Israel,2019-01-07,"The inflation rate has stabilized above the lower bound of the target range, notwithstanding the slightly lower than expected decline of 0.3 percent in the CPI for November. In the past six months, the annual inflation rate has ranged between 1.2 percent and 1.4 percent. In the coming months, inflation is expected to range around the lower bound of the target. The Research Department forecasts inflation of 1.3 percent over the coming four quarters. Medium-term expectations remained entrenched within the target range. Continued wage increases and the economy being around full employment will support a continued rise in inflation toward the midpoint of the target range, as will the depreciation, to the extent it persists. An analysis of recent data and of updated indicators of economic activity continues to support the assessment that the economy is converging to its potential growth rate, despite the low growth in the second and third quarters. The tight labor market supports this assessment, as does the growth of imports and the widening ofthe trade deficit. Indicators of fourth quarter activity point to some acceleration in the growth rate. The global macroeconomic picture continues to convey a slowing of momentum, high volatility, and lack of certainty. The US economy remains robust, though the risks due to the worsening 'trade war' and the slowing in Europe continue to weigh on momentum. There were price declines and sharp volatility in most equity indices, and expected monetary contraction worldwide is seen to be slowing. Since the increase in the interest rate, the nominal effective exchange rate has been relatively stable, after the shekel depreciated in the preceding weeks. The Committee assesses that the rising path of the interest rate in the future will be gradual and cautious, in a manner that supports a process at the end of which inflation will stabilizearound the midpoint of the target range, and that supports economic activity. The Bank of Israel continues to monitor developments in inflation, the real economy,the financial markets, and the global economy, and will act to attain the monetary policy targets in accordance with such developments. For the file of data accompanying this notice, clickhere. The inflation environment has stabilized above the lower bound of the target range, even though the CPI reading for November declined by 0.3 percent and was slightly lower than expected. In the past six months, the annual inflation rate has ranged between 1.2 and 1.4 percent, but the index adjusted for the effect of energy, fruit and vegetable prices, as well as the price changes initiated by the government, is slightly lower (Figure 2 in the attached data file). Inflation in tradable goods prices continued to moderate, primarily as a result of the decline in energy prices. Inflation in prices of nontradable items, which serves as an approximation of the domestic component of inflation, continued to increase (Figure 3). In the coming months, inflation is expected to range around the lower bound of the target, and 1-year expectations and forecasts from the various sources range between 0.9 percent and 1.2 percent (Figure 4). The Research Department expects inflation of 1.3 percent over the coming four quarters. Expectations for medium terms remained entrenched within the target range, and in recent months there was some decline in longer-term expectations (Figure 5). Since the increase of the interest rate, the nominal effective exchange rate has remained relatively stable, following a depreciation of the shekel in the weeks prior to the increase (Figure 6). The continued increase in wages and the economy being around full employment will support a continued rise in inflation toward the midpoint of the target, as will the depreciation, to the extent it persists. The steep decline in oil prices in recent months may offset the factors supporting inflation,but its impact on the 'adjusted indices' will be limited. Since the previous interest rate decision, government bond yields have been relatively stable, despite the sharp decline in parallel yields in theUS. The yield spreads between corporate bonds and comparable government bonds increased. In the past two months. Tel Aviv Stock Exchange equity indices declined by approximately 10 percent (Figure 10), which is in line with the marked declines on major global equity indices (Figure 25). Regarding economic activity, the first estimate by the Central Bureau of Statistics for full year growth in 2018 is 3.2 percent, similar to the long-term growth rate. After the growth rate slowed in the second and third quarters of 2018, the findings from the fourth quarter Companies Survey (Figure 14) and data on tax revenues support the assessment that the economy isgrowing at a pace hovering around the long term path. In addition, the Composite State of the Economy Index, which increased by 0.3 percent in November, with datafor October revised upward, even hints at a faster pace in the fourth quarter (Figure 13). Labor market data show that it remains tight: the unemployment rate remains low, although there was an increase in unemployment benefit claims in recent months; the share of job vacancies out of total employee posts is ata peak (Figure 18); and wages continue to increase (Figure 19).All of these support the assessment that the economy is around full employment,thus creating a supply constraint. The increases of imports and the widening of the trade deficit also support this assessment. According to the Research Department's assessment. GDP is expected to grow by 3.4 percent in 2019, slightly lower than the previous forecast, and by 3.5 percent in 2020. Growth in those years will be positively impacted by notable activity of several large companies. Home prices have stabilized in recent months (Figure 9), with a continued decline in building starts and an increase in the number of those planning to purchase a home. Moderate growth in mortgage volume continued; mortgage interest rates rose moderately, while the spread between them and government bond yields has narrowed (Figure 11). The macro picture conveyed by the global economy continues to indicate declining momentum, high volatility, and uncertainty. It appears that the risks due to a worsening of the 'trade war' are trickling down tothe business activity of leading corporations as well. Investment houses revised their growth forecasts downward for most regions (Figure 20), and the moderation in world trade continues among the advanced economies (Figure 21). The expected global monetary contraction is projected to slow. Despite the continued increases in the interest rates of the US and some other economies. US markets are no longer pricing in an additional rise, and European markets have pushed off the timing of an expected interest rate increase. In financial markets, there were sharp declines and volatility in most equity indices (Figure 25), government bond yields declined, and corporate bond spreads widened. The USeconomy continued to grow at a rapid pace, but the rate is expected to moderate slightly in the fourth quarter. The major economies in Europe convey a mixed picture: there was positive growth in France and Spain, while contraction was seen in Germany and Italy. There was accelerated growth in the UK, but the uncertainty regarding Brexit remained high. In Japan, the economic activity data published in the fourth quarter indicate a recovery, following contraction in the third quarter. Emerging markets are relatively stable, but the growth rate may be negatively impacted by a possible deterioration in the 'trade war' and the effects of monetary contraction in advanced economies. Growth in China continued to weaken in the fourth quarter as well, mainly in the manufacturing sector. Oil prices continued to decline until recently, despite the decision by oil producers to cut back on output (Figure 23). The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on January 21, 2019. The next decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Monday.

Romania,2019-01-08,"In its meeting of 8 January 2019, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided the following:. The annual CPI inflation rate fell to 3.43 percent in November 2018 (from 5.03 percent in September and 4.25 percent in October), returning inside the variation band of the flat target, amid some base effects and the carefully calibrated monetary policy stance. The disinflationary base effects mainly marked the developments in volatile and administered prices, also influenced by the decreases in fuel prices and prices of fruit and vegetables seen in November. The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate (which excludes from the CPI inflation a number of prices on which monetary policy has limited or no influence, i.e. administered prices, volatile prices, and tobacco product and alcoholic beverage prices) followed a slightly steeper downward path, falling to 2.5 percent in November from 2.78 percent in September. The decline continued to be mainly induced by processed food and services, under the influence of base effects and the evolution of the EUR/RON exchange rate in November. In November, the average annual CPI inflation rate remained flat at the 4.6 percent level reported in October (versus 4.5 percent in September); calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, the average annual rate saw a similar evolution, remaining unchanged at 4.0 percent from October (compared to 3.8 percent in September). In 2018 Q3, the annual economic growth continued to see a slight step-up to 4.3 percent from 4.1 percent in the previous quarter, solely on account of agricultural output increasing way above expectations. On the demand side, the major contributor to GDP growth was further the change in inventories, followed by household consumption, whereas gross fixed capital formation made a lower negative contribution. The negative contribution of net exports to the advance in GDP increased amid a relatively faster slowdown in the growth rate of exports of goods and services, which, alongside the worsening of the primary and secondary income balances, led to a swifter rise in the current account deficit from the same year-earlier period. The latest statistical data show mixed developments for October 2018 compared to Q3: the faster annual dynamics of retail trade and market services to households, the persistent drop in construction works, the slowdown in the pace of increase of industrial output, concurrently with new orders across manufacturing regaining momentum. The relevant interbank money market rates saw their positive spread vis-Ã -vis the monetary policy rate narrow in November and December 2018, while the EUR/RON exchange rate remained relatively stable until towards end-2018. The annual growth rate of credit to the private sector accelerated in October, before moderating slightly in November, its average remaining marginally above that recorded in Q3. Behind these developments stood the relative recovery in the dynamics of credit to non-financial corporations  on account of the foreign currency component , as well as the further fast increase in loans to households, albeit slowing down slightly versus Q3. The share of the leu-denominated component in total private sector credit widened to 65.6 percent in November, from a 35.6 percent low in May 2012. The latest assessments indicate the outlook for the annual inflation rate to decline further and remain over the very short time horizon slightly below the upper bound of the variation band of the target, in line with the latest medium-term forecast published in the November 2018 Inflation Report. The uncertainties and risks surrounding the inflation outlook are compounded by the pace of euro area and global economic growth, as well as by the monetary policy stance of the ECB and of central banks in the region. Also relevant are the fiscal and income policy stance, given inter alia the still pending 2019 budget, as well as the hasty nature and the contents of the set of fiscal and budgetary measures effective 1 January 2019. In today's meeting, based on the currently available assessments and data, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided to keep the monetary policy rate at 2.50 percent per annum; moreover, the NBR Board decided to leave unchanged the deposit facility rate at 1.50 percent per annum and the lending (Lombard) facility rate at 3.50 percent per annum. In addition, the NBR Board decided to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board decisions aim to ensure and preserve price stability over the medium term in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth and amid safeguarding financial stability. The NBR Board underlines that the balanced macroeconomic policy mix and the implementation of structural reforms designed to foster the growth potential over the long term are of the essence in preserving a stable macroeconomic framework and strengthening the capacity of the Romanian economy to withstand potential adverse developments. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR website on 15 January 2019, at 3:00 p.m. In line with the announced calendar, the next monetary policy meeting of the NBR Board is scheduled for 7 February 2019, when a new quarterly Inflation Report is to be examined."
Poland,2019-01-09,"Warsaw, 9 January 2019 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 8-9 January 2019 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged at: â–ª reference rate at 1.50%; â–ª lombard rate at 2.50%; â–ª deposit rate at 0.50%; â–ª rediscount rate at 1.75%. Global economic conditions remain favourable, although incoming data suggest a weakening in some economies. In the euro area, following a decline in GDP growth in 2018 Q3, certain economic climate indicators deteriorated further. In the United States, economic conditions remained very strong in 2018 Q4, yet forecasts suggest lower growth in 2019. Also in China activity growth is gradually slowing down. The continuously heightened uncertainty about the global economic outlook is having an adverse effect on the prices of some assets in the international financial markets. At the same time, global oil prices have fallen in recent months. A marked decline in commodity prices, notably the prices of oil, has contributed to lower inflation in many countries. At the same time, core inflation in the environment of the Polish economy, including the euro area, remains moderate. The European Central Bank keeps interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero. At the same time, the ECB has terminated the net purchase of financial assets, yet it will continue to reinvest the funds from the maturing securities. The US Federal Reserve raised interest rates in December 2018. In Poland, incoming data point to economic conditions remaining strong. GDP growth is still driven by rising  albeit at a slightly lower rate than in previous quarters  consumption, that is fuelled by increasing employment and wages as well as very high consumer sentiment. This is accompanied by a rise in investment. Notwithstanding relatively high economic growth and wages rising faster than in the previous year, annual consumer price growth has declined in recent months and remains moderate. At the same time, inflation net of food and energy prices continues to be low. In the Council's assessment, current information points to a relatively favourable outlook for economic conditions in Poland, although a gradual slowing in GDP growth is expected in the quarters ahead. At the same time, according to current forecasts, the annual price growth will increase in the coming months, yet  due to the decline in oil prices and the freeze on electricity prices  the scale of this increase will be smaller than anticipated in the November projection. In the medium term, the expected slowdown in economic growth will have a dampening effect on inflation. Consequently, in the monetary policy transmission horizon inflation will remain close to the target. 1/2 The Council judges that the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability."
Peru,2019-01-10,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JANUARY 2019 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 2.75% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 2.75 percent. This decision takes into account the following factors: In December, the YoY inflation rate and trend inflation indicators showed levels within the inflation target range; The expected YoY rate of inflation was 2.50 percent in December; Economic activity indicators showed signs of higher dynamism in the fourth quarter of 2018, even though the output level remains below its potential, and There are still risks in terms of global economic activity and increased financial volatility, associated with commercial tensions and uncertainty in financial markets. The YoY inflation rate is projected to remain within the target range and around 2.0 percent. The Board considers that it is appropriate to maintain an expansionary policy stance while inflation expectations remain anchored in a context in which the level of economic activity is below its potential level. Recent indicators of inflation and activity reflect the following: Inflation in December showed a rate of 0.18 percent, as a result of which the YoY inflation rate remained at 2.2 percent in December 2018. Moreover, inflation excluding food and energy prices recorded a rate of 0.34 percent, as a result of which the YoY rate remained at 2.2 percent in December. Most indicators of business expectations have improved and remain on the optimistic side. Furthermore, indicators of economic activity continue recovering. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 1.50 percent. Direct security and currency repos and rediscount operations: 3.30 percent for the first 10 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 10 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 3.30 percent. The Monetary Program for the month of February will be approved on the Board meeting to be held on February 7, 2019."
Kazakhstan,2019-01-14,"– 1 The base rate remains unchanged at 9.25% January 14, 2019 Almaty The National Bank of Kazakhstan has made a decision to keep the base rate at 9.25% with the corridor of +/-1%. The annual inflation continues forming at the levels corresponding to the target range. In December 2018, the inflation was at the level close to the lower boundary of the target range of 5-7%. In the condition of gradual recovery of economic activity, preventing inflation from exceeding the boundaries of the target corridor remains a high priority objective for the National Bank of Kazakhstan. In the absence of significant shocks, current level of the base rate will facilitate formation of inflation within a new target range of 4-6% by the end of 2019. Further decisions on the base rate will be taken based on dynamics of actual inflation, its forecast values, and the degree of realization of risky scenarios. In case of maintaining of existing volatility in the key commodity markets that depresses the stability in the domestic financial market, a decision about tightening monetary policy might be taken on the next revision of the base rate. Annual inflation by the end of 2018 was formed at the level of 5.3%. A moderate increase of prices for all main categories of consumer goods and services was recorded. The largest price increase was fixed on non-food products (6.4% in annual terms). Prices of food products (increase of 5.1%) and paid services (increase of 4.5%) were formed at the level lower than the overall inflation. At the same time, the core inflation in December was higher than the overall inflation and amounted to 6.7% (6.2% in December 2017), which indicates that the inflation background remains, associated both with the volatility of oil prices and the acceleration of domestic demand, which this year is being reinforced by fiscal incentives. Nevertheless, at the end of 2019, the National Bank estimates inflation to maintain within the upper region of a new, lower target range of 4-6%, i.e. 5-6%. Inflation expectations were reduced significantly. In November and December of 2018 values of expected inflation 12 months ahead resulted in 5.3% and 5.0% accordingly (after 6.4% and 6.3% in September and October). Anchoring inflationary expectations around current level and improving their resistance in the short term remains an important objective of the National Bank of Kazakhstan. There is a volatility of oil prices observed in the external sector. After a decline in October-December last year down to the minimum values of the previous 1.5 years (US $50.47 per barrel), they went back to the level of US $60 per barrel in January 2019. Nevertheless, considerable uncertainty remains with regards to future outlook, which creates a potential ground for realization of the risky scenarios, both in the short and medium term. In addition, strengthening of the external inflationary background is observed. An actual annual inflation in Russian Federation, the main trading partner, is forming above the target rate, while estimations about further acceleration this year create a potential foundation for inflationary pressure on domestic prices in Kazakhstan, taking into account high proportion of Russian imports. In the domestic sector, the situation is expressed by the expanding domestic demand against the background of growing real income of population of 4.4% as of January-November period, in comparison to the corresponding period of the previous year. A growth of consumer lending was slowing down modestly and reached 11% in annual terms in November 2018. Current development of macroeconomic indicators allows sustaining monetary conditions close to a neutral level. A neutral policy aims at maintaining a balance between achieving inflation targets and assisting in sustaining economic growth close to its potential levels. Further decisions on the base rate will depend on the forecast dynamics of the domestic macroeconomic indicators and situation in the external markets. A necessity to achieve a target inflation of 4% by the end of 2020 becomes one of the key parameters. In case of maintaining volatility in the global oil market on the domestic financial market, a decision on the tightening monetary policy might be taken on the next revision of the base rate. The next decision on the base rate will be announced on March 4, 2019, at 17:00 Astana time.

Turkiye,2019-01-16,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 24 percent. Recently released data show that rebalancing trend in the economy has become more noticeable. External demand maintains its strength while slowdown in economic activity continues, partly due to tight financial conditions. Current account balance is expected to maintain its improving trend. While developments in import prices and domestic demand conditions have led to some improvement in the inflation outlook, risks on price stability continue to prevail. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to maintain the tight monetary policy stance until inflation outlook displays a significant improvement. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior, lagged impact of recent monetary policy decisions, contribution of fiscal policy to rebalancing process, and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
South Africa,2019-01-17,"South African Reserve Bank PRESS STATEMENT EMBARGO DELIVERY 17 January 2019 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since November 2018, international developments have been the major contributor to an improved inflation outlook. Significant declines in international oil prices and a less depreciated exchange rate have been key drivers of this improved outlook. Domestic petrol prices decreased by a cumulative R3.07 per litre (for 95 unleaded in Gauteng) in December and January. Lower food price inflation also contributed to lower consumer price inflation. The economy's recovery from the technical recession in the first half of 2018 is welcomed, but it remains modest, with growth constrained by subdued demand as a result of weaker levels of consumer and business confidence. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas was 5.2% in November (up from 5.1% in October). Goods price inflation was 5.3% (up from 5.1% in October), while services price inflation was unchanged at 5.1%. The Bank's measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity MPC Statement January 17th, 2019 Page 1. The Bank's measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity MPC Statement January 17th, 2019 Page 1 was 4.4% in November compared to 4.2% in October. Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods slowed marginally to 6.8% in November from 6.9% in October. The near-term inflation forecast generated by the SARB's Quarterly Projection Model (QPM) has improved significantly since the previous MPC. Headline inflation is now expected to average 4.6% in 2018 (down from 4.7%) and 4.8% in 2019 (down from 5.5%), before increasing to 5.3% in 2020 (down from 5.4%) and moderating to 4.8% in 2021. Headline CPI inflation is now expected to peak at around 5.6%, in the first quarter of 2020. Core inflation is expected remain unchanged at 4.3% in 2018 and forecast to average 5.0% in 2019 (down from 5.3%), 5.1% in 2020 (down from 5.5%) and 4.8% in 2021. These inflation projections are based on an interest rate path generated by the QPM. Following a significant decline in oil prices since November, the assumptions for Brent crude oil in the QPM were revised down by around US$10 per barrel from US$73 to US$62 for 2019 and US$65 for 2020 and 2021. Food price inflation is expected to have bottomed out in the fourth quarter of 2018 and to rise to 4.6% in 2021. Average inflation expectations for both 2019 and 2020, as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research (BER) in the fourth quarter of 2018, declined from 5.6% to 5.4%. Average five-year expectations also came down from 5.5% in the previous survey to 5.3%. The inflation expectations of market analysts in the January 2019 Reuters Econometer survey are also lower at 5.2% in 2019 (down from 5.5%) and remained unchanged at 5.3% for 2020. Expectations implicit in the break-even inflation rates (i.e. the yield differential between conventional and inflation-linked government bonds) remain MPC Statement January 17th, 2019 Page 2. Expectations implicit in the break-even inflation rates (i.e. the yield differential between conventional and inflation-linked government bonds) remain MPC Statement January 17th, 2019 Page 2 sensitive to exchange rate movements. While five-year break-even rates remain within the inflation target range, the longer-term break-even rates remain above 6%. Global growth is expected to remain broadly favourable over the near term, but to moderate over the medium term while risks are tilted to the downside. The negative effects of tariff increases are becoming more visible in economic data and uncertainty arising from trade tensions remains. Other risks include geo-political developments and excessive financial market volatility. Recent communication from major central banks suggests a slower pace of monetary policy normalisation in advanced economies. In December, the US Fed signalled a more gradual pace of rate hikes. Although the European Central Bank (ECB) ended its asset purchase programme in December, it has indicated that monetary policy would remain largely accommodative. Since the November MPC, the rand has appreciated by 1.4% against the US dollar, by 1.5% against the euro, and by 0.5% on a trade-weighted basis. The implied starting point for the rand is R14.30 against the US dollar, compared with R14.50 at the time of the previous meeting. At these levels, the QPM assesses the rand to be less undervalued. Emerging market currencies, including the rand, have recently benefited from a weaker US dollar and indications of continued accommodative monetary policy in advanced economies, but they remain vulnerable to changes in investor sentiment. The rand also remains sensitive to domestic growth prospects, political developments and policy settings. MPC Statement January 17th, 2019 Page 3. MPC Statement January 17th, 2019 Page 3 The domestic growth outlook remains sluggish. Although. GDP increased by 2.2% in the third quarter of 2018, private sector fixed investment remains weak and production in key sectors is volatile. The SARB now expects growth in 2018 to have averaged 0.7% (up from 0.6% in November). The growth forecast for 2019 is 1.7% (down from 1.9%), it is unchanged at 2.0% for 2020 and increases to 2.2% in 2021. At these growth rates, the negative output gap is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021. The Absa Purchasing Managers' Index reached 50.7 index points in December driven by improved expectations about new sales orders and business activity, however the employment sub-index receded to its lowest levels since 2014. Although the SARB's composite leading business cycle indicator increased somewhat in October, it has been trending lower since early 2018. The RMB/BER Business Confidence Index also remains significantly below the neutral level of 50 index points, broadly aligned with weakness in gross fixed capital formation. Sustained growth in fixed capital formation is needed to raise potential growth and to make in-roads into unemployment. Household consumption expenditure remains constrained by weak employment growth. Over the forecast period, consumption expenditure growth is expected to remain around 2%, on the back of moderate increases in real wages and household disposable income. The MPC assesses the risks to the growth forecast to be on the downside. Weak business and consumer confidence continue to weigh on fixed capital formation. This could be exacerbated by the possibility of protracted electricity supply constraints. Prudent macroeconomic policies are essential to ensuring that growth is sustainable and the economy is more resilient to shocks. Furthermore, the Committee remains of the view that current challenges facing the economy are primarily structural in nature. MPC Statement January 17th, 2019 Page 4. MPC Statement January 17th, 2019 Page 4 The implementation of credible structural policy initiatives that make a marked impact on potential output and employment and lower the cost structure of the economy should be prioritised. The MPC has taken note of the improved inflation outlook, especially in the near-term. Over the forecast period, inflation is expected to remain within the inflation target range, averaging 5.3% in 2020 and 4.8% in 2021. The overall risks to the inflation outlook are assessed to be moderately on the upside. The risks include administered prices such as electricity and water tariffs, rising domestic food prices in the outer years, changing investor sentiment towards emerging markets, moderation in global growth and volatile international oil prices. Against this backdrop, the MPC unanimously decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 6,75% per year. The Committee continues to assess the stance of monetary policy to be broadly accommodative. Monetary policy actions will continue to focus on anchoring inflation expectations closer to the mid-point of the inflation target, in the interest of balanced and sustainable growth. The approach of the MPC is to look through the first-round effects and focus on the possible second-round effects of supply side shocks. As previously indicated, any future policy adjustments will be data dependent. The implied path of policy rates generated by the Quarterly Projection Model is for one hike of 25 basis points, reaching 7.0% by the end of 2021. The forecasted endogenous interest rate path is built into our growth and inflation outlook. As emphasised previously, the implied path remains a broad policy guide which can and does change MPC Statement January 17th, 2019 Page 5.

Nigeria,2019-01-22,"CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE No. 122 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING OF MONDAY 21ST AND TUESDAY 22ND JANUARY, 2019 Background The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) held its first meeting for fiscal 2019 on 21st and 22nd January, 2019 amidst concerns over the slowdown in global economic activity, arising from on-going trade tensions, tightening global financing conditions and mounting external debt in Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDEs). On the domestic front, the resurgence of moderate inflationary pressure and possible threats to accretion to external reserves due to softening crude oil prices were noted. The Committee reviewed the developments in the global and domestic economic and financial environments in 2018, as well as the risks and outlook in the short to medium term. Eleven (11) members of the Committee were in attendance. Global Economic Developments The Committee noted the divergence in performance of most economies in 2018 leading to moderation in global output. In addition, a combination of factors including: financial market volatilities, trade war between the US and key allies, continuing monetary policy normalization by the US. BREXIT, the termination of the European Central Bank's (ECB) asset purchase program in December 2018 and the slowdown in the Chinese economy, further heightened uncertainties for the global economy in 2019. Consequently 1 global growth has been downgraded by the IMF to 35 per cent in 2019, from 37 per cent in 2018. The Committee noted the gradual increase in global inflation, with inflationary pressures intensifying in some Emerging Markets and Developing Economics (EMDEs) that had in the recent past faced currency depreciation arising from capital flow reversals arising from progressive monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve. It is, however, expected that the recent decline in oil prices may reverse the trend, especially for oil importing economies and thus moderate currency depreciation in these countries. Domestic Output Developments The Committee noted the continued recovery in output growth in the domestic economy after the 2016 recession as real GDP grew by 181 per cent in Q3 2018 from 150 per cent in Q2 2018. The services and agricultural sectors continued to drive output growth, contributing 119 and 056 per cent, respectively. However the persistence of herdsmen attack on farmers, cattle rustling and flooding in some parts of the country affected agricultural and livestock output. Based on the Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Indices (PMI), output growth for Q4 2018 is expected to expand further. The expected performance projected in the PMI is attributed to continued stability in the foreign exchange market, improvements in the flow of financing resources to the real sector through the various interventions by the Bank, effective implementation of the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP) and the increase in non-oil sector GDP. The outlook for growth, however, remains fragile as the late implementation of the 2018 budget and the residual impact of flooding and security challenges, constitute headwinds to growth. The Committee, therefore, believes that the effective implementation of the 2018 capital budget and the ERGP, improvement in the security situation, and continued stability in the 2 foreign exchange market will enhance aggregate demand and output growth. Developments in Money and Prices The Committee noted that the broader measure of money supply. M3, grew by 1658 per cent in 2018, above the provisional benchmark of 1302 per cent. Broad money (M2), also grew by 1217 per cent in December 2018 over its level at end-December 2017, in contrast to the provisional benchmark of 1048 per cent for 2018. The increase in M2 reflected the growth in Net Foreign Assets (NFA) of 1854 per cent in December 2018, above its provisional benchmark of 1450 per cent. Credit to the private sector rose marginally by 196 per cent below its provisional benchmark of 1239 per cent, while credit to government grew by 3377 per cent in December 2018, above its benchmark rate of 1738 per cent. The Committee noted the appreciable growth in credit to the private sector which had been a constraint to growth in the real sector and expressed optimism of further improvement in lending, through the sustained effort of the Bank to enhance credit delivery to small and medium scale industries in the economy. The MPC, thus, commended the Management of the Bank for its efforts so far in sustaining credit delivery to the real sector of the economy. The resurgence in inflationary pressure in the economy was of concern to the MPC as headline inflation (year-on-year) inched up to 1144 per cent in December 2018 from 1128 per cent in November 2018. The increase in headline inflation was driven by food inflation, which rose to 1336 per cent in December 2018 from 1330 per cent in November, while Core inflation declined marginally to 977 per cent in December 2018 from 979 per cent in the previous month. The Committee, however, observed that the uptick in inflation was attributed to seasonal factors, which impacted mainly on food. Consequently all measures of inflation, month-on-month, showed a decline. Thus headline, food and core inflation declined to 074, 081and 050 per 3 cent in December 2018 from 084, 090 and 068 per cent, respectively, in November 2018. The Committee observed that the near-term risks to inflation remain: the residual impact of flooding on agricultural output, insecurity in parts of the food producing belts of the country, exchange rate pass-through to inflation due to weakening oil price and campaign-related spending towards the 2019 general elections. Accordingly the MPC urged the Federal Government to sustain its current effort towards improving security to ease the food supply chain bottlenecks. Money market interest rates in the review period, generally reflected the level of liquidity in the banking system as the average inter-bank call rate declined significantly to 717 per cent in November 2018 from 1418 per cent in October 2018. The Open Buy Back (OBB) rate, which stood at 657 per cent in October 2018, increased marginally to 676 per cent in November 2018. On December 24 and 31, 2018, the interbank call and OBB rates, however, closed at 1400 and 1894 per cent, respectively. The improvement in net liquidity position and interest rate reflected the combined effects of the CBN quasi-fiscal operations. OMO auctions, maturing CBN Bills and foreign exchange interventions as well as statutory allocations to state and local governments. The Committee observed the decline in the equities market for the most part of 2018. On a year-on-year basis, the All-Share Index (ASI) decreased by 1781 per cent from 38,,24319 at end-December 2017 to 31,,43050 at end- December 2018. The All-Share Index (ASI) further decreased by 135 per cent to 31,,00517 as at January 18, 2019. Similarly Market Capitalization (MC) decreased by 1387 per cent from N1361 trillion at end-December 2017 to N1172 trillion at end-December 2018. It further declined by 137 per cent to N1156 trillion as at January 18, 2019. The Committee observed that these developments largely reflected the impact of the progressive monetary policy normalization in some advanced economies and the sustained profit 4 taking activities of foreign investors arising from perceived political risk in the build-up to the 2019 general elections. The MPC, however, remained optimistic of the gradual reversal of the current trend in the medium term, given the current stability in the foreign exchange market and the external reserves position, as well as continued improvements in key macroeconomic indicators. The Committee noted the relative stability at both the Bureau-de-Change (BDC) and the Investors' and Exporters' (I&E) window of the foreign exchange market, supported by the Bank's proactive exchange rate management policies. It also observed with satisfaction, the contribution to stability in the market of the implementation of the Bilateral Currency Swap Agreement (BCSA) with China and the inflow of the US$28 billion Euro bond. The Committee also noted the marginal increase in the external reserves, from US$4254 billion at end-December 2018 to US$4328 billion as at January 21, 2019, noting that these improvements would further strengthen investor confidence in the Nigerian economy. The Overall Outlook and Risks Forecasts for key macroeconomic indicators in 2019 portend a positive outlook for the domestic economy. Output growth is expected to be driven by fiscal stimulus from increase in oil and non-oil receipts to support the Federal Government's Economic Recovery and Growth Plan. The economy is projected to grow by 20 per cent by the IMF, 22 per cent by the World Bank and 228 per cent by the CBN. Key headwinds to these forecasts, however, are softening oil prices, persistent security challenges arising from insurgency in the North East, herdsmen attack in some parts of the country and perceived political risks associated with the 2019 general elections. The outlook for inflation in the first half of 2019 is mixed, with the expectation of an increase in the near-term before a gradual decline towards the mid- 5 year. Inflation is expected to rise marginally amidst palpable tailwinds, which include increased spending preparatory to the 2019 general elections and continued disruptions to the food supply chain in the insurgency prone areas and herdsmen attacks in food producing regions of the country. The MPC appraised the possibility of external shocks in 2019 as the outlook for the global economy remains uncertain due to the effect of on-going trade tensions between the US and its key allies, slower growth in China, unclear direction of BREXIT negotiations and continuing monetary policy normalization in some advanced economies. The Committee was of the view that oil prices may, however, remain relatively stable, within the US$50pb bracket in view of recent OPEC's production cutting actions. Committee's Considerations The Committee noted with satisfaction, the performance of the economy in 2018, highlighting the achievements in key macroeconomic indicators in the face of global uncertainties and domestic challenges. In particular, it noted the stability in the exchange rate, stable accretion to external reserves, moderation in inflation and the low but gradual improvement in real GDP growth in the last six consecutive quarters commencing from Q2 2017. The MPC noted that given global economic conditions and the risk confronting emerging markets and developing economies in recent times, as well as the limited productive capacity of the economy, the managed float foreign exchange management regime of the CBN has delivered the most optimal results when compared with other emerging markets in recent times. Consequently capital flows into the domestic economy has continued unabated after an initial lull. The Committee considered the risks to the global economy, noting the downward revision in projected global output in 2019, the adverse impact of the trade war between the US and its major trading partners, likelihood of lower crude oil prices, impact on capital flows of continued monetary policy normalization by major advanced economies, 6 distorted signals on BREXIT negotiations, as well as pockets of other socio- political tensions and perceived election risks on the domestic front. The Committee commended the government's focused expenditure on investment in infrastructure and urged the Federal Government to sustain the pace towards addressing the infrastructural deficit in Nigeria. It noted that the immediate impact of this approach on GDP may be slow in coming, but will eventually expand the economy's productive base, reduce unemployment and increase aggregate demand in a more sustainable manner and over a long period of time. The Committee acknowledged the strategic role of the private sector in economic growth and remained concerned over the slow growth in credit to the private sector through 2018, while noting the sudden increase at end- December 2018. The MPC commended the initiative of the Bankers Committee in addressing the phenomenon of low credit to the small and medium scale enterprises through partnering with the Nigeria Incentive- Based Risk Sharing System for Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL) to establish a national Microfinance bank with branches in all States and Local Government areas of the Federation to provide low interest rate lending to small scale businesses. further initiative by NIRSAL with the CBN to de-risk lending to small scale enterprises is also being fine-tuned. On external borrowing, the Committee noted the increase in the debt level, it advised for caution, noting that debt levels could fast be approaching the pre-2005 Paris Club exit level. The MPC also noted that although there was an increase in the inflation rate for the second consecutive month, month-on-month inflation continued to moderate, indicating that the year-on-year measures will also moderate in the near term. This is supported by the stability in the naira exchange rate and thus, urged the Bank to sustain this stability. To this end, it welcomed the 7 narrowing of the exchange rate premium between the BDC segment and the Investors' and Exporters' (I&E) window of the foreign exchange market. The Committee also noted with satisfaction the gradual reduction in Non- Performing Loans of the deposit money banks (DMBs) which has further strengthened their balance sheets. The Committee believes that as Government pays off contractor debt and other obligations, there will be a sizable reduction in the NPLs of the banking system. The Committee also noted the attempt by Government to broaden the base of the Value Added Tax (VAT) and urged the authorities to expedite action in that respect, arguing that increased tax collection will reduce the pressure on government expenditure and create fiscal buffers to improve macroeconomic management. The observed and recent high foreign capital inflow into the Nigerian economy despite the perception of election risk, is evidence of the confidence of the international community in the country's macroeconomic management and provides a compelling reason for the Committee to await clarity on macroeconomic performance after the general elections in February and March 2019. In the light of the observed risk confronting the economy, including the global and domestic inflationary pressures, which have intensified the risk of currency depreciation, the MPC was of the view that a loosening option was very remote. Weighing the balance of its judgement on price stability conducive to growth, the MPC felt that tightening would result in the loss of the gains so far achieved, noting that this may drive the banks to reprice their assets; thus increasing the cost of credit as well as elevating credit risk in the economy. It will also worsen the position of non-performing loans of the banks. The Committee also felt that tightening would dampen investments 8 and hamper improvements in output growth, given the already fragile growth performance so far achieved. The Committee's Decision In the light of the above, the MPC decided by a vote of all eleven (11) members to keep the policy parameters unchanged from their current levels. In summary, the MPC voted to: I Retain the MPR at 14 per cent; II. Retain the asymmetric corridor of +200/-500 basis points around the MPR; III. Retain the CRR at 225 per cent; and IV. Retain the Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent. Thank you. Godwin I Emefiele Governor. Central Bank of Nigeria 22nd January, 2019 9."
Euroarea,2019-01-24,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Vice-President. Mr Dombrovskis. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We continue to expect them to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, we intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. The incoming information has continued to be weaker than expected on account of softer external demand and some country and sector-specific factors. The persistence of uncertainties in particular relating to geopolitical factors and the threat of protectionism is weighing on economic sentiment. At the same time, supportive financing conditions, favourable labour market dynamics and rising wage growth continue to underpin the euro area expansion and gradually rising inflation pressures. This supports our confidence in the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Significant monetary policy stimulus remains essential to support the further build-up of domestic price pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term. This will be provided by our forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates, reinforced by the reinvestments of the sizeable stock of acquired assets. In any event, the Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation continues to move towards the Governing Council's inflation aim in a sustained manner. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro area real GDP increased by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2018, following growth of 0.4% in the previous two quarters. Incoming data have continued to be weaker than expected as a result of a slowdown in external demand compounded by some country and sector-specific factors. While the impact of some of these factors is expected to fade, the near-term growth momentum is likely to be weaker than previously anticipated. Looking ahead, the euro area expansion will continue to be supported by favourable financing conditions, further employment gains and rising wages, lower energy prices, and the ongoing  albeit somewhat slower  expansion in global activity. The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook have moved to the downside on account of the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors and the threat of protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility. Euro area annual HICP inflation declined to 1.6% in December 2018, from 1.9% in November, reflecting mainly lower energy price inflation. On the basis of current futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to decline further over the coming months. Measures of underlying inflation remain generally muted, but labour cost pressures are continuing to strengthen and broaden amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets. Looking ahead, underlying inflation is expected to increase over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion and rising wage growth. Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth moderated to 3.7% in November 2018, after 3.9% in October. The narrow monetary aggregate M1 remained the main contributor to broad money growth. The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations stood at 4.0% in November 2018, after 3.9% in October, while the annual growth rate of loans to households remained broadly unchanged at 3.3%. The euro area bank lending survey for the fourth quarter of 2018 suggests that overall bank lending conditions remained favourable, following an extended period of net easing, and demand for bank credit continued to rise, thereby underpinning loan growth. The pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014 continues to significantly support borrowing conditions for firms and households, access to financing  in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises  and credit flows across the euro area. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is still necessary for the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute more decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential and reducing vulnerabilities. The implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up to increase resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost euro area productivity and growth potential. Regarding fiscal policies, the Governing Council reiterates the need for rebuilding fiscal buffers. This is particularly important in countries where government debt is high and for which full adherence to the Stability and Growth Pact is critical for safeguarding sound fiscal positions. Likewise, the transparent and consistent implementation of the EU's fiscal and economic governance framework over time and across countries remains essential to bolster the resilience of the euro area economy. Improving the functioning of Economic and Monetary Union remains a priority. The Governing Council welcomes the ongoing work and urges further specific and decisive steps to complete the banking union and the capital markets union."
South Korea,2019-01-24,"Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.75% for the intermeeting period. This press release is the English version of the Bank of Korea's policy statement. In the case of any inconsistency, the original version in Korean will prevail. The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.75% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Board considers that the pace of global economic growth has slowed somewhat. The volatilities in the global financial markets, which had previously expanded, have diminished slightly this year, in line mainly with the possibility of the US Federal Reserve adjusting the pace of its rate hikes and with expectations of progress in the US-China trade negotiations. Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and the global financial markets as likely to be affected by factors such as the degree of the spread of trade protectionism, the paces of monetary policy normalization in major countries, and the uncertainties concerning Brexit. The Board judges that the domestic economy has sustained a rate of growth at its potential level generally, as the increases in consumption and exports have been sustained, although the adjustments in facilities and construction investment have continued. Employment conditions have been sluggish, with the amount of increase in the number of persons employed having lessened substantially in December. Going forward the Board expects domestic economic growth to fall slightly short of the path projected in October, but to sustain a rate that does not diverge significantly from its potential level thanks to increased government expenditures for example. Consumer price inflation has slowed to the lower-1% level, in consequence mainly of declines in the prices of petroleum products and reductions in the extents of increase in agricultural, livestock and fisheries product prices. Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has been at the lower-1% level, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has been in the mid-2% range. Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will fluctuate at the 1% level for some time and then steadily increase to the mid-1% level in the second half of this year. Core inflation will also gradually rise. The domestic financial markets saw increased volatility in December last year, but have been generally stable since the beginning of this year. Stock prices had fallen, in line mostly with concerns about the global economic slowdown, but have rebounded on expectations of an easing of the US-China trade dispute for example. Long-term market interest rates, after a decline, have been fluctuating slightly. The Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has been generally stable while moving within a narrow range. The amount of increase in household lending has diminished, while housing prices have continued to slow. Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As it is forecast that inflationary pressures on the demand side will not be high for the time being, and that the domestic economy will sustain a rate of growth that does not diverge significantly from its potential level, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance. In this process it will judge whether to adjust the degree of monetary policy accommodation further, while closely checking future economic growth and inflation trends. It will also carefully monitor conditions related to trade with major countries, any changes in the monetary policies of major countries, financial and economic conditions in emerging market economies, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks."
Malaysia,2019-01-24,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.25 percent. The global economy continues to expand. Employment remains firm in the advanced economies, while in Asia, domestic demand is sustained. However, global growth momentum is moderating with slower growth in the major economies. Trade tensions are beginning to have a material impact on global trade and investments. Tightening financial conditions and heightened volatility in financial markets, coupled with country-specific factors ranging from heightened political and policy uncertainty and elevated debt levels, could further weigh on growth prospects. For Malaysia, latest indicators point towards sustained economic expansion. For 2019, domestic demand will remain the key driver of growth. Private consumption will continue to be underpinned by stable employment and wage growth, while private investment will be supported by on-going multi-year projects in both export- and domestic-oriented industries. Sustained growth in private sector activity is expected to offset lower public spending arising from the ongoing fiscal consolidation by the Government. With moderating global growth, the external sector is likely to soften. Risks to growth are tilted to the downside, primarily from potential escalation of trade tensions and commodity-related shocks. On balance, the Malaysian economy is expected to remain on a steady growth path in 2019. Headline inflation averaged at 1.0% in 2018. In 2019, inflation is expected to average moderately higher. The impact of the consumption tax policy on headline inflation in 2019 will start to lapse towards the end of the year. However, the trajectory of headline inflation will be dependent on global oil prices. Underlying inflation is expected to remain contained in the absence of strong demand pressures. The domestic financial markets have remained resilient, despite bouts of volatility due to global developments. Domestic monetary and financial conditions remain orderly and supportive of economic growth. The financial sector is sound, with financial institutions operating with strong capital and liquidity buffers. Importantly, the domestic economy maintains its underlying fundamental strength, with steady economic growth, low unemployment and surplus in the current account of the balance of payments. Bank Negara Malaysia's monetary operations will continue to ensure sufficient liquidity to support the orderly functioning of money and foreign exchange markets and intermediation activity. At the current level of the OPR, the degree of monetary accommodativeness is consistent with the intended policy stance. The MPC will continue to monitor and assess the balance of risks surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation. Bank Negara Malaysia 24 January 2019."
Armenia,2019-01-29,"PRESS RELEASE 29.01.2019 In the January 29, 2019 meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) decided to cut the refinancing rate by 0.25 pp to 5.75%. There was 1.5% inflation in December of 2018, in which case the 12-month inflation rate amounted to 1.8%. Prices of seasonal products have shaped at a relatively low level, with some decline in core inflation. As a result, a low inflationary environment will persist over the upcoming months while the 12-month inflation will run below the lower part of the confidence band. Global economic growth rates are signaling some weakening in both leading and developing countries, and the central banks of leading countries continue to tighten their monetary policy conditions. Accordingly, softening inflationary environment is further observable in the international markets of basic commodities, so the Board of the CBA considers that no inflationary pressures from the external sector are likely in the coming months. The Board admits that the economic activity in late 2018 was still sluggish, while the year's economic growth is expected around 5.0%. The weakening of aggregate demand is largely due to a contractionary stance of the fiscal policy and slowing growth in private spending. The Board reckons that the low inflation is partly of a structural nature, driven by long-term economic and public policy changes, which also contributes to maintaining the purchasing power and anchoring the inflationary expectations. In consideration of the situation mentioned above, the Board finds it reasonable to increase the extent of expansionary monetary conditions by reducing the refinancing rate by 0.25 pp and using the long- term liquidity injection toolkit. At the same time, in view of the anticipated macroeconomic developments, to leave monetary conditions expansionary for a longer period of time will be needed for maintaining price stability in the medium run. As a result, the expectation is that inflation will still be running below the lower part of the confidence band and stabilizing around the 4% value at the end of forecast horizon. Risks to fulfillment of the inflation target in forecast horizon are assessed still downside, due to both external and internal factors. The CBA keeps a watchful eye on macroeconomic developments, if risks emerge, it will adjust the monetary policy directions accordingly, while ensuring the price stability. Detailed information that underlies the decision on setting of the interest rate will be available in Press Release (Minutes on Interest Rate) to be published by February 12, 2019. Press Service of the Central Bank of Armenia."
Chile,2019-01-30,"Wednesday, 30 January 2019 Monetary Policy Meeting At its monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points to 3% annually. The decision was made by the Board members' unanimous vote. Internationally, incoming data point to growth moderating in the world economy beyond forecasts, accompanied by volatile financial markets and persistent political and economic risks. In the developed world, economic expectations have deteriorated. Conjunctural Eurozone growth data again brought negative surprises, while China's activity indicators moderated further, prompting its authorities to announce new stimuli. Meanwhile, recent US data remains dynamic. Inflation slowed in most countries as a result of the drop in oil prices in the last quarter of 2018. In this context, the main central banks have signaled a more gradual normalization of their monetary policies, which market prices have internalized. Long-term interest rates have fallen in several economies, stock markets have risen from end-of-2018 levels and capital flows have returned to emerging countries. The oil price has recovered partially in 2019 so far, while copper has fluctuated around USD 2.7 per pound. Regarding local financial conditions, the peso continued to fluctuate significantly, but its current value in terms of US dollars shows little variation from the last Meeting. This, in a context in which the local risk indicators remain contained, interest rates have fallen slightly to converge with the global trend, while the stock market (IPSA) has aligned with the increases in Latin American stock markets. In the credit market, annual credit growth accelerated towards the end of 2018, especially in consumer and commercial loans. Interest rates remain low from a historical perspective. The Banking Credit Survey of the fourth quarter of last year showed that demand for the different credit types has continued to strengthen. On the supply side, milder restrictions are observed in loans granted to large companies and somewhat tighter conditions for mortgage loans. In the last quarter of 2018, the economy regained its dynamism, as was foreseen in the Monetary Policy Report of December. Non-mining activity tended to accelerate, especially in investment- related sectors. About the latter, the dynamism of capital goods imports, the upward revision of the Capital Goods Corporation's Project Survey and the persistence of positive figures for construction stand out. Partial consumption indicators show slower growth than in the first part of 2018, especially for durables. In the labor market, the national unemployment rate remains around 7%, while y-o-y growth of nominal wages remains close to 4%. For 2019, the expectations contained in the Economic Expectations Survey practically did not change after the release of the last Report, anticipating GDP growth of 3.6%. December's monthly inflation was negative (-0.1%), affected mainly by a drop in the more volatile items (i.e. energy and foodstuffs). With this, in y-o-y terms. CPI inflation was 2.6% and for CPIEFE was 2.3%, both figures slightly below the December Report's estimates. Those prices most sensitive to the activity gap, including unregulated services in the CPIEFE, continued to rise steadily. Inflation expectations for December 2019 declined to 2.8%, while expectations two years out remain around 3%. The Board's decision considered that the evolution of macroeconomic conditions continues to warrant a gradual withdrawal of the monetary stimulus, in line with what was foreseen in the last Monetary Policy Report. At the same time, it reiterated that it will proceed with this process gradually and cautiously. In particular, the next Monetary Policy Report will pay special attention to the evolution of the international scenario and its implications for the convergence of inflation to the target. Accordingly, the Board reaffirms its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the two-year horizon. The minutes of this Monetary Policy Meeting will be published at 8:30 hours of Thursday 14 February 2019. The next Monetary Policy Meeting is scheduled to take place on Friday 29 March 2019 and the statement thereof will be released this same day at 18:00 hours."
Georgia,2019-01-30,"30.01.2019 The National Bank of Georgia cuts the monetary policy rate by 0.25 percentage points to 6.75% The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on January 30 and decided to cut the refinancing rate by 25 basis points. Currently, the policy rate stands at 6.75 percent. Over 2018, in line with the forecasts, inflation rate remained around the target level of 3%. In December, the annual inflation equaled 1.5 percent. According to the forecasts, other factors being equal, inflation is expected to fluctuate near the target level. In July 2018, the NBG started the gradual exit from the moderately tightened monetary policy. After the previous Committee meeting, along with the reduction of macroeconomic risks coming from the external sector, the upward risks to the inflation forecast have also abated. Considering that the inflationary pressure from the aggregate demand remains weak, the Monetary Policy Committee deemed appropriate to cut the policy rate. According to the forecast, the monetary policy rate is expected to be reduced further over the year. The speed of normalization will depend on how fast the output gap will close on one hand and how strongly the increased regional macroeconomic risks will be transmitted to Georgian economy  on the other. The positive trends in the external sector have been maintained. The annual growth rate of goods exports in 2018 equaled 23% whereas the tourism revenues grew by 18%. However in the second half of 2018, the growth of both domestic and external demand somewhat declined. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all means and instruments at its disposal to ensure the price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on March 13, 2019."
United States,2019-01-30,"EST January 30, 2019 Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a solid rate. Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Household spending has continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment has moderated from its rapid pace earlier last year. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remain near 2 percent. Although market-based measures of inflation compensation have moved lower in recent months, survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent. The Committee continues to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes. In light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation (more) For release at 2 p.m. EST January 30, 2019 - 2 - expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.

Colombia,2019-01-31,"The Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica, in its meeting today, decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 4.25% For this decision, the Board mainly took into account the following aspects. In December, yearly consumer inflation and the average of core inflation indicators decreased, reaching 3.18% and 3.03%, respectively. Inflation expectations recorded slight changes and remain above 3.0%. To horizons greater than or equal to one year, analysts' expectations and those embedded in public debt bonds are between 3.3% and 3.5%. The prospects for global growth continue moderating. The Fed kept its reference interest rate unaltered. For 2019, in the United States, a path of interest rates lower than in the last quarter is expected. So far this month, the international price of oil increased, but remained below the average observed in 2018. In the same period, the country's risk premia lowered, and the peso appreciated vis--vis the US dollar. The latest figures available suggest that in 2018 economic growth, estimated by the technical staff at 2.6%, continued. Household consumption accelerated, mainly by higher spending on durable goods. Higher imports of machinery and equipment suggest recovery of investment. The Board of Directors expects a growth figure close to 3.5% for 2019. This estimate assumes a positive effect of the Financing Law on output, and considers the lower paths expected for oil prices and for the average growth of the country's trading partners. For 2019, a current account deficit as a share of GDP higher than in 2018 is projected. Based on this information, the Board considered the following factors for its decision. The dynamics of the economic activity and uncertainty over its pace of recovery. Observed inflation, its expected convergence to the 3.0% target, and the risks associated to it. The current, moderately expansionary monetary policy stance. The effects of the changing external conditions on the Colombian economy. In this environment, upon assessing the economic situation and the risk balance, the Board deemed appropriate to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 4.25%. The Board will continue to carefully monitor the behavior of inflation and the forecasts for economic activity and inflation in the country, as well as the international context. Finally, the Board reiterates that the monetary policy will depend on the availability of new information. The decision to maintain the benchmark interest rate unaltered was approved unanimously by the Board."
Pakistan,2019-01-31,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement January 31, 2019 Economic data released after the last Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting in November 2018 confirms that the stabilization measures implemented during the last twelve months are taking hold. Key monthly indicators are showing visible signs of deceleration in domestic demand. The current account deficit is narrowing, albeit gradually. This along with an increase in financial inflows are contributing to reduced pressures on the country's external accounts. These developments are encouraging and have served to reduce some economic uncertainty. However challenges to Pakistan's economy persist: (a) despite narrowing, the current account deficit remains high; (b) fiscal deficit is elevated; and (c) core inflation is persistently high. This situation calls for continued consolidation efforts. Average headline CPI inflation stands at. percent for the first half of FY19, which is considerably higher than the. percent recorded during the same period last year. Meanwhile headline YoY inflation has shown some moderation during the last two months, primarily due to sharp fall in prices of perishable food items and downward adjustment in prices of petroleum products. The impact of these developments has also been captured in the recent IBA-SBP's consumer confidence survey, which indicates some moderation in households' inflation expectations. Despite these positives, core inflation as measured by non-food-non-energy components of the CPI basket has reached. percent in December 2018. Going forward, the second round impacts of the exchange rate movements, upward adjustments in gas and electricity tariffs, and higher government borrowings from SBP are likely to be offset by the lagged impact of the increase in policy rates and the fall in international oil prices, on inflation. Accordingly the projected range of inflation remains unchanged at. to. percent. The pickup in inflation and the continuation of economic challenges are taking their toll on economic performance. Real economic activity has witnessed marked slowdown during the first half of the year. Large-scale manufacturing, which has strong backward and forward linkages, saw net contraction of. percent during the first five months of this fiscal year, mainly due to moderation in domestic demand and some sector specific challenges. Meanwhile all major kharif crops have recorded decline in production from last year's levels. The initial assessment of the wheat crop is also not encouraging. Both the direct and the knock on, impacts of changes in commodity producing sectors on the services sector, is likely to reduce real GDP growth for FY19 to around. percent, well below both the annual target of. percent and the. percent growth realized in the previous year. Credit to private sector (CPS) saw net expansion of Rs 570. billion during Jul-Dec FY19, which was almost double the level of expansion during the same period last year. This growth is largely attributed to higher cost of raw materials (cotton, petroleum products, etc), continuation of capacity expansion in power and construction-allied industries (especially cement and steel), and favorable liquidity conditions due to retirement of government borrowing from commercial banks. Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN In absolute terms, net budgetary finance from SBP reached Rs ,7. billion during 1st Jul-18th Jan FY19, which is. times the amount borrowed during the same period last year. This financing will potentially have inflationary consequences in the future. major chunk of this borrowing was used to retire government debt from commercial banks (a net retirement of Rs 3035. billion). This huge shift in government borrowing from commercial banks to SBP has incentivized private sector lending. The banks seem keen to redeploy their funds as there is hardly any increase in spreads charged by banks during the current cycle of monetary tightening and economic slowdown. Both the healthy credit offtake and higher government borrowing were the primary contributors to higher broad money (M2) growth of. percent during 1st Jul-18th Jan FY19 as compared to. percent during the same period last year. The fiscal deficit for first half FY19 is likely to be higher than the same period last year. This shows that despite sharp cut in PSDP releases and rationalization of tariffs and duties, fiscal consolidation remains challenge. The MPC reiterated its earlier view that fiscal policy will have to be proactive and play supportive role to generate conditions for stability and sustainable growth. On external front, the current account deficit (CAD) recorded YoY reduction of. percent during the first half of the year to US$. billion. This improvement is largely driven by sharp deceleration in import of goods and services. The impact of stabilization measures is amply visible from non-oil imports, which saw contraction of. percent during the first half of FY19 against an increase of 19. percent during the same period last year. marginal increase in exports and healthy growth in remittances also helped contain the current account deficit. The financing of CAD, nevertheless, remained challenging as the private (Foreign Direct Investments and private loans) and official inflows were insufficient to completely finance the deficit. Thus significant part of CAD was managed by using the country's own resources, which reduced the SBP's net liquid foreign exchange reserves to US$. billion by end-December 2018. However the realization of bilateral official flows in the last few days has helped increase SBP's net liquid foreign exchange reserves to US$. billion and the country's FX reserves to US$ 14. billion as of 25th January 2019. The MPC noted that the impact of stabilization measures implemented so far is gradually unfolding and confidence is improving amidst reduced economic uncertainty, but the fiscal deficit is yet to show signs of consolidation despite reduction in PSDP spending; although gradual improvement in current account deficit is visible, it remains high; marked shift in the pattern of government borrowing from scheduled banks to SBP entails inflationary concerns; and even as stabilization measures gradually work through the economy, underlying inflationary pressures persist. Based on the above and after detailed deliberations, the MPC decided to raise the policy rate by 25 bps to 10.25 percent effective 1st February 2019. Page."
Ukraine,2019-01-31,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to keep its key policy rate at 18.0% per annum. The rate was maintained at the same level in order to drive inflation down to the target of 5% in 2020. In 2018, consumer price inflation declined to a five-year low of 9.8% (versus 13.7% in 2017). The reversal of the trend for rising inflation seen in 2017 was primarily due to the NBU's tight monetary policy  the series of interest rate hikes that started in October 2017 increased the attractiveness of saving. Moreover, the tight monetary conditions were among reasons for the strengthening of the hryvnia. High global prices for exported goods, a record harvest of grain crops, and a substantial amount of remittances also contributed to the stronger hryvnia. In addition to monetary factors, an increase in the domestic food supply and lower global prices for food products dampened inflationary pressures. Despite having decelerated, inflation was, as expected, above the central bank's target range of 6% +/-2 pp at the end of 2018*. The deviation from the target was largely due to factors over which monetary policy has only a limited effect:. higher administered priceswage-driven growth in production costscrude oil prices rising throughout most of the yeara narrowed supply of vegetables due to unfavorable weather.Consumer demand, fueled by higher wages, was also an important inflation driver. Uncertainty as to whether or not cooperation with the IMF would resume and high external risks also weighed on economic sentiment throughout most of the year. The NBU deliberately chose a more lengthy path to bringing inflation to the target in order to minimize the loss of economic growth. Being able to balance the need to drive inflation to the target, and the need to support economic growth, shows the flexibility of the inflation-targeting regime. The tight monetary policy will help reduce inflation to the target of 5% in 2020. Inflation will continue to decline gradually. As before, the NBU expects inflation to decline to 6.3% at year-end 2019 and reach 5.0% at the end of 2020. That said, inflation will already be in the target range of 5% +/- 1 pp in early 2020, as planned. The disinflation will primarily be due to the tight monetary policy. Inflation will be also curbed by:. prudent fiscal policy driven by the need to repay large volumes of public debt in 20192020slower wage growth, as domestic wages converge with wages in neighboring countries and migration moderatesrelatively low exchange rate volatility resulting in low imported inflationa decrease in energy prices in the global marketsweak growth in raw food prices.These factors will make core inflation decline to 5% in 2019, down from 8.7% in 2018, and to a level below 4% in 20202021. At the same time, the further planned increases in administered prices, which are required to bring them to market levels, will continue to impact consumer price inflation. After picking up in 2018, economic growth will somewhat decelerate. Last year, the Ukrainian economy grew more rapidly than in any of the past seven years  by 3.3% according to the NBU's latest estimates. However, real GDP growth will slow to 2.5% in 2019, as predicted. The slowdown will be driven by the tight monetary policy necessary to bring inflation down to the target level and by the conservative fiscal policy intended to finance significant public debt repayments this year. In addition, the grain harvest is expected to decline from the record levels that made agriculture the primary driver of economic growth. Another factor will be a gradual deceleration of growth in the global economy and trade, including due to protectionist measures. Private consumption will remain a key driver of growth as real household income  wages, pensions, and remittances from abroad  continues to grow. Although investment activity will slow down, it will remain an important driver of demand for investment imports. As a result, even given a revival in export-oriented industrial production and record grain exports, imports will grow faster than exports in real terms. Consequently, the contribution of net exports will remain negative, although smaller than before. Next year, real economy growth will start to accelerate, hitting 2.9% in 2020 and 3.7% in 2021. The growth will mainly be propelled by a gradual easing in monetary policy, which will bolster domestic demand, and a pick-up in investment activity, as uncertainty about the political situation diminishes. After widening to 3.6% of GDP in 2018, the current account deficit will range between 3% and 4% of GDP in 2019 and 2020. In 2019, the deficit will narrow to 3.1% of GDP, due to the 2018 bumper corn harvest and a drop in energy prices. In 20202021, the current account deficit will widen slightly, on the back of a decrease in gas transit, a poorer grain harvest, and a rise in investment imports after the elections. A widening in the trade deficit will be offset by greater private remittances, supported by the higher incomes of labor migrants. A key assumption of the macroeconomic forecast is that Ukraine will continue to cooperate with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and enjoy relatively favorable access to the international capital markets. At the same time, reasonably high interest rates will contribute to the inflow of capital, which, together with continued inflows of foreign direct investment, will finance the current account deficit. External official borrowing and the government's placement of Eurobonds will make it possible to repay external public debt, the repayments of which will peak in 20192020. This will improve the expectations of economic agents and promote macrofinancial stability. As a result, international reserves will hover around USD 21 billion in 2019 and 2020. The usual increase in uncertainty during presidential and parliamentary elections poses the main risk to the said macroeconomic forecast, including Ukraine's ability to meet its inflation target in 2020. This, in turn, could affect inflation expectations. External risks are also important. a more significant slowdown in the global economy, including in the economies of Ukraine's main trading partnersa drop in the global prices of the commodities exported by Ukrainepersistently strong labor migration and the resulting pressures on wagesgeopolitical risks, such as an escalation of the Azov Sea conflict, which could cut export earningsuncertainty over the volume of gas transit through Ukraine starting in 2020, as pipelines bypassing the country are being built to deliver gas to Europe.Taking into account the updated macroeconomic forecast and the above risks, the NBU Board deems it necessary to maintain the existing reasonably tight monetary conditions in order to ensure that inflation returns to its target range in Q1 2020. Any further changes to the key policy rate will depend on inflation developments, as well as on whether or not risks to price stability materialize. The Board sees reasons for launching a monetary easing cycle, as risks of inflation decrease steadily, and inflation returns to its target, along the trajectory outlined in the central bank's new macroeconomic forecast. However, if underlying inflationary pressures rise and risks that inflation may not return to its target increase, the NBU could raise the key policy rate. The decision to keep the key policy rate at 18.0% was approved by NBU Board Policy Rate Decision No.88-D, dated 31 January 2019. A new detailed macroeconomic forecast will be published in the central bank's Inflation Report on 7 February 2019. A summary of the discussion by Monetary Policy Committee members that preceded this decision will be published on 11 February 2019. The next meeting of the NBU Board on monetary policy issues will be held on 14 March 2019 as scheduled. * the target set in the Monetary Policy Guidelines for 2018 and the Medium Term."
Brazil,2019-02-06,"The Copom unanimously decided to maintain the Selic rate at 6.50% p.a. The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario:. Recent data on economic activity continue to indicate gradual recovery of the Brazilian economy. The global outlook remains challenging, despite some decline in risks and a change in composition. On the one hand, short-term risks associated with normalization of interest rates in some advanced economies have receded. On the other hand, there was an increase in risks related to a slowdown in global growth, as a result of several uncertainties, such as trade conflict and Brexit. The Committee judges that various measures of underlying inflation are running at appropriate or comfortable levels. This includes the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy. Inflation expectations for 2019, 2020 and 2021 collected by the Focus survey are around 3.9%, 4.0% and 3.75%, respectively; and. The Copom's inflation projections in the scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the Focus survey stand around 3.9% for 2019 and 3.8% for 2020. This scenario assumes a path for the Selic rate that ends 2019 at 6.5% p.a. and increases to 8.0% p.a. over the course of 2020. It also assumes a path for the exchange rate that ends 2019 at R$/US$ 3.7, and 2020 at R$/US$ 3.75. In the scenario with a constant interest rate, at 6.5% p.a., and a constant exchange rate, at R$/US$ 3.70*, the projections for 2019 and 2020 stand around 3.9% and 4.0%, respectively. The Committee emphasizes that risks around its baseline scenario remain in both directions, but with larger weight on the last two risks, thus with asymmetry. On the one hand, the high level of economic slack may lead to a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory. On the other hand, frustration of expectations regarding the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy may affect risk premia and increase the path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy. This risk intensifies in case the global outlook for emerging economies deteriorates. The Committee judges that, since its previous meeting, notably related to the global outlook, inflationary risks have moderated. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the wide array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to maintain the Selic rate at 6.50% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation and the associated balance of risks, and is consistent with convergence of inflation to target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, which includes 2019 and, with a smaller and gradually increasing weight, 2020. The Copom reiterates that economic conditions prescribe stimulative monetary policy, i.e., interest rates below the structural level. The Copom emphasizes that the evolution of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy is essential to maintain low inflation in the medium and long run, for the reduction of its structural interest rate, and for sustainable economic recovery. The Committee stresses that the perception of continuation of the reform agenda affects current expectations and macroeconomic projections. In the Copom's assessment, the evolution of the baseline scenario and of the balance of risks prescribes keeping the Selic rate at its current level. The Copom emphasizes that the next steps in the conduct of monetary policy will continue to depend on the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, and on inflation projections and expectations. The Copom asserts that caution, serenity, and perseverance in monetary policy decisions, even in the face of volatile scenarios, have been instrumental in pursuing its primary objective of keeping the inflation path towards the targets. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Ilan Goldfajn (Governor). Carlos Viana de Carvalho. Carolina de Assis Barros. MaurÃ­cio Costa de Moura. OtÃ¡vio Ribeiro Damaso. Paulo Sergio Neves de Souza. Sidnei CorrÃªa Marques, and Tiago Couto Berriel. *Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average R$/US$ exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the Friday prior to the Copom meeting."
Philippines,2019-02-06,"At its meeting on monetary policy today, the Monetary Board decided to keep the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) facility unchanged at 4.75 percent. The interest rates on the overnight lending and deposit facilities were likewise held steady. The Monetary Board's decision is based on its assessment of a more manageable inflation environment. Latest baseline inflation forecasts show inflation settling within the target band of3.0 percent Â± 1.0 percentage point for 2019-2020, as price pressures continue to recede due to the decline in international crude oil prices and the normalization of supply conditions for key food items. Inflation expectations have also declined further and are now aligned to the inflation target for 2019-2020. At the same time, domestic demand conditions have remained firm, supported by a projected recovery in household spending and the sustained implementation of the government's infrastructure program. Meanwhile, the risks to the inflation outlook are seen to remain evenly balanced for 2019 while leaning toward the downside for 2020 given a more uncertain global economic environment, which in turn could temper potential upward pressures from commodity prices in the coming months. Given these considerations, the Monetary Board deems the prevailing monetary policy settings to be appropriate, as previous monetary responses continue to work their way through the economy. The Monetary Board also emphasized that the BSP remains vigilant against developments that could affect the outlook for inflation and is prepared to take appropriate policy action as necessary to safeguard its price and financial stability objectives."
Poland,2019-02-06,"Warsaw, 6 February 2019 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 5-6 February 2019 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: â–ª reference rate at 1.50%; â–ª lombard rate at 2.50%; â–ª deposit rate at 0.50%; â–ª rediscount rate at 1.75%. Incoming data indicate a weakening in some of the largest economies, amid heightened uncertainty regarding the outlook for global economic activity in the coming quarters. In the euro area. GDP growth in 2018 Q4 remained lower than in the first half of 2018, while economic climate indicators declined in the recent period. In the United States. GDP growth in 2018 Q4 slowed down, although economic conditions in this economy remain strong. At the same time, in China activity growth continues to gradually decline. Despite some increase in global oil prices in the recent period, their level is lower than in 2018 Q3. This is leading to a decline in inflation in many countries. Alongside that, core inflation in the environment of the Polish economy, including the euro area, remains low. The European Central Bank keeps interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero. At the same time, the ECB continues to reinvest the funds from the maturing securities. Following an interest rate hike in December 2018, the US Federal Reserve is keeping interest rates unchanged. In Poland, preliminary GDP data for 2018 suggest that GDP growth in 2018 Q4 remained relatively high, although it was slightly lower than in previous quarters. GDP growth is still driven by rising consumption  albeit at a slightly lower rate than in previous quarters  that is fuelled by increasing employment and wages as well as very high consumer sentiment. This was accompanied by a rise in investment. Notwithstanding relatively high economic growth and wages increasing faster than in previous years, annual consumer price growth has declined in recent months and remains moderate. At the same time, inflation net of food and energy prices continues to be low. In the Council's assessment, the outlook for economic conditions in Poland remains favourable. However, in the quarters to come, there will probably be a gradual slowdown in GDP growth. At the same time, according to current forecasts, the annual price growth will increase in the coming months, yet  due to lower oil prices than in 2018 Q3 and the freeze on electricity prices  the scale of this increase will be markedly smaller than anticipated in the November projection. In the medium term, the expected slowdown in economic growth will have a dampening effect on inflation. Consequently, in the monetary policy transmission horizon, inflation will remain close to the target. 1/2 The Council judges that the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability."
Thailand,2019-02-06,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 1/2019 Mr. Titanun Mallikamas. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 6 February 2019 as follows. The Committee voted 4 to 2 to maintain the policy rate at 175 percent. Two members voted to raise the policy rate by 025 percentage point from 175 to 200 percent. One MPC member was unable to attend the meeting. In deliberating their policy decision, the Committee assessed that the Thai economy would continue to gain traction on the back of domestic demand despite a slowdown in external demand. Headline inflation was restrained by lower energy prices and subject to increased downside risks, while core inflation would edge up in line with previous projection. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative and conducive to economic growth. However there were risks to financial stability in the future that warranted close monitoring. The Committee viewed that the current accommodative monetary policy stance had contributed to the continuation of economic growth and was appropriate given the inflation target. Thus most members decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at this meeting. Nevertheless two members viewed that the economy continued expanding around its potential, and that overall financial conditions would remain accommodative and conducive to economic growth despite an additional 025 percentage point increase in the policy rate. Hence they voted to raise the policy rate at this meeting to curb financial stability risks and to build up policy space. The Thai economy as a whole was expected to continue expanding around its potential despite increased downside risks. This was due to merchandise exports growth which was affected by the global economic slowdown, trade protectionism measures between the US and China, and a down cycle of electronic products. Meanwhile tourism would improve mainly on the back of a faster-than-expected recovery in the number of Chinese tourists. Domestic demand momentum continued to expand. Private consumption was expected to expand on the back of increasingly broad-based improvements in both farm and non-farm income with additional supports from government measures. Nevertheless private consumption was restrained by elevated household debt. Private investment was projected to expand thanks to the relocation of production base to Thailand and public-private partnership projects for infrastructure investment. Public expenditure would grow at a slower pace mainly due to the lower-than-expected actual spending and budget for current and capital expenditures as well as delayed investment by some state-owned enterprises. The Committee would monitor external risks from both trade protectionism measures between the US and China and the Chinese economic outlook as well as the progress of major infrastructure investment and its knock-on effects on private investment which could affect momentum of economic growth in the period ahead. Headline inflation was restrained by lower energy prices and subject to increased downside risks due to fluctuations in energy and fresh food prices. Core inflation would edge up given the gradually rising demand-pull inflationary pressures. The Committee viewed that structural changes contributed to more persistent inflation than in the past. Such changes included the expansion of e-commerce, rising price competition, and technological development which reduced costs of production. Financial conditions over the previous period had been accommodative and conducive to economic growth with ample liquidity in the financial system. Financial institutions gradually increased interest rates following the policy rate, especially deposit interest rates. Real interest rates rose but still remained at a low level, allowing financing by the private sector to continue expanding. Loans extended to businesses and consumers continued to grow. With regard to exchange rates, the Thai baht against the US dollar appreciated mainly due to the weakened US dollar. The movement of the Thai baht was in line with those of emerging markets and regional economies. Looking ahead, the baht would likely remain volatile due to uncertainties pertaining to external front, and thus the Committee would continue to closely monitor exchange rate developments as well as their impacts on the economy. Financial stability remained sound overall but there remained a need to monitor risks that might pose vulnerabilities to financial stability in the future, especially the search-for-yield behavior amid the low interest rate environment that might lead to underpricing of risks. The Committee viewed that the implemented macroprudential measures and the increased policy rate would help curb accumulation of vulnerabilities in the financial system to some extent. Nevertheless developments in the mortgage loan market, adjustments in the real estate sector, growth in assets held by saving cooperatives, as well as debt accumulation among households and large corporates, which could lead to underpricing of risks, still warranted monitoring. Looking ahead, the Thai economy was projected to continue to gain traction although the external demand might slow down. The Committee viewed that accommodative monetary policy would remain appropriate in the period ahead, and thus would continue to monitor developments of economic growth, inflation, and financial stability, together with associated risks, in deliberating appropriate monetary policy in the period ahead."
Czech Republic,2019-02-07,"At its meeting today, the CNB Bank Board decided to keep interest rates unchanged. The two-week repo rate thus remains at 1.75%, the discount rate at 0.75% and the Lombard rate at 2.75%. Five members voted in favour of this decision, and two members voted for increasing rates by 25 basis points. . The decision adopted by the Bank Board is underpinned by a new macroeconomic forecast. Consistent with the forecast is broad interest rate stability. According to the external assumptions of the forecast, economic growth in the euro area will slow this year and accelerate slightly next year. Consumer and producer price inflation will be just below 2% over the next two years. The European Central Bank ended its asset purchase programme but stated that it would not start increasing interest rates until quite some time later. According to the market outlook, the 3M EURIBOR will thus remain negative until the end of 2020. Following its recent marked drop, the oil price is expected to remain at around USD 60 a barrel over the next two years. The market expects the euro to appreciate modestly against the dollar due to convergence between euro and dollar interest rates. Overall, the outlooks for foreign variables have been revised in the anti-inflationary direction compared to the previous forecast. Inflation in the Czech Republic will rise temporarily at the start of this year but will again be very close to the Czech National Bank's 2% target in the following period. The persisting substantial domestic inflation pressures continue to reflect above all a tight labour market, characterised by rapid wage growth and very low unemployment. However, the inflation pressures from the domestic economy will be partly offset this year by an increasing anti-inflationary effect of import prices. This will stem from slowing growth in foreign prices and renewed appreciation of the koruna. Together with slowing wage growth, this will lead to a gradual decrease in the overall inflation pressures and thereby to stabilisation of inflation close to the target. Growth of the Czech economy of close to 3% this year and the next will be consistent with the long-run equilibrium growth rate. The increase in domestic economic activity will be driven mainly by growth in household consumption, which will continue to reflect buoyant growth in household income. Rising demand and still distinct labour shortages are motivating domestic firms to invest. Government investment will also grow further, mainly as a result of higher drawdown of EU funds. Fiscal policy will also contribute to economic growth this year via a significant rise in current expenditure. The record-low unemployment rate is not creating room for unemployment to fall significantly further. This will lead to slower employment growth and continued high, albeit gradually moderating, wage growth. The forecast assumes that the negative sentiment on foreign exchange markets towards emerging markets will gradually fade out in the quarters ahead. This will lead to renewed appreciation of the koruna, supported by a wider interest rate differential vis-Ã -vis the euro area. Next year, the koruna will appreciate more gradually, in line with continued real convergence of the Czech economy. Consistent with the forecast is broad interest rate stability. Upward pressure is being exerted on rates primarily by the currently weakened koruna, which is dampening the anti-inflationary effect of import prices. The strong domestic inflation pressures and the gradual pass-through of the higher administered price inflation into other components of inflation are acting in the same direction. Renewed appreciation of the koruna amid persisting negative interest rates in the euro area until the end of 2020 will subsequently have the opposite effect on rates. Compared to the previous forecast, the inflation forecast has shifted to lower levels this year, reflecting the latest observed figures and a stronger anti-inflationary effect of import prices. At the monetary policy horizon, the inflation outlook is almost unchanged. The forecast for domestic economic growth has shifted slightly lower. Interest rates are slightly higher this year, due mainly to a weaker koruna. Next year, by contrast, rates are slightly lower, primarily reflecting a markedly lower outlook for euro area interest rates over the entire forecast horizon. The forecast expects the effect of negative sentiment, which has dampened the appreciation of the koruna, to fade away a quarter later than assumed by the previous forecast. The koruna will thus appreciate less this year than in the previous prediction, but will return to the levels of the previous forecast next year."
India,2019-02-07,"Sixth Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2018-19 Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) Reserve Bank of India On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation at its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to: reduce the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 25 basis points from 6.5 per cent to 6.25 per cent with immediate effect. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF stands adjusted to 6.0 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate to 6.5 per cent. The MPC also decided to change the monetary policy stance from calibrated tightening to neutral. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Assessment 2. Since the last MPC meeting in December 2018, there has been a slowdown in global economic activity. Among key advanced economies (AEs), economic activity in the US lost some steam in Q4:2018. The outlook for Q1:2019 is clouded by the partial government shutdown, though the labour market conditions remain strong. In the Euro area, economic activity lost momentum on weak industrial activity. The Japanese economy is gradually recovering and an accommodative monetary policy stance is expected to buttress domestic spending. Economic activity also slowed in some major emerging market economies (EMEs). In China, growth decelerated in Q4:2018. Economic activity in Russia lost pace, with soft oil prices posing a downside risk to growth. The Brazilian economy appeared to have ended 2018 on a firmer note, driven by improved domestic spending and exports, though industrial activity continued to struggle to recover from the disruptions of H1:2018. In South Africa, the economic recovery in Q4:2018 remained gradual, tempered by weak industrial activity and subdued exports. Crude oil prices recovered from their December lows in early January on production cuts, but remain below their peak levels in October. Base metals, which witnessed selling pressures in December on persisting uncertainty over US-China trade frictions, recouped losses in January on expectations of thawing of trade disputes and production disruptions.2 Gold prices have risen, underpinned by safe haven demand in response to geo-political uncertainty and volatility in equity markets. Inflation edged lower in major AEs and many key EMEs. Global financial markets began the year on a calmer note after a turbulent December. Among AEs, equity markets in the US recovered from a sharp sell-off in December, triggered by monetary policy tightening by the Fed, trade tensions and an impending shutdown. EM stock markets, which declined in December on a slew of soft economic data, registered some gains recently on expectations of accommodative monetary policy stances in major economies. The 10-year yield in the US, which fell to a multi-month low in December, rose in January on the edging up of crude oil prices and positive risk sentiment, though softening of the Fed stance restricted the gains. Among other AEs, bond yields in the Euro area and Japan eased on diminishing optimism about global growth. In most EMEs, bond yields have eased as well. In currency markets, the US dollar remained under pressure, though expectations of easing trade tensions provided some support. EME currencies appreciated on the pause in the rate hiking cycle by the Fed and expectations of a positive outcome from US-China trade negotiations. Moving on to the domestic economy, on January 7, 2019 the Central Statistics Office (CSO) released the first advance estimates (FAE) for 2018-19, placing India's real gross domestic product (GDP) growth at 7.2 per cent  the same level as in 2017-18 (first revised estimates). The FAE for 2018-19 featured an acceleration in gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) and a slowdown in consumption expenditure (both private and government). The drag from net exports is estimated to decline in 2018-19. Some indicators of investment demand, viz., production and imports of capital goods, contracted in November/December. Credit flows to industry remain muted. Available data suggest that while revenue expenditure of the Centre, excluding interest payments and subsidies, contracted in Q3, that of States increased sharply, thus maintaining overall growth in government spending. On the supply side, the FAE have placed the growth of real gross value added (GVA) at 7.0 per cent in 2018-19 as compared with 6.9 per cent in 2017-18. The estimates incorporated a slowdown in agricultural GVA growth and an acceleration in industrial GVA growth. Services GVA growth is set to soften due to subdued activity in trade, hotels, transport, communication and other services. Growth in public administration and defence services is also likely to moderate. Rabi sowing so far (up to February 1, 2019) has been lower than in the previous year, but the overall shortfall of 4.0 per cent across various crops is expected to catch up as the season comes to a close. The lower rabi sowing reflects a deficient north-east monsoon (44 per cent below the long period average); however, storage in major reservoirs  the main source of irrigation during the rabi season  at 44 per cent of the full reservoir level (as on January 31, 2019) was marginally higher than in the previous year. The extended period of cold weather in this year's winter is likely to boost wheat yields, which would partly offset the shortfall, if any, in area sown. After exhibiting an uptick in the festive month of October, industrial activity, measured by the index of industrial production (IIP), slowed down in November. The year- on-year (y-o-y) growth in core industries decelerated to 2.6 per cent (y-o-y) in December, pulled down by a slowdown in the production of electricity and coal; and contraction in petroleum refinery products, crude oil and fertilisers output. Capacity utilisation (CU) in the manufacturing sector, as measured by the Reserve Bank's order books, inventory and capacity utilisation survey (OBICUS), increased to 74.8 per cent in Q2 from 73.8 per cent in Q1; seasonally adjusted CU also improved to 75.3 per cent from 74.9 per cent. While the Reserve3 Bank's business assessment index of the industrial outlook survey (IOS) for Q3:2018-19 suggests a weakening of demand conditions in the manufacturing sector, the business expectations index (BEI) points to an improvement in Q4. The manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) for January remained in expansion on the back of increased output and new orders. High-frequency indicators of the services sector suggest some moderation in the pace of activity. Sales of motorcycles and tractors imply weakening of rural demand in December. Sales of passenger cars  an indicator of urban demand  contracted, possibly reflecting volatility in fuel prices and mandated long-term insurance premium payments. Commercial vehicle sales also shrank in December 2018 from a high base of the previous year. Lead indicators for the hotels sub-segment, viz., foreign tourist arrivals and air passenger traffic, point to softening in November-December. In the communication sub-segment, the telephone subscriber base contracted in October-November, while that of broadband continued to expand in October. The services PMI continued to expand in January 2019 despite a dip from the previous month. Indicators of the construction sector, viz., consumption of steel and production of cement, continued to show healthy growth, though growth in cement production inched lower in November 2018, reflecting a base effect. Retail inflation, measured by y-o-y change in the CPI, declined from 3.4 per cent in October 2018 to 2.2 per cent in December, the lowest print in the last eighteen months. Continuing deflation in food items, a sharp fall in fuel inflation and some edging down of inflation excluding food and fuel contributed to the decline in headline inflation. Five constituents of the food group  vegetables, sugar, pulses, eggs and fruits, accounting for about 30 per cent of food group  were in deflation in December. Inflation in respect of other major food sub-groups  cereals, milk, and oils and fats  was subdued. Within cereals, rice prices declined for the fourth consecutive month in December. Inflation in prices of meat and fish and non-alcoholic beverages showed an uptick, while it remained sticky for prepared meals. Inflation in the fuel and light group fell from 8.5 per cent in October to 4.5 per cent in December, pulled down by a sharp decline in the prices of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), reflecting softening of international petroleum product prices. Kerosene inflation continued to edge up due to the calibrated increase in its administered price. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel decelerated to 5.6 per cent in December from 6.2 per cent in October, dragged down mainly by the moderation in the prices of petrol and diesel in line with the decline in international petroleum product prices. Housing inflation continued to edge down as the impact of the house rent allowance (HRA) increase for central government employees dissipated. However, inflation in several of the sub-groups  household goods and services; health; recreation and amusement; and education  firmed up in December, offsetting much of the impact of lower inflation in petrol, diesel and housing. Inflation expectations of households, measured by the December 2018 round of the Reserve Bank's survey, softened by 80 basis points for the three-month ahead horizon and by 130 basis points for the twelve-month ahead horizon over the last round, reflecting the continued decline in food and fuel prices. Producers' assessment of inflation in input prices eased in Q3 as reported by manufacturing firms polled by the Reserve Bank's industrial outlook survey. Inflation in the prices of farm inputs and industrial raw materials remained elevated, despite some softening. Growth in rural wages moderated in October.4 18. The weighted average call rate (WACR) traded below the policy repo rate on 12 out of 20 days in December, all 23 days in January and 4 days in February (up to February 6). The WACR was below the repo rate on an average by 4 basis points in December and 11 basis points each in January and February. Currency in circulation expanded sharply during December and January. The liquidity needs arising out of expansion in currency were met by the Reserve Bank through injection of durable liquidity amounting to 500 billion each in December and January through purchases under open market operations (OMOs). Accordingly, total durable liquidity injected through OMOs has aggregated 2.36 trillion during 2018-19 so far. Liquidity injected under the LAF was 996 billion in December on an average daily net basis, and 329 billion in January. In February, however, the average daily liquidity position turned into surplus with an average absorption of 279 billion. Export growth on a y-o-y basis was almost flat in November and December 2018, primarily due to a high base effect and weak global demand. While growth in exports of petroleum products remained positive, non-oil exports declined, dragged down by lower shipments of gems and jewellery, engineering goods, meat and poultry. Import growth slowed in November and turned negative in December 2018. While imports of petroleum (crude and products) rose in line with the increase in import volumes, non-oil imports such as pearls and precious stones, gold, electronic goods and transport equipment, recorded declines. The merchandise trade deficit for April-December 2018 was a shade higher than its level a year ago. Net services exports picked up in October and November 2018, which combined with low oil prices, could have a salutary impact on the current account deficit in Q3. On the financing side, net FDI flows to India during April-November 2018 were higher than a year ago. Foreign portfolio flows turned negative in January 2019, after rebounding in November and December 2018. India's foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 400.2 billion on February 1, 2019. Outlook 20. In the fifth bi-monthly monetary policy resolution in December 2018. CPI inflation for 2018-19 was projected in the range of 2.7-3.2 per cent in H2:2018-19 and 3.8-4.2 per cent in H1:2019-20, with risks tilted to the upside. The actual inflation outcome at 2.6 per cent in Q3:2018-19 was marginally lower than the projection. There have been downward revisions in inflation projections during the course of the year, reflecting mainly the unprecedented soft inflation recorded across food sub-groups. Several factors will shape the inflation path, going forward. First, food inflation has continued to surprise on the downside with continuing deflation across several items and a significant moderation in inflation in cereals. Several food groups are experiencing excess supply conditions domestically as well as internationally. Hence, the short-term outlook for food inflation appears particularly benign, despite adverse base effects. Secondly, the moderation in the fuel group was larger than anticipated. Inflation in items of rural consumption such as firewood and chips, which had remained sticky and at elevated levels, has collapsed in recent months. Electricity prices also showed an unexpected moderation, providing a softer outlook for the fuel group. Thirdly, while inflation excluding food and fuel remains elevated, the recent unusual pick-up in the prices of health and education could be a one-off phenomenon. Fourthly, the crude oil price outlook remains broadly the same as in the December policy. Fifthly, the Reserve Bank's surveys show that inflation expectations of households as well as input and output price expectations of producers have moderated significantly. Finally, the effect of the HRA increase for central government employees has dissipated completely along expected lines. Taking into consideration these developments and assuming a normal monsoon in 2019, the path of CPI inflation is revised downwards to 2.8 per cent in Q4:2018-19, 3.2-3.4 per cent in H1:2019-20 and 3.9 per cent in Q3:2019-20, with risks broadly balanced around the central trajectory.5 22. Turning to the growth outlook. GDP growth for 2018-19 in the December policy was projected at 7.4 per cent (7.2-7.3 per cent in H2) and at 7.5 per cent for H1:2019-20, with risks somewhat to the downside. The CSO has estimated GDP growth at 7.2 per cent for 2018-19. Looking beyond the current year, the growth outlook is likely to be influenced by the following factors. First, aggregate bank credit and overall financial flows to the commercial sector continue to be strong, but are yet to be broad-based. Secondly, in spite of soft crude oil prices and the lagged impact of the recent depreciation of the Indian rupee on net exports, slowing global demand could pose headwinds. In particular, trade tensions and associated uncertainties appear to be moderating global growth. Taking into consideration the above factors. GDP growth for 2019-20 is projected at 7.4 per cent  in the range of 7.2-7.4 per cent in H1, and 7.5 per cent in Q3  with risks evenly balanced. Headline inflation is projected to remain soft in the near term reflecting the current low level of inflation and the benign food inflation outlook. Beyond the near term, some uncertainties warrant careful monitoring. First, vegetable prices have been volatile in the recent period; reversal in vegetable prices could impart upside risk to the food inflation trajectory. Secondly, the oil price outlook continues to be hazy. Thirdly, a further heightening of trade tensions and geo-political uncertainties could also weigh on global growth prospects, dampening global demand and softening global commodity prices, especially oil prices. Fourthly, the unusual spike in the prices of health and education needs to be closely watched. Fifthly, financial markets remain volatile. Sixthly, the monsoon outcome is assumed to be normal; any spatial or temporal variation in rainfall may alter the food inflation outlook. Finally, several proposals in the union budget for 2019-20 are likely to boost aggregate demand by raising disposable incomes, but the full effect of some of the measures is likely to materialise over a period of time. The MPC notes that the output gap has opened up modestly as actual output has inched lower than potential. Investment activity is recovering but supported mainly by public spending on infrastructure. The need is to strengthen private investment activity and buttress private consumption. Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to change the stance of monetary policy from calibrated tightening to neutral and to reduce the policy repo rate by 25 basis points.6 26. The decision to change the monetary policy stance was unanimous. As regards the reduction in the policy repo rate. Dr.Ravindra H. Dholakia. Dr.Pami Dua. Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted in favour of the decision. Chetan Ghate and Dr.Viral V. Acharya voted to keep the policy rate unchanged. The MPC reiterates its commitment to achieving the medium-term target for headline inflation of 4 per cent on a durable basis. The minutes of the MPC's meeting will be published by February 21, 2019. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled from April 2 to 4, 2019. Jose J. Kattoor Press Release: 2018-2019/1877 Chief General Manager."
Mexico,2019-02-07,"Banco de Mexico's Governing Board has decided to maintain the target for the overnight interbank interest rate at 8.25%. Available indicators suggest that during the fourth quarter of 2018 the world economy decelerated, as evidenced by the lower dynamism in most advanced and some emerging economies, such as the Eurozone. China, and, to a lesser extent, the United States. This reflects, among other factors, the effects of trade disputes, declining business confidence, and transitory shocks. This environment of lower dynamism of economic activity led to downward revisions in the outlook for world growth for 2019 and 2020, and, together with the decrease in crude oil prices, contributed to ease inflationary pressures in the main economies. The latter has been reflected in expectations of a slower normalization of monetary policy in the major economies, and in lower short- and long-term interest rates in the United States. As expected, in January the Federal Reserve left the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged. Also, it modified significantly its message, stating that it will be patient in making future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate and that it could adjust the details of its balance sheet normalization program if necessary. In this context, financial markets in both advanced and emerging economies have exhibited a more favorable performance. As for the risks to the global economy, the uncertainty regarding trade disputes between the U.S. and China, a disorderly Brexit process, a lower- than-expected growth of the Chinese economy, and an escalation of political and geopolitical turmoil in different regions stand out. Since the last monetary policy decision, the prices of financial assets in Mexico have exhibited a more favorable performance. The Mexican peso appreciated and exhibited lower volatility. Additionally, sovereign risk premia and interest rates for the medium and long terms decreased, partly reverting the increases exhibited in the last months of 2018, although they still remain at high levels. Among the factors contributing to a better performance of domestic markets were the reduction in interest rates in the United States and the weakening of the US dollar, the Economic Package approved for 2019, and investors' consent to the New Mexico City International Airport bond buyback offer. Nevertheless, in view of Pemex's challenges. Fitch downgraded its credit rating, which will imply greater financing costs for Mexico's state-owned oil company. The current environment continues to pose significant risks in the medium and long terms that could affect the country's macroeconomic conditions, its potential growth, and the economy's price formation process. In this regard, it is particularly important that, in addition to following a prudent and firm monetary policy, measures to foster an environment of confidence and certainty for investment and higher productivity are adopted, and public finances are consolidated sustainably. In this context, it is especially relevant that the fiscal goals set in the Economic Package for 2019 are attained. Strengthening the rule of law and tackling corruption are equally imperative. 1 During the fourth quarter of 2018. Mexico's economic activity decelerated significantly as compared to the third quarter and this pattern could continue at the beginning of 2019 as a result of the slowdown of the world economy, some weakness in domestic demand, and to factors of a transitory nature that might affect growth in the first quarter of the year, including those associated with fuel distribution and with the blocking of transportation routes. Thus, slack conditions in the economy loosened towards the end of 2018 and the early part of this year. Due to the latter, the balance of risks for growth is biased to the downside. Inflation fell from 4.72% in November 2018 to 4.37% in January 2019, mainly due to a reduction in non- core inflation, as core inflation continued to exhibit a resistance to decline, going from 3.63% in November to 3.60% in January. During such period, non-core inflation fell from 8.07% to 6.81%, mirroring the lower increases in energy and in livestock product prices. These results were partially offset by greater increases in fruit and vegetable prices. Headline inflation expectations for 2019 and 2020 showed a marked deterioration in December and some improvement in January. Those corresponding to the end of 2019 went from 3.71% in October to 3.89% in December, and then decreased to 3.80% in January. As for core inflation expectations for the end of 2019, these adjusted from 3.45% in October to 3.50% in December and January. Headline inflation expectations for the medium and long terms continue to be above the 3% target, at around 3.50%. As for information drawn from market instruments, medium- and long-term inflationary risk premia decreased, but still remain at high levels. Regarding the risks for inflation, the possibility that the peso exchange rate comes under pressure stemming from external or domestic factors stands out. Should the economy require adjustments either to the real exchange rate or to medium- and long-term interest rates. Banco de Mexico will contribute to making such adjustments occur in an orderly manner, in an effort to prevent second-round effects on the economy's price formation process. Inflation could also be affected if new pressures on energy prices or on agricultural product prices arise, if an escalation of protectionist and compensatory measures worldwide materializes, or in case public finances deteriorate. Considering the magnitude of the recent minimum wage increases, in addition to their possible direct impact, there is also the risk that these bring about wage revisions that exceed productivity gains and give rise to cost pressures, affecting formal employment and prices. In order to raise the purchasing power of wages sustainably, the role of other public policies must be considered, in particular, fostering competition in those sectors of goods and services with a high share in the consumption basket of the segments of the population with the lowest income. Also, the persistence shown by core inflation could give rise to a greater resistance of long-term inflation expectations to decline. As for downside risks, those that stand out are possible lower price increases in some of the goods included in the non-core subindex or a greater-than-foreseen widening in slackness conditions. Considering all of the above, the balance of risks for the forecasted path of inflation remains biased to the upside, in an environment of high uncertainty. To guide its monetary policy actions. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board follows closely the development of inflation vis-Ã -vis its forecasted trajectory, taking into account the monetary policy stance adopted and the time frame in which monetary policy operates, as well as available information on all inflation determinants and on medium- and long-term inflation expectations, including the balance of risks for such factors. Monetary policy must respond prudently if for any reason the uncertainty faced by the economy increases considerably. In this context, considering that the recent developments in inflation and its main determinants have not changed significantly with respect to their foreseen path, that the cyclical position of the economy has loosened somewhat, and that the current monetary policy stance is consistent with the convergence of inflation to its target. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board has decided unanimously to leave the target for the overnight interbank interest rate unchanged at 8.25%. Considering the risks to consolidate low and stable inflation as well as those the economy's price formation is subject to, the Governing Board will take the necessary actions so that the reference rate is kept at a level 2 consistent with the convergence of headline inflation to Banco de Mexico's target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board will maintain a prudent monetary policy stance and, under the current environment of uncertainty, will follow closely the potential pass-through of exchange rate fluctuations to prices, the monetary policy stance relative to that of the U.S., under an external environment that it is still subject to risks, and to the behavior of the conditions of slack in the Mexican economy. In the presence and possible persistence of factors that, by their nature, involve risks to both inflation and inflation expectations, monetary policy will be adjusted in a timely and firm manner to achieve the convergence of inflation to its 3% target and to strengthen the anchoring of medium- and long-term inflation expectations so that they attain such target."
Romania,2019-02-07,"In its meeting of 7 February 2019, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided:. The annual CPI inflation rate continued to go down in December 2018 to 3.27 percent from 3.43 percent in November, moving deeper into the variation band of the flat target. Thus, the NBR fulfilled its objective of maintaining price stability over the medium term amid a carefully calibrated monetary policy stance. The December evolution occurred mainly following the drop in fuel prices  amid the international oil price dynamics , partly offset by the hikes in the prices of fruit and vegetables and those of tobacco products. In turn, the annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate (which excludes from the CPI inflation administered prices, volatile prices, and tobacco product and alcoholic beverage prices) declined slightly to 2.5 percent from 2.6 percent in November. In December, the average annual CPI inflation rate remained flat at the 4.6 percent level reported in November; calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, the average annual rate saw a slight pick-up to 4.1 percent from 4.0 percent in November. The revised data on 2018 Q3 economic growth confirm the step-up in the annual dynamics of real GDP to 4.4 percent from 4.1 percent in the previous quarter, solely on account of a much higher-than-expected agricultural production. On the demand side, the change in inventories made the largest contribution to GDP growth, ahead of household consumption with increased support from self-consumption and purchases on the agri-food market, whereas gross fixed capital formation had a negative contribution. The negative contribution of net exports to GDP dynamics expanded compared to the previous data, against the background of a more pronounced slowdown in the growth rate of exports of goods and services than in that of imports. Alongside the worsening of the primary and secondary income balances, this caused a substantial deepening of the current account deficit against the same year-ago period. The latest developments show a slight deceleration in the annual dynamics of industrial activity in October-November 2018 compared to Q3, down to 3 percent, while the construction sector reported a smaller contraction of -3.9 percent. At the same time, in 2018 Q4, the growth rate of retail purchases saw an upturn to 5.9 percent, lagging, however, behind the dynamics seen in the first half of the year. Furthermore, the trade balance posted a faster deterioration, contributing to the further widening of the current account deficit. The relevant interbank money market rates and their positive spread vis-Ã -vis the monetary policy rate re-entered a slightly upward path in mid-January 2019, while the EUR/RON exchange rate posted a more pronounced increase in the latter part of the month; in January as a whole, the leu weakened 1.1 percent versus the euro. The annual growth rate of credit to the private sector accelerated in December 2018 to 7.9 percent (the fastest rise since May 2012) from 6.3 percent in November. Behind the advance stood mainly the leu-denominated component, whose share in total private sector credit peaked at a 66 percent high since September 1996. However, the level of credit is further low relative to economic activity. In today's meeting, the NBR Board examined and approved the February 2019 Inflation Report, which incorporates the most recent data and information available. The new scenario of the projection reconfirms the prospects for the annual inflation rate to decline further during the next three quarters to values even slightly below the previously anticipated ones, before climbing and remaining slightly beneath the upper bound of the target band until the end of the forecast horizon. The uncertainties and risks related to the inflation outlook stem from the new set of fiscal and budgetary measures effective 1 January 2019, as well as from the still pending draft budget and hence from the future fiscal and income policy stance. Also important are the uncertainties surrounding the pace of euro area and global economic growth, the international oil price developments, the monetary policy stances of the ECB and of central banks in the region. In today's meeting, based on the currently available data and assessments, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided to keep the monetary policy rate at 2.50 percent per annum; moreover, the NBR Board decided to leave unchanged the deposit facility rate at 1.50 percent per annum and the lending (Lombard) facility rate at 3.50 percent per annum. In addition, the NBR Board decided to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board decisions aim to ensure and preserve price stability over the medium term in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth and amid safeguarding financial stability. The NBR Board underlines that the balanced macroeconomic policy mix and the implementation of structural reforms designed to foster the growth potential over the long term are of the essence in preserving a stable macroeconomic framework and strengthening the capacity of the Romanian economy to withstand potential adverse developments. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be presented to the public in a press conference on 11 February 2019, at 11:00 a.m. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR's website on 14 February 2019, at 3:00 p.m. The next monetary policy meeting of the NBR Board is scheduled for 2 April 2019."
Russia,2019-02-08,"On 8 February 2019, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to keep the key rate at 7.75% per annum. In January 2019, annual inflation held at the lower bound of the Bank of Russia expectations. Inflation expectations of households and businesses increased somewhat. The contribution of the VAT increase to annual consumer price growth in January was moderate. The effect of the VAT increase on inflation can be fully assessed no sooner than this April. There persists uncertainty over future external conditions and certain food price dynamics. The balance of risks remains skewed towards pro-inflationary risks, especially over a short-term horizon. Given the decision taken, the Bank of Russia forecasts annual inflation to range between 5.0 and 5.5% by the end of 2019 and return to 4% in the first half of 2020. In its key rate decision-making, the Bank of Russia will determine if the increases of the key rate in September and December 2018 were sufficient to bring annual inflation back to the target in 2020, taking into account inflation and economic performance against the forecast, as well as the risks associated with external conditions and financial markets' response to them. Inflation dynamics. In January 2019, annual inflation held at the lower bound of the Bank of Russia expectations. Annual consumer price growth rose to 5.0% in January (vs 4.3% in December 2018). The contribution of the VAT increase to annual consumer price growth in January was moderate. The effect of the VAT increase on inflation can be fully captured no sooner than this April. Faster growth of food prices to 5.5% (vs 4.7% in December 2018) played a significant role in the inflation rise in January. The acceleration of food inflation is substantively attributable to the recovery after its considerable drop in the second half of 2017 and the first half of 2018. Furthermore, prices are completing their adjustment to the ruble's weakening of the second half of 2018. Annual inflation of prices of non-food goods and services was below that of food prices during the last 12 months. In January, price expectations of businesses increased on the back of the earlier weakening of the ruble and the VAT increase. Household inflation expectations rose only slightly. According to the Bank of Russia forecast, the VAT increase and the 2018 weakening of the ruble will temporarily accelerate annual inflation, which will peak in the first half of 2019 and run at 5.0-5.5% by the end of 2019. Quarterly year-on-year consumer price growth is set to decelerate to 4% as early as the second half of 2019. Annual inflation will return to 4% in the first half of 2020 when the effects of the ruble's weakening and the VAT rise peter out. Monetary conditions. Monetary conditions have seen no significant changes since the last Board meeting. Interest rates in individual segments of the domestic financial market have showed mixed trends. OFZ yields have declined as external financial markets regained a stable footing. Interest rates in the deposit and credit market have risen slightly. Sustained positive real interest rates are set to support the attractiveness of bank deposits and bonds and balanced growth in consumption. Economic activity. Rosstat's flash estimate shows that 2018 GDP growth totalled 2.3%, which exceeds the Bank of Russia's forecast of 1.5-2%. However, recent months have seen slower growth in economic activity. December recorded a decline of growth rates in industrial production, construction volumes, real wages and retail sales. The Bank of Russia maintains its 2019 GDP growth forecast in the range of 1.2-1.7%. The VAT increase might have a slight constraining effect on business activity, mostly early in the year. The newly received budgetary funds will be used to raise government spending including investment as early as 2019. Subsequent years might see higher economic growth rates as the planned structural measures are implemented. Inflation risks. The balance of risks remains skewed towards pro-inflationary risks, especially over a short-term horizon, driven by the VAT increase and price movements in individual food products. Uncertainty remains over future external conditions and their impact on financial asset prices. Despite the oil price growth in January 2019, the risks of supply exceeding demand in the 2019 oil market remain high. The revisions of the expected paths of monetary policy tightening by the US Federal Reserve and other central banks in developed markets reduce the risks of persistent capital outflows from emerging markets. At the same time, geopolitical factors might lead to strengthened volatility in commodity and financial markets, affecting exchange rate and inflation expectations. The Bank of Russia leaves mostly unchanged its assessment of risks associated with wage movements, possible changes in consumer behaviour and budget expenditures. These risks remain moderate. In its key rate decision-making, the Bank of Russia will determine if the increases of the key rate in September and December 2018 were sufficient to bring annual inflation back to the target in 2020, taking into account inflation and economic performance against the forecast, as well as the risks associated with external conditions and financial markets' response to them. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next rate review meeting on 22 March 2019. The press release on the Bank of Russia Board decision is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time. The reference to the Press Service is mandatory if you intend to use this material."
Egypt,2019-02-14,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release February 14, 2019 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation by 100 basis points to 1575 percent, 1675 percent, and 1625 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also cut by 100 basis points to 1625 percen. Headline and core inflation rose to 127 percent and 86 percent in January 2019, respectively, due to unfavorable base effect. This comes after headline inflation declined to 120 percent in December 2018 due to the reversal of the transitory supply shock related to select vegetable. As a result, the CBE's first inflation target of 13 percent (Â±3 percent) for 2018 Q4 that was announced in May 2017 has been achieve. Real GDP growth increased slightly to 55 percent in 2018 Q4 from 53 percent in 2018 Q3, while the unemployment rate declined to 89 percent from 100 percent, registering its lowest level since December 201. Preliminary data for 2018 Q3 indicate that net external demand continued to support economic activity while private domestic demand remained containe. The expansion of global economic activity weakened, and the tightening of financial conditions eased, while trade tensions continued to weigh on the global outloo. International oil prices recently stabilized, yet remain subject to volatility due to potential supply-side factor. The Ministry of Finance is targeting to achieve a primary surplus of 20 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2018/19, up from a preliminary 01 percent in the previous year, and to maintain this surplus thereafte. Incoming data continued to confirm the moderation of underlying inflationary pressure. Accordingly the MPC decided to cut key policy rates by 100 basis point. This remains consistent with tight real monetary conditions and with achieving the inflation target of 9 percent (Â±3 percent) in 2020 Q4 and price stability over the medium ter. The MPC closely monitors all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust its stance to preserve monetary stabilit.

Peru,2019-02-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR FEBRUARY 2019 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 2.75% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 2.75 percent. This decision takes into account the following factors: In January, the YoY inflation rate and trend inflation indicators showed levels within the inflation target range; The expected YoY rate of inflation was 2.48 percent in January; Economic activity indicators continue showing signs of dynamism, even though the output level remains below its potential, and There are still risks in terms of global economic activity associated with commercial tensions, although lower volatility has been observed in international financial markets. The YoY inflation rate is projected to remain around 2.0 percent, within the target range. The Board considers that it is appropriate to maintain an expansionary policy stance while inflation expectations remain anchored in a context in which the level of economic activity is below its potential level. Recent indicators of inflation and activity reflect the following: Inflation in January showed a rate of 0.07 percent, as a result of which the YoY inflation rate decreased to 2.1 percent in January 2019. Moreover, inflation excluding food and energy prices recorded a rate of 0.05 percent, as a result of which the YoY rate was 2.4 percent in January. Indicators of business expectations remain on the optimistic side. Furthermore, indicators of economic activity continue pointing to a gradual closure of the output gap. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 1.50 percent. Direct security and currency repos and rediscount operations: 3.30 percent for the first 10 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 10 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 3.30 percent. The Monetary Program for the month of March will be approved on the Board meeting to be held on March 7, 2019."
Israel,2019-02-25,"The inflation environment remained near the lower bound of the target range. After the annual inflation rate declined below the target range in December, it returned above the lower bound in January, and in the coming months it is expected to hover near it. One-year expectations and forecasts from the various sources are around the lower bound of the target, while medium-term and long-term expectations increased slightly toward the midpoint of the target. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the economy returned to a growth rate that is in line with the long term pace, after slowing in the second and third quarters of 2018. Growth was driven by private consumption, while investment in residential construction has continued to contract for several quarters and goods exports remain sluggish. In recent months, the unemployment rate increased slightly, and the job vacancy rate declined, but the labor market remains tight and supports the assessment that the economy is in a full employment environment. In particular, wages continue to rise, led by the business sector and across all industries. The global macroeconomic picture continues to point to a decline in both the growth and inflation rates. The main risks include the slowdown in Europe, an escalation of the trade war, and Brexit. The IMF again revised its growth forecast downward for most regions, particularly Europe. Equity indices recovered, in light of the expected halt in the process of monetary contraction, and renewed optimism regarding US-China trade negotiations. Since the last interest rate decision, the shekel strengthened by 2 percent in nominal effective exchange rate terms. If the appreciation continues, it could delay the inflation rate's rise toward the midpoint of the target. The Committee assesses that the rising path of the interest rate in the future will be gradual and cautious, in a manner that supports a process at the end of which inflation will stabilizearound the midpoint of the target range, and that supports economic activity. The Bank of Israel continues to monitor developments in inflation, the real economy,the financial markets, and the global economy, and will act to attain the monetary policy targets in accordance with such developments. For the file of figures accompanying this notice, clickhere. The inflation environment is near the lower bound of the target range. The CPI for January declined by only 0.1 percent, a more moderate decrease than had been expected, and the inflation rate for the preceding 12 months returned to above the lower bound of the target, at 1.2 percent (Figure 1 in the attached file of figures), a level similar to that of recent months. The 12-month CPI excluding prices of energy, fruit and vegetables, and administrative price changes remains slightly lower (Figure 2). Inflation in nontradables, an approximation of the domestic component of inflation, continued to increase, reaching approximately 2 percent, while inflation in tradables continued to decline, and has turned negative in the past two months (Figure 3). In the coming months, inflation is expected to range around the lower bound ofthe target, and 1-year expectations and forecasts from the various sources are hovering around it (Figure 4). Since the previous interest rate decision, medium-term and long-term expectations have increased slightly toward the midpoint of the target (Figure 5). The shekel appreciated by approximately 2 percentin nominal effective exchange rate terms since the previous interest rate decision (Figure 6). Equityindices in Israel have increased significantly since the last interest rate decision, after marked declines in the final two months of 2018 (Figure 7), in line with major equity indices worldwide (Figure 25). However, government bond yields declined more sharply than those in Europe and in the US (Figure 8). The yield spreads between corporate bonds and comparable government bonds narrowed slightly (Figure 9). Based on the initial estimate of National Accounts data by the Central Bureau of Statistics, the economy returned to growth in the fourth quarter of 2018 at a pace in line with the long-term rate, following slower growth in the second and third quarters of 2018 (Figure 12). GDP grew by 3.1 percent (in annual terms), with the growth driven by private consumption. There wasan increase in investment in most of the principal industries, except for investment in residential construction that continued to decline, and exports (excluding diamonds and startups) grew due to exports of services, while exports of goods remained sluggish (Figure 14). Labor market data indicate that it remains tight: the unemployment rate remains low, the employment rate is stable at a record high level (Figure 15), and wages continue to rise across all industries, led by the business sector (Figures 16 and 17). These factors support the assessment that the economy is in a full employment environment. The growth in imports also indicates that the supply constraint is limiting growth. Although in recent months the unemployment rate increased slightly and the job vacancy rate declined somewhat, it is too early to determine whether these point to the beginning of a change in trend. Home prices declined by 1.4 percent in 2018, even though the most recent monthly figure showed an increase of 0.2 percent (Figure 10). The number of transactions continued to increase, particularly among first-time home buyers, notwithstanding the prolonged decline in the scope of residential construction. Mortgage volume continues to expand, and mortgage interest rates continue to rise moderately (Figure 11). The global macroeconomic picture continues to indicate a decline in both the growth and inflation rates. The main risks include a slowdown in Europe, an escalation of the trade war, and Brexit. The IMF revised its growth forecast downward again for most regions, particularly for Europe (Figure 18). The moderation in world trade continues, led by advanced economies (Figure 19). However, the IMF kept its 2019 world trade growth forecast unchanged and slightly reduced its 2020 forecast. Equity indices recovered (Figure 20), in light of the change in tone at central banks, the expected halt in the process of monetary contraction, and renewed optimism regarding US-China trade negotiations. Government bond yields declined worldwide, led by Europe. In the US, growthdata for the fourth quarter of 2018 were not published due to the partial government shutdown, but indicators point to slower growth in that quarter and in the first quarter of 2019. Retail sales declined sharply, stemming in part fromthe deferral of US federal government workers' salaries. In Europe, economic activity continues to lose momentum and sentiment indices continue to weaken. Germany and Italy are notably weak, with the latter slipping into a recession. In the UK, fourth quarter 2018 growth declined because investments decreased sharply in view of Brexit. In Japan, there was slight growth in the fourth quarter,driven by domestic demand, a partial correction to the contraction in the third quarter. Emerging markets are relatively stable, helped by the decline in risks of further monetary tightening worldwide. Growth in China continued to weaken and PMI indices also point to weakness in manufacturing. Oil prices increased due to a decline in OPEC output, after prices declined sharply since October 2018 against the background of growth in global supply (Figure 23).. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on March 11, 2019. The next decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Monday. April 8, 2019, following which the Governor will hold a press briefing."
South Korea,2019-02-28,"Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.75% for the intermeeting period. This press release is the English version of the Bank of Korea's policy statement. In the case of any inconsistency, the original version in Korean will prevail. The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.75% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Board considers that the pace of global economic growth has continued to slow somewhat. Volatility in the global financial markets has continued the trend of decrease seen last month, as expectations of an adjustment to the Federal Reserve's pace of monetary policy normalization and of progress in the US-China trade negotiations have heightened. Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and the global financial markets as likely to be affected by factors such as the degree of the spread of trade protectionism, the paces of monetary policy normalization in major countries, and the uncertainties concerning Brexit. The Board judges that the domestic economy has sustained a rate of growth not diverging significantly from its potential level, as consumption has continued to grow modestly, although the adjustments in facilities and construction investment have continued and export growth has slowed. Employment conditions have been sluggish, with the number of persons employed having increased only slightly. Going forward the Board expects domestic economic growth to be generally consistent with the path projected in January. Consumption will continue to grow, while exports and facilities investment will also recover gradually toward the second half of this year, although the adjustment in construction investment will continue. Consumer price inflation has slowed to the upper-0% range, in consequence mainly of declines in the prices of petroleum products and reductions in the extents of increase in agricultural, livestock and fisheries product prices. Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has been at the 1% level, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has been in the low- to mid-2% range. Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will fluctuate for some time below 1%, slightly lower than the path projected in January, and then run at the mid-1% level from the second half of this year. Core inflation will also gradually rise. The domestic financial markets have been stable. Stock prices have risen mainly on expectations of an easing of the US-China trade dispute. Long-term market interest rates and the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate have fluctuated within narrow ranges. The rate of increase in household lending has continued to slow, while housing prices have fallen slightly. Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As it is forecast that inflationary pressures on the demand side will not be high for the time being, and that the domestic economy will sustain a rate of growth that does not diverge significantly from its potential level, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance. In this process it will judge whether to adjust the degree of monetary policy accommodation further, while closely checking future economic growth and inflation trends. It will also carefully monitor conditions related to trade with major countries, any changes in the monetary policies of major countries, financial and economic conditions in emerging market economies, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks."
Kazakhstan,2019-03-04,"– 7 The base rate remains unchanged at 9.25% March 4, 2019 Almaty The National Bank of Kazakhstan has made a decision to maintain the base rate at 9.25% with the corridor of +/-1 percentage points. The annual inflation continued to decline in February and formed just below the midpoint of the target range. Nevertheless, the risk of accelerating inflationary background persists, in part because of the unbalanced dynamics of inflation components. The risks of the worsening external environment taken into account in the previous revision of the base rate did not realize. According to the assessment of the National Bank, the probability of their realization further on has diminished. The current level of the base rate facilitates the achievement of the target for inflation in 2019. In January and February 2019 annual inflation slowed down to 5.2% and 4.8% respectively. However, the nature of this decline is not stable. This is reflected in the multidirectional dynamic of the core components of the consumer price index. The inflation of food commodities accelerated noticeably (from 5.1% in December 2018 to 6.6% in February 2019) with regards to all categories of goods, except for the fruits and vegetables. A decline in the price of paid services in the first two months of the year (by 0.2% and 1.3% respectively) was due to the enhanced administrative measures to reduce tariffs for natural monopolies' services. This resulted in the reduction in the annual change of services' component of the consumer price index from 4.5% to 1.3% from the beginning of the year. The inflation of non- food products continued to slow down, reaching 6.2% in annual terms in February. The cost component has decelerated significantly. Prices in manufacturing slowed down to 7.7% in annual terms at the end of February (in comparison to 24.6% 6 months ago). The annual price growth in the manufacturing of consumer goods amounted to 1.8%. Inflation expectations are gradually reducing after a surge in Autumn 2018. In January, values of expected inflation 12 months ahead declined to 4.7%, which is the minimum value since the beginning of the questionnaire. The proportion of respondents that expect inflation acceleration fell to 17.2% in comparison to the historical maximum of 28.2% in October 2018, whereas the proportion of responders expecting a deceleration of inflation reached its maximum value in the past 12 months  27.4%. The output gap is estimated to be positive, but its low level constrains the inflationary pressure. Moreover, the growth of economic activity has slowed down this year. The short- term economic indicator amounted to 2.9% in annual terms in January 2019 (4.7% at the end of 2018). A positive contribution to the growth was provided by the mining industry (6.8%), transport (3.7%), trade (7.5%), and agriculture (3.5%). An increase in household consumption that was reinforced by the growing real money income (growth by 3.2% in December 2018 in annual terms) is observed, as well as a recovery in consumer lending (growth by 14% in annual terms in January). A strengthening tendency of consumer demand growth is expected due to the fiscal stimulus. Nevertheless, an impact on inflation is not estimated as strong. Therefore, it does not require an immediate reaction on the part of monetary policy. Concerns related to the significant deterioration of the external environment, which were taken into account during the previous revision of the base rate in January this year did not materialize and a probability of risk realization has declined. Brent oil price is forming above $ 65 per barrel (in comparison to the price under $55 per barrel in the second half of December 2018). In January the FAO Food Price Index was 2.2% below the corresponding month last year, regardless of a rise in international price indices for dairy products and cereal. Nevertheless, inflationary risks originating from several external factors continue to exist. The inflation in the countries - main trading partners reflects multidirectional tendencies. In January the annual inflation in Russia accelerated to 5.0%, whereas in China and the European Union it decelerated to 1.7% and 1.5% respectively. Due to the decision made current monetary conditions remain neutral. Real market interest rates are kept at the level sufficient for achieving the target for inflation and, at the same time, facilitating the economic growth at potential levels. In the absence of shocks, the annual inflation will continue to form along the upper boundary of the target range of 4-6% in 2019. The next decision on the base rate will be announced on April 15, 2019, at 17:00 Astana time.

Malaysia,2019-03-05,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.25 percent. Global growth momentum is showing signs of moderation amid slowing growth in most major advanced and emerging economies. Going forward, unresolved trade tensions remain a key source of risk, affecting global trade and investment activities. Tighter global financial conditions and elevated political and policy uncertainty could lead to financial market adjustments, further weighing on the overall outlook. The Malaysian economy grew at a more moderate pace of 4.7% in 2018. Looking ahead, growth is expected to be sustained in 2019 with continued support from private sector spending. Stable labour market conditions and capacity expansion in key sectors will continue to drive household and capital spending. Support from the external sector is expected to soften, in tandem with the moderating global growth momentum. On balance, the baseline forecast is for the Malaysian economy to remain on a steady growth path. However, materialisation of downside risks from unresolved trade tensions, heightened uncertainties in the global and domestic environment, and prolonged weakness in the commodity-related sectors could further weigh on growth. Headline inflation in January 2019 was at -0.7%, due mainly to negative transport inflation at -7.8% arising from lower global oil prices. Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation[1] remained stable at 1.5% in January 2019 reflecting sustained demand conditions. In the immediate term, inflation is expected to remain low mainly due to policy measures. These include the lower price ceiling on domestic retail fuel prices until mid-2019 and the impact of the changes in consumption tax policy on headline inflation. For 2019 as a whole, average headline inflation is expected to be broadly stable compared to 2018. The trajectory of headline inflation will continue to be dependent on global oil prices. Underlying inflation is expected to be sustained, supported by the steady expansion in economic activity and in the absence of strong demand pressures. At the current level of the OPR, the degree of monetary accommodativeness is consistent with the intended policy stance. Recognising that there are downside risks in the economic and financial environment, the MPC will continue to monitor and assess the balance of risks surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation. [1] Core inflation is computed by excluding price-volatile and price-administered items. It also excludes the estimated direct impact of tax policy changes. Bank Negara Malaysia 05 March 2019."
Poland,2019-03-06,"Warsaw, 6 March 2019 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 5-6 March 2019 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates: â–ª reference rate at 1.50%; â–ª lombard rate at 2.50%; â–ª deposit rate at 0.50%; â–ª rediscount rate at 1.75%. Incoming data suggest a weakening in some of the largest economies, amid heightened uncertainty about the outlook for global economic activity in the coming quarters. In the euro area. GDP growth in 2018 Q4 was lower than in the first half of 2018, while available forecasts suggest a further weakening in 2019. In the United States, economic conditions remain good, although a slight slowdown in GDP growth is expected there. In China activity growth continues to gradually decline. Despite an increase in global oil prices at the beginning of 2019, their level is still lower than in 2018 Q3. This is leading to a decline in inflation in many countries. Alongside that, core inflation in the environment of the Polish economy, including the euro area, remains low. The European Central Bank keeps interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero. At the same time, the ECB continues to reinvest the funds from the maturing securities. The US Federal Reserve is keeping interest rates unchanged. In Poland. GDP growth in 2018 Q4 remained relatively high. GDP growth is driven by rising consumption  albeit at a slightly lower rate than in previous quarters  that is fuelled by increasing employment and wages as well as very high consumer sentiment. This was accompanied by a rise in investment. Notwithstanding relatively high economic growth and wages rising faster than in the previous years, annual consumer price growth has declined in recent months and is running at a low level. Inflation net of food and energy prices continues to be low, despite possible increase in January. The Council became acquainted with the results of the March projection of inflation and GDP, prepared under the assumption of unchanged NBP interest rates. The March projection takes into account data and information published up to 15 February 2019  including information on statutory freeze on electricity prices  as well as preliminary information on changes in fiscal policy announced on 23 February 2019. In line with the March projection based on the NECMOD model, there is a 50-percent probability that the annual price growth will be in the range of 1.2-2.2% in 2019 (against 2.6-3.9% in the November 2018 projection), 1.7-3.6% in 2020 (compared to 1.9-3.9%) and 1.3-3.5% in 2021. At the same time, the annual GDP growth  according to this projection  will be 1/2 with a 50-percent probability in the range of 3.3-4.7% in 2019 (against 2.7-4.4% in the November 2018 projection), 2.7-4.6% in 2020 (compared to 2.3-4.2%) and 2.4-4.3% in 2021. In the Council's assessment, the outlook for economic conditions in Poland remains favourable. However, in the quarters to come, there will probably be a gradual slowdown in GDP growth. At the same time, inflation will remain at a moderate level and, in the monetary policy transmission horizon, will stay close to the target. Such an assessment is supported by the results of the March projection of inflation and GDP. The Council judges that the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability. The Council adopted the Inflation Report  March 2019."
Turkiye,2019-03-06,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 24 percent. Recently released data show that rebalancing trend in the economy has become more noticeable. External demand maintains its relative strength while economic activity displays a slow pace, partly due to tight financial conditions. Current account balance is expected to maintain its improving trend. Developments in import prices and domestic demand conditions have led to some improvement in inflation indicators. Yet, risks on price stability continue to prevail. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to maintain the tight monetary policy stance until inflation outlook displays a significant improvement. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior, lagged impact of recent monetary policy decisions, contribution of fiscal policy to rebalancing process, and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Euroarea,2019-03-07,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Vice-President. Mr Dombrovskis. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we have conducted a thorough assessment of the economic and inflation outlook, also taking into account the latest staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. As a result, the Governing Council took the following decisions in the pursuit of its price stability objective. First, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We now expect them to remain at their present levels at least through the end of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Second, we intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. Third, we decided to launch a new series of quarterly targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO-III), starting in September 2019 and ending in March 2021, each with a maturity of two years. These new operations will help to preserve favourable bank lending conditions and the smooth transmission of monetary policy. Under TLTRO-III, counterparties will be entitled to borrow up to 30% of the stock of eligible loans as at 28 February 2019 at a rate indexed to the interest rate on the main refinancing operations over the life of each operation. Like the outstanding TLTRO programme. TLTRO-III will feature built-in incentives for credit conditions to remain favourable. Further details on the precise terms of TLTRO-III will be communicated in due course. Fourth, we will continue conducting our lending operations as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of the reserve maintenance period starting in March 2021. Today's monetary policy decisions were taken to ensure that inflation remains on a sustained path towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. While there are signs that some of the idiosyncratic domestic factors dampening growth are starting to fade, the weakening in economic data points to a sizeable moderation in the pace of the economic expansion that will extend into the current year. The persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors, the threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets appears to be leaving marks on economic sentiment. The weaker economic momentum is slowing the adjustment of inflation towards our aim. At the same time, supportive financing conditions, favourable labour market dynamics and rising wage growth continue to underpin the euro area expansion and gradually rising inflation pressures. Today's decisions will support the further build-up of domestic price pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term. Significant monetary policy stimulus will continue to be provided by our forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates, reinforced by the reinvestments of the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the new series of TLTROs. In any event, the Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation continues to move towards the Governing Council's inflation aim in a sustained manner. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro area real GDP increased by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the fourth quarter of 2018, following growth of 0.1% in the third quarter. Incoming data have continued to be weak, in particular in the manufacturing sector, reflecting the slowdown in external demand compounded by some country and sector-specific factors. The impact of these factors is turning out to be somewhat longer-lasting, which suggests that the near-term growth outlook will be weaker than previously anticipated. Looking ahead, the effect of these adverse factors is expected to unwind. The euro area expansion will continue to be supported by favourable financing conditions, further employment gains and rising wages, and the ongoing  albeit somewhat slower  expansion in global activity. This assessment is broadly reflected in the March 2019 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. These projections foresee annual real GDP increasing by 1.1% in 2019, 1.6% in 2020 and 1.5% in 2021. Compared with the December 2018 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real GDP growth has been revised down substantially in 2019 and slightly in 2020. The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook are still tilted to the downside, on account of the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors, the threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.5% in February 2019, after 1.4% in January, reflecting somewhat higher energy and food price inflation. On the basis of current futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to remain at around current levels before declining towards the end of year. Measures of underlying inflation remain generally muted, but labour cost pressures have strengthened and broadened amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets. Looking ahead, underlying inflation is expected to increase over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion and rising wage growth. This assessment is also broadly reflected in the March 2019 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation at 1.2% in 2019, 1.5% in 2020 and 1.6% in 2021. Compared with the December 2018 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for HICP inflation has been revised down across the projection horizon, reflecting in particular the more subdued near-term growth outlook. Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth decreased to 3.8% in January 2019, from 4.1% in December 2018. M3 growth continues to be backed by bank credit creation, notwithstanding a recent moderation in credit dynamics. The narrow monetary aggregate M1 remained the main contributor to broad money growth. The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations declined to 3.3% in January 2019, from 3.9% in December 2018, reflecting a base effect but also, in some countries, the typical lagged reaction to the slowdown in economic activity, while the annual growth rate of loans to households remained at 3.2%. Borrowing conditions for firms and households are still favourable, as the monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014 continue to support access to financing, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises. The policy measures decided today, and in particular the new series of TLTROs, will help to ensure that bank lending conditions remain favourable going forward. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is still necessary for the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute more decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential and reducing vulnerabilities. The implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up to increase resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost euro area productivity and growth potential. This is particularly important in view of the overall limited implementation of the 2018 country-specific recommendations, as recently communicated by the European Commission. Regarding fiscal policies, the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance and the operation of automatic stabilisers are providing support to economic activity. At the same time, countries where government debt is high need to continue rebuilding fiscal buffers. All countries should continue to increase efforts to achieve a more growth-friendly composition of public finances. Likewise, the transparent and consistent implementation of the European Union's fiscal and economic governance framework over time and across countries remains essential to bolster the resilience of the euro area economy. Improving the functioning of Economic and Monetary Union remains a priority. The Governing Council welcomes the ongoing work and urges further specific and decisive steps to complete the banking union and the capital markets union."
Peru,2019-03-07,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR MARCH 2019 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 2.75% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 2.75 percent. This decision takes into account the following factors: In February, the YoY inflation rate and trend inflation indicators showed levels within the inflation target range; The expected YoY rate of inflation decreased to 2.40 percent in February; Indicators of non-primary economic activity continue showing signs of dynamism, even though the output level remains below its potential, and There are still risks in terms of global economic activity, although lower volatility has been observed in international financial markets. The YoY inflation rate is expected to remain around 2.0 percent, within the target range. The Board considers that it is appropriate to maintain an expansionary policy stance while inflation expectations remain anchored in a context in which the level of economic activity is below its potential level. Recent indicators of inflation and activity reflect the following: Inflation in February showed a rate of 0.13 percent, as a result of which the YoY inflation rate decreased to 2.0 percent in February 2019. Moreover, inflation excluding food and energy prices recorded a rate of 0.12 percent, as a result of which the YoY rate was 2.4 percent in February. Indicators of business expectations remain on the optimistic side. Furthermore, indicators of non-primary economic activity continue pointing to a gradual closure of the output gap. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 1.50 percent. Direct security and currency repos and rediscount operations: 3.30 percent for the first 10 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 10 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 3.30 percent. The Monetary Program for the month of April will be approved on the Board meeting to be held on April 11, 2019."
Georgia,2019-03-13,"13.03.2019 The National Bank of Georgia cuts the monetary policy rate by 0.25 percentage points to 6.5% The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on March 13 and decided to cut the refinancing rate by 25 basis points. Currently, the policy rate stands at 6.5 percent. According to forecasts, since the beginning of the year, similarly to 2018, the inflation will remain within the target level of 3 percent. The annual inflation was equal to 2.3 percent in February. According to the current forecast, other things equal the inflation will fluctuate around the target rate in the medium term. Along with the weakening of external risks the National Bank continued the gradual exit from moderately tightened monetary policy, which started in July 2018. According to the leading economic growth indicators the demand-side inflation pressure is still weak, as are the macroeconomic risks coming from the external sector. Hence the MPC decided to cut the policy rate. Further easing of the moderately tight monetary policy will depend on how fast the output gap will close. The positive trends in the external sector have been maintained in the beginning of 2019. The goods export continues growing at a high rate, whereas the import growth is modest, resulting in the improvement of the current accound deficit. In the first months of the year the retail lending has somewhat slowed down, however the business lending is on the up. In order to mitigate possible future financial stability risks, the Monetary Policy Committee decided to increase the minimum reserve requirements for funds attracted in foreign currency by 5 percentage points. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all means and instruments at its disposal in order to ensure the price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on May 1, 2019."
Ukraine,2019-03-14,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) has decided to keep its key policy rate at 18.0% per annum. The tight monetary conditions continue to be an important prerequisite for gradually reducing inflation to the 5% target in 2020. Inflation continued to decelerate in the early months of 2019, effectively staying on the trajectory the NBU predicted in its January 2019 Inflation Report. By the end of February, inflation had declined to 8.8% yoy, with core inflation down to 7.8% yoy, signifying that the underlying inflationary pressure is easing off as anticipated. The NBU's tight monetary policy contributed to the lower inflation, including by being one of the reasons for the strengthening of the hryvnia. The stronger hryvnia affected the prices of imported goods and goods that have a substantial import content, which along with other factors brought core inflation down. In addition, the consistency of the monetary policy, which aims to tackle inflation, and the FX market conditions contributed to the gradual improvement of inflation expectations. This raises interest rates in real terms* and thus ensures tight monetary conditions necessary to reduce inflation. In January the NBU projected that inflation will decelerate to 6.3% in 2019 and return to the target range of 5% Â± 1 pp early next year. The January forecast still holds although new factors emerged since the NBU Board last met to discuss monetary policy. On the one hand, increases in social payments, as well as the monetization of utility subsidies are planned for the coming months. Although the effects of these individual factors are insignificant, their combined impact on inflation expectations could be substantial, on the back of greater uncertainty arising from the presidential and parliamentary elections. On the other hand, a more noticeable strengthening in the hryvnia exchange rate than is envisaged in the current forecast, is helping curb inflation. That said, the risk that inflation may not decrease mentioned by the NBU in its January macroeconomic forecast continues to persist. After balancing the need to bring inflation back to its target against the risks that could prevent inflation from decreasing, the NBU Board decided to leave the key policy rate unchanged, at 18.0% per annum. Although leaving the key policy rate unchanged, the NBU Board said that it could cut it in the future. How soon the NBU will adopt an easing cycle will depend on how steadily risks of inflation decrease and inflation expectations improve. Looking ahead, any changes to the key policy rate will be based on the NBU's updated macroeconomic forecast that will be published in April. The decision to keep the key policy rate at 18.0% was approved by NBU Board Policy Rate Decision No., dated 14 March 2019. A summary of the discussion by Monetary Policy Committee members that preceded this decision will be published on 25 March 2019. The next meeting of the NBU Board on monetary policy issues will be held on 25 April 2019 as scheduled."
Brazil,2019-03-20,"The Copom unanimously decided to maintain the Selic rate at 6.50% p.a. The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario:. Recent data on economic activity came in below expectations. Nevertheless, the Brazilian economy remains on a gradual recovery path. The global outlook remains challenging. On the one hand, the risks associated with normalization of interest rates in some advanced economies have receded since the previous Copom meeting. On the other hand, the risks associated with a slowdown in global growth, as a result of several uncertainties, are more elevated. The Committee judges that various measures of underlying inflation are running at appropriate or comfortable levels. This includes the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy. Inflation expectations for 2019, 2020 and 2021 collected by the Focus survey are around 3.9%, 4.0% and 3.75%, respectively; and. The Copom's inflation projections in the scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the Focus survey stand around 3.9% for 2019 and 3.8% for 2020. This scenario assumes a path for the Selic rate that ends 2019 at 6.5% p.a. and increases to 7.75% p.a. over the course of 2020. It also assumes a path for the exchange rate that ends 2019 at R$/US$ 3.70, and 2020 at R$/US$ 3.75. In the scenario with a constant interest rate, at 6.5% p.a., and a constant exchange rate, at R$/US$ 3.85*, the projections for 2019 and 2020 stand around 4.1% and 4.0%, respectively. The Committee emphasizes that risks around its baseline scenario remain in both directions. On the one hand, the high level of economic slack may lead to a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory. On the other hand, frustration of expectations regarding the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy may affect risk premia and increase the path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy. Risk intensifies in case the global outlook for emerging economies deteriorates. The Committee judges that the balance of risks is symmetric. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the wide array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to maintain the Selic rate at 6.50% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation and the associated balance of risks, and is consistent with convergence of inflation to target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, which includes 2019 and, with gradually increasing weight, 2020. The Copom reiterates that economic conditions prescribe stimulative monetary policy, i.e., interest rates below the structural level. The Copom emphasizes that the evolution of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy is essential to maintain low inflation in the medium and long run, for the reduction of its structural interest rate, and for sustainable economic recovery. The Committee stresses that the perception of continuation of the reform agenda affects current expectations and macroeconomic projections. In the Copom's assessment, the evolution of the baseline scenario and of the balance of risks prescribes keeping the Selic rate at its current level. The Committee deems important to observe how the Brazilian economy will behave over time, with lower uncertainty and without the effects of the various shocks that hit the economy last year. The Copom judges that this assessment takes time and should not be completed in the short run. The Copom emphasizes that the next steps in the conduct of monetary policy will continue to depend on the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, and on inflation projections and expectations. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Roberto Oliveira Campos Neto (Governor). Bruno Serra Fernandes. Carlos Viana de Carvalho. Carolina de Assis Barros. Joao Manoel Pinho de Mello. Mauricio Costa de Moura. Otavio Ribeiro Damaso. Paulo Srgio Neves de Souza, and Tiago Couto Berriel. *Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average R$/US$ exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the Friday prior to the Copom meeting."
Philippines,2019-03-20,"At its meeting on monetary policy today, the Monetary Board decided to keep the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) facility unchanged at 4.75 percent. The interest rates on the overnight lending and deposit facilities were likewise held steady. The Monetary Board's decision is based on its assessment that prevailing monetary policy settings remain appropriate. Latest baseline inflation forecasts show inflation settling within the target range of 3.0 percent Â± 1.0 percentage point for both 2019 and 2020, while inflation expectations continue to stabilize within the target band. Inflation pressures have eased further since the previous monetary policy meeting, reflecting mainly the decline in food prices amid improved supply conditions. Meanwhile, the Monetary Board observed that overall prospects for domestic activity continue to be firm, supported by a projected recovery in household spending and the continued implementation of the government's infrastructure program. However, there are risks to economic growth in 2019 if the current budget impasse in Congress is not resolved soon. The Monetary Board also noted that the risks to the inflation outlook remained broadly balanced for 2019 even as it observed that further risks could emerge from prolonged El NiÃ±o and higher-than-expected increases in global oil and food prices. For 2020, the risks lean toward the downside as tighter global financial conditions and geopolitical risks temper global economic activity and potential upward pressures on commodity prices. Given these considerations, the Monetary Board is of the view that the within-target inflation outlook and firm domestic growth support keeping monetary policy settings steady at this time. Looking ahead, the BSP will continue to monitor developments affecting the inflation outlook to ensure that the monetary policy stance remains consistent with its price stability objective."
Thailand,2019-03-20,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 2/2019 Mr. Titanun Mallikamas. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 20 March 2019 as follows. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 175 percent. In deliberating their policy decision, the Committee assessed that the Thai economy would expand around its potential despite at a slower pace than previously assessed due to a slowdown in external demand. Nevertheless domestic demand would continue to gain traction. Headline inflation projection was in line with the previous forecast, while core inflation would be slightly lower than previously assessed. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative and conducive to economic growth. However there were risks to financial stability in the future that warranted continued monitoring. The Committee viewed that the current accommodative monetary policy stance had contributed to the continuation of economic growth and was appropriate given the inflation target. In addition, given heightened global and domestic uncertainties in the current period, the Committee thus voted to keep the policy rate unchanged at this meeting to assess the clarity of impacts from such uncertainties. Despite a slight downward revision to economic projection, the Thai economy as a whole was expected to continue expanding around its potential on the back of domestic demand. Private consumption was expected to continue expanding on the back of increasingly broad-based improvements in both farm and non-farm income with additional supports from government measures. Nevertheless private consumption was restrained by elevated household debt. Private investment was projected to continue expanding thanks to the relocation of production base to Thailand, public-private partnership projects for infrastructure investment, and favourable business sentiment. Meanwhile merchandise exports grew at a slower pace than previously assessed due to the global economic slowdown, a down cycle of electronic products as well as impacts from trade protectionism measures between the US and China. Tourism continued to gain traction. Public expenditure, both consumption and investment, would grow at a slower pace than previously assessed, which was partly due to delay in some state-owned enterprise investment projects. The Committee would monitor external risks from both trade protectionism measures between the US and China, as well as economic outlooks of China and advanced economies, which could affect domestic demand. Furthermore the Committee would monitor the progress of major infrastructure investment and private investment, which could affect momentum of economic growth in the period ahead. The annual average of headline inflation would be largely unchanged from the previous projection. This was attributable to higher energy prices relative to the assessment in the previous meeting. In addition, fresh food prices increased as excess supply alleviated and the drought condition intensified, which offset effects of lower core inflation compared to the previous assessment. The Committee viewed that structural changes contributed to more persistent inflation than in the past. Such changes included the expansion of e-commerce, rising price competition, and technological development which reduced costs of production. Financial conditions over the previous period had been accommodative and conducive to economic growth, with ample liquidity in the financial system. Real interest rates remained at a low level, allowing financing by the private sector to continue expanding. Loans extended to businesses and consumers continued to grow. With regard to exchange rates, the Thai baht depreciated against the US dollar in the intermeeting period in line with regional currencies. Looking ahead, the baht would likely remain volatile due to both domestic and external uncertainties, and thus the Committee would continue to closely monitor exchange rate developments as well as their impacts on the economy. Financial stability remained sound overall but there remained a need to monitor risks that might pose vulnerabilities to financial stability in the future. The Committee viewed that the implemented macroprudential measures and the increased policy rate would to some extent help curb accumulation of vulnerabilities in the financial system from the search-for-yield behavior in the low interest rate environment that might lead to underpricing of risks. Nevertheless developments in the mortgage loan market, adjustments in the real estate sector, growth in assets held by saving cooperatives, rising household debt, as well as debt accumulation by large corporates that could lead to underpricing of risks still warranted monitoring. In the following period, there remained a need to address financial stability risks through a combination of tools, including the appropriate policy interest rate as well as microprudential and macroprudential measures. Looking ahead, the Thai economy was projected to continue to gain traction although the external demand momentum might slow down. The Committee viewed that current accommodative monetary policy stance would remain appropriate and would continue to monitor developments of economic growth, inflation, and financial stability, together with associated risks, in deliberating appropriate monetary policy in the period ahead."
United States,2019-03-20,"EDT March 20, 2019 Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January indicates that the labor market remains strong but that growth of economic activity has slowed from its solid rate in the fourth quarter. Payroll employment was little changed in February, but job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Recent indicators point to slower growth of household spending and business fixed investment in the first quarter. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation has declined, largely as a result of lower energy prices; inflation for items other than food and energy remains near 2 percent. On balance, market-based measures of inflation compensation have remained low in recent months, and survey- based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent. The Committee continues to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes. In light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including (more) For release at 2 p.m. EDT March 20, 2019 - 2 - measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.

Colombia,2019-03-22,"Enlace 2. The Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica, in its meeting today, unanimously decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 4.25%. The Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica, in its meeting today, unanimously decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 4.25%. For this decision, the Board mainly took into account the following aspects. In February, yearly consumer inflation and the average of core inflation indicators decreased, reaching 3.01% and 2.81%, respectively. Inflation expectations lowered, but they are still somewhat above 3.0%. Analysts' expectations and those derived from those embedded in public debt bonds to horizons greater than or equal to one year are between 3.0% and 3.5%. Global growth prospects continue moderating. The Federal Reserve kept its benchmark interest rate unaltered, and for the remainder of 2019 no changes are expected. So far in 2019, the international price of oil increased, but remained below the average observed in 2018. In the same period, country risk premia lowered, and the peso appreciated vis--vis the US dollar. GDP growth in the last quarter of 2018 (2.9%) was somewhat higher than anticipated, due to a better performance of domestic demand. The new figures of economic activity for the first quarter of 2019 suggest that the economy would grow to a faster pace than at the end of 2018. For 2019, the technical staff of the Central Bank forecasts a most likely growth figure of 3.5%, and estimates that the spare capacity of the economy will continue to decline. In 2018, the current account deficit was slightly wider than had been estimated, and it is expected to increase in 2019. This takes place in an environment of greater increase of domestic demand and more favorable external financial conditions. Based on this information, the Board considered the following factors for its decision. The existence of spare capacity and the uncertainty about the pace at which it will reduce. Observed inflation is on the target, and the risks associated with future deviations from it. The current moderately expansionary monetary policy stance. The effects of the changing external conditions on the country's economy. In this environment, upon assessing the economic situation and the risk balance, the Board deemed appropriate to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 4.25%. The Board will continue to carefully monitor the behavior of inflation and the forecasts for economic activity and inflation in the country, as well as the international context. Finally, the Board reiterates that the monetary policy will depend on the availability of new information. The decision to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 4.25% was approved unanimously by the Board. Bogot. Fecha de publicacion."
Russia,2019-03-22,"On 22 March 2019, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to keep the key rate at 7.75% per annum. In February-March 2019, inflation is holding somewhat lower than the Bank of Russia's expectations. Despite the fact that inflation expectations of households and businesses notably declined in February and March, they remain elevated. The contribution of the VAT increase to annual consumer price growth has largely materialised. However, deferred effects may manifest themselves in the months to come. Short-term pro-inflationary risks have abated. In view of the above, the Bank of Russia has lowered its end-of-year annual inflation forecast in 2019 from 5.0-5.5% to 4.7-5.2% and expects inflation to return to 4% in the first half of 2020. In its key rate decision-making, the Bank of Russia will take into account inflation and economic dynamics against the forecast, as well as risks posed by external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia admits the possibility of turning to cutting the key rate in 2019. Inflation dynamics. In Februaryâ€”March 2019, annual inflation is holding lower than the Bank of Russia's expectations. In February, annual consumer price growth rate rose to 5.2% (vs 5.0% in January 2019). As of 18 March, annual inflation was 5.3%. The VAT increase pass-through to prices has largely materialised. Its contribution to annual inflation was around 0.6-0.7 pp, which corresponds to the lower bound of the Bank of Russia expectations range. Certain deferred effects of the VAT hike may manifest themselves in the months to come. An accurate assessment of the VAT increase effect on inflation can be made in the second quarter of the current year. Faster growth of food prices to 5.9% (vs 5.5% in January 2019) played a significant role in the inflation rise in February. Accelerating food inflation is largely bouncing back after a considerable drop in the second half of 2017 and the first half of 2018. Accordingly, the low base effect of food prices noticeably contributes to the annual consumer price index growth rate. Prices of non-food goods and services rose less than food prices over the past 12 months. The acceleration of annual inflation was curbed by consumer demand and income dynamics, ruble appreciation, the decline in prices of principal types of motor fuel and certain food products in February vs January. Inflation was also held back by the Bank of Russia's September and December 2018 pre-emptive decisions to increase the key rate. Despite the fact that inflation expectations of households and businesses notably declined in February and March, they remain elevated. According to the Bank of Russia's forecast, annual inflation will pass its local peak in Marchâ€”April 2019. That said, the Bank of Russia has lowered its end-of-year annual inflation forecast in 2019 from 5.0-5.5% to 4.7-5.2%. Quarterly year-on-year consumer price growth is set to decelerate to 4% as early as the second half of 2019. Annual inflation will return to 4% in the first half of 2020 when the effects of ruble's weakening in 2018 and the VAT rise peter out. Monetary conditions. Since the beginning of this year, monetary conditions have not seen significant changes. Interest rates across segments of the domestic financial market have showed a variety of trends. OFZ yields declined on the back of the improved situation in global financial markets and revised expectations of market participants with regard to the future Bank of Russia's key rate path. Deposit rates slightly increased while credit rates stabilised. That said, the dynamics of OFZ yields limits the potential for further growth of deposit and credit rates and creates conditions for their decline in the future. Sustained positive real interest rates are set to support the attractiveness of savings and balanced growth in consumption. Economic activity. The economy is close to its potential. Current consumer demand movements and labour market conditions do not generate excessive inflationary pressure. In Januaryâ€”February, annual industrial production growth was the same as in 2018 Q4. Investment activity growth is still moderate. As predicted by the Bank of Russia's forecast, annual retail sales growth declined in Januaryâ€”February as a result of the VAT increase and a slowdown in wage growth. The Bank of Russia maintains its 2019 GDP growth forecast in the range of 1.2-1.7%. The VAT hike slightly constrains business activity. Newly attracted budgetary funds will be used to boost government spending, including spending on investments, as early as 2019. Subsequent years might see higher economic growth rates as national projects are implemented. Inflation risks. Short-term pro-inflationary risks have abated. With regard to internal conditions, secondary effects of the VAT increase and enhanced growth in prices of certain food products became less of a risk. As for external conditions, the revision of interest rates path by the US Fed and other central banks in advanced economies reduces the risks of persistent capital outflows from emerging markets. At the same time, the risk of a slowdown in global economic growth still looms. Geopolitical factors might lead to strengthened volatility in global commodity and financial markets, affecting exchange rate and inflation expectations. Despite the oil price growth since the beginning of the year, the risks of supply exceeding demand in the 2019 oil market remain elevated. Elevated and unanchored inflation expectations also pose a meaningful risk. The Bank of Russia leaves mostly unchanged its assessment of risks associated with wage movements, possible changes in consumer behaviour and budget expenditures. These risks remain moderate. In its key rate decision-making, the Bank of Russia will take into account inflation and economic dynamics against the forecast, as well as risks posed by external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia admits the possibility of turning to cutting the key rate in 2019. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next rate review meeting on 26 April 2019. The Board decision press release is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time. In the follow-up to the Board of Directors meeting of 22 March 2019 the Bank of Russia released its medium-term forecast.

Hungary,2019-03-26,"At its meeting on 26 March 2019, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 27 March 2019:. The Magyar Nemzeti Bank's (MNB) single anchor is inflation, its primary objective is to achieve and maintain price stability. In February 2019, inflation stood at 3.1 percent and core inflation at 3.5 percent. The increase in core inflation mainly reflected higher inflation of processed food and market services, to which rises in volatile unprocessed food and fuel prices also contributed in the case of the overall consumer price index. Core inflation excluding indirect tax effects stood at 3.2 percent in February following a value of 3.0 percent in January. Volatile items continue to influence inflation. Therefore, in assessing the outlook, the Monetary Council pays more attention to developments in the measures of underlying inflation capturing persistent trends. Since mid-2018, the consumer price index has been continuously fluctuating around 3 percent, and core inflation excluding indirect tax effects rose to 3 percent at the beginning of 2019, therefore the MNB has met its inflation target. A dichotomy is observed between the factors determining the developments in inflation and core inflation excluding indirect tax effects. Persistently buoyant domestic demand is boosting, and weakening external activity is restraining the pace of price increases. In the coming quarters, inflation will fluctuate around the 3 percent central bank target. Core inflation excluding indirect tax effects is expected to continue to rise until the autumn months and then to decline from the end of 2019. In 2018, the Hungarian economy grew by 4.9 per cent, which was largely supported by the strong expansion in corporate and household lending. Household consumption and investment continued to increase. Labour demand remained strong, and the unemployment rate was close to its historically low level. Developments in the current account balance were influenced by two opposite effects. The balance of goods fell, while the services balance rose. Economic growth is expected to slow gradually from 2019, but to remain strong. As a result of the dynamic growth in credit markets, the investment rate is likely to stabilise at high levels. Higher real incomes are expected to contribute to a further expansion in household consumption and savings. However, regarding long-term, sustainable economic growth, the improvement in competitiveness by structural measures will be given increasing emphasis. There has been a significant deterioration in the outlook for global growth recently. Recent data from the United States, the euro area and China mostly point to a slowdown in economic activity. In addition, risk appetite was influenced by developments in international trade policies and by uncertainties related to the Brexit agreement. As a result, the world's leading central banks became more cautious. The Federal Reserve announced the gradual conclusion of its balance sheet reduction. Based on market expectations, monetary conditions are likely to remain loose for a longer period than earlier expected. This has been reflected in the declining long-term yields in developed countries since the beginning of 2019. Oil prices have increased somewhat recently. Due to the deteriorating economic outlook in Europe and downside risks to inflation related to the euro area, the European Central Bank (ECB) has modified its forward guidance. Consequently, the first interest rate hike has been shifted to a later date. Furthermore, the ECB will launch a new series of quarterly targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO-III) to improve the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission and to maintain favourable bank lending conditions. As a result, the central bank balance sheet is expected to remain essentially unchanged for a prolonged period. Due to the shift in the first interest rate hike to a later date and balance sheet policy, monetary conditions in the euro area will remain loose for a longer period of time. To maintain price stability, the Monetary Council deemed it necessary to modify monetary conditions. Accordingly, the Council raised the overnight deposit rate by 10 basis points to -0.05 percent, and left the base rate, the overnight collateralised lending rate and the one-week collateralised lending rate unchanged at 0.9 percent. Furthermore, the Council reduced the average amount of liquidity to be crowded-out for the second quarter of 2019 by HUF 100 billion to at least HUF 300-500 billion and will take this into account in setting the stock of central bank swap instruments. To improve the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission, the Monetary Council will launch its corporate bond purchasing programme with a total amount of HUF 300 billion on 1 July 2019. By introducing a new monetary policy instrument, the Bond Funding for Growth Scheme (BGS), the Council's specific objective is to promote the diversification of the funding to the domestic corporate sector. Under the programme, the Bank will purchase bonds having a good rating issued by non-financial corporations. The MNB will neutralise excess liquidity arising from the bond purchases by using the preferential deposit facility bearing interest at the central bank base rate. The Bank is publishing the considerations underlying the introduction and the most important features of the programme in the form of a background material and it will publish the document containing details of the conditions until the end of April 2019. The new programme complements the Funding for Growth Scheme Fix launched at the beginning of 2019. By taking these measures, the Monetary Council ensures the maintenance of price stability. The monetary policy stance will continue to be accommodative, economic agents' financing costs will remain favourable. A dichotomy is observed between the factors determining the developments in inflation. Persistently buoyant domestic demand is boosting, and weakening external activity is restraining the pace of price increase. The Monetary Council will assess the effects of this on the maintenance of price stability over the 5-8 quarter horizon of monetary policy. In its monetary policy decisions, the Council applies a cautious approach, relying mainly on the comprehensive projections for the macroeconomy and inflation in the quarterly published Inflation Report."
Nigeria,2019-03-26,"CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO. 123 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING OF MONDAY 25TH AND TUESDAY 26TH MARCH, 2019 Background The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on the 25th and 26th March, 2019; against the backdrop of developments in the global and domestic economic environments in the first quarter of 2019. Eleven (11) members of the Committee were present. Global Economic Developments The Committee noted with concern the weakening performance of global output growth at the end of 2018 and observed that developments in the first quarter of 2019 were characterised by legacy headwinds from the second half of 2018. These include: the continued trade war between the US and China, policy uncertainty amongst advanced economy central banks; persisting uncertainties surrounding BREXIT negotiations; vulnerabilities in major financial markets and rising public debt in some Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDEs). Consequently global output growth for 2019 was downgraded by the IMF from 37 per cent to 35 per cent. Price developments across major advanced economies, continued to moderate in the review period alongside signals of weakening output growth. In the light of this development, the US Fed, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank retreated from their earlier stance of monetary policy normalisation in favour of a monetary policy accommodation. This led to volatilities in the financial markets of the advanced economies as the balancing of portfolios moved capital from the equities to the bonds market. The MPC noted the moderate appreciation of the US dollar against the currencies of most advanced and emerging market economies. It further noted the trend of declining long term yields in the US, and the likelihood that capital flows may be redirected to EMDEs in the medium term. Domestic Output Developments Output data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) indicate that real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 238 per cent in Q4 2018 from 181 and 211 per cent in the previous quarter and corresponding period of 2017. The major impetus for growth came from the non-oil sector, which grew by 27 per cent in Q4 2018, while the oil sector contracted by 162 per cent. The Committee welcomed the continued positive sentiments in the Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Indices (PMIs) for the 24th and 23rd consecutive months in March 2019. The manufacturing PMI rose by 574 index points 2 compared with 571 in the previous month. Similarly the non- manufacturing PMI increased by 585 index points compared with 584 in February 2019. The increase in both measures of PMI was driven by increases in production, employment, raw material inventories and new orders. This improved outlook was attributable to the continued stability in the foreign exchange market, various interventions by the Bank in the real sector and the effective implementation of the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP) by the Federal Government. Furthermore on the current measure of national output, the MPC noted the need to rebase the GDP, an exercise which was last carried out in 2010. Developments in Money and Prices The Committee noted that broad money supply (M2) contracted by 198 per cent in February 2019, below its level at end- December 2018. Net Foreign Assets (NFA) contracted by 747 per cent in February 2019 relative to its level at end-December 2018. In contrast. M3 grew by 431 per cent in February 2019 compared with its level at end-December 2018. Net Domestic Credit also grew by 1068 per cent in February 2019. The growth in NDC was accounted for by the increase in credit to Government which grew by 1720 per cent in February 2019 over its level at end- December 2018. Credit to the private sector also rose by 641 per cent compared with its growth benchmark of 941 per cent. Given the positive trajectory, the Committee urged the Management of the CBN, to sustain the various initiatives of the Bank, particularly 3 the partnership between the Bankers Committee and the Nigeria Incentive-Based Risk Sharing System for Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL) aimed at establishing a national microfinance bank to cater for the MSMEs of the economy. The Committee noted the continued moderation in inflation as headline inflation (year-on-year) declined further to 1131 per cent in February 2019 from 1137 and 1144 per cent in January 2019 and December 2018, respectively. The decrease in headline inflation was driven mainly by food inflation, which declined to 1347 per cent in February 2019 from 1351 per cent in January 2019, while core inflation declined marginally to 980 per cent from 991 per cent in the previous month. On a month-on-month basis, headline, food and core inflation declined to 073, 082 and 065 per cent in February 2019, respectively, from 074, 083 and 081 per cent in January 2019. The Committee noted the upside risks to inflation to include; high cost of energy, infrastructure constraints, insecurity in some parts of the country; and anticipated increase in liquidity from the late implementation of the 2018 budget, and noted that most of these factors were outside the ambit of monetary policy. The MPC, therefore, urged the Federal Government to sustain its current effort in stimulating output growth by executing the policies approved in the ERGP. The net liquidity position reflected the impact of OMO auctions, foreign exchange interventions, statutory allocations to states and local governments, and maturing CBN Bills. Consequently the average Inter-bank call rate increased to 1645 per cent in 4 February 2019 from 1500 per cent in January 2019. The Open Buy Back (OBB) rate, however, declined marginally to 1879 per cent in February 2019 from 1971 per cent in January 2019. The interbank call rates, however, closed at 80 per cent on March 8, 2019, while the OBB closed at 1439 on March 22, 2019. The Committee noted that in spite of the recent upsurge in capital inflow into the economy, the All-Share Index (ASI) and Market Capitalization (MC) continued to decline, reflecting global sentiments in portfolio rebalancing from equities to fixed income securities. This generally reflected the perceived risk at the long end of the yield curve. The Committee noted with satisfaction, the continued stability in the foreign exchange market at the Investors' and Exporters' (I&E) window of the market. In particular, it also observed the moderate improvement in oil prices and stable accretion to external reserves, which stood at US$452 billion as at March 21, 2019, a 673 per cent increase from US$4235 billion at end-February 2019. The Overall Outlook and Risks The medium term outlook for the global economy continues to be uncertain with indications of increasing macroeconomic vulnerabilities and downward revision of the forecast for global output growth. On the domestic economy, available data on key macroeconomic indicators for output growth in the first quarter of 2019, and forecasts for the rest of the year, suggests continued positive outcomes. Based on recent projections, the economy is expected to grow by 20 per cent (IMF), 22 per cent (World Bank) and 274 per cent (CBN). The projection is hinged on: the enhanced flow of credit to the real sector; sustenance of a stable exchange rate; moderating inflation rate; CBN special interventions in growth-enhancing sectors, especially, agriculture and non-agricultural SMEs; improved growth in the non-oil sector and the effective implementation of the ERGP by the Federal Government, amongst others. The Committee expressed optimism that the establishment of the NIRSAL National Microfinance Bank and the enactment of the Secured Transactions in Movable Assets Act 2017 will stimulate lending to small and medium enterprises. Committee's Considerations The Committee observed the tepid output growth in 2018, but noted with satisfaction that it strengthened in the last quarter of 2018 as well as the positive forecast for 2019. It further noted with great satisfaction, the continued moderation in all measures of inflation, sustained stability in the exchange rate and the robust level of external reserves. It commended the recent upsurge in capital inflows into the economy, noting this to be a demonstration of sustained confidence by the foreign investor community in the Nigerian economy. The Committee was, 6 however, not unmindful of developments in the global economy, noting the recent slowdown in growth in some advanced economies and the dovish stance of some major central banks as an early warning sign of broader macroeconomic vulnerabilities. It therefore, underscored the need to monitor the trend in capital flows and the continued downturn in the equities market, noting that the recent surge in portfolio inflows were concentrated in the money market. The Committee noted the relative volatility in oil prices and its impact on accretion to reserves which could easily undermine the stability observed in the foreign exchange market. It however, noted that current developments in the oil futures market indicate that oil prices will remain considerably above the Federal Government's 2019 budget benchmark. The Committee, therefore, urged the Federal Government to strengthen its current revenue mobilization efforts as well as explore additional sources of revenue in order to improve fiscal buffers. It further urged the Federal Government to sustain its implementation of the ERGP, while ensuring that growth is all inclusive. It reiterated the need to concentrate effort on addressing the problem of weak power infrastructure, as well as support domestic manufacturing. The Committee also called on all relevant institutions of the government to address the menace of smuggling and dumping of goods into Nigeria; and encouraged the Bank to continue to explore available scenarios to deal with the activities of economic and policy saboteurs, including those involved in dumping and 7 smuggling, in a bid to accelerate domestic production of goods in Nigeria. The MPC noted the positive moderate outlook for growth and the risks in the horizon. The Committee also noted that having achieved a relatively stable exchange rate with price stability, it is imperative that monetary policy should explore the next steps necessary for enhancing growth, reducing unemployment and diversifying the base of the economy. It further observed that per capita income growth is very negligible, while aggregate demand remains weak. Aggregate output also remains below the potential output level, implying sufficient headroom for non- inflationary growth. This new direction has, therefore, become imperative against the backdrop of the aftermath of the general national elections and strong inflow of foreign direct and portfolio investments into the economy. The Committee urged for the speedy passage of the other aspects of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) to fast track the development of the value chain in the sector and create employment. It also welcomes the passage of the National Minimum Wage Bill by the National Assembly and call for its speedy implementation in order to boost domestic aggregate demand. The Committee further observed that the performance of the monetary aggregates were below their benchmarks, indicating 8 headroom for monetary growth. The MPC noted the encumbrances and constraints imposed on fiscal policy and the associated vulnerabilities as it has consistently failed to mobilise sufficient revenues to support development as enunciated in the ERGP, leaving room for continued debt financing, not previously envisaged. Against this backdrop, it is imperative for monetary policy to provide the much needed leverage to support output growth and employment generation in the country. On a more cautious note, the Committee expressed concern and sympathises with the fiscal authorities, over the growing fiscal deficit, external debt and debt service, and urged the need to closely monitor the public procurement process in order to improve efficiency in public resource management. On financial system stability, the MPC noted the improvements in key financial soundness indicators and commended the Federal Government for the settlement of debt owed to oil marketers, which has considerably, helped in reducing the non-performing loans (NPLs) portfolio of the banking industry. The Committee, therefore, urged the Government to expedite action in settling all outstanding contractor-related arrears so as to improve the NPLs position and stabilise the banking system. In addition, the MPC reiterated the Bank's commitment to improve credit delivery, especially to small and medium scale enterprises, while acknowledging efforts by the Central Bank of Nigeria in coordinating the de-risking of lending to the private sector 9 through the collaboration between the Bankers' Committee and NIRSAL. In its consideration of the best monetary policy option, the Committee noted the need for all agencies of Government to work hard, not only in consolidating the growth so far achieved, but also in ensuring that appropriate policies are put in place and implemented to create jobs on a mass scale and diversify the economy in a proper direction. In doing this, the policy options facing the MPC at this meeting is a decision between retention of the current stance of monetary policy or a slight loosening of the policy rate, backed by the substantial stability of the major macroeconomic indicators. The Committee felt that given the relative stability in the key macroeconomic variables, there is the need to signal a new direction that is pro-growth. In its arguments, the Committee was convinced that doing this would further uphold the Bank's commitment to promoting strong growth by way of encouraging credit flow to the productive sectors of the economy. The MPC felt that signalling through loosening by a marginal reduction would serve to manage the sentiments in the capital markets owing to the wider spread in yields in the EMDEs, relative to the advanced economies. Moreover the real interest rate in the country would still remain positive. 10 The Committee's Decision In light of the above, the MPC decided by a vote of six out of eleven members to reduce the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) by 50 basis points. Two members voted to reduce the MPR by 25 basis points, while one member voted to reduce it by 100 basis points. Two members, however, voted to hold the MPR at its current level. Ten members voted to hold all other parameters constant, while a member voted to reduce the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) by 100 basis points from 225 to 215 per cent. In summary, the MPC voted to: I Adjust the MPR by 50 basis points from 1400 to 1350 per cent; II. Retain the asymmetric corridor of +200/-500 basis points around the MPR; III. Retain the CRR at 225 per cent; and IV. Retain the Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent. Thank you. Godwin I Emefiele Governor. Central Bank of Nigeria 25th March 2019 11."
Czech Republic,2019-03-28,"At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank decided to keep interest rates unchanged. The two-week repo rate thus remains at 1.75%, the discount rate at 0.75% and the Lombard rate at 2.75%. Five members voted in favour of this decision, and two members voted for increasing rates by 25 basis points. . This decision is underpinned by the current macroeconomic forecast and by an assessment of information obtained since the current forecast was prepared. Following a temporary increase in inflation in the first half of this year, the current forecast expects inflation to return to the 2% target. Inflation will remain very close to the target at the monetary policy horizon. Consistent with the forecast is broad interest rate stability. At its meeting today, the Bank Board assessed the risks to the inflation forecast at the monetary policy horizon as being broadly balanced. As regards the external assumptions of the forecast, the outlook for economic activity in the euro area has been lowered slightly. Likewise, the consumer price outlook for this year and the foreign interest rate outlook for next year have been shifted downwards. By contrast, the expected rate of producer price inflation in the euro area has been increased slightly. The market outlook for the Brent crude oil price is about five dollars a barrel higher. The euro-dollar exchange rate has shifted towards a slightly weaker euro. Domestic inflation increased into the upper half of the tolerance band around the 2% target in Q1. Its rise was stronger than forecasted. Core inflation was higher than forecasted, reflecting among other factors a jump in the prices of package holidays. To a lesser extent, the higher-than-expected inflation was due to stronger year-on-year growth in food prices and administered prices. The growth of the Czech economy rose to just below 3% in 2018 Q4, whereas the forecast had expected it to slow slightly. The deviation was due mainly to higher-than-expected growth in goods and services exports. Government consumption also grew faster than forecasted. By contrast, household consumption was lower than expected, its growth slowing markedly at the year-end. The prediction for growth in gross capital formation broadly materialised. The January data point to continued brisk growth in retail sales excluding the automotive segment. Construction output growth also remains solid. By contrast, industrial production continues to slow, even decreasing year on year in January. Employment kept rising in 2018 Q4, doing so at a slightly faster pace than forecasted. In line with expectations, the decline in the unemployment rate almost came to a halt. Labour shortages coupled with still high labour demand led to a further increase in job vacancies. Conversely, total wage growth slowed in Q4 and was below the forecast in market and especially non-market sectors. The koruna-euro exchange rate appreciated slightly to CZK 25.7 to the euro in 2019 Q1, broadly in line with the forecast. The forecast expects both the negative sentiment and the outflow of capital from emerging markets, which has been countering appreciation of the koruna for several quarters now, to fade out gradually. To sum up the important facts about recent developments in the Czech economy. GDP and prices are rising at a faster pace than forecasted, whereas wages are increasing more slowly. The unemployment rate is broadly in line with the forecast."
Egypt,2019-03-28,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release March 28, 2019 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 1575 percent, 1675 percent, and 1625 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 1625 percen. Annual headline and core inflation rose to 144 percent and 92 percent in February 2019 from 127 percent and 86 percent in January 2019, respectivel. The increase was mainly due to selected food items, particularly selected fresh vegetables, while the contribution of non-food items remained broadly containe. Moreover the increase was partly impacted by an unfavorable base effec. Real GDP growth rose slightly to 55 percent in 2018 Q4 from 53 percent in 2018 Q3, while the unemployment rate declined to 89 percent from 100 percent, registering its lowest level since 2010 Q. Available data indicate that net external demand continued to support economic activity, while private domestic demand remained contained during 2018 Q. The expansion of global economic activity weakened, and the pace of tightening financial conditions eased, while trade tensions continued to weigh on the global outloo. International oil prices recently increased and remain subject to volatility due to potential supply-side factor. The Ministry of Finance is targeting to achieve a primary surplus of 20 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2018/19, up from 01 percent registered preliminarily in the previous year; and to maintain this surplus thereafte. The MPC decided that keeping key policy rates unchanged is consistent with achieving the inflation target of 9 percent (Â±3 percentage points) in 2020 Q4 and price stability over the medium ter. The MPC closely monitors all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust its stance to preserve monetary stabilit.

Mexico,2019-03-28,"Banco de Mexico's Governing Board has decided to maintain the target for the overnight interbank interest rate at 8.25%. Available indicators suggest that the weakening of world economic activity observed during the second half of 2018 continued during the early part of 2019, as evidenced by the lower dynamism in most advanced and some emerging economies, such as the euro area. China, and, to a lesser extent, the United States. This has led to a decline in global growth expectations. Labor markets in the major advanced economies continued exhibiting tightness. Nevertheless, headline inflation in these economies has decreased, partly due to the lower energy prices in relation to the previous year, while core inflation has remained relatively stable. All of the above has consolidated expectations that the major central banks would not tighten monetary conditions in the foreseeable future. In March, the Federal Reserve left the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged and reiterated its message that it will be patient in making future adjustments to the target range. In addition, the median of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) economic projections suggests that there will be no increases in the federal funds target range in 2019. The Fed also announced significant changes in the strategy for the normalization of its balance sheet, which consists of shrinking the rate of reduction of its securities holdings starting in May and concluding such process in September of this year. In this context, the interest rates of U.S. Treasury bonds decreased significantly for all terms, thus increasing risk appetite in financial markets and leading to higher capital flows to emerging economies. In this regard, it is important to highlight that risks to the global economy persist, among which a sharper deceleration than previously foreseen, the uncertainty regarding trade disputes between the U.S. and China, a disorderly Brexit process, a lower- than-expected growth of the Chinese economy, and an escalation of political and geopolitical turmoil in different regions, stand out. Since the last monetary policy decision, the more favorable conditions that have prevailed in international financial markets have contributed to the positive performance of financial assets in Mexico. Nevertheless, some risk factors and the uncertainty associated with the Mexican economy have led to an additional discount or risk premium for domestic assets. Among such factors, those related to the credit rating of Pemex, and even to Mexico's sovereign debt, are particularly noteworthy. The current environment continues to pose significant risks in the medium and long terms that could affect the country's macroeconomic conditions, its potential growth, and the economy's price formation process. In this regard, it is particularly important that, in addition to following a prudent and firm monetary policy, measures to foster an environment of confidence and certainty for investment and higher productivity are adopted, and public finances are consolidated sustainably. In this context, it is especially relevant that the fiscal goals set in the Economic Package for 2019 are attained. Strengthening the rule of law and tackling corruption are equally imperative. 1 Available information suggests that, in the early part of 2019. Mexico's economy continued registering low growth as a result of the slowdown of the world economy, some weakness in domestic demand, and transitory factors that might have affected growth during the first quarter of the year. Thus, slack conditions in the economy loosened towards the end of 2018 and the early part of 2019. Due to the latter, the balance of risks for growth remains biased to the downside. Between January and the first two weeks of March, headline inflation fell from 4.37% to 3.95%, mainly due to the decline in non-core inflation, which went from 6.81% in January to 5.39% in the first two weeks of March, as a result of the lower increases in energy and in agricultural and livestock product prices. Nevertheless, some of the favorable shocks that have led to the fall in non-core inflation have started to revert recently. In particular, the prices of energy goods rose in the second half of February, reflecting increases in their international references. With regards to core inflation, it evolved as anticipated, by registering 3.60% in January and 3.51% in the first two weeks of March. Nevertheless, food merchandise inflation has increased, while that of certain services remains high. As for inflation expectations, between January and February the median of headline inflation expectations for 2019 and 2020 fell from 3.80% to 3.65%, and from 3.71% to 3.60%, respectively. However, that of core inflation expectations for the end of 2019 remained at 3.50%, while that for the end of 2020 increased slightly from 3.45% to 3.48%, during the stated period. As for headline inflation expectations for the medium and long terms, these continue to be above the 3% permanent target, at around 3.50%. Regarding medium-term core inflation expectations, these increased from 3.42% to 3.50%, while those for the long term remained at 3.40%, after having been at 3.30% during most of 2018. As for information drawn from market instruments, the medium- and long-term inflationary risk premium decreased, although it still remains at high levels. As for inflation risks, the possibility that the peso exchange rate comes under pressure stemming from external or domestic factors stands out. Should the economy require adjustments either to the real exchange rate or to medium- and long-term interest rates. Banco de Mexico will contribute to making such adjustments occur in an orderly manner, in an effort to prevent second-round effects on the economy's price formation process. Inflation could also be affected if additional pressures on energy prices or on agricultural product prices arise, if an escalation of protectionist and compensatory measures worldwide materializes or in case public finances deteriorate. Considering the magnitude of the minimum wage increases, in addition to their possible direct impact, there is also the risk that these bring about wage revisions that exceed productivity gains and give rise to cost pressures, affecting formal employment and prices. In order to raise the purchasing power of wages sustainably, the role of other public policies must be considered, in particular, fostering competition in those sectors of goods and services with a high share in the consumption basket of the segments of the population with the lowest income. Also, the persistence shown by core inflation could give rise to a greater resistance to decline of long-term inflation expectations. As for downside risks, those that stand out are possible lower price increases in some of the goods included in the non-core subindex or a greater-than-foreseen widening in slackness conditions. Altogether, although there has been an intensification of some of the downside risk factors, there are still others that might put upward pressure on inflation in greater magnitude and make it deviate from its foreseen path. For this reason, the balance of risks for the forecasted trajectory for inflation still remains to the upside, in an environment of high uncertainty. To guide its monetary policy actions. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board follows closely the development of inflation vis-Ã -vis its forecasted trajectory, taking into account the monetary policy stance and the time frame in which monetary policy operates, as well as available information on all inflation determinants and on medium- and long-term inflation expectations, including the balance of risks for such factors. Monetary policy must respond prudently if for any reason the uncertainty faced by the economy increases considerably. In this context, considering that the recent developments in inflation and its main determinants have not changed significantly with respect to their foreseen path, that the cyclical position of the economy has loosened somewhat, and that the current monetary policy stance is consistent with 2 the convergence of inflation to its target. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board has decided unanimously to leave the target for the overnight interbank interest rate unchanged at 8.25%. Considering the risks to consolidate low and stable inflation as well as those the economy's price formation is subject to, the Governing Board will take the necessary actions so that the reference rate is kept at a level consistent with the convergence of headline inflation to Banco de Mexico's target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board will maintain a prudent monetary policy stance and, under the current environment of uncertainty, will follow closely the potential pass-through of exchange rate fluctuations to prices. Mexico's monetary policy stance relative to that of the U.S.-in an external environment that it is still subject to risks- and the behavior of slack conditions in the Mexican economy. In the presence and possible persistence of factors that, by their nature, involve risks to both inflation and inflation expectations, monetary policy will be adjusted in a timely and firm manner to achieve the convergence of inflation to its 3% target and to strengthen the anchoring of medium- and long-term inflation expectations so that they attain such target."
South Africa,2019-03-28,"South African Reserve Bank PRESS STATEMENT 28 March 2019 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, global growth concerns have increased, with particular weakness visible in some of our major trading partners. Domestically, electricity constraints, combined with weakness in business and consumer confidence, weigh on the forecast. While inflation continues to show near-term downside surprises, the medium-term outlook is impacted by higher energy tariffs and rising food and fuel prices. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas was 4.1% in February (up from 4.0% in January). Goods price inflation was 3.0% (up from 2.8% in January), while services price inflation remained at 5.2%. The Bank's measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity, was unchanged in February at 4.4% for the fourth consecutive month. Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods increased to 4.7% in February from 4.1% in January. MPC Statement March 28th, 2019 Page 1. MPC Statement March 28th, 2019 Page 1 The inflation forecast generated by the SARB's Quarterly Projection Model (QPM) is broadly unchanged since the previous MPC. Headline inflation is expected to average 4.8% in 2019, before increasing to 5.3% in 2020 and moderating to 4.7% in 2021 (down from 4.8%). Headline CPI inflation is expected to peak at 5.7%, in the first quarter of 2020 and settle at 4.5% by the end of the forecast period. Previous MPC statements have highlighted the risks to the forecast presented by volatile oil prices and food price surprises. In light of recent developments, the assumptions for Brent crude oil in the QPM were revised up by US$2 per barrel from US$62 to US$64 for 2019. The assumptions for 2020 and 2021 are unchanged at US$65. Fuel taxes and levies announced in the 2019 Budget have been included in the forecast. The turning point for food price inflation has also been difficult to predict due to lower than expected meat prices and weak demand. Food price inflation is expected to bottom out in the first quarter of 2019 and to peak at 5.9% in the second quarter of 2020. The forecast also takes into account the recent electricity tariff increases announced by the National Energy Regulator of South Africa. The assumption for electricity price inflation, which takes into account municipal price adjustments, has increased from 12% to 13% for 2019/20 and from 6% to 9% in 2020/21. Higher food, fuel and electricity prices are expected to lift inflation over the medium term. However, this is expected to be offset by lower core inflation as unit labour costs and inflation expectations moderate. MPC Statement March 28th, 2019 Page 2. MPC Statement March 28th, 2019 Page 2 Average inflation expectations have been declining since the end of 2017. Inflation expectations as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research (BER) in the first quarter of 2019, declined from 5.4% to 4.8% for 2019 and from 5.4% to 5.2% for 2020. Average five-year expectations also came down from 5.3% to 5.1%, which is the lowest level since they were first surveyed in 2011. The inflation expectations of market analysts in the March 2019 Reuters Econometer survey are also lower at 4.7% for 2019 (down from 5.2%) and remained unchanged at 5.3% and 5.2% for 2020 and 2021 respectively. Expectations implicit in the break-even inflation rates (i.e. the yield differential between conventional and inflation-linked government bonds) remain sensitive to exchange rate movements. While still higher than the mid-point of the inflation target range, at 4.97%, the five-year break-even rates are at their lowest level in four years. Although global growth conditions remain benign, the pace of growth is slower than previously anticipated. Business confidence has softened amidst increasing concerns about weaker trade and production, on-going trade tensions and tariffs hikes, as well as country specific factors. Global GDP is expected to pick up over the medium term, but risks remain tilted to the downside. A further escalation of trade tensions, rising geo-political risks, including the possibility of a no-deal Brexit and renewed tightening of financial conditions could further weaken growth in an environment with limited policy space. A slower pace of monetary policy normalisation is expected in advanced economies. Most of these economies are growing at levels close to or above their potential, while inflation remains below targeted levels. Inflation expectations are contained and in some instances lower than targeted inflation. Recent communication by the US Fed MPC Statement March 28th, 2019 Page 3. Recent communication by the US Fed MPC Statement March 28th, 2019 Page 3 and the European Central Bank has signalled that their monetary policy stance will remain largely accommodative for now. Emerging market currencies have generally benefitted from indications of continued accommodative monetary policy in advanced economies and low market volatility. Currencies of countries with stronger macroeconomic fundamentals are better placed to benefit from these developments. The rand has been affected by idiosyncratic factors such as domestic growth prospects, political developments and policy settings. Since the January MPC, the rand has depreciated by 6.4% against the US dollar, by 5.2% against the euro, and by 6.1% on a trade-weighted basis. The implied starting point for the rand is R14.00 against the US dollar, compared with R14.30 at the time of the previous meeting. At these levels, the QPM assesses the rand to be less undervalued. GDP increased by 1.4% in the fourth quarter of 2018, averaging 0.8% for the year. This is largely due to declining investment by public corporations and government as well as weaker business confidence, as suggested by the most recent RMB/BER Business Confidence Index. The Absa Purchasing Managers' Index moderated from 49.9 index points in January to 46.2 index points in February, driven by a sharp decrease in business activity and new sales orders. The SARB's composite leading business cycle indicator has trended lower since February 2018 and contracted further by 1.8% in January. Household consumption expenditure has been stronger than forecast, but remains constrained by low employment growth, electricity price hikes and higher petrol prices.

MPC Statement March 28th, 2019 Page 4 Over the forecast period, growth in household expenditure is expected to decline to 1.0% in 2019 and 1.4% in 2020 before increasing to 1.8% in 2021. The SARB now expects GDP growth for 2019 to average 1.3% (down from 1.7% in January). This results from the bigger than expected slowdown in the global economy, declines in business confidence, potential supply side disruptions from load shedding and growing pressure on household disposable income. The MPC assesses the risks to the growth forecast to continue to be on the downside. Electricity supply constraints and weak business confidence will likely limit near term production and investment prospects. The Committee remains of the view that current challenges facing the economy are primarily structural in nature. Given current economic vulnerabilities, prudent macroeconomic policies combined with structural reforms that raise potential growth and lower the cost structure of the economy, have become even more urgent. The MPC takes note of the recent inflation outcomes and welcomes the moderation in inflation expectations. The overall risks to the inflation outlook are assessed to be more or less evenly balanced. Key upside risks are rising administered prices including electricity and water tariffs, rising domestic food prices in the outer years and higher international oil prices. Downside risks include lower global inflation and an extended period of monetary accommodation in advanced economies. MPC Statement March 28th, 2019 Page 5. MPC Statement March 28th, 2019 Page 5 Against this backdrop, the MPC unanimously decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 6.75% per year. The Committee continues to assess the stance of monetary policy to be accommodative. Monetary policy actions will continue to focus on anchoring inflation expectations closer to the mid-point of the inflation target, in the interest of balanced and sustainable growth. The MPC is of the view that there is little evidence of demand side pressures in the economy. Over the medium term, cost-push factors could arise from higher electricity, fuel and food prices. The approach of the MPC is to focus on the possible second-round effects of supply side shocks. Any future policy adjustments will continue to be data dependent. The implied path of policy rates generated by the Quarterly Projection Model is for one hike of 25 basis points, reaching 7.0% by the end of 2019. The endogenous interest rate path is built into the growth and inflation forecast. As emphasised previously, the implied path remains a broad policy guide which could change in either direction from meeting to meeting in response to new developments and changing risks.

Pakistan,2019-03-29,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement March 29, 2019 Economic data released since the last Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting in January 2019 indicates that the impact of stabilization measures continues to unfold. In particular, the current account deficit recorded sizeable contraction during the first two months of 2019, which, together with bi-lateral inflows, helped ease pressures on SBP's foreign exchange reserves. These developments on the external front have improved stability in the financial markets, reduced uncertainty and improved businesses confidence, as reflected in various surveys. Nonetheless despite narrowing, the current account deficit remains high, fiscal consolidation is slower than anticipated, and core inflation continues to rise. Average headline CPI inflation reached. percent in Jul-Feb FY19 compared to. percent recorded in the same period last year. Meanwhile YoY CPI inflation has risen considerably to. percent in January 2019 and further to. percent in February 2019 the highest YoY increase in inflation since June 2014. These pressures on headline inflation are explained by adjustments in the administered prices of electricity and gas, significant increase in perishable food prices, and the continued unfolding impact of exchange rate depreciation. Core inflation maintained its 13-month upward trajectory accelerating to. percent in February 2019 from. percent year earlier. Further rising input costs on the back of higher energy prices and the lagged impact of exchange rate depreciation are likely to maintain upward pressure on inflation despite moderation in aggregate demand due to proactive monetary management. As result, headline CPI inflation is projected to fall in the range of. to. percent for FY19. Amidst the efforts to curtail inflationary pressures and reduce the otherwise widening macroeconomic imbalances, domestic economic activity experienced the brunt of the stabilization measures implemented thus far. In particular. Large-scale Manufacturing (LSM) declined by. percent during Jul-Jan FY19 against. percent growth recorded in the same period last year. The latest available estimates of major crops also depict lackluster performance by the agriculture sector. The slowdown in commodity producing sectors has downside implications for growth in services sector as well. Similarly deceleration in consumer demand and capital investments, reflected through cut in development spending and deceleration in credit for fixed investments, indicates moderation in domestic demand. In this backdrop, the real GDP growth is projected to be around. percent in FY19. Owing to stabilization measures, the current account deficit narrowed to US$. billion in Jul-Feb FY19 compared to deficit of US$ 1. billion during the same period last year- fall of 2. percent. This includes notable pace of retrenchment of the current account deficit by 59. percent during the first two months of 2019 over the same period last year. This reduction in the external balance was mainly driven by 29. percent decline in the trade deficit in goods and services as well as strong growth in remittances. The reduction in the trade deficit is in large part driven by import compression- this decline would have been even more pronounced if not for rise in oil prices. Exports in dollar value, during this period remained flat, however in terms of quantum there has been notable improvement. Though still posing significant challenge in term of its financing, the narrowing of the current account deficit has translated into some stability in the foreign exchange market. Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN With an improvement in the external balance as well as an increase in bilateral official inflows. SBP's foreign exchange reserves gradually recovered to US$ 10. billion on 25th March 2019. While the reserves are still below the standard adequacy levels (equal to three months of imports cover), the recent improvement on the external front has nevertheless improved business confidence. This is captured in the recent wave of IBA-SBP surveys of large number of firms in industry and services sectors. Having said that, the share of private financial flows need to increase on sustainable basis to achieve medium-to-long term stability in the country's external accounts. Similarly as enunciated in previous statements, concerted structural reforms are required to reduce the trade deficit by improving productivity and competitiveness of the export-oriented sectors. The fiscal deficit for HI-FY19 was higher at. percent of GDP when compared with. percent for the same period last year. In view of the shortfalls in revenue collections and escalating security- related expenditures it is most likely that the target for the fiscal deficit in FY19 would be breached. So far, significant portion of the fiscal deficit was financed through borrowings from SBP, which if continued, will not only complicate the transmission of monetary policy but also dilute its impact and prolong the ongoing consolidation efforts. In absolute terms, the government borrowed Rs3. trillion from SBP and retired Rs2. trillion of its borrowing from scheduled banks (on cash basis) during 1st Jul 15th Mar. FY19. This in turn, facilitated the banks to meet private sector credit demand that increased by. percent without putting pressures on the market interest rates. Much of the increase in credit demand was for working capital due to higher input prices and capacity expansions in the power and construction allied industries. Overall money supply (M2) grew by. percent during 1st Jul 15th Mar. FY19 against. percent increase in the same period last year. This growth in M2 was solely driven by expansion in net domestic assets, as net foreign assets declined. Taking into account the above developments and the evolving macroeconomic situation, the MPC noted that sustainable growth and overall macroeconomic stability requires further policy measures as: underlying inflationary pressures continue; the fiscal deficit is elevated, and despite an improvement, the current account deficit is still high. In this backdrop and after detailed deliberations, the MPC decided to increase the policy rate by 50 bps to 10.75 percent effective from 1st April 2019. Page."
Chile,2019-03-30,"Monetary Policy Meeting At its monetary policy meeting the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy rate at 3,0%. The decision was made by the Board's members unanimous votes. On the external front, since the previous meeting growth forecasts for the main economies have continued to be downgraded. In this scenario, the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank have reinforced their stance for a more expansive monetary policy while the Chinese authorities have added new stimulus measures. In addition to adjustments to its balance sheet, the Federal Reserve also announced that it would not raise the federal funds rate this year and that the direction of its next move cannot be foreseen with clarity. Even though all these announcements have significantly reduced long term interest rates, tensions in international financial markets have reappeared. The yield curve has inverted, the dollar has appreciated globally and news fears about the performance of some emerging economies whose economic fundamentals are perceived as weak have arisen. Commodity prices have been less affected. Specifically, the current price of copper is still above the one observed at the time of January's meeting. Regarding local financial conditions, the peso, as the majority of emerging market currencies, experienced significant fluctuations since the previous meeting. Measures of domestic financial risk remained contained. Aligned with global trends, the stock market and interest rates fell. In the local bank credit market, loans continued growing in real terms while lending rates remain low in historical perspective. Prints for local activity in the last months, including national accounts for the fourth quarter of 2018, ratify that the growth rate of non-mining activities has increased. On the contrary, mining has significantly deteriorated. Investment remains as the most dynamic component of domestic expenditure which is also seen in the performance of several sectors linked to it. Regarding private consumption, no major changes are observed with the exception of car sales where the expansion of sales has slowed after strong numbers of the previous year and a half. This has taken place while the labor market has not shown significant changes as indicated by the evolution of the unemployment rate. The worse performance of mining manifests itself in growth forecasts. According to March's Economic Expectation Survey (EES), in 2019 non- mining GDP will grow 3,6% (3,7% in January) whereas total GDP would increase 3,4% (3,6% in January). [INF*RES*AS] The annual growth of the CPI  according to the base 2018=100 reference series- is at 1,7% in February (CPIEFE: 2%), below what was forecasted in the last Monetary Policy Report. Beyond the direct impact of the new CPI basket and methodology, a number of macroeconomic phenomena seem to explain this difference. A lower than expected exchange rate pass-through and more competition in some markets are among them. An evaluation that capacity slack is bigger than previous estimations, what to a significant extent appears to be related to the effects of immigration in the labor force, is another factor. In the last months, private sector inflation expectations for the short term have been reduced while the ones for December 2019 have seen a smaller reduction. At the two-year horizon, they are around 3%. The Board's decision considered that, according to the analysis in the Monetary Policy Report and the recent data, the lower level of inflation and its perspectives, require keeping the monetary stimulus for a longer time. Notwithstanding, it still estimates that towards the medium term it will be necessary to resume the normalization of the monetary policy rate to assure the convergence of inflation in the policy horizon. With this, the Board reaffirms that it will proceed gradually and cautiously as has been stated and reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the two-year horizon. The minutes of this Monetary Policy Meeting will be published at 8:30 hours of Monday 15 April 2019. The next Monetary Policy Meeting is scheduled to take place on Wednesday 8 and Thursday 9 May 2019 and the statement thereof will be released this same day at 18:00 hours. _The Spanish original prevails."
Mongolia,2019-04-01,"MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Keeping the policy rate unchanged and Revising the upper limit on debt service to income ratio for consumer loans excluding pension loans Number: 2019/01 Effective date: 21 March 2019 The Monetary Policy Committee meeting was held on 21 March 2019, and it was decided to keep the Policy rate unchanged at 11 percent and to revise the upper limit on debt service to income ratio on newly-issued and term-changed consumer loans excluding pension loans to 60 percent, effective April 1, 2019. As of February 2019, annual inflation has reached 6.9 percent nationwide and 7.9 percent in Ulaanbaatar city. Fluctuations in inflation are mainly driven by changes in the prices of gasoline, meat and solid fuel, while demand-pull inflation remains relatively stable. This year, economic recovery is expected to keep its momentum and inflation outlook remains around the target level. The Monetary Policy Committee decided to keep the policy rate unchanged this time, considering demand, supply and external factors underlying inflation, their outlook and sentiment in the business environment. In the event that domestic demand continues to expand sharply, the policy rate may need to be raised in the upcoming periods. The decision to tighten the upper limit on debt service to income ratio in the wake of upcoming wage increases, serves the objective to gradually ease household debt burden that surged during the past years, reaching substantially high level. The Monetary Policy Committee's decisions are consistent with the Bank of Mongolia's objectives to keep inflation rate around the target rate and to ensure macroeconomic and financial stability in the medium term. Extracts of the meeting minutes will be released in two weeks on the Bank of Mongolia's website. MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE."
Romania,2019-04-02,"In its meeting of 2 April 2019, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided the following:. The annual CPI inflation rate rose from 3.27 percent in December 2018 to 3.32 percent in January and 3.83 percent in February 2019, thus standing above the upper bound of the variation band of the target and above the forecast. All major CPI components posted higher-than-expected increases during this period, but the evolution of inflation rate was mostly influenced by the pick-up in the prices of vegetables and fruit, to which added the hike in tobacco product prices and the advance in core inflation. The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate (which excludes from the CPI inflation administered prices, volatile prices, and tobacco product and alcoholic beverage prices) reached 2.5 percent in January and 2.7 percent in February from 2.4 percent in December 2018. The increase reflects rising demand-pull and wage cost-push inflationary pressures, as well as the influences of the leu exchange rate and the indirect effects of the recent advance in fuel prices. January through February 2019, the average annual CPI inflation rate edged down to 4.5 percent (from 4.6 percent in December 2018); calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, the average annual inflation rate remained flat at the December 2018 level (4.1 percent). Data on 2018 Q4 economic growth show the annual dynamics of real GDP remaining little changed at 4.1 percent compared to 4.2 percent in the previous quarter. On the demand side, household consumption became again the main driver of economic growth, ahead of the change in inventories, while gross fixed capital formation made a less negative contribution. Net exports had a larger negative contribution to GDP dynamics against the background of the protracted slowing trend in the growth rate of exports of goods and services, in parallel with the slight re-acceleration in the dynamics of imports. Alongside the worsening of the primary income balance, the developments in net exports led to a sizeable widening of the current account deficit against the same year-ago period. In 2018 as a whole. GDP dynamics dropped to 4.1 percent from 7 percent in the previous year, in the context of the fall in investment, a larger negative contribution from net exports, as well as a slower, albeit still robust, rise in private consumption. The share of the current account deficit in GDP widened to 4.5 percent in 2018 from 3.2 percent in the previous year. The latest developments show a further deceleration in industrial production annual growth in January 2019 compared to the 2018 Q4 average, concurrently with softer dynamics of new orders in manufacturing and a persistent decline in construction works. At the same time, activity in retail trade and services stepped up in January amid the significantly faster increase in the average real net wage. The annual growth rate of credit to the private sector accelerated further in January 2019 to 8.4 percent (the fastest rise since May 2012), before moderating slightly in February, its average for the period as a whole increasing versus 2018 Q4. The evolution reflected a slightly slower rise in the domestic currency component, in parallel with a considerably slacker decline in the foreign currency component. Against this background, the share of leu-denominated loans in total private sector credit narrowed marginally to 65.7 percent. The latest assessments indicate the outlook for the annual inflation rate to remain above the upper bound of the target band over the short time horizon, as it is seen following a higher path than in the latest medium-term forecast published in the February 2019 Inflation Report. The uncertainties and risks surrounding the inflation outlook stem from the fiscal and income policy stance and labour market conditions. The evolution of the current account deficit remains a matter of concern. Also important are the uncertainties related to the pace of euro area and global economic growth, the international oil price developments, the monetary policy stances of the ECB and of central banks in the region, and to the effect of Brexit. In today's meeting, based on the currently available data and assessments, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided to keep the monetary policy rate at 2.50 percent per annum, while maintaining strict control over money market liquidity. Moreover, the NBR Board decided to leave unchanged the deposit facility rate at 1.50 percent per annum and the lending (Lombard) facility rate at 3.50 percent per annum. In addition, the NBR Board decided to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board decisions aim to ensure and preserve price stability over the medium term in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth and amid safeguarding financial stability. The NBR Board underlines that the balanced macroeconomic policy mix and the implementation of structural reforms designed to foster the growth potential over the long term are of the essence in preserving a stable macroeconomic framework and strengthening the capacity of the Romanian economy to withstand potential adverse developments. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR's website on 9 April 2019, at 3:00 p.m. In line with the announced calendar, the next monetary policy meeting of the NBR Board is scheduled for 13 May 2019, when a new quarterly Inflation Report is to be examined."
Poland,2019-04-03,"Warsaw, 3 April 2019 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 2-3 April 2019 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: â–ª reference rate at 1.50%; â–ª lombard rate at 2.50%; â–ª deposit rate at 0.50%; â–ª rediscount rate at 1.75%. Incoming data confirm a weakening in some of the largest economies, amid persistent uncertainty about the outlook for global activity over the coming quarters. Information on the euro area indicates continued low economic growth in this region at the beginning of the year. In the United States, economic conditions remain good, although GDP growth probably slowed down in 2019 Q1. In China activity growth continues to gradually decline. Despite a rise in global oil prices at the beginning of 2019, their current level is still lower than in 2018 Q3. This is translating into moderate inflation in many countries. Alongside that, core inflation in the environment of the Polish economy, including the euro area, remains low. The European Central Bank has extended the period of keeping interest rates at the current level, including the deposit rate below zero. Moreover, it has announced launching additional operations providing liquidity to the banking sector. The US Federal Reserve has kept interest rates unchanged. At the same time, the Fed has announced it will stop reducing the size of its balance sheet in the coming quarters. In Poland, economic conditions remain good, although incoming data indicate that the GDP growth in 2019 Q1 was softer than in 2018 Q4. Activity growth is driven by rising consumption  albeit at a slightly lower rate than in previous quarters  fuelled by increasing employment and wages as well as very high consumer sentiment. This is accompanied by a rise in investment. Notwithstanding relatively high economic growth and wages rising faster than in previous years, annual consumer price growth remains at a low level. Inflation net of food and energy prices also continues to be low, despite some increase in recent months. In the Council's assessment, the outlook for economic conditions in Poland remains favourable. However, in the quarters to come, there will probably be a gradual slowdown in GDP growth. At the same time, inflation will remain at a moderate level and, in the monetary policy transmission horizon, will stay close to the target. The Council judges that the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability."
India,2019-04-04,"First Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2019-20 Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) Reserve Bank of India On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today decided to: reduce the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 25 basis points to 6.0 per cent from 6.25 per cent with immediate effect. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF stands adjusted to 5.75 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate to 6.25 per cent. The MPC also decided to maintain the neutral monetary policy stance. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Assessment Global Economy 2. Since the last MPC meeting in February 2019, global economic activity has been losing pace. In the US, the subdued performance in the final quarter of 2018 appears to have continued into Q1:2019 as reflected in declining factory activity. The Euro area slowed down in Q4:2018 on soft domestic demand and contracting manufacturing activity. Of its constituents, the Italian economy contracted for two consecutive quarters in Q3 and Q4. In the UK, growth slowed down on Brexit uncertainty, with industrial production contracting during September-January. The Japanese economy rebounded in Q4 on increased domestic consumption expenditure and recovering investment spending. However, the latest data on manufacturing activity and business confidence suggest that growth lost momentum in Q1:2019. The monetary policy stances of the US Fed and central banks in other major advanced economies (AEs) have turned dovish. Economic activity also slowed down in some major emerging market economies (EMEs). The Chinese economy decelerated in Q4:2018 on subdued domestic and global demand impacting industrial activity. Much of this weakness seems to have continued into 2019 as reflected in low 12018 on a weak note; going into 2019, available economic indicators for Q1 suggest that economic activity remained restrained by both weak domestic and external demand. The South African economy slowed down in the final quarter of 2018. Subdued industrial activity and worsening external demand point to a further loss in momentum in Q1. Crude oil prices have risen on production cuts by OPEC and Russia as well as disruption in supplies due to US sanctions on exports from Venezuela. Gold prices weakened on expectations of positive outcomes of the China-US trade deal. Inflation continued to remain low in major AEs and many key EMEs due to slowing global growth and stable or falling commodity prices. Financial markets continued to be driven by monetary policy stances of key central banks and movements in crude oil prices. In the US, the equity market witnessed some selling pressure in the last week of March on weak economic data. Equity markets in EMEs gained, benefitting from country-specific factors and easing of global financing conditions. Bond yields in the US softened, slipped into negative territory in Germany and dipped further into negative territory in Japan as central banks signalled softer stances. Bond yields in most EMEs have been falling in tandem with those in AEs and on the improving inflation outlook. In currency markets, the US dollar has traded with an appreciating bias in recent weeks. EME currencies have traded with a depreciating bias on country-specific factors and on fears of a weakening economic outlook in China. Domestic Economy 6. Turning to the domestic economy, the second advance estimates for 2018-19 released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) in February 2019 revised India's real gross domestic product (GDP) growth downwards to 7.0 per cent from 7.2 per cent in the first advance estimates. Domestic economic activity decelerated for the third consecutive quarter in Q3:2018-19 due to a slowdown in consumption, both public and private. However, gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) growth remained in double digits for the fifth consecutive quarter in Q3, with the GFCF to GDP ratio rising to 33.1 per cent in Q3:2018-19 against 31.8 per cent in Q3:2017-18, supported primarily by the government's thrust on the road sector and affordable housing. The drag on aggregate demand from net exports also moderated in Q3 due to a marginal acceleration in exports and a sharp deceleration in imports led by a decline in crude oil prices. On the supply side, the second advance estimates of the CSO placed the growth of real gross value added (GVA) lower at 6.8 per cent in 2018-19 as compared with 6.9 per cent in 2017-18. GVA growth slowed down to 6.3 per cent in Q3 due to a deceleration in agriculture output from the record level achieved in the previous year. Industrial GVA growth remained unchanged in Q3, with manufacturing GVA growth slowing somewhat. Services GVA growth also remained unchanged in Q3; while growth in construction activity accelerated, there was some loss of momentum in public administration, defence and other services. Beyond Q3, the second advance estimates of foodgrains production for 2018-19 at 281.4 million tonnes were 1.2 per cent lower than the fourth advance estimates of 2017-18, but 1.4 per cent higher than the second advance estimates of 2017-18. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the US. El NiÃ±o conditions strengthened during February 2019, which may affect the prospects of a normal south west monsoon. Of the high frequency indicators of industry, the manufacturing component of the index of industrial production (IIP) growth slowed down to 1.3 per cent in January 2019 due to automobiles, pharmaceuticals, and machinery and equipment. The growth of eight core industries remained 23 from 74.8 per cent in Q2 exceeding its long-term average; the seasonally adjusted CU rose to 76.1 per cent from 75.4 per cent. The business assessment index of the industrial outlook survey (IOS) points to an improvement in overall sentiments in Q4. The manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) remained in expansion zone for 20th month in March. The key indicators of investment activity contracted, viz., production of capital goods in January and imports of capital goods in February. High frequency indicators of the services sector suggest significant moderation in activity. Sales of commercial vehicles contracted during February. Other indicators of the transportation sector, viz., port freight traffic and international air freight traffic, also contracted. However, indicators of the construction sector, viz., consumption of steel and production of cement, continued to show healthy growth. The hotels sub-segment showed some improvement in foreign tourist arrivals in January and international air passenger traffic in February. The services PMI continued to be in expansion zone for the tenth consecutive month in March 2019. Retail inflation, measured by y-o-y change in the CPI, rose to 2.6 per cent in February after four months of continuous decline. The uptick in inflation was driven by an increase in prices of items excluding food and fuel and weaker momentum of deflation in the food group. However, inflation in the fuel group collapsed to its lowest print in the new all India CPI series. Within the food group, deflation in four sub-groups  vegetables, sugar, pulses and fruits  continued in February. Egg prices moved into inflation after remaining in deflation in previous three months, while inflation ticked up in all other food sub-groups. Inflation in the fuel and light sub-group collapsed from 4.5 per cent in December to 1.2 per cent in February. Prices of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) declined sharply, pulled down by the lagged impact of the softening of international energy prices. The prices of firewood, with the second largest weight in the fuel group, also declined. Electricity slipped into deflation in January and February. Inflation in kerosene remained elevated, however, reflecting the impact of the calibrated increase in its administered price. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel declined to 5.2 per cent in January, but rose to 5.4 per cent in February, driven by a broad-based pick-up in inflation in the personal care and effects, and recreation and amusement sub-groups. However, inflation in the clothing and footwear, and transport and communication sub-groups fell, the latter reflecting the reduction in petrol and diesel prices. Inflation in the health and education sub-groups remained elevated, even though it moderated markedly during January-February vis-Ã -vis December. Inflation expectations, measured by the Reserve Bank's survey of households, declined in the February round over the previous round by 40 basis points each for the three months ahead and for the one year ahead horizons. Firms participating in the Reserve Bank's industrial outlook survey of manufacturing companies reported reduction in input price pressures, but they expected an increase in staff expenses in Q1:2019-20. Farm and industrial input costs increased at a slow pace in January- February 2019. Nominal growth in rural wages and staff costs in the organised manufacturing and services sectors remained muted in Q3:2018-19. From a daily net average surplus of â‚¹27,928 crore (â‚¹279 billion) during February 1-6, 2019, systemic liquidity moved into deficit during February 7 - March 31, reflecting the build-up of government cash balances. Currency in circulation expanded sharply in February-March. The 343 crore (â‚¹570 billion) in March. The weighted average call rate (WACR) remained broadly aligned with the policy repo rate in February and March. Anticipating the seasonal tightening of liquidity at end-March, the Reserve Bank conducted four longer term (tenor ranging between 14-day and 56-day) variable rate repo auctions during the month in addition to the regular 14-day variable rate term repo auctions. Furthermore, the Reserve Bank conducted long-term foreign exchange buy/sell swaps of US$ 5 billion for a tenor of 3 years on March 26, 2019, thereby injecting durable liquidity of â‚¹34,561 crore (â‚¹346 billion) into the system. Export growth remained weak in January and February 2019 mainly due to exports of petroleum products decelerating in response to a fall in international crude oil prices. Among non-oil exports, engineering goods, chemicals, leather and marine products recorded either sequentially lower or negative growth. As in the case of exports, lower international crude oil prices downsized the oil import bill. Non-oil non-gold imports declined sharply, dragged down by the subdued demand for pearls and precious stones, transport equipment, project goods and vegetable oils. The trade deficit narrowed in February 2019  both sequentially and on a year-on-year basis  to its lowest level in 17 months. This, along with the increase in services exports and lower outgo of income payments, resulted in narrowing of the current account deficit sequentially. On the financing side, net FDI inflows were strong in April-January 2018-19. Foreign portfolio investors turned net buyers in the domestic capital market in Q4:2018-19. India's foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 412.9 billion on March 31, 2019. Outlook 19. In the sixth bi-monthly monetary policy resolution of February 2019. CPI inflation was projected at 2.8 per cent for Q4:2018-19, 3.2-3.4 per cent for H1:2019-20 and 3.9 per cent for Q3:2019-20, with risks broadly balanced around the central trajectory. Actual inflation outcomes averaged 2.3 per cent in January-February. The inflation path during 2019-20 is likely to be shaped by several factors. First, low food inflation during January-February will have a bearing on the near-term inflation outlook. Second, the fall in the fuel group inflation witnessed at the time of the February policy has become accentuated. Third. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel in February was lower than expected, which has imparted some downward bias to headline inflation. Fourth, international crude oil prices have increased by around 10 per cent since the last policy. Fifth, inflation expectations of households as well as input and output price expectations of producers polled in the Reserve Bank's surveys have further moderated. Taking into consideration these factors and assuming a normal monsoon in 2019, the path of CPI inflation is revised downwards to 2.4 per cent in Q4:2018-19, 2.9-3.0 per cent in H1:2019-20 and 3.5-3.8 per cent in H2:2019-20, with risks broadly balanced. GDP growth for 2019-20 in the February policy was projected at 7.4 per cent in the range of 7.2-7.4 per cent in H1, and 7.5 per cent in Q3  with risks evenly balanced. Since then, there are some signs of domestic investment activity weakening as reflected in a slowdown in production and imports of capital goods. The moderation of growth in the global economy might impact India's exports. On the positive side, however, higher financial flows to the commercial sector augur well for economic activity. Private consumption, which has remained resilient, is also expected to get a fillip from public spending in rural areas and an increase in disposable incomes of households due to tax benefits. Business expectations continue to be optimistic. Taking into consideration the above 45 basis points and maintain the neutral stance of monetary policy. Dr.Pami Dua. Dr.Ravindra H. Dholakia. Dr.Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted in favour of the decision to reduce the policy repo rate by 25 basis points. Dr.Chetan Ghate and Dr.Viral V.

Israel,2019-04-08,"The inflation environment stabilized slightly above the lower bound of the target range. In the past 9 months, except for December 2018, the annual inflation rate has been 1.2 percent or higher. In the coming months, annual inflation is expected to be slightly above the lower bound of the target, and 1-year expectations and forecasts from the various sources hover near it. Medium-term and long-term forward expectations are slightly below the midpoint of the target. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the economy grew at a rate in line with the long term pace, and indicators of activity support the assessment that the economy continued to grow at a solid pace in the first quarter as well. Labor market data show that it remains tight: the unemployment rate declined slightly, the employment rate stabilized at a record high level, and the increase in wages continues. However, several indicators point to a possible moderation in the labor market. The global macroeconomic picture continues to point to moderation in the growth and inflation rates,and growth forecasts for most regions were revised downward again. The slowdownin world trade is becoming more severe, and includes emerging markets as well. Major central banks signaled that the process of monetary contraction will cease for now. Since the last interest rate decision, the shekel strengthened by 1.2 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. If the appreciation continues, it could delay the inflation rate's rise toward the midpoint of the target. The Committee assesses that the rising path of the interest rate in the future will be gradual and cautious, in a manner that supports a process at the end of which inflation will stabilizearound the midpoint of the target range, and that supports economic activity. The Bank of Israel continues to monitor developments in inflation, the real economy, fiscal policy, the financial markets, and the global economy, and will act to attain the monetary policy targets in accordance with such developments. For the file of figures accompanying this notice, click here. The CPI for February increased by 0.1 percent, higher than the assessments prior to its publication, and in the past 9 months, excluding December, the annual inflation rate was 1.2 percent or higher (Figure 1 in the attached file of figures). The adjusted indices are near the lower bound of the target range (Figure 2). Inflation in nontradables, an approximation of the domestic component of inflation, continued to increase, reaching approximately 2.5 percent, while inflation in tradables continued to decline, reaching a negative annual rate of -0.7 percent (Figure 3).In the coming months, inflation is expected to be slightly above the lower bound of the target, and 1-year expectations and forecasts from the various sources are hovering near it (Figure 4). According to the Research Department's staff forecast, inflation in the next four quarters is expected to be 1.3 percent. Medium-term and long-term forward expectations are slightly below the midpoint of the target range (Figure 5). Since the previous interest rate decision, the shekel appreciated by 1.2 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. It strengthened by 0.5 percent against the dollar, and by 1.7 percent against the euro (Figure 7) If the appreciation continues, it could delay the inflation rate's rise toward the midpoint of the target. Trading on equity indices in Israel was mixed since the previous interest rate decision, and at the end of the first quarter of 2019, the declines from the fourth quarter of 2018 had been largely offset (Figure 8). The gap between government bond yields in the US and the yields on parallel bonds in Israel narrowed slightly (Figure 9). Yield spreads between corporate bonds in Israel and comparable government bonds continued to decline (Figure 10). The second estimate of National Accounts data by the Central Bureau of Statistics also shows that economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2018 was in line with the long-term rate, and it is clear that the slowdown in mid-2018 was transitory (Figure 13). Most of the indicators of economic activity support the assessment that the economy continued to grow solidly in the first quarter: The Composite State of the Economy Index for February increased by 0.3 percent, similar to its rate of increase during 2018 (Figure 14), and there is a slight recovery apparent in goods exports (Figure 15). Labor market data indicate that it remains tight: the unemployment rate declined slightly, the employment rate is stable at a record high level (Figure 17), and wage increases are continuing, led by the business sector (Figure 18). These factors support the assessment that the economy remains in a full employment environment. However, some industries are showing an apparent slight easing in the labor shortage constraint as reported by employers, and the job vacancy rate remains elevated but is declining moderately. According to the Research Department's staff forecast. GDP is expected to grow in 2019 by 3.2 percent, a slightly lower rate than in the previous forecast, and by 3.5 percent in 2020. The economy is expected to grow in those years at a rate slightly higher than the long-term pace, as a result of significant activity by a number of large companies. In thepast year, home prices declined by approximately 0.7 percent (Figure 11). The number of transactions continued to increase, particularly among first-time home buyers, alongside the prolonged decline in investment in residential construction. Mortgage volume continues to expand, and mortgage interest rates remained stable (Figure 12). The global macroeconomic picture continues to indicate moderation in both the growth and inflation rates. The main risks include a possible escalation of the trade war (despite progress in contacts between the US and China), and concern over a no-deal Brexit in the UK. Investment houses again revised their growth forecasts downward for most regions, particularly for Europe (Figure 19). The slowdown in world trade is worsening, and includes the emerging economies (Figure 20). In the financial markets, there were increases in the equity indices (Figure 21), and declines in government bond yields in view of the expectation that the process of global monetary contraction will be halted for now. In the US, the pace of inflation moderated, and the Fed left the federal funds rate unchanged (Figure 22), and interest rate forecasts were revised downward. In addition, the Fed announced its intention to end its balance-sheet contraction earlier than had been expected. In Europe, economic activity continues to lose momentum and sentiment indices continue to weaken. The ECB left its interest rate unchanged, and revised its growth and inflation forecasts downward, but noted that the chances of falling into a recession are very low. In addition, the ECB renewed its program of providing credit to the commercial banks in order to support economic activity in the eurozone. In the UK, risk remained high due to Brexit, and uncertainty is expected to weigh on economic activity in the coming months. In Japan, economic activity has moderated since the beginning of the year, following some recovery in the fourth quarter of 2018. There is relative stability in emerging markets, although economic activity is expected to moderate. Growth in China continued to weaken in the first quarter. Oil prices continued to increase, impacted by the decline in supply, further to the sharp increases since the beginning of the year (Figure 24). The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on April 18, 2019. The next decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 onMonday. May 20, 2019."
Euroarea,2019-04-10,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We continue to expect them to remain at their present levels at least through the end of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. We intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation continues to move towards the Governing Council's inflation aim in a sustained manner. Details on the precise terms of the new series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) will be communicated at one of our forthcoming meetings. In particular, the pricing of the new TLTRO-III operations will take into account a thorough assessment of the bank-based transmission channel of monetary policy, as well as further developments in the economic outlook. In the context of our regular assessment, we will also consider whether the preservation of the favourable implications of negative interest rates for the economy requires the mitigation of their possible side effects, if any, on bank intermediation. The information that has become available since the last Governing Council meeting in early March confirms slower growth momentum extending into the current year. While there are signs that some of the idiosyncratic domestic factors dampening growth are fading, global headwinds continue to weigh on euro area growth developments. The persistence of uncertainties, related to geopolitical factors, the threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets, is leaving marks on economic sentiment. At the same time, further employment gains and rising wages continue to underpin the resilience of the domestic economy and gradually rising inflation pressures. However, an ample degree of monetary accommodation remains necessary to safeguard favourable financing conditions and support the economic expansion, and thus to ensure that inflation remains on a sustained path towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Significant monetary policy stimulus is being provided by our forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates, reinforced by the reinvestments of the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the new series of TLTROs. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro area real GDP rose by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the fourth quarter of 2018, following an increase of 0.1% in the third quarter. Incoming data continue to be weak, especially for the manufacturing sector, mainly on account of the slowdown in external demand, which has been compounded by some country and sector-specific factors. As the impact of these factors is turning out to be somewhat longer-lasting, the slower growth momentum is expected to extend into the current year. Looking ahead, the effect of these adverse factors is expected to unwind. The euro area expansion will continue to be supported by favourable financing conditions, further employment gains and rising wages, and the ongoing  albeit somewhat slower  expansion in global activity. The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the downside, on account of the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors, the threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.4% in March 2019, after 1.5% in February, reflecting mainly a decline in food, services and non-energy industrial goods price inflation. On the basis of current futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to decline over the coming months. Measures of underlying inflation remain generally muted, but labour cost pressures have strengthened and broadened amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets. Looking ahead, underlying inflation is expected to increase over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion and rising wage growth. Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth increased to 4.3% in February 2019, from 3.8% in January. Looking through some volatility in monthly flows. M3 growth continues to be backed by bank credit creation, notwithstanding a recent moderation in credit dynamics. The narrow monetary aggregate M1 remained the main contributor to broad money growth. The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations rebounded to 3.7% in February 2019, from 3.4% in January, reflecting mainly a base effect. Looking through short-term volatility, the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations has moderated in recent months, reflecting the typical lagged reaction to the slowdown in economic growth. At the same time, the annual growth rate of loans to households remained broadly unchanged at 3.3% in February. The euro area bank lending survey for the first quarter of 2019 suggests that overall bank lending conditions remained favourable. Our monetary policy measures, including the new series of TLTROs that we announced in March, will help to safeguard favourable bank lending conditions and will continue to support access to financing, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is still necessary for the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute more decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential and reducing vulnerabilities. The implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up to increase resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost euro area productivity and growth potential. Regarding fiscal policies, the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance and the operation of automatic stabilisers are providing support to economic activity. At the same time, countries where government debt is high need to continue rebuilding fiscal buffers. All countries should reinforce their efforts to achieve a more growth-friendly composition of public finances. Likewise, the transparent and consistent implementation of the European Union's fiscal and economic governance framework over time and across countries remains essential to bolster the resilience of the euro area economy. Improving the functioning of Economic and Monetary Union remains a priority. The Governing Council welcomes the ongoing work and urges further specific and decisive steps to complete the banking union and the capital markets union."
Peru,2019-04-11,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR APRIL 2019 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 2.75% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 2.75 percent. This decision takes into account the following factors: In March, the YoY inflation rate and trend inflation indicators showed levels within the inflation target range; The expected YoY rate of inflation decreased to 2.33 percent in March; Indicators of non-primary economic activity continue showing signs of dynamism, even though production remains below its potential, and There are still risks in terms of global economic activity, although lower volatility has been observed in international financial markets. The YoY inflation rate is projected to remain within the target range and around 2.0 percent in the forecast horizon. The Board considers that it is appropriate to maintain an expansionary policy stance while inflation expectations remain anchored, in a context in which the level of economic activity is below its potential level. Recent indicators of inflation and activity reflect the following: Inflation in March showed a rate of 0.73 percent, as a result of which the YoY inflation rate registered 2.25 percent in March 2019. Moreover, the monthly rate of inflation excluding food and energy prices was 1.02 percent, as a result of which the YoY rate was 2.6 percent in March due to specific factors, such as the increase in tuition and education fees. Indicators of business expectations remain on the optimistic side. Furthermore, indicators of non-primary economic activity continue pointing to a gradual closure of the output gap. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 1.50 percent. Direct security and currency repos and rediscount operations: 3.30 percent for the first 10 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 10 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 3.30 percent. The Monetary Program for the month of May will be approved on the Board meeting to be held on May 9, 2019."
Kazakhstan,2019-04-16,"– 11 The base rate reduced to 9.00% April 16, 2019 Almaty The National Bank of Kazakhstan has made a decision to reduce the base rate to the level of 9.00% with a corridor of +/-1 percentage point. In March the annual inflation rate formed below the midpoint of the target range. At the same time inflation expectations continued declining. There were several positive tendencies observed in the external market: the slowdown of inflation in the countries  main trade partners, as well as the price increase in the global commodity market. The next decision on the base rate will be made depending on the correspondence of actual inflation and forecast for this year and expectations for 2020. In March the annual inflation amounted to 4.8% (in comparison, it was 5.3% in December 2018). The prices of non-food products revealed a gradual deceleration of the annual dynamic, reaching 6.0% at the end of March (6.4% in December 2018). In March 2019 food prices grew by 6.7%, compared to the March of 2018 (5.1% in December 2018), which made the largest contribution to the growth of inflation. The annual price increase for paid services slowed down to 1.2% (4.5% in December 2018), which is associated with measures taken to reduce tariffs for natural monopolies' services. Inflation expectations resumed declining amid the low level of inflation. According to the results of the March round of households' surveys, the value of expected inflation 12 months ahead amounted to 4.5%. The formation of inflation expectations below the level of inflation will make a favorable impact on inflation stabilization in the future. The growth of economic activity continued along with the income of the population. In the end of February the short-term economic indicator amounted to 104.2% in annual terms. A positive contribution to the growth was added by the construction industry (8.9%), trade (7.2%), mining (4.8%), transport (4.4%), and agriculture (3.6%). In the past 3 months, the growth of investment in fixed capital amounted to 7.0%, compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. The domestic demand is stimulated by the growth of real money income of the population (growth by 9.4% in annual terms in January-February), as well as a persistent tendency of expanding consumer lending portfolio in the banking sector (growth by 13.5% in annual terms in February). The external environment is considered to be moderately positive. The oil prices are formed at a high level (from the beginning of the year the average Brent price has been formed at 64 US dollars per barrel). External monetary conditions have not changed significantly, compared to the previous episode of decision-making on the base rate; their current impact is considered as neutral. The inflation in China and the European Union is formed below their target levels. Nevertheless, the risk of importing high inflation from Russia persists. Despite the reduction of the base rate, monetary conditions remain neutral. The current decision on the base rate will allow maintaining control over the prevailing inflationary background in order to keep inflation within the target range of 4-6% in 2019-2020 and helping to sustain the economic growth as much as possible. The next decision on the base rate will be announced on June 3, 2019, at 17:00 Nur- Sultan time.

South Korea,2019-04-18,"Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.75% for the intermeeting period. This press release is the English version of the Bank of Korea's policy statement. In the case of any inconsistency, the original version in Korean will prevail. The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.75% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Board considers that the pace of global economic growth has continued to slow. Volatility in the global financial markets increased temporarily. Government bond yields in major countries have fallen considerably, in line mainly with concerns about the global economic slowdown and changes in expectations about the monetary policies of such countries, while the exchange rates of some vulnerable emerging economies have risen significantly. Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and the global financial markets as likely to be affected by factors such as the degree of the spread of trade protectionism, the changes in the monetary policies of major countries, and the uncertainties concerning Brexit. The Board judges that the pace of domestic economic growth has moderated somewhat as consumption growth has temporarily slowed, facilities and construction investment have continued undergoing adjustments and export growth has continued to slow. The sluggishness in employment conditions has partially lessened, with the increase in the number of persons employed having risen. Going forward the Board expects that consumption will continue to grow, while exports and facilities investment will also recover gradually toward the second half of this year, although the adjustment in construction investment will continue. GDP is forecast to grow at the mid-2% level this year, slightly below the level projected in January (2.6%). Consumer price inflation has slowed to the mid-0% range, in consequence mainly of declines in the prices of petroleum products and agricultural, livestock and fisheries products. Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has been at the upper-0% level, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has been in the low- to mid-2% range. Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will fluctuate for some time below 1%, lower than the path projected in January, and then run at the low- to mid-1% level from the second half of this year. Core inflation will also gradually rise. The volatility of price variables in the domestic financial markets has expanded slightly. Long-term market interest rates and stock prices have rebounded after having fallen, affected by movements in the global financial markets in line with projections of weakening growth in major countries and expectations of progress in the US-China trade negotiations. The Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has risen, in line with the strengthening of the US dollar. The rate of increase in household lending has continued to slow, while housing prices have continued their downtrend. Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As it is expected that the domestic economy will continue to grow at a rate that does not diverge significantly from its potential level and it is forecast that inflationary pressures on the demand side will not be high, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance. In this process it will carefully monitor developments such as conditions related to trade with major countries, any changes in the economies and monetary policies of major countries, financial and economic conditions in emerging market economies, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks, while examining their effects on domestic growth and inflation."
Ukraine,2019-04-25,"The NBU Board has decided to cut the key policy rate to 17.5% per annum effective 26 April 2019. Inflation declining steadily towards the target of 5% allows the National Bank of Ukraine to start the cycle of key policy rate cuts. At the same time, the NBU Board sees risks that may hinder these plans. In March 2019, annual consumer price inflation continued to slow and reached 8.6%, which was in line with the NBU's latest forecast. Core inflation declined even faster than expected (to 7.6%). This evidenced that underlying inflationary pressures continued to weaken in early 2019. The decline in inflation was supported by the NBU's tight monetary policy, which was one of the reasons for the strengthening of the hryvnia. This impacted the prices of imported goods and goods that have a substantial import content. Despite the electoral events, the situation on the Ukrainian financial market remains benign and inflation expectations continue to improve among households, businesses, banks, and financial analysts. In addition to monetary factors, an increase in the domestic supply of some food products and lower global food prices also dampened inflationary pressures. Inflation will continue to decline gradually. The NBU reiterates that inflation will decline to 6.3% at year-end 2019 and reach 5.0% at the end of 2020. Inflation will enter the target range of 5% +/- 1 pp already in early 2020, in line with the forecast. This will be the result of tight monetary conditions and restrained fiscal policy. The major factors behind the further decline in inflation also include:. slower growth in wages, which are gradually converging with wages in neighboring countries, as a result of weaker migration processesappreciation of the hryvnia in Q1 2019, which will limit growth in prices for nonfood goodslower global prices for natural gas that will pass through to domestic priceslarger supply of both domestic and imported food products.These factors will also contribute to the continued slowdown of core inflation to 5.0% this year and 3.7% in the subsequent year. The expected increase in some tariffs to the market levels and higher excise taxes on alcoholic and tobacco products will restrain the decline in inflation. Economic growth will slow in 2019 to rebound in 2020. As well as in January, the NBU forecasts a slowdown in economic growth to 2.5%. This will be due to a slowdown in the global economy and trade, restrained fiscal policy resulting from the need to repay large volumes of public debt, and tight monetary conditions required to bring inflation to its target. Moreover, the harvest of grains and oil crops is expected to be lower compared to the bumper crop of 2018. Private consumption will remain the main driver of economic growth. However, its growth will decelerate due to a slower growth in real household income  wages, pensions, and remittances from abroad. Investment demand will be limited by political uncertainty in the year of presidential and parliamentary elections. Growth in real GDP will accelerate to 2.9% in 2020 and 3.7% in 2021. The growth will be propelled by a gradual easing of monetary policy, which will bolster domestic demand, and spur investment activity as the election cycle is over. Economic growth will be restrained by decreased volumes of natural gas transit to Europe as a result of the construction of bypass pipelines. In 2019, the current account deficit is projected to stay at the previous year's level, at 3.3% of GDP, due to various factors. Proceeds from selling the last year's record harvest of corn and the effect of favorable trade conditions will be offset as economies of Ukraine's main trading partners cool. This will affect exports and the amount remittances from labor migrants. In future, the current account deficit will widen slightly, to reach 4% of GDP in 2021, as a result of a decrease in natural gas transit and weak demand from the main trading partners caused by stronger investment demand on domestic markets. The continued fulfillment of Ukraine's obligations under cooperation program with the International Monetary Fund remains the basic assumption of the macroeconomic forecast. This will allow Ukraine to attract other official financing, improve the conditions of access to international capital markets, and support active interest of nonresidents in hryvnia-denominated domestic government bonds. These borrowings will make it possible for the government to repay external public debt, the repayments of which will peak in 20192020. Inflows of debt capital and investments to the private sector will continue as well. As a result, international reserves will hover around USD 2122 billion during this and subsequent years. The usual increase in uncertainty during presidential and parliamentary elections poses the main internal risk to the said macroeconomic forecast (in particular, to inflation declining to the target in 2020). The NBU will consider this risk in its monetary decisions mainly due to its impact on the financial market and inflation expectations. The following external risks are also important:. the global recession and lower raw commodity pricesstronger geopolitical tensions, particularly due to the uncertainty around Brexituncertainty over the volume of gas transit through Ukraine starting in 2020, as pipelines bypassing the country are being built to deliver gas to European escalation of the military conflict and new trade restrictions introduced by Russia.Considering the revised macroeconomic forecast and the balance of risks, the NBU Board has decided to lower its key policy rate to 17.5%. As it initiates an easing cycle, the NBU Board points out that the further steps will depend on the realization of inflation risks and an improvement in inflation expectations. However, despite that there are macroeconomic preconditions for the cycle of key policy rate cuts, this process might be impeded by materialization of risks to financial stability (mentioned in the statement of the Financial Stability Council last week) and to the central bank`s independence. The NBU will closely monitor the developments in Ukraine and, in case such risks materialize, is ready to react using monetary instruments. The decision to cut the key policy rate to 17.5% is approved by NBU Board Decision No.311-D On the Key Policy Rate dated 25 April 2019. A new detailed macroeconomic forecast will be published in the Inflation Report on 3 May 2019. A summary of the discussion by Monetary Policy Committee members that preceded this decision will be published on 6 May 2019. The next meeting of the NBU Board on monetary policy issues will be held on 6 June 2019 as scheduled."
Colombia,2019-04-26,"The Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica, in its meeting today, unanimously decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 4.25%. The Board took into consideration the following information. The average of core inflation indicators (2.82%) did not change, and remained below the target. Inflation expectations to different terms exhibited no significant changes, standing around observed inflation. In March, inflation rose and stood at 3.21%, mainly explained by the performance of the food and regulated items groups. Despite the recent positive growth data from the United States and China, the prospects for global growth continued to moderate. The market expects the Fed's benchmark rate to remain stable or decrease in the following two years. For 2019, the technical staff at the Central Bank continues projecting a growth figure of 3.5%, and estimates that the spare capacity of the economy will decline. Based on this information, the Board considered the following factors for its decision. Observed inflation will be close to the target, and the upside risks are low. The spare capacity and the uncertainty around the pace with which it may reduce remain, as was estimated in the previous meeting of the Board. The effects of external conditions on the Colombian economy remain uncertain. In this environment, upon assessing the economic situation and the risk balance, the Board deemed appropriate to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 4.25%, with which monetary policy continues to be slightly expansionary. The Board will continue to carefully monitor the behavior of inflation and the forecasts for economic activity, as well as the international situation and the performance of the balance of payments. Finally, the Board reiterates that monetary policy will depend on the availability of new information. Fecha de publicacion."
Russia,2019-04-26,"On 26 April 2019, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to keep the key rate at 7.75% per annum. Annual inflation passed the local peak in March and started to subside in April. Consumer prices current growth rates track somewhat below the Bank of Russia forecast. In April, inflation expectations of households rose slightly after a tangible drop in March. Business price expectations continued to decline but remain at an elevated level. Short-term proinflationary risks have abated. The Bank of Russia's decisions to raise the key rate made in September and December 2018 were sufficient to curb the effects of one-off proinflationary factors. According to the Bank of Russia's forecast, annual inflation will return to 4% in the first half of 2020. In its key rate decision-making, the Bank of Russia will take into account inflation and economic dynamics against the forecast, as well as risks posed by external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia admits the possibility of turning to cutting the key rate in Q2-Q3 2019. Inflation dynamics. In March, annual inflation passed the local peak. The annual consumer price growth rate increased to 5.3% in March (from 5.2% in February 2019). In April, annual inflation started to slow down and declined to 5.1%, according to the estimate as of 22 April. Consumer prices current growth rates tend to be somewhat below the Bank of Russia's forecast. The VAT increase pass-through to prices has largely materialised. The Bank of Russia's pre-emptive key rate hikes in September and December 2018 helped return annualised monthly consumer price growth rates to levels close to 4%. Consumer demand trends constrain inflation. Also, temporary disinflationary factors contributed to slowing consumer price growth, among those ruble appreciation since the beginning of the year, and declining prices for principal types of motor fuel and certain food products in March-April compared to February readings. In April, inflation expectations of households rose slightly after a tangible drop in March. Business price expectations continued to decline but remain at an elevated level. According to the Bank of Russia's forecast, annual inflation will return to 4% in the first half of 2020. Monetary conditions. Monetary conditions have seen no significant changes since the last Board meeting. OFZ yields, as well as deposit and lending rates held close to their March-end readings. That said, the year-to-date decline in OFZ yields creates conditions for the decline of deposit and lending rates in the future. Economic activity. Rosstat's revision of 2014-2018 GDP data has not changed the Bank of Russia's view of the current state of the economy â€” it is close to the potential. Current consumer demand trends and labour market conditions create no excessive inflationary pressure. In the first quarter, industrial production grew moderately year on year and somewhat below the reading of 2018 Q4. Investment activity remains muted. Annual retail sales growth declined in the first quarter as a result of the VAT increase and the slowdown in wage growth. The Bank of Russia expects GDP to grow by 1.2-1.7% in 2019. The VAT hike slightly constrained business activity. The incremental budget revenues will be used to raise government spending, including investment, as early as 2019. Subsequent years might see higher economic growth rates as national projects are implemented. Inflation risks. Short-term proinflationary risks have abated. With respect to internal conditions, the secondary effects of the VAT increase are seen as immaterial and accelerated price growth in certain food products became less of a risk. That said, significant risks are posed by elevated and unanchored inflation expectations, as well as by external factors. In particular, the risk of a slowdown in global economic growth still looms. Geopolitical factors might lead to strengthened volatility in global commodity and financial markets, affecting exchange rate and inflation expectations. Supply-side factors in the oil market may amplify the volatility of global oil prices. At the same time, the revision of the interest rate paths by the US Fed and other central banks in advanced economies in the first quarter constrains the risks of persistent capital outflows from emerging markets. The Bank of Russia leaves mostly unchanged its assessment of risks associated with wage movements, possible changes in consumer behaviour and budget expenditures. These risks remain moderate. In its key rate decision-making, the Bank of Russia will take into account inflation and economic dynamics against the forecast, as well as risks posed by external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia admits the possibility of turning to cutting the key rate in Q2-Q3 2019. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next rate review meeting on 14 June 2019. The Board decision press release and the medium-term forecast are to be published at 13:30 Moscow time.

Armenia,2019-04-30,"PRESS RELEASE 30.04.2019 In the April 30, 2019 meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia decided to leave the refinancing rate unchanged, at a 5.75% level. There was 0.1% inflation in March of 2019, as much as in the same period of the previous year, in which case the 12-month inflation rate remained unchanged, 1.9%. The core inflation rate behaved similarly steady, amounting to 0.2% in March, while for a 12-month period it stayed on a 1.3% level, as was recorded in the previous month. Sluggish global economic growth rates are in line with the Central Bank's forecasts, reflecting a weakening global demand and a low inflation environment persisting in international markets of basic commodities. In the meantime, central banks of leading countries prepare to provide for milder-than- expected monetary conditions. In view of these developments, the Board of the Central Bank considers that inflationary pressures from the external sector in the upcoming months are not likely. The Board states that economic activity in January-March of 2019 was higher, consistent with predictions, making up 6.5%, with private consumption growth remaining a key driver to growth. At the same time, according to the results of the year's past four months, the fiscal policy had a more than anticipated contractionary impact on the domestic demand, owing to the deficit that came in considerably smaller than forecasted. The assumption, however, is that the fiscal policy will mainly have a neutral impact on inflation during the year, as the contractionary effect it had on the domestic demand previously is expected to phase out in the second half of the year. In consideration of the current situation, the Board finds it reasonable to keep monetary conditions expansionary by leaving the refinancing rate unchanged. At the same time, in view of the anticipated macroeconomic developments, to leave monetary conditions expansionary for a lasting period will be needed for maintaining price stability in the medium run. As a result, the expectation is that the inflation will be running below the target in the coming months but later stabilizing around the target. It should be noted that downside risks to inflation are still persisting, which is associated with possible weaker private demand and more contractionary fiscal policy. Anyway, the Central Bank will keep a watchful eye on existing risks and the ones that may arise with an adequate monetary policy response, in order to maintain price stability in the medium run. Detailed information that underlies the decision on setting of the interest rate will be available in Press Release (Minutes on Interest Rate) to be published by May 16, 2019. Press Service of the Central Bank of Armenia."
Hungary,2019-04-30,"At its meeting on 30 April 2019, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 1 May 2019:. The Magyar Nemzeti Bank's (MNB) single anchor is inflation, its primary objective is to achieve and maintain price stability. In March 2019, inflation stood at 3.7 percent and core inflation at 3.8 percent. Core inflation excluding indirect tax effects rose from 3.2 percent in February to 3.5 percent in March. The rise in core inflation partly reflected an increase in excise taxes on tobacco products at the beginning of 2019, while the rise in fuel prices also contributed to a pick-up in the consumer price index. Regarding developments in core inflation excluding indirect tax effects, market services inflation remained broadly unchanged in March; and the increase in tradables prices reflected a few individual, volatile items. Inflation continues to show large volatility. Therefore, in assessing the outlook, the Monetary Council pays more attention to developments in the measures of underlying inflation capturing persistent trends. A dichotomy is observed between the factors determining likely developments in inflation and core inflation excluding indirect tax effects. Persistently buoyant domestic demand is boosting, and weakening external activity is restraining the pace of price increase. In the coming quarters, inflation will fluctuate around the 3 percent central bank target. Core inflation excluding indirect tax effects is expected to continue to rise until the autumn months and then to decline from the end of 2019. In 2018, the Hungarian economy grew by 4.9 percent, which was largely supported by the strong expansion in corporate and household lending. Based on the indicators received at the beginning of the year, growth in household consumption and investment is likely to continue this year. Labour demand remained strong, and the unemployment rate was close to its historically low level. The country's current account balance grew in February 2019, reflecting a stable services balance and renewed increase in the balance of goods. Economic growth is expected to slow gradually from 2019, but to remain strong. As a result of further dynamic growth in credit markets, the investment rate is likely to stabilise at high levels. Higher real incomes are expected to contribute to a further expansion in household consumption and savings. Regarding long-term, sustainable economic growth, the improvement in competitiveness by structural measures will be given increasing emphasis. The outlook for world economic activity and inflation continues to be moderate. Monetary policies across the world's leading central banks remain cautious. Consistent with the downside risks related to the economic activity in Europe and inflation in the euro area, in March the European Central Bank (ECB) shifted its first interest rate hike to a later date. As a result of this and the ECB's balance sheet policy, monetary conditions in the euro area will remain loose for a longer period of time than earlier expected. Sentiment in international financial markets has been more favourable than earlier in the period since the Council's previous interest rate decision. Risk appetite was influenced by developments in international trade policies, uncertainties related to the Brexit agreement and measures taken by the world's leading central banks. The Monetary Council left monetary conditions unchanged. Accordingly, the Council maintained the base rate, the overnight collateralised lending rate and the one-week collateralised lending rate at 0.9 percent and the overnight deposit rate at -0.05 percent. In March, the Council set the average amount of liquidity to be crowded-out for the second quarter of 2019 at least at HUF 300-500 billion and will take this into account in setting the stock of central bank swap instruments. To improve the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission, the Monetary Council will launch its corporate bond purchasing programme with a total amount of HUF 300 billion on 1 July 2019. By introducing the Bond Funding for Growth Scheme (BGS), the Council's specific objective is to promote the diversification of funding to the domestic corporate sector. The MNB will neutralise excess liquidity arising from the bond purchases by using the preferential deposit facility bearing interest at the central bank base rate. The new programme complements the Funding for Growth Scheme Fix launched at the beginning of 2019. In its decisions, the Monetary Council focuses on the maintenance of price stability. The monetary policy stance will continue to be accommodative, economic agents' financing costs will remain favourable. A dichotomy is observed between the factors determining developments in inflation. Persistently buoyant domestic demand is boosting, and weakening external activity is restraining the pace of price increase. The Monetary Council will assess the effects of this on the maintenance of price stability over the 5-8 quarter horizon of monetary policy. In its monetary policy decisions, the Council applies a cautious approach, relying mainly on the comprehensive projections for the macroeconomy and inflation in the quarterly published Inflation Report."
Georgia,2019-05-01,"01.05.2019 The National Bank of Georgia keeps its policy rate unchanged at 6.50% The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on May 1, 2019 and decided to keep the refinancing rate unchanged at 6.50 percent. Since the beginning of the year inflation has been moving around the target rate (3 percent). In March headline inflation was 3.7 percent with a significant contribution from one-off factors. Particularly, the increase in excise taxes on tobacco products at the beginning of the year contributed 1.3 percentage points to annual inflation in March. According to the current forecast, other things equal, the inflation will move towards the target level once the one-off (exogeneous) factors have faded away. It is important to note that the monetary policy is an instrument of influencing domestic demand and, generally, central banks do not react to exogeneous factors (i.e. those independent from monetary policy). Along with external risks softening, in the first quarter of 2019 the NBG continued the process of gradual exit from moderatelly tightened monetary policy (normalization process). Despite the fact that aggregate demand remains below the potential level of output, considering the still-material risks from external sector, the normalization process is expected to be implemented gradually. Therefore, the MPC deemed it necessary to leave the policy rate unchanged. Based on preliminary estimates on economic growth, inflationary pressure from aggregate demand remains weak. The credit activity growth is moderate (13 percent annual growth in March, excluding exchange rate effect). The consumer loans declined in the first month of the year, however, mortgages in national currency and business loans are accelerating. External demand continues to grow at a moderate pace. In particular, in the first quarter merchandise exports increased by 13 percent annualy. The growth in tourism revenues (5 percent) and remittances (6 percent) has also been moderate. It is worth to note that merchandise imports declined by 5 percent in the first quarter. The current dynamics in the external sector points to the improvement of current account deficit in 2019 as well. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all means and instruments at its disposal in order to ensure the price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on June 12, 2019."
United States,2019-05-01,"EDT May 1, 2019 Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity rose at a solid rate. Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Growth of household spending and business fixed investment slowed in the first quarter. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have declined and are running below 2 percent. On balance, market-based measures of inflation compensation have remained low in recent months, and survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent. The Committee continues to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes. In light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Jerome H Powell. Chair; John C. Williams. Vice Chair; Michelle W Bowman; Lael Brainard; James Bullard; Richard H Clarida; Charles L Evans; Esther L George; Randal K Quarles; and Eric S Rosengren."
Czech Republic,2019-05-02,"At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank unanimously increased the two-week repo rate (2W repo rate) by 25 basis points to 2%. At the same time, it increased the Lombard rate to 3% and the discount rate to 1%.. The decision adopted by the Bank Board is underpinned by a new macroeconomic forecast. Consistent with the forecast is a rise in domestic interest rates followed by broad interest rate stability until mid-2020. According to the external assumptions of the new forecast, economic growth in the euro area will continue to slow until mid-2019 and then accelerate slightly again. Producer price inflation in the euro area will also slow further. Consumer price inflation in the euro area will rise slightly next year but will remain below 2%. The European Central Bank clarified that it will keep its interest rates at the current level at least until the end of this year. According to the market outlook, the 3M EURIBOR will thus remain negative until the end of 2020. The price of crude oil rose during 2019 Q1 but is expected to fall slightly in the following period. The spread between three-month dollar and euro rates is expected to narrow gradually as a result of an expected decrease in the dollar rate. This should lead to a slight strengthening of the euro against the dollar. Domestic inflation will stay in the upper half of the tolerance band around the target this year. This is due to persisting domestic inflation pressures, stronger administered price inflation and renewed growth in food prices. However, the inflation pressures are now easing overall. Besides a temporary fade-out of the inflationary effect of import prices, the domestic inflation pressures are also diminishing owing to gradually falling wage growth and slower growth in economic activity. Inflation will thus decrease to the 2% target at the start of next year. This will also be fostered by a further tightening of monetary policy and the fading out of the currently high growth in administered prices. The Czech economy will grow by 2.5% this year and pick up slightly next year. The increase in economic activity will be driven by all components of domestic demand. Continued solid growth in household consumption will reflect high, albeit gradually slowing, growth in household income. Persisting labour shortages are still motivating domestic firms to invest. Government investment will also grow further, with projects co-financed from EU funds contributing significantly. Fiscal policy will also contribute to domestic demand growth this year via a rise in public sector pay, pensions and social benefits. The labour market is past its peak, but a tight labour market situation persists. Wage growth will therefore fall towards its steady-state level only gradually. The unemployment rate is at a record low, which is preventing it from decreasing further. In this context, total employment will rise more slowly as well. A markedly positive interest rate differential vis-Ã -vis the euro area and continued real convergence of the Czech economy will cause the koruna to firm gradually this year. Next year, the exchange rate will appreciate more gradually owing to the start of monetary policy normalisation by the European Central Bank. Consistent with the forecast is a rise in domestic interest rates followed by broad interest rate stability until mid-2020. The rise in rates at the start of the forecast is a reaction above all to the persisting domestic inflation pressures. The subsequent broad stability of rates until mid-2020 mainly reflects persisting negative interest rates in the euro area. By comparison with the previous forecast, the inflation outlook for this year has been raised owing to stronger price growth at the start of the year. By contrast, the forecast for growth in domestic economic activity has been lowered, due mainly to a worse external demand outlook. The koruna will appreciate more gradually this year and the next on the basis of an assumption that the global factors that have led to its broad stability since 2018 Q2 will last somewhat longer. In connection with the slower appreciation, interest rates are higher over almost the entire forecast horizon."
Malaysia,2019-05-07,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to reduce the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) to 3.00 percent. The ceiling and floor rates of the corridor for the OPR are correspondingly reduced to 3.25 percent and 2.75 percent respectively. The global economy continues to expand moderately. While growth outcomes for several major economies were better than expected during the first quarter, underlying economic conditions continue to suggest moderation going forward. Considerable downside risks to global growth remain, stemming from unresolved trade tensions and prolonged country-specific weaknesses in the major economies, further dampening global trade and investment activities. Although the tightening in global financial conditions has eased somewhat, heightened policy uncertainties could lead to sharp financial market adjustments, further weighing on the overall outlook. For Malaysia, latest developments point towards moderate economic activity in the first quarter of 2019. Looking ahead, slowing global demand conditions and subdued growth of key trading partners will continue to weigh on the external sector. Domestically, stable labour market conditions and capacity expansion in key sectors will continue to drive household and capital spending. The baseline projection is for the Malaysian economy to grow within the projected range of 4.3% - 4.8%. However, there are downside risks to growth from heightened uncertainties in the global and domestic environment, trade tensions and extended weakness in commodity-related sectors. Headline inflation increased to 0.2% in March 2019 (February: -0.4%), due mainly to the less negative transport inflation at -3.0% (February: -6.8%). Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation[1], remained stable at 1.6% in March 2019. In the immediate term, inflation is expected to remain low mainly due to policy measures. These include the price ceiling on domestic retail fuel prices until mid-2019 and the impact of the changes in consumption tax policy on headline inflation. For 2019 as a whole, average headline inflation is expected to be broadly stable compared to 2018. The trajectory of headline inflation will continue to be dependent on global oil prices. Underlying inflation is expected to remain stable, supported by the continued expansion in economic activity and in the absence of strong demand pressures. The domestic financial markets have remained resilient, despite periods of volatility primarily due to global developments. While domestic monetary and financial conditions remain supportive of economic growth, there are some signs of tightening of financial conditions. The adjustment to the OPR is therefore intended to preserve the degree of monetary accommodativeness. This is consistent with the monetary policy stance of supporting a steady growth path amid price stability. The MPC will continue to monitor and assess the balance of risks surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation. [1] Core inflation is computed by excluding price-volatile and price-administered items. It also excludes the estimated direct impact of consumption tax policy changes.

Brazil,2019-05-08,"The Copom unanimously decided to maintain the Selic rate at 6.50% p.a. The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario:. Recent data on economic activity suggest that the softening observed at the end of 2018 continued in early 2019. The Copom's baseline scenario assumes that the process of gradual economic recovery will resume. The global outlook remains challenging. On the one hand, the risks associated with normalization of interest rates in some advanced economies in the short and medium runs are low. On the other hand, the risks associated with a slowdown in global growth remain. The Committee judges that various measures of underlying inflation are running at appropriate levels. This includes the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy. Inflation expectations for 2019, 2020 and 2021 collected by the Focus survey are around 4.0%, 4.0% and 3.75%, respectively; and. The Copom's inflation projections in the scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the Focus survey stand around 4.1% for 2019 and 3.8% for 2020. This scenario assumes a path for the Selic rate that ends 2019 at 6.5% p.a. and increases to 7.5% p.a. over the course of 2020. It also assumes a path for the exchange rate that ends 2019 at R$/US$ 3.75, and 2020 at R$/US$ 3.80. In the scenario with a constant interest rate, at 6.5% p.a., and a constant exchange rate, at R$/US$ 3.95*, the projections for 2019 and 2020 stand around 4.3% and 4.0%, respectively. The Committee emphasizes that risks around its baseline scenario remain in both directions. On the one hand, the high level of economic slack may lead to a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory. On the other hand, frustration of expectations regarding the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy may affect risk premia and increase the path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy. Risk intensifies in case the global outlook for emerging economies deteriorates. The Committee judges that, although the risk associated with economic slack has increased at the margin, the balance of risks is symmetric. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the wide array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to maintain the Selic rate at 6.50% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation and the associated balance of risks, and is consistent with convergence of inflation to target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, which includes 2019 and, to a greater extent, 2020. The Copom reiterates that economic conditions prescribe stimulative monetary policy, i.e., interest rates below the structural level. The Copom emphasizes that the evolution of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy is essential to maintain low inflation in the medium and long run, for the reduction of its structural interest rate, and for sustainable economic recovery. The Committee stresses that the perception of continuation of the reform agenda affects current expectations and macroeconomic projections. In the Copom's assessment, the evolution of the baseline scenario and of the balance of risks prescribes keeping the Selic rate at its current level. The Committee deems important to observe how the Brazilian economy will behave over time, without the remaining effects of the various shocks that hit the economy last year and, especially, with reduction of the degree of uncertainty to which the Brazilian economy remains exposed. The Copom judges that this assessment takes time and should not be completed in the short run. The Copom emphasizes that the next steps in the conduct of monetary policy will continue to depend on the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, and on inflation projections and expectations. The Copom asserts that caution, serenity, and perseverance in monetary policy decisions, even in the face of volatile scenarios, have been instrumental in pursuing its primary objective of keeping the inflation path towards the targets. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Roberto Oliveira Campos Neto (Governor). Bruno Serra Fernandes. Carlos Viana de Carvalho. Carolina de Assis Barros. Joao Manoel Pinho de Mello. Mauricio Costa de Moura. Otavio Ribeiro Damaso. Paulo Srgio Neves de Souza, and Tiago Couto Berriel. *Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average R$/US$ exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the Friday prior to the Copom meeting."
Philippines,2019-05-08,"At its meeting on monetary policy today, the Monetary Board decided to reduce the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) facility by 25 basis points to 4.5 percent, effective on Friday, 10 May 2019. The interest rates on the overnight lending and deposit facilities were reduced accordingly. The Monetary Board's decision is based on its assessment that the inflation outlook continues to be manageable, with easing price pressures owing to the decline in food prices amid improved supply conditions. Latest baseline forecasts indicate that inflation remains likely to settle within the target range of 3.0 percent Â± 1.0 percentage point for both 2019 and 2020, while inflation expectations have moderated further. In deciding on the stance of monetary policy, the Monetary Board noted the impact of the budget delays on near-term economic activity, but took the view that the prospects for domestic demand remain firm, to be supported by a projected recovery in household spending and the continued implementation of the government's infrastructure program. In addition, the Monetary Board observed that the global economic growth momentum has slowed down in 2019. Meanwhile, indications of slower growth in domestic liquidity and credit require careful monitoring. At the same time, the Monetary Board also noted that the risks to the inflation outlook remain broadly balanced for 2019 amid risks of a prolonged El NiÃ±o episode and higher-than-expected increases in global oil prices. For 2020, the risks continue to lean toward the downside as weaker global economic activity could temper commodity price pressures. Looking ahead, the BSP will continue to monitor developments affecting the inflation outlook to ensure that the monetary policy stance remains consistent with its price stability objective."
Thailand,2019-05-08,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 3/2019 Mr. Titanun Mallikamas. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 8 May 2019 as follows. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 175 percent. In deliberating their policy decision, the Committee assessed that the Thai economy would expand at a slower pace than the previous assessment. Inflation was projected to be around the lower bound of the inflation target. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative and conducive to economic growth. However there were risks to financial stability in the future that warranted continued monitoring. The Committee viewed that the current accommodative monetary policy stance had contributed to the continuation of economic growth and was appropriate given the inflation target. In addition, global economic and domestic uncertainties would remain high in the period ahead. The Committee thus voted to keep the policy rate unchanged at this meeting to assess the clarity of impacts from such uncertainties. The Thai economy was expected to expand at a slower pace than previously assessed owing to merchandise exports and investment. Merchandise exports would grow at a slower pace than previously assessed due to the global economic slowdown, a down cycle of electronic products as well as impacts from trade protectionist measures between the US and China. Tourism would continue to gain traction. Regarding domestic demand, private consumption was expected to continue expanding. Nevertheless private consumption was restrained by elevated household debt and the overall employment that started to flatten out, with signs of moderation in employment in the construction and export-related manufacturing sectors. Private investment was expected to expand at a slower pace. However the relocation of production base to Thailand and public-private partnership projects for infrastructure investment would support investment in the period ahead. Meanwhile public expenditure would grow at a slower pace than previously assessed, which was partly due to delays in some public investment projects. The Committee would monitor external risks from both trade protectionist measures between the US and China, as well as the economic outlook of China and advanced economies, which could affect domestic demand. Furthermore the Committee would monitor domestic uncertainties, including policy implementation of the new government and public expenditure, as well as the progress of major infrastructure investment and its knock-on effects on private investment, which could affect momentum of economic growth in the period ahead. The annual average of headline inflation would be largely unchanged from the previous projection. The increase in energy prices since the previous meeting offsetted lower-than-expected increase in fresh food prices. Nevertheless there remained risks to inflation due to the impact of drought. Meanwhile core inflation would remain broadly unchanged from the previous projection. The Committee viewed that structural changes contributed to more persistent inflation than in the past. Such changes included the expansion of e-commerce, rising price competition, and technological development which reduced costs of production. Financial conditions over the previous period had been accommodative and conducive to economic growth, with ample liquidity in the financial system. Real interest rates remained at a low level, allowing financing by the private sector to continue expanding. Loans extended to businesses and consumers continued to grow. With regard to exchange rates, the Thai baht depreciated against the US dollar in the intermeeting period in line with regional currencies. Looking ahead, the baht would likely remain volatile due to both domestic and external uncertainties, and thus the Committee would continue to closely monitor exchange rate developments as well as their impacts on the economy. Financial stability remained sound overall but there remained a need to monitor risks that might pose vulnerabilities to financial stability in the future. The Committee viewed that the implemented macroprudential measures and the increased policy rate would to some extent help curb accumulation of vulnerabilities in the financial system from the search-for-yield behavior in the low interest rate environment that might lead to underpricing of risks. Nevertheless the Committee would monitor rising household debt accumulation driven particularly by auto-related loans, growth in assets held by saving cooperatives and the interconnectedness among saving cooperatives, adjustments in the real estate sector after the implementation of the revised loan-to-value ratio (LTV) measure, and leverage by large corporates that could underprice risks. In the following period, there remained a need to address financial stability risks through a combination of tools, including the appropriate policy interest rate as well as microprudential and macroprudential measures which would need to place greater emphasis on debt serviceability of borrowers. Looking ahead, the Thai economy was projected to continue to gain traction although the external demand momentum might slow down. The Committee viewed that current accommodative monetary policy stance would remain appropriate and would continue to monitor developments of economic growth, inflation, and financial stability, together with associated risks, in deliberating appropriate monetary policy in the period ahead."
Chile,2019-05-09,"Thursday, 9 May 2019 Monetary Policy Meeting At its Monetary Policy Meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 3%. The decision was adopted by the unanimous vote of the Board members. Internationally. US labor and growth data came in better than expected. In the Eurozone and China, better-than-expected growth figures were also recorded, although other indicators fell short of estimates. On the inflation side, higher energy prices have pushed up headline inflation and the inflation outlook, while core inflation has remained unaffected. Several central banks have reaffirmed a more expansionary orientation of their monetary policies. More recently, intensified trade tensions between the US and China resulted in higher global aversion to risk, increased volatility, a partial reversal of riskier assets' price increases and reduced prices of commodities, including copper. In this context, the Chinese authority cut down reserve requirements as a response to the escalating trade conflict. The local financial market has seen a decline in the stock market and a depreciation of the peso, in line with the global trends of recent days. Medium- and long-term interest rates have shown no major movements in the most recent past, despite some decline after the last Meeting. Credit expansion, costs and lending standards, according to the March Bank Lending Survey, present no big change, while demand for credit is perceived as having lost some dynamism in the segments of consumers and large companies. Preliminary first-quarter data suggest that GDP grew less than forecast in the March Monetary Policy Report. This would respond to reduced mining activity and the performance of some of the more volatile sectors. Conversely, all other sectors have performed in line with expectations, particularly those linked to services and investment. About the latter, although imports of capital goods have shown greater volatility, the outlook remains favorable as can be derived from the evolution of construction activity and the upward revision of the Capital Goods Corporation's latest survey. On the consumption side, there are no signs of a significant switch in the trend, as the slowdown in durable goods consumption is offset by the strengthening of services. In the labor market, the various sources of information point to stronger growth in salaried employment. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate remains around 7% and nominal wages accelerated in annual terms, reflecting the rise in the minimum wage. [INF*RES*AS] Annual CPI inflationâ€”measured with the 2018=100 base benchmark seriesâ€”increased with respect to the beginning of the year, standing at 2% in April. This responds to a large extent to the higher incidence of foodstuffs and fuels. Meanwhile, the CPIEFE has continued to fluctuate around 2% y-o-y. Private inflation expectations available at the time of the Meeting show slight changes. For this year's end and one year ahead, they stand somewhat below 3% annually, where they are expected to remain in the two- year horizon. The Board's decision considered that information accumulated in the last month does not modify significantly from the evaluation contained in the March Report. Thus, it estimates that the lower level and outlook of inflation require keeping the monetary stimulus still for an extended period of time. The course of the MPR normalization necessary for the convergence of inflation within the policy horizon will be subject to a new appraisal in the June Report. Accordingly, the Board reiterates its will to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the two- year horizon. The minutes of this Monetary Policy Meeting will be published at 8:30 hours of Monday 27 May 2019. The next monetary Policy Meeting is scheduled to take place on Friday 7 June 2019 and the statement thereof will be released at 18:00 hours the same day. _The Spanish original prevails."
Peru,2019-05-09,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR MAY 2019 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 2.75% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 2.75 percent. This decision takes into account the following factors: In April, the YoY inflation rate and trend inflation indicators showed levels within the inflation target range; The expected YoY rate of inflation was 2.38 percent in April; Indicators of non-primary economic activity continue showing signs of dynamism, while primary activity shows a weak performance; as a result, production remains below its potential, and There are still risks in terms of global economic activity and greater volatility has been observed in international financial markets over the past few days due to commercial tensions. The YoY inflation rate is projected to remain within the target range and around 2.0 percent in the forecast horizon. The Board considers that it is appropriate to maintain an expansionary policy stance while inflation expectations remain anchored, in a context in which the level of economic activity is below its potential level. Recent indicators of inflation and activity reflect the following: Inflation in April showed a rate of 0.20 percent, as a result of which the YoY inflation rate registered 2.59 percent in April 2019 due to the statistical effect associated with the negative inflation rate in April 2018. Moreover, the monthly rate of inflation excluding food and energy prices was 0.04 percent, as a result of which the YoY rate remained at 2.6 percent in April. Indicators of business expectations declined in April, but remain on the optimistic side. Furthermore, indicators of non-primary economic activity continue pointing to a gradual closure of the output gap. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 1.50 percent. Direct security and currency repos and rediscount operations: 3.30 percent for the first 10 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 10 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 3.30 percent. The Monetary Program for the month of June will be approved on the Board meeting to be held on June 13, 2019."
Poland,2019-05-15,"Warsaw, 15 May 2019 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 14-15 May 2019 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: â–ª reference rate at 1.50%; â–ª lombard rate at 2.50%; â–ª deposit rate at 0.50%; â–ª rediscount rate at 1.75%. Incoming data suggest that global growth in 2019 Q1 continued at a relatively slow pace, although economic conditions have improved somewhat in some of the largest economies. At the same time, sentiment in industry was still weak, with more upbeat signs coming from the service sector. In the euro area, despite a pick-up in quarterly GDP growth, the pace of economic activity growth remains relatively slow. In the United States, economic conditions stay strong, and the quarterly GDP growth in 2019 Q1 was higher than in the previous quarter. In China, economic activity growth stabilised at the beginning of the year. Since the beginning of 2019, global oil prices have been rising, which translated into somewhat higher inflation in many countries. Alongside that, core inflation in the external environment of the Polish economy, including the euro area, has picked up slightly. The European Central Bank is keeping interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero, and reinvests maturing securities bought under the asset purchase programme. The US Federal Reserve is keeping interest rates unchanged. At the same time, the Fed is gradually limiting the pace of its balance sheet reduction. In Poland, economic conditions remain good, although GDP growth in 2019 Q1 was somewhat softer than in previous quarters. Activity growth is driven by rising consumption  albeit at a slightly lower rate than in previous quarters  fuelled by increasing employment and wages as well as very high consumer sentiment. This is accompanied by a rise in investment. In recent months, consumer price growth has increased, which was accounted for by rising fuel and food prices as well as higher core inflation. Despite this, inflation continues to run at moderate levels. In the Council's assessment, the outlook for economic conditions in Poland remains favourable. However, in the quarters to come, there will probably be a gradual slowdown in GDP growth. At the same time, inflation will remain at a moderate level and, in the monetary policy transmission horizon, will stay close to the target. The Council judges that the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability."
Romania,2019-05-15,"In its meeting of 15 May 2019, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided:. The annual CPI inflation rate went up from 3.83 percent in February to 4.03 percent in March and 4.11 percent in April, thus standing above the variation band of the target and above the forecast. Behind this evolution stood the pick-up in the prices of vegetables and fruit, as well as the advance in fuel prices and tobacco product prices, yet core inflation also made a significant contribution thereto. The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate (which excludes from the CPI inflation administered prices, volatile prices, and tobacco product and alcoholic beverage prices) remained at 2.7 percent in March, moving up to 3 percent in April. The increase shows rising demand-pull and wage cost-push inflationary pressures, as well as the impact of the new tax levied on telecom companies. Average annual CPI inflation rate continued to decline slightly from 4.5 percent in February to 4.4 percent in March and 4.3 percent in April 2019; calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, the average annual inflation rate has remained flat at 4.1 percent starting with December 2018. The revised data on economic growth confirm that real GDP advanced by 4.1 percent year on year in 2018 Q4 compared to 4.2 percent in the previous quarter. On the demand side, final consumption continued to be the main driver of economic growth (3.5 percentage points), ahead of the change in inventories (3.2 percentage points), while gross fixed capital formation reported again a negative contribution. By contrast, net exports had a lower negative contribution to GDP dynamics against the background of an upward revision of the growth rates of exports and imports of goods and services. The latest statistical data point to a widening of the current account deficit in 2019 Q1 compared to the same year-earlier period, albeit at a slower pace than in 2018 Q4. Production and investment saw mixed developments. On the one hand, the annual dynamics of industrial output lost further momentum in 2019 Q1 compared to 2018 Q4, concurrently with the deceleration in the dynamics of new orders in manufacturing. On the other hand, in annual terms, the volume of construction works rose substantially. At the same time, retail trade and services continued to grow at a faster pace amid the significant step-up in the growth rate of the average net real wage. The annual growth rate of credit to the private sector decelerated. The evolution reflected a slower rise in the domestic currency component, in parallel with a considerably slacker decline in the foreign currency component. Against this background, the share of leu-denominated loans in total private sector credit increased marginally to 65.8 percent. In today's meeting, the NBR Board examined and approved the May 2019 Inflation Report, which incorporates the most recent data and information available. The new scenario of the projection indicates the outlook for the annual inflation rate to remain above the variation band of the target during the next three quarters and thereafter return to and stay in the upper half of the band until the end of the forecast horizon amid the upward revision of its projected path, especially over the short time horizon. The uncertainties and risks surrounding the inflation outlook further relate to the impact of the set of fiscal and budgetary measures implemented this year, including that of the bank asset tax and of the new benchmark index for loans to consumers (IRCC) on lending and on the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Significant uncertainties and risks stem from the fiscal and income policy stance and labour market conditions. The evolution of the current account deficit remains a matter of concern as well. Also important are the uncertainties about the pace of euro area and global economic growth, the international oil price developments, the monetary policy stances of the ECB and of the Fed, as well as of central banks in the region. In today's meeting, based on the currently available data and assessments, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided to keep the monetary policy rate at 2.50 percent per annum, while tightening control over money market liquidity. Moreover, the NBR Board decided to leave unchanged the deposit facility rate at 1.50 percent per annum and the lending (Lombard) facility rate at 3.50 percent per annum. In addition, the NBR Board decided to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board decisions aim to ensure and preserve price stability over the medium term in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth and amid safeguarding financial stability. The NBR Board underlines that the balanced macroeconomic policy mix and the implementation of structural reforms designed to foster the growth potential over the long term are of the essence in preserving a stable macroeconomic framework and strengthening the capacity of the Romanian economy to withstand potential adverse developments. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be presented to the public in a press conference on 17 May 2019, at 11:00 a.m. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR's website on 22 May 2019, at 3:00 p.m. The next monetary policy meeting of the NBR Board is scheduled for 4 July 2019."
Mexico,2019-05-16,"Banco de Mexico's Governing Board has decided to maintain the target for the overnight interbank interest rate at 8.25%. Since the second half of 2018, world economic activity has exhibited a downward trend, although a moderate recovery was observed during the first quarter of 2019 in some of the major economies, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, the euro area and China, to a large extent associated with short run factors. Labor markets in the major advanced economies continued to exhibit strength and certain wage increases. Although headline inflation in these economies has rebounded due to the increase in energy prices, core inflation has decreased in several of them, in some cases due to transitory factors and methodological changes. This environment has strengthened expectations that the central banks of the major economies will adopt a more accommodative monetary policy strategy. In its May meeting, the US Federal Reserve left the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged and reiterated its message that it will be patient in making adjustments to the range. Among the risks that still persist and are worth highlighting are an escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and its main trade partners; a more prolonged weakening of some of the major economies than expected; new episodes of volatility in financial markets; and, the intensification of certain political and geopolitical risks. Due to the aforementioned, the balance of risks for the global economy continues biased to the downside. As for domestic financial markets, the peso exchange rate appreciated compared to the levels observed during the last monetary policy decision, while exhibiting higher levels of volatility. Interest rates on government securities increased, mainly those for the medium and long terms. Looking ahead, risks persist which might have a significant effect on the performance of financial assets in Mexico. In particular, uncertainty regarding the external environment might lead to portfolio adjustments, and investors remain alert to domestic issues such as the credit perspectives for Pemex and for the economy in general. The current environment continues to pose significant risks in the medium and long terms that could affect the country's macroeconomic conditions, its potential growth, and the economy's price formation process. In this regard, it is particularly important that, in addition to a prudent and firm monetary policy, measures to foster an environment of confidence and certainty for investment and higher productivity are adopted, and public finances are consolidated in a sustainable way. In this context, it is especially relevant that the fiscal targets set in the Economic Package for 2019 are attained. Strengthening the rule of law, tackling corruption, and fighting insecurity are equally imperative. The latest information suggests that during the first quarter of 2019 the weak performance the Mexican economy had been exhibiting since the previous quarter intensified, due to both external and domestic factors, some of which are transitory. Thus, economic slack increased towards the end of 2018 and the early part of 2019. The balance of risks for growth has become more uncertain and remains biased to the downside. 1 Between March and April, headline inflation rose from 4.00% to 4.41%, due to increases in its core and non-core components, with core inflation's contributing in greater measure. As for non-core inflation, it increased from 5.47% to 6.08%, partly reflecting that since the second week of February 2019, the downward path in energy price increases reverted, due largely to the evolution of their international references. As for core inflation, it rose during this period, from 3.55% in March to 3.87% in April. This was due to continued increases in the rate of change of food merchandise prices, while that for services prices rebounded during the same period. Services prices were partly influenced by the effect on their annual variations of the Easter holiday, which this year took place in April, while in 2018 it did so in March. Nevertheless, even after excluding this effect, the annual variation of services prices increased. Thus, core inflation has remained at high levels, and recently has increased further. Headline and core inflation expectations increased for both the short and medium terms, while those for the long term remained unchanged, all of them remaining clearly above the 3% permanent target. As for information drawn from market instruments, after having followed a downward trend, the medium- and long-term inflationary risk premium has increased over the last weeks, remaining at high levels. As for inflation risks, the possibility that the peso exchange rate comes under pressure stemming from external or domestic factors stands out. Should the economy require adjustments either to the real exchange rate or to medium- and long-term interest rates. Banco de Mexico will contribute to orderly adjustments, in an effort to prevent second-round effects on the economy's price formation process. Inflation could also be affected if additional pressures on energy prices or on agricultural and livestock product prices arise, if an escalation of protectionist and compensatory measures worldwide materializes or in case public finances deteriorate. Moreover, given the magnitude of the increases to the minimum wage, in addition to their possible direct impact, there is the risk that these bring about high wage revisions in several sectors. In fact, in some sectors these have exceeded productivity gains and could give rise to cost pressures, thus affecting formal employment and contributing to keep core inflation at high levels. In order to raise the purchasing power of wages sustainably, the role of other public policies must be considered, in particular, fostering competition in those sectors of goods and services with a high share in the consumption basket of the segments of the population with the lowest income. Also, the persistence shown by core inflation could imply a greater downward resistance of medium- and long- term inflation expectations. Finally, another risk is that the greater economic slack does not translate into lesser pressures on inflation, given the factors that have been putting upward pressure on core inflation. As for downside risks, the prices of certain goods included in the non-core subindex could register lower variations or economic slack could widen more than expected. Thus, although there has been an intensification of certain downside risk factors, like the greater slack in the economy, there are others that could make inflation remain at high levels and, therefore, deviate it from its foreseen path, given the factors that have restrained core inflation from decreasing. For this reason, in an environment of high uncertainty, it is deemed that the balance of risks for inflation relative to its forecasted trajectory still remains to the upside. To guide its monetary policy actions. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board follows closely the development of inflation vis-Ã -vis its forecasted trajectory, taking into account the monetary policy stance and the time frame in which monetary policy operates as well as available information on all inflation determinants and on medium- and long-term inflation expectations, including the balance of risks for such factors. Monetary policy must respond prudently if for any reason the uncertainty faced by the economy increases considerably. Although headline and core inflation have increased, these developments are considered to be transitory and the current monetary policy stance consistent with the convergence of inflation to its target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates. For this reason. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board has decided unanimously to leave the target for the overnight interbank interest rate unchanged at 8.25%. Considering the risks to consolidate a low and stable inflation as well as those the economy's price formation is subject to, the Governing Board will continue to follow closely 2 all factors and elements of uncertainty that have an impact on both inflation and its outlook, and will take the necessary actions so that the reference rate is kept at a level consistent with the convergence of headline inflation to Banco de Mexico's target within the period in which monetary policy operates. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board will maintain a prudent monetary policy stance and, under the current environment of uncertainty, will follow closely the potential pass-through of exchange rate fluctuations to prices. Mexico's monetary policy stance relative to that of the U.S.-in an external environment that it is still subject to risks- and the behavior of slack conditions and cost-related pressures in the Mexican economy. In the presence and possible persistence of factors that, by their nature, involve risks to both inflation and inflation expectations, monetary policy will be adjusted in a timely and firm manner to achieve the convergence of inflation to its 3% target and to strengthen the anchoring of medium- and long-term inflation expectations so that they attain such target."
Israel,2019-05-20,"The inflation environment remains stable above the lower bound of the target range. The CPI for April was lower than pre-publication assessments, but CPI readings for the previous three months surprised to the upside, and year-on-year inflation is at a level similar to that of recent months. One-year inflation expectations and forecasts are slightly above the lower bound of the target range, and forward expectations for medium and longer terms remained near the midpoint of the target. For the year to date, the shekel has strengthened by 6 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, and since the last meeting it has appreciated by 1.2 percent. The appreciation is the main factor that is delaying the continued increase of the inflation rate toward the midpoint of the target. The high growth rate in the first quarter was impacted markedly by stronger new vehicle sales, along with solid growth in exports. Net of this effect, the economy grew at a rate slightly below its potential. The labor market remains tight: The participation and employment rates increased slightly from already record levels, and wages continue to rise, led by the business sector. The risks to the global economy increased, mainly in view of the increasing severity of the trade war, despite first-quarter growth in major economies surprising to the upside. The slowdown in world trade continues, and includes emerging markets as well. The IMF again revised downward its forecasts for world trade and growth for most regions. The Committee assesses that the rising path of the interest rate in the future will be gradual and cautious, in a manner that supports a process at the end of which inflation will stabilizearound the midpoint of the target range, and that supports economic activity. The Bank of Israel continues to monitor developments in inflation, the real economy, fiscal policy, the financial markets, and the global economy, and will act to attain the monetary policy targets in accordance with such developments. For the file of figures accompanying this notice, click here. The CPI for April increased by 0.3 percent, lower than pre-publication assessments, but the indices for the three preceding months surprised to the upside. Inflation over the past 12 months was 1.3 percent: similar to the level in recent months (Figure 1 in the attached file of figures). Inflation measured by the adjusted index is slightly lower. Inflation in nontradables, a proxy for the domestic component of inflation, remains above the 2 percent level, and inflation in tradables increased from negative levels to near zero. One-year inflation expectations and forecasts are slightly above the lower bound of the target range, and following the publication of the April CPI, there was a slight decline (Figure 4). Medium-term and long-term forward expectations remain around the midpoint of the target range, but expectations for the second year declined slightly (Figure 5). Since the beginning of the year, the shekel has strengthened by 4.6 percent against the US dollar. In terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, the shekel has strengthened by 6 percent since the start of the year, and by 1.2 percent since the previous interest rate decision. The appreciation is delaying the inflation rate's continued rise towardthe midpoint of the target range. The equity indices in Israel continued to increase after the previous interest rate decision, but have fallen since the end of April, with an emphasis on the shares of pharmaceutical companies and in view of declines in most of the global markets. The gap between the yields on US and Israeli government bonds narrowed slightly. Yield spreads between corporate bonds and comparable duration government bonds in Israel increased slightly, similar to the global trend (Figure 8). For the past several quarters, the economy has been growing at near its potential rate. According to the first estimate of National Accounts data for the first quarter of 2019, the economy grew by 5.2 percent (Figures 11 and 12), but the figure was affected markedly by increased new vehicle sales in the first quarter. After adjusting for this effect, the Bank of Israel Research Department's assessment is that economic growth was slightly below 3 percent. Services exports wereparticularly strong, and goods exports also increased. Most recent data regarding exports are more mixed. There is an apparent decline in the share of companies in the Business Tendency Survey reporting a severe constraint in export orders, but foreign trade data indicate a slowdown in goods exports in April. Private current consumption increased at a relatively moderate rate in the first quarter, and, other than vehicles, most components of investment contracted. Data on the labor market data indicate that it remains tight: the employment rate and the participation rate both increased slightly from the record rates at which they had been (Figure 14), the slight increase in the unemployment rate since the beginning of the year does not indicate an increase in the duration of unemployment - Figure 15), and wage increases are continuing, led by the business sector (Figure 16). However, while the job vacancy rate remains high, it has been declining moderately for several months. In recent months, home prices reverted to registering moderate increases, and have increased by approximately 0.5 percent in the past year (Figure 9). The number of transactions increased markedly, particularly among first-time homebuyers, alongside the continued decline in investment in residential construction. The trend of expansion in mortgage volume continues, and mortgage interest rates declined slightly (Figure 10). The risks to the global economy increased, despite first quarter growth data of major economies surprising to the upside (Figure 17), mainlyin view of the worsening of the trade war between the US and China. The IMF again revised its world trade forecast downward and revised its growth forecasts downward for most regions, particularly for Europe (Figure 18). The slowdown in world trade continues, and includes the emerging economies (Figure 19). In the financial markets, there were declines in equity indices, mainly following the crisis surrounding the trade talks (Figure 23),and government bond yields continued to decline moderately in view of the expectation that the process of global monetary tightening will be halted for now and a worsening of sentiment in the markets. In the US, there was some continued moderation in core inflation. The Fed left the federal funds rateunchanged, and noted that despite the strong growth in the first quarter, there is noticeable moderation in private consumption and in investment. In Europe, the economic picture continues to indicate weakness, although first quarter growth data in a number of leading economies surprised to the upside. The ECB left its interest rate unchanged, and its president noted that there are greater expectations for a slowdown in growth in 2019. In the UK as well, first quarter growth data were encouraging, but the risks regarding Brexit remain high, and its implementation was delayed again. In Japan, the moderation of economic activity since the beginning of the year continued, and its parliament approved an incentive program to support the economy. Growth in China stabilized in the first quarter after moderating at the end of 2018, although data on economic activity indicate continued moderation. Oil prices remained stable since the previous interest rate decision, in view of the decline in supply being offset by worsening sentiment in the markets. (Figure 21). The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on June 3, 2019. The next decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Monday. July 8, 2019, following which the Governor will hold a press briefing."
Pakistan,2019-05-20,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement May 20, 2019 Key developments since the last MPC statement There have been three notable developments since the last Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting in March 2019. First the government of Pakistan has reached staff-level agreement with the International Monetary Fund for 39-month long Extended Fund Facility of around US$. billion. The program is designed to restore macroeconomic stability and support sustainable economic growth, and is expected to unlock considerable additional external financing. Second trends in government borrowing reflect widening fiscal deficit during the first nine months of FY19 when compared to the same period in FY18. In addition, greater reliance on central bank financing of the deficit has acted to dilute the impact of previous monetary tightening. Finally since the last MPC, the exchange rate has depreciated by.93 percent to PKR 149.65 per USD, at the close of 20th May 2019, reflecting combination of underlying macroeconomic factors and market sentiment considerations. Real sector SBP's estimates show that economic growth is expected to slow in FY19 but rise modestly in FY20. This slowdown is mostly due to lower growth in agriculture and industry. More than two-thirds of real GDP growth in FY19 is expected to come from services. Going forward, some gradual recovery in economic activity is expected on the back of improved market sentiment in the context of the IMF supported program, rebound in the agriculture sector and government incentives for export- oriented industries. External sector The current account deficit narrowed to US$. billion in Jul-Mar FY19 as compared to deficit of US$ 13. billion during the same period last year, fall of 29 percent. The reduction is mainly driven by import compression and healthy growth in workers' remittances. This impact was partially offset by higher international oil prices. The non-oil trade deficit declined from US$ 13. billion in Jul-Mar FY18 to US$ 1. billion in Jul-Mar FY19 reflecting the impact of stabilization policies implemented so far. Recent indicators suggest export volumes have begun to grow although total export receipts have not grown due unfavorable prices. Despite the improvement in the current account and noticeable increase in official bilateral inflows, the financing of the current account deficit remained challenging. Consequently reserves declined to US$. billion as of 10th May 2019 from US$ 10. billion at end-March 2019. The exchange rate also came under pressure in the last few days. In SBP's view, the recent movement in the exchange rate reflects the continuing resolution of accumulated imbalances of the past and some role of supply and demand factors. SBP will continue to closely monitor the situation and stands ready to take measures, as needed, to address any unwarranted volatility in the foreign exchange market. Furthermore the current level of reserves is below standard adequacy levels (equal to three months of imports cover). As noted in previous MPC statements, deep structural reforms are Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN required to improve productivity and competitiveness of export-oriented sectors and improve the trade balance. Fiscal sector The overall fiscal deficit is likely to be considerably higher during Jul-Mar FY19 as compared to the same period last year due to shortfall in revenue collection, higher than budgeted interest payments and security related expenditures. From monetary policy perspective, growing portion of the fiscal deficit has been financed through borrowings from SBP. In absolute terms, the government borrowed Rs. trillion from SBP during 1st Jul-10th May FY19, which is. times the borrowing during the same period last year. major portion of this borrowing from the SBP (Rs. trillion) reflects shift away from commercial banks which were reluctant to lend to the government at prevailing rates. The resulting increase in monetization of the deficit has added to inflationary pressures. Monetary sector and inflation outlook Despite the recent tightening of monetary policy, private sector credit rose. percent during 1st Jul-10th May. FY19. Much of the increase in credit was for working capital needs due to higher input prices. The expansionary impact of higher government borrowing and private sector credit on broad money supply (M2) was partly offset by contraction in net foreign assets of the banking sector. In aggregate, broad money supply grew by. percent during 1st Jul 10th May. FY19. The consumer price index (CPI) rose. percent in March 2019 and. percent in April 2019, on y-o-y basis. Average headline CPI inflation reached. percent in Jul-Apr FY19 compared to. percent in the same period last year. Moreover the annualized headline month-on-month inflation has risen considerably in the last three months due to the recent hike in domestic fuel prices and rising food prices and input costs. As such, inflationary pressures are likely to continue for some time. The most recent IBA-SBP consumer confidence survey also shows that most households expect higher inflation during the next six months. Taking into account the recent developments discussed above and outlook for key sectors, average headline CPI inflation is expected to be in the range of.5-7. percent in FY19 and it is anticipated to be considerably higher in FY20. This inflation outlook is subject to number of upside risks from an expected rationalization of taxes in the upcoming budget, potential adjustments in electricity and gas tariffs, and volatility in international oil prices. The inflation outlook suggests fall in real interest rates on forward- looking basis. Policy rate decision Taking into account the above considerations and the evolving macroeconomic situation, the MPC noted that further policy measures are required to address underlying inflationary pressures from higher recent month-on-month headline and core inflation outturns; recent exchange rate depreciation; an elevated fiscal deficit and its increased monetization, and potential adjustments in utility tariffs. In this context, the MPC decided to increase the policy rate by 150 bps to 12.25 percent effective from 21st May 2019. Page."
Nigeria,2019-05-21,"CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO. 124 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING OF MONDAY 20TH AND TUESDAY 21ST MAY, 2019 Background The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on the 20th and 21st of May 2019, amidst uncertainties in the global financial, economic and political environments. All Eleven (11) members of the Committee were present. Global Economic Developments The Committee reviewed developments in the global economy, noting with concern, the declining trend in global output growth, which commenced in the second half of 2018. Accordingly the International Monetary Fund downgraded global output growth from 37 per cent in 2018 to 36 per cent in 2019 and further revised it downwards to 33 per cent in 2019. The decrease in the global composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) in the last three months provides further fillip to this downgrade. The Committee noted that the weakening global output growth continued amidst prevailing uncertainties from familiar headwinds including: the further escalation of trade tensions between the US and China; imposition of new rounds of sanctions on Iran; breakdown of BREXIT negotiations; a new wave of tension on the Korean Peninsula; vulnerabilities in major financial markets and rising public and private debt in some Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDEs). Despite these uncertainties, inflation in the advanced economies remained muted and largely below their 20 per cent long-run targets. As a result, most central banks in the advanced economies, including the US Fed. Bank of 1 England and the European Central Bank, adopted a dovish monetary policy stance, which is expected to remain in place in the near to medium term, as signs of weakness in the global economy re-emerged. In the Emerging Market Developing Economies, however, developments were mixed, with inflation rising in some, but moderating in others. In response, the financial markets witnessed the rebalancing of portfolios from equities to fixed income securities, and some stock markets posting losses. In the main, the Emerging Market Developing Economies are expected to continue to benefit from the accommodative monetary policy stance of the advanced economies through increased capital inflows. Domestic Output Developments Available output data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 201 per cent in the first quarter of 2019 compared with 238 and 189 per cent in the previous and corresponding quarters of 2018, respectively. This was largely driven by the non-oil sector, which grew by 247 per cent in the first quarter of 2019 while the oil sector contracted by 240 per cent. Staff projections indicate real GDP growth of 234 and 236 per cent in Q2 2019 and Q3 2019, respectively, including a reduction in the unemployment rate. The Monetary Policy Committee observed that actual output remains below potential, implying that the economy still had sufficient headroom for non-inflationary growth. This is expected to be driven largely by sustained stability in the financial system; continued special interventions in Agriculture, manufacturing and SMEs sectors, by the Bank; sustained effort in improving transport infrastructure to address distribution challenges; continued expansion of business activities as indicated by the PMI and increased supply of foreign exchange to growth-stimulating sectors of the economy, among others. The Committee noted the continued expansion of the Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Indices (PMI) for the 25th and 24th consecutive months in April 2019 and broadly welcomed this positive 2 development in economic activities in Nigeria. The manufacturing PMI grew by 577 index points compared with 574 index points in the previous month. Similarly the non-manufacturing PMI grew by 587 index points compared with 585 index points in March 2019. The growth in both measures of PMI were anchored by marginal increases in production, employment level and new orders. Developments in Money and Prices The Committee noted the growth in broad money supply (M3) by 542 per cent in April 2019 from the level at end-December 2018, annualized to 1636 per cent, above the indicative benchmark rate of 1447 per cent for 2019. This was largely driven by the growth of 1962 per cent in Net Domestic Assets (NDA). In contrast. Net Foreign Assets (NFA) contracted by 583 per cent in April 2019 relative to the level at end-December 2018. In spite of the significant underperformance of M1 at -426 per cent annualised to -1277 per cent. M2 grew by 185 per cent in April 2019, annualized to 554 per cent, which was significantly below the benchmark rate of 1299 per cent for 2019. This development was largely due to the growth in time and savings deposits by 653 per cent. The Net Domestic Credit (NDC) grew by 1931 per cent in April 2019 from the level at end-December 2018, annualized to 5792 per cent, above its indicative benchmark of 1182 per cent. The growth in NDC was attributed to the significant increase in credit to both government and the private sector by 6444 and 964 per cent, respectively, in April 2019, compared with end-December 2018. The Committee noted the developments in the monetary aggregates and enjoined the Bank to initiate moves towards improving lending to the private sector and urged other intermediary institutions in the financial sector to support these initiatives by improving their credit delivery to boost output growth. The Committee noted the uptick in inflation as headline inflation (year-on- year) rose slightly to 1137 per cent in April 2019 from 1125 per cent in March 3 2019. The increase in headline inflation was driven mainly by food inflation which rose by 1370 per cent in April 2019 from 1345 per cent in March 2019. Core inflation, however, declined marginally to 928 per cent in April from 946 per cent in March 2019. In April 2019, month-on-month headline, food and core inflation increased to 094, 114 and 070 per cent from 079, 088 and 053 per cent in March 2019, respectively. The MPC noted that the recent uptick in inflationary pressure was seasonally driven and anticipated. Liquidity conditions in the banking system reflected the net impact of Open Market Operations (OMO) auctions, maturing CBN Bills, statutory allocations to states and local governments as well as interventions by the CBN in the foreign exchange market. Consequently the monthly weighted average Inter-bank call and Open Buy Back (OBB) rates increased to 1398 and 1615 per cent in April 2019 from 1080 and 1217 per cent in March 2019, respectively. The daily unsecured interbank and the OBB rate, fluctuated within the standing facilities corridor, closing at 657 per cent and 555 per cent on May 10 and May 16, 2019, respectively, reflecting the reaction of the money market to the 50 basis point reduction in the policy rate at the meeting of the MPC in March 2019. The Committee observed the continued bearish trend in the equities market in spite of the sustained capital inflows into the economy during the period under review. The All-Share Index declined by 814 per cent to 28,,87183 index points on May 17, 2019 from 31,,43050 index points as at end-December 2018, while market capitalization grew by 853 per cent to N1272 trillion on May 17, 2019 from N1172 trillion at end-December 2018. The recent growth in market capitalization reflected new listings in the market, prominent amongst which is: MTN and Skyway Aviation Handling Company Plc and additional listing from the merger between Access Bank and Diamond Bank. The Committee welcomed the continued stability at both the Bureau-de- change (BDC) and the Investors' and Exporters' (I&E) windows of the foreign exchange market, expressing optimism in the recovery of crude oil prices due 4 to the OPEC production ceiling and other geo-political issues affecting oil exports. The MPC also noted the steady accretion to external reserves, which stood at US$4542 billion as at May 16, 2019, an increase of 220 per cent from US$4444 billion at end-April 2019. The Overall Outlook and Risks The overall medium term outlook for the global economy remains mixed and uncertain with growing indications of persistent macroeconomic vulnerabilities, global financial market fragilities, accommodative monetary policy, policy uncertainties and weakening global output. Data on the domestic economy suggests some fragility in output growth during the second quarter of 2019 with improved outlook for the rest of the year. Accordingly revised output projections indicate that the economy would grow by 21 per cent according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), 22 per cent by the World Bank and 238 per cent by the CBN in 2019. This outlook is hinged on the following key factors: the effective implementation of the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP); supportive monetary policy; enhanced flow of credit to the real sector; sustained stability of the exchange rate; and improved fiscal buffers; amongst others. The Committee, thus, expects that monetary policy would focus on improving access to credit, reducing unemployment and stimulating economic growth. Committee's Considerations The Committee took into consideration the continued slowdown in the global economy and the persisting uncertainties, including the ongoing trade wars between the US and its major trade partners, financial fragilities in a number of countries, the debt-constrained fiscal operations of most EMDEs, including 5 Nigeria, and the volatility in the oil market. The Committee, therefore, enjoined the Federal government to urgently build fiscal buffers through a more realistic benchmark oil price for the Federal Budget. The MPC noted the 201 per cent growth in real GDP during the first quarter of 2019 compared with 189 per cent in the corresponding quarter of 2018. Although output growth in the first quarter was slower than 238 per cent recorded in the preceding quarter, it emphasized that actual output remains well below the economy's long-run potential, indicating the existence of spare capacity for non-inflationary growth in the economy, an opportunity which should be explored through increased credit delivery to the private sector. Not impressed by the flow of credit from the Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) to the private sector, the MPC called on the CBN management to urgently put in place modalities to promote Consumer, and Mortgage lending in the Nigerian economy, noting that doing this will greatly and positively impact on the flow of credit and ultimately result in output growth. The MPC called for a close monitoring of the uptick in inflationary pressures in April 2019, driven largely by food shortages during the Easter season, the commencement of the planting season as well as persisting security challenges in some of the food producing regions of the country. The Committee, urged the relevant authorities to strengthen efforts to address the security challenges and improve food production. It encouraged financial intermediating institutions to ensure that loans to the agricultural sector were channelled effectively to end users. The MPC welcomed the improvement in financial soundness indicators (FSIs), but noted that although the Non-Performing Loan (NPL) ratio moderated, it remained above the prudential benchmark. Consequently the Committee considered and recommended to the CBN, a proposal to develop a comprehensive administrative, legal and regulatory framework to speed up 6 the recovery of delinquent loan facilities of the banking system; involving structured engagement with relevant stakeholders and authorities, in order to mitigate credit risk and ultimately open up the credit delivery space in the Nigerian economy. The Committee extended warm felicitations in an expression of gratitude to the President and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. President Muhammadu Buhari, and the Senate of the Federal Republic, respectively, for the reappointment and prompt confirmation of the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria. Godwin I. Emefiele for a second 5-year term in office. In particular, the Committee noted that the reappointment was in recognition of the contributions of the CBN to maintaining macroeconomic stability and it would engender confidence and build policy credibility and deliver stability to the Nigerian financial markets. In view of the abundant opportunities available to banks for unfettered access to government securities, which tends to crowd out private sector lending, the Committee called on the Bank to provide a mechanism for limiting DMBs access to government securities so as to redirect bank's lending focus to the private sector, noting that this would spur the much needed growth in the economy. It called on the Government to use all machinery at its disposal to increase tax revenue to enable the government fund its budget adequately. The Committee's Decision The global and domestic developments have conditioned an environment of low optimism in the macroeconomic and financial sector space, forcing central banks to return to accommodative monetary policy. As in the past, the Committee considered the options of whether to be more accommodative, tighten or hold it position. The Committee felt that although the slight inflation uptick should result in tightening, it nevertheless felt that doing this will limit the ability of DMBs to increase credit at this time, given the need to support or redirect the focus of DMBs to new credit in support of consumer, mortgage and other priority sectors of the economy, including. SMEs, agriculture and manufacturing. It also felt that given the fragile state of the economy, increasing the cost of credit would further diminish investment flow and impact negatively on output growth. As regards loosening, some members felt that it was desirable to aggressively stimulate growth, restart the capital market activities and increase lending at lower rates; which would ultimately stimulate domestic aggregate demand. Those against loosening felt that given that there was a marginal increase in headline inflation for April 2019, there is need to restrain from loosening in order not to exacerbate inflationary pressures. They also felt the economy would experience liquidity surfeit and without corresponding increase in real sector output, inflationary pressures could be elevated; resulting in likely exchange rate pressures. As for members who favoured a hold position, maintaining monetary policy rate at its present level was essential for better understanding of the momentum of growth before determining any possible modifications. They also felt that retaining the current policy stance provides an avenue for evaluating the impact of the Bank's intervention policies to support lending to the priority sectors of the economy. Consequently the MPC decided against the backdrop of these developments by a vote of 9 members out of 11, to hold all parameters of monetary policy constant. Two members voted, however, to reduce the monetary policy rate by 25 basis points. In summary, the MPC voted to: I Retain the MPR at 1350 per cent; II. Retain the asymmetric corridor of +200/-500 basis points around the MPR; III. Retain the CRR at 225 per cent; and IV. Retain the Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent. Thank you. Godwin I Emefiele Governor. Central Bank of Nigeria 21st May, 2019 9."
Egypt,2019-05-23,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release May 23, 2019 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 1575 percent, 1675 percent, and 1625 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 1625 percen. Annual headline and core inflation declined to 130 percent and 81 percent in April 2019 from 142 percent and 89 percent in March 2019, respectivel. This decline was supported by favorable base effects and a lower contribution from food prices, while the contribution of non- food prices remained broadly unchange. Real GDP growth continued to increase slightly to record 56 percent in 2019 Q1 compared to 55 percent in 2018 Q4, and the unemployment rate continued to decline to record 81 percent in 2019 Q1 compared 89 percent in 2018 Q4. Available data indicate that net external demand continued to support economic activity, while private domestic demand remained containe. The expansion of global economic activity weakened, and the pace of tightening financial conditions eased, while trade tensions continued to weigh on the global outloo. Meanwhile international oil prices continued to increase since the beginning of 2019 and remain subject to volatility due to geopolitical risks and potential supply-side factors, which pose risks to the domestic inflation outloo. The Ministry of Finance is targeting to achieve a primary surplus of 20 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2018/19, up from 01 percent in the previous year, and to maintain this surplus thereafte. Accordingly the inflation outlook incorporates fiscal consolidation measures, which include reaching cost recovery for most fuel products and automatic fuel price indexation to underlying cost. Against this background, the MPC decided that key policy rates remain appropriate at this juncture, and consistent with achieving the inflation target of 9 percent (Â±3 percentage points) in 2020 Q4 and price stability over the medium ter. The MPC closely monitors all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust its stance to preserve monetary stabilit.

South Africa,2019-05-23,"South African Reserve Bank PRESS STATEMENT 23 May 2019 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Over the past few months, global growth has rebounded somewhat, but significant downside risks remain, in particular from threats to the global trade regime. Domestically, electricity supply constraints and a protracted strike in a major gold mine contributed to a weak first quarter performance. Business and consumer confidence continue to weigh on the near-term growth forecast. Recent monthly inflation outcomes have remained around the mid-point of the inflation target range, in part due to weak demand and positive inflation data surprises. The medium-term inflation outlook has moderated slightly. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas was 4.4% in April (down from 4.5% in March). Goods price inflation was 4.2% (up from 4.1% in March), while services price inflation was 4.6% (down from 4.9% in March). The Bank's measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity, was 4.1% in April (down from 4.4% in March). Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods increased to 6.2% in March (from 4.7% in February). The inflation forecast generated by the SARB's Quarterly Projection Model (QPM) has improved since the previous MPC. Headline inflation is expected to average 4.5% in 2019 (down from 4.8%), increasing to 5.1% in 2020 (down from 5.3%) and moderating MPC Statement May 23rd, 2019 Page 1. Headline inflation is expected to average 4.5% in 2019 (down from 4.8%), increasing to 5.1% in 2020 (down from 5.3%) and moderating MPC Statement May 23rd, 2019 Page 1 to 4.6% in 2021 (down from 4.7%). Headline CPI inflation is expected to peak at 5.5% in the first quarter of 2020 and settle at 4.5% in the last two quarters of 2021. The main drivers of the forecast are a lower starting point for food and services inflation, and the revised oil price assumptions. Food price inflation is now expected to average 3.7% in 2019 (down from 4.1%). The assumptions for Brent crude oil in the QPM were revised up from US$64 to US$69.50 for 2019. The assumptions for 2020 and 2021 were also revised up from US$65 to US$68. Moderation in rental prices, unit labour costs and inflation expectations also contribute to lower core inflation over the medium term. Average inflation expectations have been declining slowly since the end of 2017. The inflation expectations of market analysts in the May 2019 Reuters Econometer survey were unchanged at 4.7% for 2019 while expectations edged down to 5.2% for 2020 (from 5.3%) and 5.0% for 2021 (from 5.1%). Market-based expectations implicit in the break-even inflation rates (i.e. the yield differential between conventional and inflation- linked government bonds) remain sensitive to exchange rate movements. Since our last meeting, five-year break-even rates increased to 5.1% and ten-year break-even rates were unchanged at 5.8%. The next BER1 inflation expectations survey will be published in July. Global GDP is expected to average 3.3% in 2019 and stabilise around 3.5% from 2020. While global economic activity remains moderate overall, growth momentum has slowed somewhat and there are many risks. Trade tensions have escalated 1 Bureau for Economic Research MPC Statement May 23rd, 2019 Page 2. Trade tensions have escalated 1 Bureau for Economic Research MPC Statement May 23rd, 2019 Page 2 between the United States and China, weighing on market confidence. Further tariff increases could disrupt global value chains and further reduce global trade. The IMF April 2019 World Economic Outlook estimates that tariff increases could subtract as much as 0.8 percentage points from global growth. Much uncertainty remains around Brexit, alongside other geo-political developments. In some countries, there also remain significant financial vulnerabilities associated with elevated private and public debt. Inflation in most advanced economies remains below targeted levels, allowing major central banks space to put monetary policy normalisation on hold. However, the risk of a renewed tightening of financial conditions should not be underestimated. The performance of emerging market currencies was mixed, reflecting a combination of changes in investor sentiment, easier monetary conditions in major economies and country specific factors. Currencies of countries with stronger macroeconomic fundamentals remain better placed to benefit from these developments. The rand has benefited from improved sentiment towards riskier assets but will continue to be affected by idiosyncratic factors such as domestic growth prospects and policy settings. Since the March MPC, the rand has appreciated by 1.5% against the US dollar, by 2.5% against the euro, and by 3.1% on a trade-weighted basis. The implied starting point for the rand is R14.40 against the US dollar, compared with R14.00 at the time of the previous meeting. At these levels, the QPM assesses the rand to be slightly undervalued. Based on recent short term indicators and negative growth in mining and manufacturing. GDP is expected to contract in the first quarter of 2019. The MPC Statement May 23rd, 2019 Page 3. The MPC Statement May 23rd, 2019 Page 3 disappointing data outcomes partly reflect supply side constraints due to load shedding and a strike at a major gold mine. Fixed capital formation and household consumption expenditure also remain weak. The Absa Purchasing Managers' Index has recovered to 47.2 index points, remaining below the neutral level. The SARB's composite leading business cycle indicator has trended lower since March 2018 and decreased further by 0.4% in March 2019. The SARB now expects GDP growth for 2019 to average 1.0% (down from 1.3% in March). The forecast for 2020 and 2021 is unchanged at 1.8% and 2.0% respectively. The near term growth outlook is limited by the larger than expected slowdown in the first quarter, weak business and consumer confidence as well as growing pressure on household disposable income. Real fixed investment is now forecast to contract by 0.3% in 2019, while household consumption expenditure will rise by a modest 1.0%. The MPC assesses the risks to the growth forecast to be on the downside. Weak business confidence, possible electricity supply constraints and high debt levels in certain state-owned enterprises will continue to limit investment prospects. The escalation of trade tensions could significantly impact global trade with likely negative impacts for South Africa as a small open economy. The Committee remains of the view that current challenges facing the economy are primarily structural in nature and cannot be resolved by monetary policy alone. It is now even more urgent to have a combination of prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms that raise potential growth and lower the cost structure of the economy. The MPC welcomes the continued downward trend in recent inflation outcomes and the moderation in inflation expectations. These are positive developments, as the MPC Statement May 23rd, 2019 Page 4. These are positive developments, as the MPC Statement May 23rd, 2019 Page 4 Committee would like to see inflation remain close to the mid-point of the inflation target range on a more sustained basis. The overall risks to the inflation outlook are assessed to be more or less evenly balanced. While there is scope for further moderation in meat and services prices, oil prices are expected to remain elevated and global food prices appear to have bottomed out. Electricity and water prices, among other administered prices, present additional upside risks. Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 6.75% per year. Three members preferred to keep rates on hold and two members preferred a cut of 25 basis points. The Committee assesses the stance of monetary policy to be broadly accommodative over the forecast period. Any future policy adjustments will continue to be data dependent. The implied path of policy rates generated by the Quarterly Projection Model is for one cut of 25 basis points to the repo rate by the end of first quarter of 2020. The endogenous interest rate path is built into the growth and inflation forecast. As emphasized previously, the implied path remains a broad policy guide which could change in either direction from meeting to meeting in response to new developments and changing risks.

Hungary,2019-05-28,"At its meeting on 28 May 2019, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 29 May 2019:. The Magyar Nemzeti Bank's (MNB) single anchor is inflation, its primary objective is to achieve and maintain price stability. In April 2019, inflation stood at 3.9 percent and core inflation at 3.8 percent. Core inflation excluding indirect tax effects decreased from 3.5 percent in March to 3.4 percent in April. The increase in services prices was balanced by the decline in highly volatile tradables prices. The rise in fuel prices largely contributed to an increase in the consumer price index in April as well. Volatile items continue to be a dominant component of inflation. Therefore, in assessing the outlook, the Monetary Council pays more attention to developments in the measures of underlying inflation capturing persistent trends. A dichotomy is observed between the factors determining likely developments in inflation and core inflation excluding indirect tax effects. Persistently buoyant domestic demand is boosting, and weakening external activity is restraining the pace of price increase. In the coming quarters, inflation will fluctuate around the 3 percent central bank target. Core inflation excluding indirect tax effects is expected to continue to rise until the autumn months and then to decline from the end of 2019. Based on the preliminary data release, the Hungarian economy grew by 5.3 percent in the first quarter of 2019, mainly driven by industry, construction and market services. According to the indicators received at the beginning of the year, growth in household consumption and investment is likely to continue this year. Labour demand remained strong, and the unemployment rate was close to its historically low level. Based on monthly preliminary data, the current account surplus was maintained in the first quarter of 2019. Economic growth is expected to slow gradually from the next quarters, but to remain strong. As a result of further dynamic growth in credit markets, the investment rate is likely to stabilise at high levels. Higher real incomes are expected to contribute to a further expansion in household consumption and savings. Regarding long-term, sustainable economic growth, the improvement in competitiveness by structural measures will be given increasing emphasis. The outlook for world economic activity and inflation continues to be moderate. Monetary policies across the world's leading central banks remain cautious. Consistent with the downside risks related to the economic activity in Europe and inflation in the euro area, market expectations related to the European Central Bank's (ECB) first interest rate hike shifted to an even later date. As a result, monetary conditions in the euro area may remain loose for a longer period of time than earlier expected. Sentiment in international financial markets has been volatile in the period since the Council's previous interest rate decision. Risk appetite was influenced by developments in international trade policies, incoming macroeconomic data and measures taken by the world's leading central banks. Oil prices have fallen slightly since April. The Monetary Council left monetary conditions unchanged. Accordingly, the Council maintained the base rate, the overnight collateralised lending rate and the one-week collateralised lending rate at 0.9 percent and the overnight deposit rate at -0.05 percent. In March, the Council set the average amount of liquidity to be crowded-out for the second quarter of 2019 at least at HUF 300-500 billion and will take this into account in setting the stock of central bank swap instruments. To improve the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission, the Monetary Council will launch its corporate bond purchasing programme with a total amount of HUF 300 billion on 1 July 2019. By introducing the Bond Funding for Growth Scheme (BGS), the Council's specific objective is to promote the diversification of funding to the domestic corporate sector. The MNB will neutralise excess liquidity arising from the bond purchases by using the preferential deposit facility bearing interest at the central bank base rate. The new programme complements the Funding for Growth Scheme Fix launched at the beginning of 2019. In its decisions, the Monetary Council focuses on the maintenance of price stability. The monetary policy stance will continue to be accommodative, economic agents' financing costs will remain favourable. A dichotomy is observed between the factors determining developments in inflation. Persistently buoyant domestic demand is boosting, and weakening external activity is restraining the pace of price increase. The Monetary Council will assess the effects of this on the maintenance of price stability over the 5-8 quarter horizon of monetary policy. In its monetary policy decisions, the Council applies a cautious approach, relying mainly on the comprehensive projections for the macroeconomy and inflation in the quarterly published Inflation Report."
South Korea,2019-05-31,"Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.75% for the intermeeting period. This press release is the English version of the Bank of Korea's policy statement. In the case of any inconsistency, the original version in Korean will prevail. The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.75% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Board considers that the pace of global economic growth has continued to slow. Volatility in the global financial markets has increased. Government bond yields and stock prices in major countries have fallen while the currencies of emerging economies have depreciated, in line mainly with the escalation of the US-China trade dispute and the sluggishness of economic indicators in major countries. Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and the global financial markets as likely to be affected by factors such as the degree of the spread of trade protectionism, the changes in the monetary policies of major countries, and geopolitical risks. The Board judges that the domestic economy has recovered slightly from its slowdown in the 1st quarter, as consumption has continued to grow albeit slowly, although facilities and construction investment have continued undergoing adjustments and exports have been sluggish. On the employment front, the increase in the number of persons employed has lessened while the unemployment rate has increased. Going forward the Board expects the domestic economy will grow at a rate that does not diverge significantly from the path projected in April. Consumption will continue to grow, while exports and facilities investment will also recover gradually in the second half of this year, although the adjustment in construction investment will continue. However, uncertainties concerning the forecast path have risen, chiefly due to the escalation of the US-China trade dispute. Consumer price inflation has slightly risen within the mid-0% range, in consequence mainly of the smaller decline in petroleum product prices. Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has been at the upper-0% level, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has been at the low-2% level. Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will fluctuate for some time below 1% and then run at the low- to mid-1% level from the second half of this year, but downside risks to the projected path have increased somewhat. Core inflation will also gradually rise. The volatility of price variables in the domestic financial markets has increased, in line mainly with movements in the international financial markets and concerns about economic slowdowns at home and abroad. Long-term market interest rates and stock prices have fallen significantly while the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has risen considerably. The rate of increase in household lending has continued to slow, while housing prices have continued their downtrend. Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As it is expected that the domestic economy will continue to grow at a rate that does not diverge significantly from its potential level and it is forecast that inflationary pressures on the demand side will not be high, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance. In this process it will carefully monitor developments such as the US-China trade dispute, any changes in the economies and monetary policies of major countries, financial and economic conditions in emerging market economies, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks, while examining their effects on domestic growth and inflation."
Kazakhstan,2019-06-03,"– 19 The base rate remains unchanged at 9.00% June 3, 2019 Almaty The National Bank of Kazakhstan has made a decision to maintain the base rate at 9.00% with the corridor of +/-1 percentage points. The annual inflation is formed in the middle of the target range. Inflation expectations remain below the level of annual inflation. Positive trends are also underway in the external sector. According to the assessment of the National Bank, taking into account the impact of internal and external factors, the annual inflation will be within target range throughout 2019- 2020. In May 2019 the annual inflation formed at the level of 5.3% compared to 4.9% in the previous month. At the same time, the non-food inflation and inflation of paid services formed at the levels of 6.1% and 1.3% in annual terms respectively. The current level of inflation was largely formed under the influence of price increase of food items (7.9% in May 2019) amid inflation accelerating in manufacturing and rising prices of import goods. Inflation expectations of households remain low. According to the results of the household survey, in March and April, the value of expected inflation 12 months ahead was formed at 4.5% level. In the absence of shocks from the domestic goods market, the expected inflation anchoring below the level of actual inflation will have a disinflationary impact in the future. The external conditions are defined largely by the dynamics of the world oil price, which remains volatile. The average Brent oil price in January-May of this year was formed above the level of $66.8 per barrel. Nevertheless, from 27 May to 3 June 2019 the oil price has dropped sharply by $9 from $71 to $61, or by 13%, which is due to the tightening trade conditions in the global economy. External monetary conditions have not changed. The inflationary pressure from price increases in the countries - main trade partners increased marginally in April. Inflation in April in Russia amounted to 5.2%. China  2.5%, the European Union  1.9%. Amid expectations of inflation decrease in Russia by the end of 2019, the influence of the external factor on inflation will weaken in the future. The main risk from external environment occurs as a result of the tension in trade relations between the US and other countries, primarily China, which can lead to a slowdown in the global economic growth and have a negative impact on world trade, as well as on goods and capital markets. Major risks to the further deceleration of inflation in the forecast horizon (until the end of 2020) are related to the growing aggregate supply and domestic demand in the economy. In January-April 2019 short-term economic indicator rose by 4.1% due to the growth in the construction industry (8.4%), trade (7.3%), transport (4.8%), agriculture (3.6%), manufacturing (3.5%), and mining (2.6%). In January-April, the growth of investment in fixed capital amounted to 6.7%. As a result, the output gap is estimated to be positive, i.e. is above its potential, creating a certain inflationary potential. The growth of economic activity is accompanied by the expanding domestic demand amid rising wages and social compensations. Hence, the real money income of the population grew up by 9.7% in annual terms in March 2019. The growth of consumer lending, which totaled 14.6% in annual terms in April, indicates growing consumer activity of the population. An increase in social compensations and wages in accordance with the assignment of the First President  Elbasy, given during XVIII convention of Nur Otan party, and rescheduling the date of the wage increase for state employees to June 1 2019 according to the order of the President of Kazakhstan K. Tokayev, in addition to the measures to raise minimum wage and individual income tax cut for low-paid workers, promote growth in consumer demand. According to the National Bank's estimates, an additional impact on inflation from the implementation of social initiatives will not exceed 0.3%. The monetary conditions remain neutral. The base rate in real terms, i.e. taking into account the expected inflation 12 months ahead, is at the level, ensuring inflation maintaining in the target range of 4-6% during the forecast horizon of 2019-2020, as well as promoting sustainable economic growth. Compared to the previous decision on the base rate, the risk balance is shifting to higher trajectory of rates development. The next decision on the base rate will be announced on July 15, 2019, at 17:00 Nur- Sultan time.

Poland,2019-06-05,"Warsaw, 5 June 2019 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 4-5 June 2019 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: â–ª reference rate at 1.50%; â–ª lombard rate at 2.50%; â–ª deposit rate at 0.50%; â–ª rediscount rate at 1.75%. Incoming data suggest that global growth continues at a relatively slow pace, amid heightened uncertainty about the global economic outlook in the coming quarters. At the same time, sentiment in industry is still weak, with more upbeat signs coming from the service sector. In the euro area, despite higher quarterly GDP growth, the pace of economic activity growth remains relatively slow. In the United States, economic conditions remain strong, and the quarterly GDP growth in 2019 Q1 was higher than in the previous quarter. In China. GDP growth stabilised in 2019 Q1, albeit recent data suggest the risk of a weakening in economic conditions in the current quarter. Oil prices have declined, following a significant increase since the beginning of the year. Alongside that, in the recent period the global prices of certain food products have risen. As a result, inflation in many countries has edged up. Core inflation in the external environment of the Polish economy, including the euro area, has also picked up in the recent period. The European Central Bank is keeping interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero, and reinvests maturing securities bought under the asset purchase programme. The US Federal Reserve is keeping interest rates unchanged. At the same time, the Fed is gradually limiting the pace of its balance sheet reduction. In Poland, economic conditions remain good, and annual GDP growth in 2019 Q1 amounted to 4.7%. Activity growth is driven by rising consumption  albeit at a slightly lower rate than in previous quarters  fuelled by increasing employment and wages as well as very high consumer sentiment. This is accompanied by a marked rise in investment, including a strong recovery in investment outlays of enterprises. In 2019 Q1, net exports also made a positive contribution to GDP growth, despite the weakening economic conditions in the external environment of the Polish economy. In recent months, consumer price growth has increased, which was accounted for by rising fuel and food prices as well as higher core inflation. Nonetheless, inflation continues to run at moderate levels. In the Council's assessment, the outlook for economic conditions in Poland remains favourable, and GDP growth this year may turn out to be slightly higher than expected in the March projection. At the same time, inflation will remain at a moderate level and, in the monetary policy transmission horizon, will stay close to the target. The Council judges that the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability."
Euroarea,2019-06-06,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. I would like to thank Chairman of the Board Vasiliauskas for his kind hospitality and express our special gratitude to his staff for the excellent organisation of today's meeting of the Governing Council. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we have conducted a thorough assessment of the economic and inflation outlook, also taking into account the latest staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. As a result, the Governing Council took the following decisions in the pursuit of its price stability objective. First, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We now expect them to remain at their present levels at least through the first half of 2020, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Second, we intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. Third, regarding the modalities of the new series of quarterly targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO , we decided that the interest rate in each operation will be set at a level that is 10 basis points above the average rate applied in the Eurosystem's main refinancing operations over the life of the respective TLTRO. For banks whose eligible net lending exceeds a benchmark, the rate applied in TLTRO III will be lower, and can be as low as the average interest rate on the deposit facility prevailing over the life of the operation plus 10 basis points. A press release with further details of the terms of TLTRO III will be published at 15:30 CET today. The Governing Council also assessed that, at this point in time, the positive contribution of negative interest rates to the accommodative monetary policy stance and to the sustained convergence of inflation is not undermined by possible side effects on bank-based intermediation. However, we will continue to monitor carefully the bank-based transmission channel of monetary policy and the case for mitigating measures. Today's monetary policy decisions were taken to provide the monetary accommodation necessary for inflation to remain on a sustained path towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Despite the somewhat better than expected data for the first quarter, the most recent information indicates that global headwinds continue to weigh on the euro area outlook. The prolonged presence of uncertainties, related to geopolitical factors, the rising threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets, is leaving its mark on economic sentiment. At the same time, further employment gains and increasing wages continue to underpin the resilience of the euro area economy and gradually rising inflation. Today's policy measures ensure that financial conditions will remain very favourable, supporting the euro area expansion, the ongoing build-up of domestic price pressures and, thus, headline inflation developments over the medium term. Looking ahead, the Governing Council is determined to act in case of adverse contingencies and also stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation continues to move towards the Governing Council's inflation aim in a sustained manner. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro area real GDP rose by 0.4%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter of 2019, following an increase of 0.2% in the fourth quarter of 2018. However, incoming economic data and survey information point to somewhat weaker growth in the second and third quarters of this year. This reflects the ongoing weakness in international trade in an environment of prolonged global uncertainties, which are weighing, in particular, on the euro area manufacturing sector. At the same time, the euro area services and construction sectors are showing resilience and the labour market is continuing to improve. Looking ahead, the euro area expansion will continue to be supported by favourable financing conditions, the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance, further employment gains and rising wages, and the ongoing  albeit somewhat slower  growth in global activity. This assessment is broadly reflected in the June 2019 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. These projections foresee annual real GDP increasing by 1.2% in 2019, 1.4% in 2020 and 1.4% in 2021. Compared with the March 2019 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real GDP growth has been revised up by 0.1 percentage points for 2019 and has been revised down by 0.2 percentage points for 2020 and by 0.1 percentage points for 2021. The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the downside, on account of the prolonged presence of uncertainties, related to geopolitical factors, the rising threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.2% in May 2019, after 1.7% in April, reflecting mainly lower energy and services price inflation. On the basis of current futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to decline over the coming months, before rising again towards the end of year. Looking through the recent volatility due to temporary factors, measures of underlying inflation remain generally muted, but labour cost pressures continue to strengthen and broaden amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets. Looking ahead, underlying inflation is expected to increase over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion and stronger wage growth. This assessment is also broadly reflected in the June 2019 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation at 1.3% in 2019, 1.4% in 2020 and 1.6% in 2021. Compared with the March 2019 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for HICP inflation has been revised up by 0.1 percentage points for 2019 and revised down by 0.1 percentage points for 2020. Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth stood at 4.7% in April 2019, after 4.6% in March. Sustained rates of broad money growth reflect ongoing bank credit creation for the private sector and low opportunity costs of holding M3. The narrow monetary aggregate M1 continues to be the main contributor to broad money growth on the components side. The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations increased to 3.9% in April 2019, from 3.6% in March. Beyond short-term volatility, the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations has moderated somewhat in recent months from its peak in September 2018, reflecting the typical lagged reaction to the slowdown in economic growth observed over the course of 2018. The annual growth rate of loans to households stood at 3.4% in April, compared with 3.3% in March, continuing its gradual improvement. The monetary policy measures taken today, including TLTRO III, will help to safeguard favourable bank lending conditions and will continue to support access to financing, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is still necessary for the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute more decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential and reducing vulnerabilities. The implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up to increase resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost euro area productivity and growth potential. The 2019 country-specific recommendations should serve as the relevant signpost. Regarding fiscal policies, the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance is providing support to economic activity. At the same time, countries where government debt is high need to continue rebuilding fiscal buffers. All countries should reinforce their efforts to achieve a more growth-friendly composition of public finances. Likewise, the transparent and consistent implementation of the European Union's fiscal and economic governance framework over time and across countries remains essential to bolster the resilience of the euro area economy. Improving the functioning of Economic and Monetary Union remains a priority. The Governing Council welcomes the ongoing work and urges further specific and decisive steps to complete the banking union and the capital markets union."
India,2019-06-06,"Second Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2019-20 Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) Reserve Bank of India On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today decided to: reduce the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 25 basis points to 5.75 per cent from 6.0 per cent with immediate effect. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF stands adjusted to 5.50 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate to 6.0 per cent. The MPC also decided to change the stance of monetary policy from neutral to accommodative. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Assessment Global Economy 2. Global economic activity has been losing pace after a somewhat improved performance in Q1:2019, reflecting further slowdown in trade and manufacturing activity. Among advanced economies (AEs), economic activity in the US strengthened in Q1, supported by higher government spending, increase in private investment and a lower trade deficit. However, factory activity and retail sales moderated in April. Economic activity in the Euro area has remained weak due to muted industrial activity and weak business confidence. Leading indicators point to a further slowdown in the Euro area in Q2. In the UK. GDP growth for Q1 picked up on high retail sales and government expenditure. However, the outlook is clouded by uncertainty relating to Brexit. The Japanese economy accelerated in Q1 on net exports gains and increased public investment. In April, industrial production improved, while retail sales fell. Economic activity has slowed in many emerging market economies (EMEs). In Q1:2019, the Chinese economy grew at the same pace as in the previous quarter, though slightly above consensus expectations. However, incoming data on industrial production and retail sales suggest that the growth momentum may weaken in Q2. The Russian economy, which had shown some signs of recovery in Q4:2018, weakened in Q1 on muted domestic activity and trade. Economic activity in South Africa contracted in Q1 pulled down mainly by a sharp decline in manufacturing activity. Brazil's economy contracted in Q1 for the first time since 2016 and there are fears that it could return to recession.2 4. Crude oil prices remained volatile, reflecting evolving demand-supply conditions underpinned by the production stance of the OPEC plus, rising shale output, weakening global demand and geo- political concerns. The strengthening of the US dollar had weakened gold prices; however, prices picked up since the last week of May on escalating trade tensions, reviving its demand as a safe haven asset. Inflation remains below target in several economies, though it has shown an uptick since March. Financial markets have been driven by uncertainties surrounding US-China trade negotiations and Brexit. In the US, the equity market has experienced some selling pressures since early May on escalation of trade tensions with China and recently, with Mexico. Equity markets in most EMEs have lost steam due to the waning risk appetite on rising geo-political uncertainties and weakening global trade prospects. Bond yields in the US picked up in April on better GDP data for Q1, but declined in May on subdued economic data and expectations of a dovish monetary policy stance. Bond yields in Germany slipped into negative territory on weak economic data; in Japan, they remained negative on indications of sustained accommodation. In many EMEs, bond yields have been falling with central banks adopting accommodative monetary policy to boost economic growth. In currency markets, the US dollar strengthened on better than expected domestic economic data for Q1. Most EME currencies have depreciated against the US dollar. Domestic Economy 6. Turning to the domestic economy, on May 31, 2019 the National Statistical Office (NSO) released quarterly estimates of gross domestic product (GDP) for Q4:2018-19 and provisional estimates of national income for 2018-19. GDP growth for 2018-19 has been estimated at 6.8 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y), down by 20 basis points from the second advance estimates released on February 28, pulled down by a downward revision in private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) and moderation in exports. Quarterly data show that domestic economic activity decelerated sharply to 5.8 per cent in Q4:2018-19 from 6.6 per cent in Q3 and 8.1 per cent in Q4:2017-18. Gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) growth declined sharply to 3.6 per cent, after remaining in double digits in the previous five quarters. Private consumption growth also moderated. The drag on aggregate demand from net exports increased in Q4 due to a sharper deceleration in exports relative to imports. However, the overall slowdown in growth was cushioned by a large increase in government final consumption expenditure (GFCE). On the supply side, agriculture and allied activities contracted, albeit marginally, in Q4:2018- 19 due to a decline in rabi production. According to the third advance estimates, foodgrains production at 283.4 million tonnes for 2018-19 was lower by 0.6 per cent compared with the previous year mainly due to lower production of rabi rice, pulses and coarse cereals. However, there has been a catch-up in foodgrains production relative to earlier estimates. Foodgrains stocks at 72.6 million tonnes as on May 16, 2019 were 3.4 times the prescribed buffer norms. Growth in manufacturing activity weakened sharply to 3.1 per cent from 6.4 per cent in the previous quarter. Service sector growth, however, accelerated, supported by financial, real estate and professional services, and public administration, defence and other services. In contrast, construction activity slowed down markedly. Moving beyond Q4, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted that south-west monsoon rainfall (June to September) is likely to be normal at 96 per cent of the long period average (LPA). The current weak El NiÃ±o conditions over the Pacific are likely to continue during the monsoon. However, currently prevailing neutral Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) conditions may turn positive in the middle of the monsoon season and persist thereafter, which augur well for the rainfall outlook. Growth in eight core industries decelerated sharply in April, pulled down largely by coal, crude oil, fertilisers and cement. Credit flows from banks to large industries strengthened, though they remained muted for micro, small and medium industries. Based on early results of the Reserve Bank's order books, inventory and capacity utilisation survey (OBICUS), capacity utilisation (CU) in the manufacturing sector improved to 77 per cent in Q4 from 75.9 per cent in Q3; seasonally adjusted CU, however, slipped marginally to 75.2 per cent in Q4 from 75.8 per cent in Q3. The business assessment index (BAI) of the industrial outlook survey (IOS) in Q1:2019-20 remained unchanged at its level in the previous quarter. Imports of capital goods  a key indicator of investment activity  remained3 anaemic in April. However, the manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) edged up to 52.7 in May with strengthening of output, new orders and employment. High frequency indicators suggest moderation in activity in the service sector. Sales of commercial vehicles, tractors, passenger cars, and three and two wheelers contracted in April. Railway freight traffic growth decelerated. Domestic air passenger traffic growth contracted in March, but turned around modestly in April. Two key indicators of construction activity, viz., cement production and steel consumption, slowed down in April. The PMI services index moderated to 50.2 in May on subdued growth of new businesses. Retail inflation, measured by y-o-y change in CPI, remained unchanged in April, at its March level of 2.9 per cent, with higher inflation in food and fuel groups being offset by lower inflation in items excluding food and fuel. The April food inflation print showed an increase to 1.4 per cent from 0.7 per cent in March. Within the food group, vegetables moved out of nine months of deflation. However, three sub-groups, viz., fruits, pulses and sugar, remained in deflation in April, though the extent of deflation moderated. Among other food sub-groups, inflation in prices of milk, oils and fats, spices, non-alcoholic beverages and prepared meals moderated, while inflation in meat, fish and eggs prices ticked up. Inflation in the fuel and light group rose to 2.6 per cent in April from the February trough of 1.2 per cent, pulled up by prices of liquified petroleum gas due to an increase in international prices. Inflation in subsidised kerosene also rose, reflecting the impact of the calibrated increase in its administered price. Electricity prices moved out of three months of deflation in April. Prices of rural fuel consumption items  firewood, chips and dung cake  moved into deflation. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel fell sharply to 4.5 per cent in April from 5.1 per cent in March  the largest monthly decline since April 2017. The moderation in inflation was broad-based, with household goods and services, and personal care and effects sub-groups registering the largest fall in April; housing inflation was the lowest since June 2017, reflecting softening in house rents in urban areas. Inflation in clothing and footwear also touched its historical low in the new all-India CPI series. Inflation in education, health and transportation and communication moderated as well. Inflation expectations of households in the May 2019 round of Reserve Bank's survey declined by 20 basis points for the three-month ahead horizon compared with the previous round, but remained unchanged for the one-year ahead horizon. However, manufacturing firms participating in the Reserve Bank's industrial outlook survey expect input cost pressures to intensify on account of higher raw material costs and salaries in Q2. Input price pressures eased in both agricultural and industrial raw materials. Nominal growth in rural wages and in organised sector staff costs remained muted. Liquidity in the system turned into an average daily surplus of â‚¹66,000 crore (â‚¹660 billion) in early June after remaining in deficit during April and most of May due to restrained government spending. The Reserve Bank injected liquidity of â‚¹70,000 crore (â‚¹700 billion) in April and â‚¹33,400 crore (â‚¹334 billion) in May on a daily net average basis under the LAF. It conducted two OMO purchase auctions in May amounting to â‚¹25,000 crore (â‚¹250 billion) and a US dollar buy/sell swap auction of US$ 5 billion (â‚¹34,874 crore) for a tenor of 3 years in April to inject durable liquidity into the system. The weighted average call money rate (WACR)  the operating target of monetary policy  remained broadly aligned with the policy repo rate: it traded above the policy repo rate (on an average) by 6 bps in April, but below the policy repo rate by 6 bps in May. The Reserve Bank has announced that it would conduct an OMO purchase auction of â‚¹15,000 crore (â‚¹150 billion) on June 13, 2019. Transmission of the cumulative reduction of 50 bps in the policy repo rate in February and April 2019 was 21 bps to the weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans. However, the WALR on outstanding rupee loans increased by 4 bps as the past loans continue to be priced at high rates. Interest rates on longer tenor money market instruments remained broadly aligned with the overnight WACR, reflecting near full transmission of the reduction in policy rate.4 18. Exports were unable to sustain the growth of 11.8 per cent observed in March 2019; they grew by 0.6 per cent in April 2019 dragged down by engineering goods, gems and jewellery, and leather products. Imports grew at a somewhat accelerated pace in April 2019 relative to the preceding month, driven by imports of petroleum (crude and products), gold and machinery. This led to a widening of the trade deficit, both sequentially and on a y-o-y basis. Provisional data suggest that net services exports in Q4:2018-19 were broadly comparable to their level a year ago which bode well for the current account balance. On the financing side, net foreign direct investment flows were stronger in Q4:2018-19 than a year ago. After a sharp recovery in March 2019, net foreign portfolio inflows were relatively modest at US$ 2.3 billion in 2019-20 in April-May. While the equity segment received net inflows during this period, the debt segment witnessed net outflows. India's foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 421.9 billion on May 31, 2019. Outlook 19. In the bi-monthly monetary policy resolution of April 2019. CPI inflation was projected at 2.4 per cent for Q4:2018-19, 2.9-3.0 per cent for H1:2019-20 and 3.5-3.8 per cent for H2:2019-20, with risks broadly balanced. The headline inflation outcome in Q4 at 2.5 per cent was largely in alignment with the April policy projections. The baseline inflation trajectory for 2019-20 is shaped by several factors. First, the summer pick-up in vegetable prices has been sharper than expected, though this may be accompanied by a correspondingly larger reversal during autumn and winter. More recent information also suggests a broad-based pick-up in prices in several food items. This has imparted an upward bias to the near- term trajectory of food inflation. Second, a significant weakening of domestic and external demand conditions appear to have led to a sharp broad-based decline of 60 bps in inflation excluding food and fuel in April; this has imparted a downward bias to the inflation trajectory for the rest of the year. Third, crude prices have continued to be volatile. However, its impact on CPI inflation has been muted so far due to incomplete pass-through. Fourth, near-term inflation expectations of households have continued to moderate. Taking into consideration these factors, the impact of recent policy rate cuts and expectations of a normal monsoon in 2019, the path of CPI inflation is revised to 3.0-3.1 per cent for H1:2019-20 and to 3.4-3.7 per cent for H2:2019-20, with risks broadly balanced (Chart 1). Risks around the baseline inflation trajectory emanate from uncertainties relating to the monsoon, unseasonal spikes in vegetable prices, international fuel prices and their pass-through to domestic prices, geo-political tensions, financial market volatility and the fiscal scenario. In the April policy. GDP growth for 2019-20 was projected at 7.2 per cent  in the range of 6.8-7.1 per cent for H1 and 7.3-7.4 per cent for H2  with risks evenly balanced. Data for Q4:2018-19 indicate that domestic investment activity has weakened and overall demand has been weighed down partly by slowing exports. Weak global demand due to escalation in trade wars may further impact India's exports and investment activity. Further, private consumption, especially in rural areas, has weakened in recent months. However, on the positive side, political stability, high capacity utilisation, the uptick in business expectations in Q2, buoyant stock market conditions and higher financial flows to the commercial sector augur well for investment activity. Taking into consideration the above factors and the impact of recent policy rate cuts. GDP growth for 2019-20 is revised downwards from 7.2 per cent in the April policy to 7.0 per cent  in the range of 6.4-6.7 per cent for H1:2019-20 and 7.2-7.5 per cent for H2  with risks evenly balanced (Chart 2).5 23. The MPC notes that growth impulses have weakened significantly as reflected in a further widening of the output gap compared to the April 2019 policy. A sharp slowdown in investment activity along with a continuing moderation in private consumption growth is a matter of concern. The headline inflation trajectory remains below the target mandated to the MPC even after taking into account the expected transmission of the past two policy rate cuts. Hence, there is scope for the MPC to accommodate growth concerns by supporting efforts to boost aggregate demand, and in particular, reinvigorate private investment activity, while remaining consistent with its flexible inflation targeting mandate. Against this backdrop, all members of the MPC (Dr.Chetan Ghate. Dr.Pami Dua. Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia. Dr.Michael Debabrata Patra. Dr.Viral V. Acharya and Shri Shaktikanta Das) unanimously decided to reduce the policy repo rate by 25 basis points and change the stance of monetary policy from neutral to accommodative. The minutes of the MPC's meeting will be published by June 20, 2019. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during August 5 to 7, 2019.

Ukraine,2019-06-06,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to keep its key policy rate at 17.5% per annum. The decision was required to neutralize inflation risks, which have increased since the previous decision taken in April, and to attain the 5% inflation target next year. Consumer price inflation has been above the NBU's forecast for two months running. In April, its annual reading was 8.8% and it continued to accelerate in May, according to NBU estimates. However, the acceleration is mostly driven by temporary factors, which include higher prices for some vegetables and fuel. In H2 2019, the effect of these factors will fade away as the new harvest becomes available for sale and global energy prices go down. Underlying inflationary pressures continued to decrease gradually. This is reflected in core inflation declining since the start of the year, which is in line with the NBU's forecast. Inflation expectations have also improved a little. At the same time, domestic demand continued to increase rapidly. In particular, there was high growth in wages, retail turnover, construction, and industrial production in March-April. Financial market volatility has also risen in recent weeks. speculative information about external public debt spread in the mediadeliberations regarding the continuation of IMF financial support put off until a new government is formedthreats to financial stability continuing to grow due to current court proceedings.The macroeconomic forecast the NBU published in April envisages that inflation will gradually slow to 6.3% by late 2019, hitting 5.0% in late 2020. The continued fulfillment of Ukraine's obligations under its cooperation program with the IMF was the basic assumption of the macroeconomic forecast. However, the deliberations regarding further financial support from the IMF and, as a result, related financing have been put off until a new government is formed. This is making the Ukrainian economy more vulnerable, and could increase financial market volatility. The Board also noted that domestic demand growth could curb the weakening of underlying inflationary pressures. In addition, both external and internal risks remain substantial, as the NBU pointed out when making its previous monetary policy decision. Among other things, uncertainty persists in the country, which is usually the case during an election period. The following external risks remain relevant:. global recession and lower raw commodity pricespersisting geopolitical tensions, particularly due to trade conflictsuncertainty over the volume of gas transit through Ukraine starting in 2020, as pipelines bypassing the country are being built to deliver gas to Europethe development of the military conflict and new trade restrictions introduced by Russia.As before, the NBU Board thinks that the monetary easing cycle could continue if inflation risks decrease and inflation expectations improve steadily. The NBU's updated macroeconomic forecast, which will be published in July 2019, will take into account the possible impact from sustained consumer demand growth on future price movements, stronger volatility on the financial markets, any other potential factors and monetary actions the central bank might have to take to offset these factors. The decision to keep the key policy rate at 17.5% was approved by NBU Board Policy Rate Decision No.392-D, dated 6 June 2019. A summary of the discussion by Monetary Policy Committee members that preceded this decision will be published on 17 June 2019. A new detailed macroeconomic forecast will be published in the Inflation Report on 25 July 2019. The next meeting of the NBU Board on monetary policy issues will be held on 18 July 2019, as scheduled."
Chile,2019-06-07,"Friday, 7 June 2019 Monetary Policy Meeting At its Monetary Policy Meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to reduce the monetary policy interest rate by 50 basis points, to 2.5%. The decision was adopted by the unanimous vote of the Board members. Regarding the evolution of the external macroeconomic scenario, the main developments of the last month have revolved around the trade conflict, which has permeated other areas of the US-China relationship, plus other US trading partners. Fears that this may lead to a deterioration of the world economy have affected asset valuation, with falls in stock markets and long-term interest rates. Besides, the dollar has appreciated globally and commodity prices have dropped, copper included. In recent days, global financial markets have shown some improvement, hand in hand with signals coming from the central banks of developed countries about their will to boost the monetary impulse. Partial second-quarter inflation and activity data have been below market expectations. It is worth noting the situation of the labor market, manufacturing production and prospects. This coincides with a significant slowdown in global trade, that even posted annual contractions in some months. With respect to local financial markets, external developments have been transmitted through the exchange rate, stock prices and the fixed-income market. Local risk indicators have also shown some increase, but remain contained. Market prices have factored in a lower MPR. Meanwhile, lending rates have declined recently, and a number of them are at their all-time lows. The publication of first-quarter National Accounts confirmed lower-than-forecast activity growth, because of a poor performance of some more volatile lines related to natural resources, and mining. As for demand, the deceleration of machinery and equipment investment and exports stood out, both falling short of expectations, coinciding with the worsened external scenario during recent quarters and inventory build-up that failed to reverse as expected. Consumption brought no surprises, with a strengthened habitual component. April's Imacec revealed an improvement of the mining sector and non-mining growth that remained above 2% annually. Annual CPI inflation â€”measured using the 2018=100 benchmark baseâ€” rose to 2.3% in May (2% in April). As expected, the month's inflation rate (0.6%) was largely the result of the increase in electricity rates. The CPIEFE stayed near 2% annually. Private inflation expectations available at the time of the Meeting show no big change. For the [INF*RES*AS] end of this year and one year ahead they stand somewhat below 3% annually, and remain in the neighborhood two years ahead. On this occasion, the Board also considered the updating of the structural parameters that are used to evaluate the state of the economy, its outlook, and the calibration of monetary policy, the details of which will be included in the June Monetary Policy Report to be released next Monday at 8:30 hours. Most importantly, this allowed to quantify the effects of the massive immigration of recent years on trend and potential growth. In both cases this means an increase of 25 basis points with respect to earlier estimates. This, combined with the lower growth of the first quarter, results in a widening of the activity gap. Meanwhile, the neutral MPR has been revised downward by 25 basis points, partly reflecting the drop in neutral rates around the world. Forecasts included in the Report suggest that in 2019 GDP growth will be between 2.75% and 3.5%, and between 3% and 4% in 2020 and 2021, in line with a recovery of growth in the second half of this year and increased potential growth. These projections consider the monetary policy decision of this Meeting. The Board estimates that, in light of the updating of the structural parameters, the economy has not recovered enough to close the activity gap and boost inflation. Accordingly, the Board has deemed necessary to recalibrate the monetary impulse. The Board estimates that, if the baseline scenario materializes, this change in the MPR will suffice to ensure the convergence of inflation to the target in the policy horizon. Going forward, the onset of the MPR normalization process will depend on inflation clearly advancing to 3%. For this evaluation it will be particularly important the way the labor market will absorb the strong migratory inflow, the response of investment and the external developments. With this, the Board reiterates its will to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the two- year horizon. The minutes of this Monetary Policy Meeting will be published at 8:30 hours of Monday 24 June 2019. The next monetary Policy Meeting is scheduled to take place on 1718 July 2019 and the statement thereof will be released at 18:00 hours this latter day. _The Spanish original prevails."
Georgia,2019-06-12,"12.06.2019 The National Bank of Georgia keeps its policy rate unchanged at 6.50% The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on June 12, 2019 and decided to keep the refinancing rate unchanged at 6.50 percent. In May, with a significant contribution from one-off factors, annual inflation rate equalled 4.7 percent. The contribution of the increased excise tax on tobacco on the annual inflation was 1.3 percentage points. Also, the growth of oil prices on international markets at the beginning of the year contributed to the annual inflation. It should be noted that the core inflation, which excludes food, energy and tobacco, stands at 1.1 percent, indicating that the increase in inflation is only temporary. According to the current forecast, other things equal, the inflation will move towards the target level once the one-off factors fade away from the beginning of the next year. It is important to note that aggregate demand remains below the potential, hence, the demand side pressure on inflation is weak. The monetary policy committee is taking into account the risks of rising inflation expectations and, therefore, further monetary policy normalization process will continue slowly. At a current stage, the MPC deemed appropriate to keep the policy rate unchanged. Although preliminary data indicates increased economic growth, the demand side pressure to the inflation remains weak. The growth of credit activity remains moderate (in April, excluding the exchange rate effect, it equalled 13%). From early 2019, the growth of consumer loans and mortgages in foreign currency declined; however, at the same time, business loans continue to grow and mortgages in national are more active. The competitive exchange rate supports the improvement of the current account balance.The preliminary data indicates the high growth of export of goods and services. Growth of remittances is also significant. According to the same indicators, the growth rate of imports reveals a declining trend in the first few months. The improvement in current account deficit positively affects investors sentiments, reducing the risks associated with the external sector. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all means and instruments at its disposal in order to ensure the price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on July 24, 2019."
Turkiye,2019-06-12,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 24 percent. Recently released data show that rebalancing trend in the economy has continued. External demand maintains its relative strength while economic activity displays a slow pace, partly due to tight financial conditions. Current account balance is expected to maintain its improving trend. Developments in domestic demand conditions and the tight monetary policy support disinflation. In order to contain the risks to the pricing behavior and to reinforce the disinflation process, the Committee has decided to maintain the tight monetary policy stance. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. Factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, monetary stance will be determined to keep inflation in line with the targeted path. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Peru,2019-06-13,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT JUNE 2019 BCRP MAINTAINS REFERENCE RATE AT 2.75% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to maintain the reference rate at 2.75 percent, in light of the following developments: Year-on-year inflation and inflation trend indicators as of May were within the BCRP's target range; One-year ahead expected inflation as of May was 2.47 percent; Primary industries show a weak performance as a result of temporary supply shocks, while non-primary industries maintain a moderate growth momentum mainly because of the slow pace of public investment, which is expected to revert in the second half of the year; and. Global growth risks remain tilted to the downside; and trade tensions have intensified in recent weeks, thereby exacerbating international financial volatility. Year-on-year inflation is expected to remain within the target range and converge towards 2.0 percent over the forecast horizon. The BCRP Board considers that it is appropriate to maintain an expansionary stance as long as inflation expectations remain anchored and economic activity is below its potential level. According to recent inflation and economic activity indicators: Monthly inflation was 0.15 percent (2.73 percent year-on-year) in May 2019. Monthly inflation excluding food and energy was 0.14 percent (remained at 2.60 percent year-on-year) in May. Business conditions expectations moderated in May but remain on the optimistic side. Non- primary activity indicators point to a gradual closure of the output gap. The Board also decided to maintain the interest rates on BCRP off-auction credit and deposit operations in domestic currency with financial entities. Overnight deposits: 1.50 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 3.30 percent per year for financial entities' first 10 operations over the last 12 months; and the rate fixed by the BCRP Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations Committee for operations other than financial entities' first 10 operations over the last 12 months. Dollar swaps: a fee equal to a minimum annual effective cost of 3.30 percent. The BCRP Board's next monetary policy session will take place on July 11, 2019."
Russia,2019-06-14,"On 14 June 2019, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to cut the key rate by 25 bp to 7.50% per annum. Annual inflation slowdown is continuing. In May, households' inflation expectations and business price expectations did not materially change and remain elevated. Economic growth in the first half of 2019 is lower than the Bank of Russia's expectations. Short-term proinflationary risks have abated compared to March. In these circumstances, in line with the pursued monetary policy, the Bank of Russia has lowered its end-of-year annual inflation forecast for 2019 from 4.7-5.2% to 4.2-4.7%. Moving on, according to the Bank of Russia's forecast, annual inflation will stay close to 4%. If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia admits the possibility of further key rate reduction at one of the upcoming Board of Directors' meetings and a transition to neutral monetary policy until mid-2020. In its key rate decision-making, the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic developments over the forecast horizon, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. Inflation dynamics. Annual inflation slowdown is continuing. Annual consumer price growth rate declined in May to 5.1% (from 5.2% in April 2019) and reached an estimated 5.0% as of 10 June. That said, starting in February, seasonally adjusted monthly consumer price growth has remained close to 4% (annualised). Consumer demand trends constrain inflation. Also, temporary disinflationary factors contributed to slowing consumer price growth, among those ruble appreciation since the beginning of the year and the high base effect in respect of the price dynamics of principal types of motor fuel. In May, households' inflation expectations and business price expectations did not materially change and remain elevated. In line with the pursued monetary policy, the Bank of Russia has lowered its end-of-year annual inflation forecast for 2019 from 4.7-5.2% to 4.2-4.7%. The revised forecast takes into account the completion of the VAT increase pass-through to prices (including the influence of secondary effects) and the preservation of relatively favourable external conditions and moderate dynamics of domestic demand. Moving on, according to the Bank of Russia's forecast, annual inflation will stay close to 4%. Monetary conditions. Monetary conditions have somewhat eased since the last Board meeting. Among other things, this was driven by the change in expectations of financial market participants with regard to the Bank of Russia's key rate path. OFZ yields and deposit rates have declined. The potential for lending rates growth has mostly exhausted. That said, the Bank of Russia's decision to cut the key rate and the year-to-date decline in OFZ yields create conditions for the decline of deposit and lending rates in the future. Economic activity. Economic growth in the first half of 2019 is lower than the Bank of Russia's expectations. In January-April, the annual industrial production growth rate remained close to the readings of 2018 Q4. Export growth rates have declined amid weakening external demand. Investment activity remains muted. Annual retail sales growth rate has been slowing down since February on the back of moderate dynamics of household income. Consumer demand and labour market conditions create no excessive inflationary pressure. During the first four months of the current year, the growth in general government income outperformed the growth in expenses, which, in part, is due to the shift to the second half of the year of the implementation of a number of national projects planned by the Government. In the second half of 2019, the incremental budget revenues will be used to raise government spending, including investment. Taking into account GDP growth statistics for 2018 â€” 2019 Q1 published by Rosstat, the Bank of Russia lowered its GDP growth forecast for 2019 from 1.2-1.7% to 1.0-1.5%. Subsequent years might see higher economic growth rates as national projects are implemented. Inflation risks. Short-term proinflationary risks have abated compared to March. The effects of the VAT hike have fully materialised. The revision of the interest rate paths by the US Fed and other central banks in advanced economies in 2019 H1 reduces the risks of persistent capital outflows from emerging markets. That said, significant risks are posed by elevated and unanchored inflation expectations, as well as by several external factors. In particular, the risk of a slowdown in global economic growth still looms caused, among other things, by the further tightening of international trade restrictions. Geopolitical factors might lead to strengthened volatility in global commodity and financial markets, affecting exchange rate and inflation expectations. Supply-side factors in the oil market may amplify volatility of global oil prices. The Bank of Russia leaves mostly unchanged its estimates of risks associated with wage movements, prices of individual food products, and possible changes in consumer behaviour. These risks remain moderate. The mid-term inflation dynamics may be affected by fiscal policy parameters, including decisions on the use of the liquid part of the National Wealth Fund in excess of the threshold level set at 7% of GDP. If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia admits the possibility of further key rate reduction at one of the upcoming Board of Directors' meetings and a transition to neutral monetary policy until mid-2020. In its key rate decision-making, the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic developments over the forecast horizon, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next rate review meeting on 26 July 2019. The Board decision press release is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time. In the follow-up to the Board of Directors meeting of 14 June 2019 the Bank of Russia released its medium-term forecast.

Brazil,2019-06-19,"In its 223rd meeting, the Copom unanimously decided to maintain the Selic rate at 6.50% p.a. The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario:. The global outlook has become less challenging, owing to changes in the prospects for monetary policy in major economies. Nevertheless, the risks associated with a slowdown in global growth remain. The Committee judges that various measures of underlying inflation are running at appropriate levels. This includes the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy. Inflation expectations for 2019, 2020 and 2021 collected by the Focus survey are around 3.8%, 4.0% and 3.75%, respectively; and. The Copom's inflation projections in the scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the Focus survey stand around 3.6% for 2019 and 3.9% for 2020. This scenario assumes a path for the Selic rate that ends 2019 at 5.75% p.a. and increases to 6.5% p.a. over the course of 2020. It also assumes a path for the exchange rate that ends 2019 and 2020 at R$/US$ 3.80. In the scenario with a constant interest rate, at 6.5% p.a., and a constant exchange rate, at R$/US$ 3.85*, the projections for 2019 and 2020 stand around 3.6% and 3.7%, respectively. The Committee emphasizes that risks around its baseline scenario remain in both directions. On the one hand, the high level of economic slack may continue to produce lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory. On the other hand, a possible frustration of expectations regarding the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy may affect risk premia and increase the path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy. Risk intensifies in case the global outlook for emerging economies deteriorates. The Committee judges that the balance of risks has evolved favorably, but risk prevails at this time. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the wide array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to maintain the Selic rate at 6.50% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation and the associated balance of risks, and is consistent with convergence of inflation to target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, which includes 2019 and, mainly, 2020. The Copom reiterates that economic conditions prescribe stimulative monetary policy, i.e., interest rates below the structural level. The Committee deems important to observe how the Brazilian economy will behave over time, with reduction of the degree of uncertainty to which it remains exposed. The Copom emphasizes that the evolution of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy is essential for the reduction of its structural interest rate and for sustainable economic recovery. The Committee stresses that the perception of continuation of the reform agenda affects current expectations and macroeconomic projections. In particular, the Committee judges that concrete progress in this agenda is fundamental for the consolidation of the benign scenario for prospective inflation. In the Copom's assessment, the evolution of the baseline scenario and of the balance of risks prescribes keeping the Selic rate at its current level. The Copom emphasizes that the next steps in the conduct of monetary policy will continue to depend on the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, and on inflation projections and expectations. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Roberto Oliveira Campos Neto (Governor). Bruno Serra Fernandes. Carlos Viana de Carvalho. Carolina de Assis Barros. Joao Manoel Pinho de Mello. Mauricio Costa de Moura. Otavio Ribeiro Damaso. Paulo Srgio Neves de Souza, and Tiago Couto Berriel. *Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average R$/US$ exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the Friday prior to the Copom meeting."
Mongolia,2019-06-19,"MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Keeping the policy rate unchanged Number: 2019/02 Effective date: 19 June 2019 The Monetary Policy Committee meeting was held on 19 June 2019, and it was decided to keep the Policy rate unchanged at 11 percent. Inflation is expected to be around its target level, given the external environment and domestic economic outlook. As of May 2019, annual inflation rate has reached 7.9 percent nationwide. Although inflation is fluctuating due to change in price of gasoline which followed the price of oil at the global market and sharp change in price of meat following recent disruption in domestic supply, the demand-driven core inflation remains stable. Rapid growth in mining activities, steady expansion of corporate lending and increased investments and budget expenditure have contributed to the economic growth. The US and China have both increased import tariffs on certain goods, thus the global trade war has deepened in recent months, resulting in heightened risk for the global economic outlook and prospects of commodity prices and uncertainty in the external environment is amplified. In addition, the upcoming potential deterioration in the terms of trade coincides with the completion of a large mining project and maturing of large external debt. In this regard, it is of utmost priority to focus on macroeconomic policy to sustain the external and internal balance and to accumulate saving and financial buffer at all levels of the country, provinces, local regions, communities, corporates, households and individuals. In order to weather the potential risks in the external environment with minimal cost and to sustain the macroeconomic stability in the medium to long run, it is essential to promote the fiscal discipline, resilience in the banking sector and independence of the central bank. The Monetary Policy Committee decided to keep the policy rate unchanged this time, considering the current macroeconomic outlook and its prospects, and uncertainties and risks in the domestic and external environment. The decision is consistent with the Bank of Mongolia's objective to keep inflation rate around the target rate and to ensure macroeconomic and financial stability in the medium term. Extracts of the meeting minutes will be released in two weeks on the Bank of Mongolia's website. MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE."
Philippines,2019-06-19,"At its meeting on monetary policy today, the Monetary Board decided to keep the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) facility unchanged at 4.50 percent. The interest rates on the overnight lending and deposit facilities were likewise held steady. Latest baseline forecasts indicate that inflation remains likely to settle within the target range of 3.0 percent Â± 1.0 percentage point for both 2019 and 2020, while inflation expectations have moderated further. The Monetary Board also noted that while real sector activity moderated in the first quarter of the year, overall domestic economic activity is likely to remain firm, supported by a projected recovery in household spending and the continued implementation of the government's infrastructure spending program. At the same time, the Monetary Board observed that the risks to the inflation outlook are broadly balanced for 2019 and 2020. Weaker global economic prospects amid a possible easing in global demand and increased trade tensions continue to temper the inflation outlook. The potential adverse effects of a prolonged El NiÃ±o episode remain a key upside risk to inflation. On balance, therefore, the Monetary Board believes that the manageable inflation outlook and firm domestic growth prospects support keeping monetary policy settings steady for the time being. A prudent pause allows the BSP to observe and assess the impact of prior monetary adjustments including the phased reduction in the reserve requirements to be completed by the end of July. Going forward, the BSP will continue to monitor emerging price and output conditions to ensure that monetary policy remains in line with the BSP's price stability objective while being supportive of economic growth."
United States,2019-06-19,"EDT June 19, 2019 Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in May indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity is rising at a moderate rate. Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Although growth of household spending appears to have picked up from earlier in the year, indicators of business fixed investment have been soft. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation have declined; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent. The Committee continues to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes, but uncertainties about this outlook have increased. In light of these uncertainties and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. EDT June 19, 2019 - 2 - Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H Powell. Chair; John C Williams. Vice Chair; Michelle W Bowman; Lael Brainard; Richard H Clarida; Charles L Evans; Esther L George; Randal K Quarles; and Eric S Rosengren. Voting against the action was James Bullard, who preferred at this meeting to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points."
Colombia,2019-06-21,"For the 14th consecutive month. The Board of Directors mainly took into consideration the following information. In May, the average of core inflation indicators (2.92%) remained below the target. Inflation posted at 3.31%. Some supply shocks could raise inflation in the coming months, but it would resume its convergence to the target later. Economic growth for the first quarter of 2019 was lower than expected. The new figures suggest that the economy will be more dynamic in the second quarter. The prospects for global growth continue to moderate, and in the United States the likelihood that the Fed may reduce its policy interest rate increased. The projection of the current account deficit for 2019 continues to stand above 4.0% of GDP, but it will continue to be financed largely by foreign direct investment. Based on this information, the Board considered the following factors for its decision. The temporary deviations of inflation from the target and their persistence. Uncertainty regarding the size of the spare capacity of the economy and the speed at which it may reduce. The effects of changing external conditions on the Colombian economy. In this environment, upon assessing the situation of the economy and the risk balance, the Board unanimously decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate unaltered at 4.25%. The Board will continue to carefully monitor the behavior of inflation and the forecasts for economic activity and inflation in the country, as well as the behavior of the balance of payments and the international context. Finally, the Board reiterates that the monetary policy will depend on the availability of new information. Fecha de publicacion."
Hungary,2019-06-25,"At its meeting on 25 June 2019, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 26 June 2019:. The Magyar Nemzeti Bank's (MNB) single anchor is inflation, its primary objective is to achieve and maintain price stability. The factors determining inflation continue to show volatility. Therefore, in assessing the outlook, the Monetary Council pays more attention to the measures of underlying inflation capturing persistent trends. In May 2019, inflation was 3.9 percent, while core inflation and core inflation excluding indirect tax effects stood at 4.0 percent and 3.7 percent, respectively. The rise in core inflation excluding indirect tax effects reflected an increase in the rate of market services and processed food prices. A dichotomy remains between the factors determining likely developments in inflation. Buoyant domestic demand is boosting, and, from the second half of the year, weakening external activity is likely to restrain the pace of price increase. Consistent with this, core inflation excluding indirect tax effects is expected to rise slightly in the coming months, and then, due to external disinflationary effects, to decline gradually to 3 percent from the end of 2019. The increase of excise duty on tobacco products on a six-monthly basis, which is outside the scope of monetary policy, is likely to raise the consumer price index over the entire forecast horizon. This measure does not cause any second-round effects, consequently, does not influence changes in core inflation excluding indirect tax effects. The Hungarian economy grew by 5.3 percent in the first quarter of 2019, mainly driven by market services, industry and construction. On the expenditure side, in addition to household consumption and investment, net exports also contributed positively to economic growth. Labour demand remained strong, and the unemployment rate was close to its historically low level. Based on monthly preliminary data, the current account remained in surplus in the first quarter of 2019. Economic growth is expected to slow gradually from the middle of the year, but to remain strong. Subdued economic activity in Europe from the second half of the year is also reflected in the slowdown of growth in Hungary. The Hungarian economy is expected to grow by 4.3 percent in 2019 and by 3.3 percent in 2020. As a result of further dynamic growth in credit markets, the investment rate is likely to continue to rise and stabilise at high levels in the coming years. Regarding long-term, sustainable economic growth, the improvement in competitiveness by structural measures will be given increasing emphasis. In addition to monetary policy, the new retail government security strategy, the 2020 draft budget and the provisions of the Economy Protection Action Plan to improve competitiveness, are aimed at further strengthening macroeconomic stability and sustainable convergence. The Hungarian Government Security Plus, introduced in June, is expected to raise households' savings rate, in addition to the structural change of their financial assets. Consequently, an increasing share of rapid wage growth is converted into savings instead of consumption, while the promotion of self-financing also helps to reduce Hungary's external vulnerability. Based on the draft legislation for next year, the budget deficit-to-GDP ratio  with a significant amount of reserves  is likely to decline to 1 percent. After 2019, fiscal policy will remain counter-cyclical in 2020 as well. Announced in recent weeks, the Economy Protection Action Plan is expected to gradually improve the competitiveness of the domestic economy. The above measures jointly strengthen macroeconomic stability, reduce external vulnerability, and contribute to maintain a sustainable convergence path. GDP data for the first quarter of 2019 exceeded expectations in many cases; however, the outlook for global economic activity has continued to deteriorate in recent months. Monetary policies across the world's leading central banks are increasingly cautious. Consistent with the downside risks related to economic activity in Europe and the euro area, after March, the European Central Bank (ECB) modified its forward guidance again in June. According to communications from the ECB, the first interest rate hike shifted to an even later date: interest rates remain at their present levels at least through the first half of 2020, and beyond. Based on the President's latest indications, a growing number of market agents are pricing in the loosening of monetary conditions. In the case of the Federal Reserve, market agents clearly expect an interest rate cut this year, while the Bank of Japan is likely to maintain its loose monetary policy for a longer period of time than earlier expected. Sentiment in international financial markets has been volatile in the period since the Council's previous interest rate decision. Risk appetite was influenced by developments in international trade policies, incoming macroeconomic data and measures taken by the world's leading central banks. Oil prices decreased significantly in the last month. To improve the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission, the Monetary Council will launch its corporate bond purchasing programme with a total amount of HUF 300 billion on 1 July 2019. By introducing the Bond Funding for Growth Scheme (BGS), the Council's specific objective is to promote the diversification of funding to the domestic corporate sector. Companies have shown considerable interest in bond issuance since the programme was announced at the end of March. As a result of the BGS, complementing the Funding for Growth Scheme Fix launched at the beginning of 2019, funding conditions and liquidity of the corporate bond market are expected to improve significantly, offering an effective alternative to funding from banks. The MNB will neutralise excess liquidity arising from bond purchases by using the preferential deposit facility bearing interest at the central bank base rate. The Monetary Council left the base rate, the overnight collateralised lending rate and the one-week collateralised lending rate at 0.9 percent and the overnight deposit rate at -0.05 percent unchanged. In addition, in June, the Council reduced the average amount of liquidity to be crowded out for the third quarter by HUF 100 billion, from the former HUF 300-500 billion band to at least HUF 200-400 billion and will take this into account in setting the stock of central bank swap instruments. The MNB is ready to change the stock of the FX swap instrument in a flexible manner to ensure that the interest rate transmission changes in line with the decisions by the Monetary Council, and the volatility of interbank rates remains at low levels. In its decisions, the Monetary Council focuses on the maintenance of price stability. The monetary policy stance will continue to be accommodative, economic agents' financing costs will remain favourable. A dichotomy remains between the factors determining likely developments in inflation. Buoyant domestic demand is boosting, and, from the second half of the year, weakening external activity is likely to restrain the pace of price increase. Regarding the outlook for inflation, data to be received in the second half of the year will be decisive. Of these, the following are of key importance: the spillover of disinflationary effects of slowing European economic activity, changes in monetary policies of the world's leading central banks, the effect of the new retail government security on savings, and the economic consequences of counter-cyclical fiscal policy. The Monetary Council will assess their effects on the maintenance of price stability over the 5-8 quarter horizon of monetary policy. In its monetary policy decisions, the Council applies a cautious approach, relying mainly on the comprehensive projections for the macroeconomy and inflation of the quarterly published Inflation Report. The future developments in the outlook for inflation will be a decisive factor in the necessity of further measures."
Czech Republic,2019-06-26,"At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank decided to keep interest rates unchanged. The two-week repo rate thus remains at 2%, the discount rate at 1% and the Lombard rate at 3%. Six members voted in favour of this decision, and one member voted for increasing rates by 25 basis points.. This decision is underpinned by the current macroeconomic forecast and by an assessment of information obtained since the current forecast was prepared. The current forecast expects inflation to stay in the upper half of the tolerance band around the target this year and decrease to the target at the start of next year. Following the increase in May, broad interest rate stability until mid-2020 is consistent with the forecast. At its meeting today, the Bank Board assessed the risks to the inflation forecast at the monetary policy horizon as being balanced. With regard to the external assumptions of the forecast, the outlook for growth in foreign producer prices has been lowered, reflecting both their latest evolution and lower expected oil prices. The outlook for economic activity and consumer prices in the euro area is little changed. The market outlook for the 3M EURIBOR in 2020 has been shifted slightly downwards after the European Central Bank extended the period of stability of its interest rates at least until mid-2020 and announced that it was considering other options for easing monetary policy. The market outlook for the Brent crude oil price this year and the next is markedly lower than expected in the current forecast. The euro-dollar exchange rate has shifted to slightly weaker levels, but the euro is still expected to appreciate slightly. So far in Q2, domestic inflation has been in the upper half of the tolerance band around the target, in line with the forecast. It was slightly below the forecast in April, whereas in May it was slightly higher than forecasted. These deviations of inflation from the forecast were due mainly to volatile food prices. Fuel prices were slightly higher in these two months. The other components of inflation were broadly in line with the forecast. In 2019 Q1, the Czech economy grew at the same pace as at the close of last year, in line with the forecast. However, the individual expenditure components differed slightly from the prediction. Household and government consumption grew somewhat faster than forecasted. Conversely, growth in gross capital formation lagged behind expectations, which was due to lower dynamics of fixed investment. The net exports forecast broadly materialised. April data point to continued solid growth in retail sales and construction output, as well as a slight recovery in industrial production. As expected, employment growth slowed in 2019 Q1 amid persisting labour shortages. In line with the prediction, the unemployment rate recorded only a marginal decrease. The number of job vacancies declined slightly. Total wage growth accelerated above the forecast, but wage growth in market sectors was broadly in line with the forecast. The koruna-euro exchange rate fluctuated within a relatively narrow range of CZK 25.625.9 to the euro during Q2. Its average level of CZK 25.7 to the euro was 20 hellers weaker than forecasted. To sum up the important facts about recent developments in the Czech economy, prices and wages increased slightly faster than forecasted, unemployment was only marginally lower and GDP growth was in line with the forecast."
Thailand,2019-06-26,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 4/2019 Mr. Titanun Mallikamas. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 26 June 2019 as follows. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 175 percent. In deliberating their policy decision, the Committee assessed that the Thai economy would expand at a slower pace than the previous assessment mainly due to merchandise and services exports. Inflation was projected to be in line with the previous forecast. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative and conducive to economic growth. However there were pockets of risks to financial stability in the future that warranted continued monitoring. The Committee viewed that the current accommodative monetary policy stance contributed to the continuation of economic growth and was appropriate given the inflation target. The Committee thus voted to keep the policy rate unchanged at this meeting. The Thai economy was expected to expand at a slower pace than previously assessed. Merchandise exports would grow at a significantly slower pace than the previous assessment due to the slowdown of trading partner economies and global trade, which were affected by intensifying trade tensions, particularly between the US and China. Tourism would grow at a lower rate relative to the previous assessment due mainly to Chinese tourist figures. Regarding domestic demand, private consumption was expected to continue expanding. Nevertheless private consumption would be restrained by elevated household debt, with signs of moderation in earnings and employment in the export-related manufacturing sectors. Private investment was projected to slow down. However the relocation of production base to Thailand and public-private partnership projects for infrastructure investment would support investment in the period ahead. Meanwhile public expenditure would grow at a slower pace than previously estimated due to the expected delay in the enactment of the Annual Budget Expenditure Act. BE. 2563 (AD. 2020) as well as postponement of some state-owned enterprise investment. The Committee would monitor external risks from trade tensions, the economic outlook of China and advanced economies that could affect domestic demand, as well as geopolitical risks. Furthermore the Committee would monitor policy implementation of the new government and public expenditure, as well as the progress of major infrastructure investment and its knock-on effects on private investment, which could affect the momentum of economic growth in the period ahead. The annual average of headline inflation would be largely unchanged from the previous projection, although fresh food prices were expected to increase from the previous meeting. Meanwhile core inflation would be mostly in line with the previous projection. The Committee viewed that structural changes contributed to more persistent inflation than in the past. Such changes included the expansion of e-commerce, rising price competition, and technological development which reduced costs of production. Financial conditions over the previous period had been accommodative and conducive to economic growth, with ample liquidity in the financial system. Real interest rates remained at a low level, allowing financing by the private sector to continue expanding. Loans extended to businesses and consumers continued to grow. With regard to exchange rates, the baht appreciated at a somewhat fast pace and outperformed regional currencies, which was a result of the weakening US dollar, short-term capital inflows, and domestic factors. The Committee expressed concerns over the baht appreciation which might not be consistent with economic fundamentals and would continue to closely monitor developments of exchange rates and capital inflows. Financial stability remained sound overall but there remained a need to monitor risks that might pose vulnerabilities to financial stability in the future. The Committee viewed that the implemented macroprudential measures and the increased policy rate had to some extent curbed accumulation of vulnerabilities in the financial system from the search-for-yield behavior in the low interest rate environment that might lead to underpricing of risks. Nevertheless the Committee would monitor household debt accumulation driven particularly by auto-related loans, growth in assets held by saving cooperatives and the interconnectedness among saving cooperatives, adjustments in the real estate sector after the implementation of the revised loan-to-value ratio (LTV) measure, and leverage by large corporates that could underprice risks. In the following period, there remained a need to address financial stability risks through a combination of tools, including the appropriate policy rate as well as microprudential and macroprudential measures which would need to place greater emphasis on debt serviceability of borrowers. Looking ahead, the Thai economy would expand at a slower pace due mainly to the softening momentum of external demand. The Committee would continue to monitor developments of economic growth, inflation, and financial stability, together with associated risks, especially impacts of trade tensions, in deliberating appropriate monetary policy in the period ahead."
Mexico,2019-06-27,"Banco de Mexico's Governing Board has decided to maintain the target for the overnight interbank interest rate at 8.25%. Available information suggests that the world economy decelerated during the second quarter of the year. This situation was due to moderation of growth in some of the main advanced and emerging economies. Although job creation has slightly decreased, unemployment rates in the main advanced economies remain at low levels and wages continue recovering gradually. In turn, headline and core inflation in these economies have remained at low levels and their expectations have decreased. The aforementioned environment has increased the possibility that central banks of the major economies will adopt more accommodative monetary policy stances. In its June meeting, the US Federal Reserve left unchanged the target range for the federal funds rate. In its policy statement, it mentioned that the uncertainty faced by the US economy has increased, under conditions where there is absence of inflationary pressures and that, hence, it will follow closely the economic developments. It added that it would take the appropriate measures in order to sustain the economic expansion with a strong labor market and inflation at levels close to its symmetric 2% objective. This led to a decline in interest rates throughout the entire yield curve and to an increase in risk appetite levels in international financial markets. Nevertheless, risks to the global economy persist: a further escalation of trade tensions between the United States and its main trade partners; the weakness of some of the major economies extending longer than foreseen; new episodes of volatility arising in international financial markets; and, the intensification of certain political and geopolitical risks. For this reason, the balance of risks for the global economy remains biased to the downside. Since the last monetary policy decision, domestic financial markets underwent episodes of volatility due to the threat of tariffs on Mexican imports by the U.S. and to the revisions to the outlook or the credit rating of sovereign debt and of Pemex's debt by some rating agencies. Nevertheless, more recently, given the agreement reached between the governments of Mexico and the United States, and the greater risk appetite among investors in view of the outlook for more accommodative monetary policies, the peso exchange rate reverted its previously observed depreciation and government securities' long- and medium-term nominal and real interest rates decreased significantly. Nonetheless, risks that may deteriorate the performance of financial assets in Mexico are still present. In particular, although domestic financial markets have been adjusting to this environment, uncertainty regarding the bilateral relationship between Mexico and the United States and the credit outlook both for Pemex's debt and for Mexico's sovereign debt persists. The current environment continues to pose significant medium- and long-term risks that could affect the country's macroeconomic conditions, its potential growth, and the economy's price formation process. In this regard, it is particularly important that, in addition to a prudent and firm monetary policy, measures 1 to foster an environment of confidence and certainty for investment and higher productivity are adopted, and public finances are consolidated in a sustainable way. In this context, addressing the deterioration of both the sovereign's and Pemex's credit ratings and achieving the fiscal targets set in the Economic Package for 2019 are necessary. Strengthening the rule of law, tackling corruption, and fighting insecurity are equally imperative. Available information suggests that in April economic activity increased marginally on a month-to-month basis, below market expectations, standing out a slowdown of the services sectors, after the contraction exhibited in the previous quarter, and that most components of aggregate demand, especially those related to domestic demand, remain weak. Thus, slack conditions in the economy have loosened even further than expected. The balance of risks for growth has become more uncertain and its downside bias has increased. Between April and the first fortnight of June, headline inflation fell from 4.41% to 4.00%, due to the significant decline of the non-core component, which went from 6.08% to 4.34%, reflecting the lower increases observed in the prices of fruits and vegetables as well as in energy products, the latter partly due to the fall in their international references. The lower increases of both of these components more than offset the increases registered in livestock product prices. As for core inflation, it was 3.87% both in April and in the first fortnight of June. Such result is due to the fact that although the rate of change of food merchandise prices continued to increase, that of services decreased during the period. Between May and mid-June, short-, medium- and long-term headline and core inflation expectations did not register significant adjustments, albeit in all cases they remained above the 3% target. Regarding information drawn from market instruments, medium- and long-term breakeven inflation expectations remain at high levels. As for inflation risks, some have diminished and others have gained relevance. To the upside, the possibility that the peso exchange rate comes under pressure stemming from external or domestic factors stands out. Should the economy require adjustments either to the real exchange rate or to medium- and long-term interest rates. Banco de Mexico will contribute to orderly adjustments, in an effort to prevent second-round effects on the economy's price formation process. The threat by the United States to impose tariffs on Mexican imports and the adoption of compensatory measures also deserves mention, although this risk has decreased as a result of the recent agreement. Other risks are that energy prices revert their downward trend or that agricultural and livestock product prices exhibit increases; that public finances deteriorate; that core inflation's persistence influences medium- and long-term inflation expectations by making them show a greater resistance to decline; and, that global protectionist measures escalate. In addition, given the magnitude of several wage revisions, that cost-related pressures arise, insofar as such revisions exceed productivity gains. To the downside, that the peso exchange rate appreciates, possibly associated with a context of more accommodative monetary policy stances and lower interest rates worldwide, or in case greater certainty regarding the trade relation with the United States is achieved. Another downside risk is that the prices of certain goods included in the non-core subindex register lower rates of change, as observed in the case of energy goods, due to the greater weakness exhibited by the world economy. In addition, that slack conditions widen more than anticipated, as suggested by the latest information on economic activity, which might influence the behavior of core inflation. Given the aforementioned, high uncertainty persists regarding the risks that might affect inflation. To guide its monetary policy actions. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board follows closely the development of inflation vis-Ã -vis its forecasted trajectory, taking into account the monetary policy stance and the time frame in which monetary policy operates. In this process, it uses available information on all inflation determinants as well as on medium- and long-term inflation expectations, including the balance of risks for such factors. Monetary policy must also respond prudently if for any reason the 2 uncertainty faced by the economy increases considerably. In this context, considering that the current monetary policy is consistent with the convergence of inflation to its target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board has decided by majority to maintain the target for the overnight interbank interest rate at 8.25%. One member voted to reduce the target by 25 basis points. Considering the challenges to consolidate a low and stable inflation as well as those the economy's price formation is subject to and the amount of slack in the economy, the Governing Board will continue to follow closely all factors and elements of uncertainty that have an impact on inflation and its outlook and will take the required actions based on incoming information so that the policy rate is consistent with the orderly convergence of headline inflation to Banco de Mexico's target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board will maintain a prudent monetary policy stance and, under the current environment of uncertainty, will follow closely the potential pass-through of exchange rate fluctuations to prices. Mexico's monetary policy stance relative to that of the U.S.-in an external environment that it is still subject to risks- and the behavior of slack conditions and cost-related pressures in the economy. In the presence and possible persistence of factors that, by their nature, involve risks to both inflation and its expectations, monetary policy will be adjusted in a timely and firm manner to achieve the convergence of inflation to its 3% target and to strengthen the anchoring of medium- and long-term inflation expectations so that they attain such target."
Poland,2019-07-03,"Warsaw, 3 July 2019 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 2-3 July 2019 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: â–ª reference rate at 1.50%; â–ª lombard rate at 2.50%; â–ª deposit rate at 0.50%; â–ª rediscount rate at 1.75%. Incoming data suggest that global economic growth continues at a relatively slow pace, amid heightened uncertainty about the global economic outlook in the coming quarters. In the euro area, despite still good situation in the services sector, the pace of economic activity growth remains relatively slow. In the United States, economic conditions stay strong, but recent indicators signal a possible weakening of activity in the coming quarters. In China, incoming data indicate a deterioration in economic conditions in 2019 Q2. In the recent period there has been an increased volatility of global oil prices; which are still lower than a year ago. This has been accompanied by an increase in the global prices of some food products. At the same time, inflation in many countries remains moderate. The European Central Bank is keeping interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero, and reinvests maturing securities bought under the asset purchase programme. At the same time, the ECB has extended the period that it intends to keep interest rates unchanged. The US Federal Reserve is keeping interest rates unchanged. The Fed is gradually limiting the pace of its balance sheet reduction, signalling the possibility of loosening monetary policy in the coming quarters. In Poland, economic conditions remain good, despite weaker growth abroad. Activity growth is driven by rising consumption, fuelled by increasing employment and wages, very high consumer sentiment, and social benefit payments. Incoming data also indicate a continuation of significant growth in investment and exports. In recent months, consumer price growth has increased, which was driven by rising fuel and food prices as well as higher core inflation. Nonetheless, inflation continues to run at moderate levels. The Council became acquainted with the results of the July projection of inflation and GDP, prepared under the assumption of unchanged NBP interest rates. The July projection takes into account data and information published up to 18 June 2019. In line with the July projection based on the NECMOD model, there is a 50-percent probability 1/2 that the annual price growth will be in the range of 1.7-2.3% in 2019 (against 1.2-2.2% in the March 2019 projection), 1.9-3.7% in 2020 (compared to 1.7-3.6%) and 1.3-3.5% in 2021 (compared to 1.33.5%). At the same time, the annual GDP growth  according to this projection  will be with a 50-percent probability in the range of 3.9-5.1% in 2019 (against 3.3-4.7% in the March 2019 projection), 3.0-4.8% in 2020 (compared to 2.7-4.6%) and 2.4- 4.3% in 2021 (compared to 2.4-4.3%). In the Council's assessment, the outlook for economic conditions in Poland remains favourable, and GDP growth will continue at a relatively high level in the coming years. At the same time, inflation will remain moderate and, in the monetary policy transmission horizon, will stay close to the target. Such an assessment is supported by the results of the July NBP projection. The Council judges that the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability. The Council adopted the Inflation Report  July 2019."
Romania,2019-07-04,"In its meeting of 4 July 2019, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided:. In May 2019, the annual CPI inflation rate remained flat at 4.10 percent (4.11 percent in April), above the variation band of the target and slightly exceeding the forecast, as the slowdown in the annual dynamics of fuel and tobacco product prices was fully offset by the step-up in core inflation. The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate (which excludes from the CPI inflation administered prices, volatile prices, and tobacco product and alcoholic beverage prices) continued to increase in May 2019 to 3.2 percent from 3 percent in April. Apart from the impact of the new tax levied on telecom companies and of the hike in some international agri-food prices, the advance mirrors strong demand-pull and wage cost-push inflationary pressures, alongside the upward adjustment in short-term inflation expectations. Average annual CPI inflation rate continued to decline to 4.2 percent in May 2019 from 4.3 percent in April 2019; calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, the average annual inflation rate has remained flat at 4.1 percent starting with December 2018. Economic growth data for 2019 Q1 indicate a faster annual growth rate of real GDP to reach 5 percent from 4.1 percent in the previous quarter. On the demand side, final consumption continued to be the main driver of economic expansion, the swifter pace of increase owing, inter alia, to a base effect, ahead of the change in inventories and of gross fixed capital formation, whose dynamics re-entered positive territory. By contrast, net exports had a larger negative contribution to GDP dynamics against the background of a wider negative differential between the growth rates of exports and imports of goods and services. Data for April 2019 show a faster rise, in annual terms, in both trade deficit and current account deficit compared to those seen in 2019 Q1. The latest statistical data point to mixed developments for production, consumption and investment: a marginal advance in the annual dynamics of industrial output in April 2019 against 2019 Q1, concurrently with a moderation in retail trade and services to households; a further elevated growth rate, in annual terms, of the volume of construction works, mainly of new construction works (both buildings and civil engineering works). The annual dynamics of credit to the private sector remained relatively constant April through May, decelerating slightly versus 2019 Q1. The evolution in May reflected the further slowdown in the rise of the domestic currency component, mainly on account of loans to households. Against this background, the share of leu-denominated loans in total private sector credit increased marginally to 66.2 percent. The latest assessments indicate the outlook for the annual inflation rate to remain above the variation band of the target over the short time horizon, with some small fluctuations, and follow a trajectory compatible with that shown in the latest medium-term forecast published in the May 2019 Inflation Report. The uncertainties and risks surrounding the inflation outlook further relate to the impact of the set of fiscal and budgetary measures implemented this year, including that of the new benchmark index for loans to consumers (IRCC) on lending and on the monetary policy transmission mechanism. High uncertainties continue to be associated with the future fiscal and income policy stance, while the evolution of the current account deficit remains a matter of concern. Also important are the uncertainties about the pace of euro area and global economic growth  inter alia amid the trade war and Brexit , as well as about the international oil price developments. Particularly relevant were considered the prospective easing of the monetary policy stance by the ECB and the Fed, and the conduct of central banks in the region. In today's meeting, based on the currently available data and assessments, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided to keep the monetary policy rate at 2.50 percent per annum, while maintaining strict control over money market liquidity. Moreover, the NBR Board decided to leave unchanged the deposit facility rate at 1.50 percent per annum and the lending (Lombard) facility rate at 3.50 percent per annum. In addition, the NBR Board decided to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board decisions aim to ensure and preserve price stability over the medium term in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth and amid safeguarding financial stability. The NBR Board underlines that the balanced macroeconomic policy mix and the implementation of structural reforms designed to foster the growth potential over the long term are of the essence in preserving a stable macroeconomic framework and strengthening the capacity of the Romanian economy to withstand potential adverse developments. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR's website on 11 July 2019, at 3:00 p.m. In line with the announced calendar, the next monetary policy meeting of the NBR Board is scheduled for 5 August 2019, when a new quarterly Inflation Report is to be examined."
Israel,2019-07-08,"The inflation environment is above the lower bound of the target range, and recently it has increased slightly, with the economy being at a full employment environment. Since the beginning of the year, most CPI readings have surprised to the upside. The inflation rate over the preceding 12 months has been 1.5 percent, and it currently seems less likely that inflation will again fall below the lower bound of the target range. Most one-year inflation expectations and forecasts are slightly above the lower bound of the target range, and forward expectations for medium and longer terms remained near the midpoint of the target. In the past year, the shekel has strengthened by 4.3 percent in terms of the effective exchange rate. In the intermeeting period, the shekel was relatively stable vis-C 3A 0-visthe dollar and the euro, and depreciated slightly in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. If the appreciation resumes, it is expected to delay the continued increase of the inflation rate toward the midpoint of the target. For several quarters, the economy has grown at around the potential rate. The moderation in the growth rate of private consumption appears consistent with the exhaustion of the process of expansion in the labor market. Some indicators of second quarter growth point to moderation, but others show that growth is continuing at a solid pace. Labor market data indicate that it remains tight. The risks to the global economy remain significant, and the forecasts for world trade and growth inmost regions were revised downward. The expectation in global financial markets is that major central banks will renew the process of monetary accommodation. The Committee assesses that the rising path of the interest rate in the future will be gradual and cautious, in a manner that supports a process at the end of which inflation will stabilizearound the midpoint of the target range, and that supports economic activity. The Bank of Israel continues to monitor developments in inflation, the real economy, fiscal policy, the financial markets, and the global economy, and will act to attain the monetary policy targets in accordance with such developments. For the file of figures accompanying this notice, click here. Graphs and data. The inflation environment is above the lower bound of the target range, and recently it increased slightly, with the economy being at a full employment environment. The CPI for May increased by 0.7 percent, higher than pre-publication assessments, and since the beginning of the year most CPI readings have surprised to the upside. Inflation over the past 12 months was 1.5 percent (Figure 1 in the attached file of figures), its highest level since 2013, with the volatile fruit and vegetables component making a relatively significant contribution (Figure 2). Inflation in the prices of nontradable goods, an approximation of the domestic component of inflation, moderated in recent months, but remains above the 2 percent level, and inflation in tradable goods prices continues to increase. Annual inflation is expected to decline slightly in the coming months, but most one-year inflation expectations and forecasts are slightly above the lower bound of the target range (Figure 3). The Research Department's staff forecast projects that inflation over the next four quarters will be 1.4 percent. Medium-term and long-term forward expectations remained around the midpoint of the target range. In the past year, the shekel has strengthened by 5 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. However, since the last interest rate decision, the shekel has been relatively stable against the dollar and the euro, and weakened slightly in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate (Figure 6). If the appreciation resumes, it is expected to delay the continued increase of the inflation rate towardthe midpoint of the target. Equityindices in Israel increased since the previous interest rate decision, in line with the price increases in most global markets. Government bond yields declined sharply, similar to global yields (Figure 7). Yield spreads between corporate bonds in Israel and comparable government bonds declined slightly. For the past several quarters, the economy has been growing at near its potential rate. According to the second estimate of National Accounts data for the first quarter of 2019, which were revised downward, the economy grew by 4.8 percent, but the growth was affected markedly by volatility in vehicle imports. The moderation of the growth rate of private consumption seems consistent with the exhaustion of the expansion process in the labor market (Figure 12). Some indicators of economic activity in the second quarter point to moderation. The Composite State of the Economy Index for May increased by 0.1 percent, lower than the pace of increase in the past year. Foreign trade data indicate a continued slowdown in goods exports in May (Figure 15). In contrast, sentiment data from the Business Tendency Survey show that growthis continuing at a solid pace, and this is seen as well in (gross) tax revenues. Labor market data indicate that it remains tight: the unemployment rate continues to decline, and the latest data on the employment and participation rates showthey declined slightly but remain high (Figure 16). Wage increases are continuing, led by the business sector (Figure 18). The job vacancy rate has been declining moderately for several months, but it remains high. According to the Research Department's staff forecast. GDP isexpected to grow by 3.1 percent in 2019, a slightly lower pace than in the previous forecast in view of the expected impact of the slowdown in world trade on exports. In 2020. GDP is expected to grow by 3.5 percent, slightly higher than the long-term pace, as a result of expected significant activity by severallarge companies. The decision to hold new elections, and uncertainty regarding the measures the government will adopt following the elections in order to lower the deficit, increase the uncertainty regarding developments in the domestic economy. In recent months, home prices again increased moderately, so that overall they increased by approximately 1.0 percent in the past year, while rental prices remained stable in the past two months. The number of transactions increased markedly among all types of homebuyers. Over the past four quarters, the downward trend in building starts appears to have halted. The trend of expansion in mortgage volume continues, and mortgage interest rates continued to decline moderately. The risks to the global economy remain significant, mainly in view of the trade war, political risk in Europe and in the Persian Gulf, and the concern of a slowdown in China. Forecasts of world trade and of growth for most regions were revised downward (Figure 19), the slowdown in world trade continues (Figure 20), and in contrast to the trend in recent years, the pace of growth in trade is expected to be lower than the growth rate of global output. In the financial markets, equity indices increased (Figure 25), and government bond yields declined sharply, in view ofthe expectation that the process of monetary accommodation by major central banks will resume. In the US, the Federal Reserve left the federal funds rate unchanged, but its announcement was interpreted as a signal that it is expected to begin implementing an accommodative policy due to intensifying risks and a decline in inflation expectations. In Europe, the economic picture continues to indicate weakness, and industrial production continues to contract. The ECB left its interest rate unchanged, but clarified that all policy tools are on the table, and noted that there is no expectation of an interest rate increase until at least the midpoint of 2020. In Japan, there was growth in the first quarter supported by net exports, although leading indicators point to weakness in domestic demand and in the manufacturing sector. Growth in China is expected to continue to moderate, and the authorities continue to adopt measures to support growth. Oil prices declined since the previous interest rate decision, in view of the continued increase in supply from the US and despite increased geopolitical risk (Figure 23). The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on July 22, 2019. The next decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Wednesday. August 28, 2019."
Malaysia,2019-07-09,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.00 percent. The global economy continues to expand moderately. Labour conditions in the advanced economies remain firm, while domestic demand continues to support growth in Asia. Leading indicators, however, point to a softening of the near term global economic outlook, with considerable downside risks remaining primarily from prolonged trade tensions. While the prospects of monetary easing in the major economies have somewhat eased global financial conditions, heightened policy uncertainty could lead to excessive financial market volatility. The Malaysian economy grew within expectations in the first quarter of the year, supported by both domestic and external factors. Looking ahead, while the external sector performance is likely to be weighed down by slower global growth and trade tensions, economic growth will be supported by domestic demand. Household and capital spending will continue to be driven by stable labour market conditions and capacity expansion in key sectors such as manufacturing and services. The baseline projection remains within the range of 4.3% - 4.8%. This projection, however, is subject to downside risks from ongoing uncertainties in the global and domestic environment, worsening trade tensions and extended weakness in commodity-related sectors. While headline inflation has remained low in the recent period, it is projected to rise in the coming months as the impact of the changes in consumption tax policy lapses. For 2019 as a whole, average headline inflation is expected to be broadly stable compared to 2018. The trajectory of headline inflation will be dependent on global oil prices and policy measures such as the timing of the lifting of the price ceiling on domestic retail fuel prices. Underlying inflation is expected to remain stable, supported by the continued expansion in economic activity and in the absence of strong demand pressures. At the current level of the OPR, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and supportive of economic activity. The MPC will continue to assess the balance of risks to domestic growth and inflation, to ensure that the monetary policy stance remains conducive to sustainable growth amid price stability.

Thailand,2019-07-10,"Outcome of the Joint Meeting between the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) and the Financial Institutions Policy Committee (FIPC) on 5 July 2019 The Bank of Thailand announced the outcome of the joint meeting between the MPC and the FIPC on 5 July 2019 to assess risks to Thailand's financial stability. Key discussion points were as follows. The committees concluded that Thailand's financial stability remained sound. Banks and insurance companies maintained high capital buffers, while external stability remained solid, which helped cushion the spillover from external factors notably the trade tensions between the US and China. Nonetheless financial stability risks had not abated in the recent periods, and a further build-up of risks was observed in some areas. The committees highlighted four key issues as follows. 1) The household debt situation remained a pressing concern, especially for vulnerable households. Household debt accumulation stayed elevated and showed signs of picking up, mainly from auto-related loans. Meanwhile banks and non-banks competed more aggressively in the retail loan market, exhibited looser underwriting standards, and had lending practices that encouraged excessive borrowing, which could add vulnerabilities to households' balance sheets. The committees thus urged banks and non-banks to lend responsibly by putting more weight on borrowers' debt serviceability in the loan approval process. Special attention should be given on vulnerable groups, such as low-income borrowers, first jobbers, and retirees, all of whom tended to be overly indebted and might not have enough residual income to cover living expenses. The committees viewed household debt to be at the forefront of financial stability concerns. Barring prompt policy actions, the problem seemed poised to intensify in the coming years. Effective policy packages would require interagency collaboration and synchronized efforts on several fronts. These would include: ensuring sound lending practices and consideration of borrowers' debt serviceability in the lending process, both for banks and non-banks; restructuring of troubled loans; and promoting financial literacy and use of microinsurance especially for farming products. Recently the Bank of Thailand collaborated with banks in standardizing the calculation of debt service ratio (DSR), which could be used for monitoring the banking system's underwriting standards and informing policy decisions if needed in the future. The committees also noted the need to stay vigilant on the spillover due to regulatory arbitrage, as stricter regulations could push risky lending activities to unregulated entities outside the purview of regulators. So effective policy packages must tackle the household debt issue in an all-inclusive manner without side effects. 2) The mortgage loan market still expanded in the first five months of 2019, despite the fact that new mortgage loans started to slow down in April and May following a surge earlier in the year. Following the implementation of the revised loan-to-value (LTV) measure, adjustments in the real estate market turned out to be as expected. The decline in the number of new mortgage loan accounts came from borrowers servicing two or more mortgage loans, especially for high-rise mortgages, and this reflected reduced speculative demand. In contrast, new mortgage loans granted to first-time homebuyers (servicing one mortgage loan) still managed to grow at a pace close to that of the previous year. Banks enhanced their underwriting standards, as reflected in a lower share of new mortgage loans with high LTV ratio, a lower loan-to-income ratio, and a shorter tenor on average. Developers also delayed project launches and adjusted their investment plans to align with market conditions. In the meantime, risks from oversupply continued to be present. Foreign demand from many countries, notably China, showed signs of slowdown since the beginning of the year, while oversupply in the condominium market stayed high as reflected in declining rental yields. In light of these assessments, the committees would continue to monitor the impact of the LTV measure, adjustments in the real estate sector, and oversupply conditions in the periods ahead. 3) For savings cooperatives, their assets had grown over the years and their significance to financial stability had risen considerably. Thus there was an urgent need to enhance the supervision of savings cooperatives to reflect their increased systemic importance. While the new Cooperatives Act had already taken effect, the committees viewed that the enactment of the accompanying ministerial regulations remained delayed. Relevant regulators must expedite the enactment of key parts of the regulations, especially those related to credit risks, liquidity risks, and households' leverage, so that the new regulations could be used promptly to mitigate existing risks in the savings cooperatives system. The committees would also remain vigilant on the search-for-yield behavior among savings cooperatives, as well as the increased interconnectedness within the cooperatives system due to cross-lending, which could act as the main channel through which liquidity shocks could propagate in the cooperatives system. 4) The search-for-yield behavior continued to persist in several areas, which could lead to underpricing of risks. Insurance companies invested in riskier bonds, while term funds' investment remained highly concentrated in a small number of countries and issuers. Meanwhile large conglomerates expanded their investment into non-core areas and had complex organizational structures, which made it more difficult to assess their risks properly. In light of these conglomerates' significance in the loan and bond markets, monitoring their risks would require close collaboration among related regulators. With regard to households, their investment in risky assets seemed poised to continue on an uptrend. There also continued to be a need to monitor fraudulent investment schemes, such as those related to Ponzi schemes and fake digital tokens, which lured the public with abnormally high returns. In the periods ahead, the committees viewed that financial stability risks would remain elevated. Further easing from G3 central banks could result in looser financial conditions globally, which would be conducive to a further build-up of risks in the global financial system. In addition, uncertainties surrounding the trade tensions and geopolitical risks would likely remain high. On the domestic front, the committees would continue to monitor developments in the four key issues discussed above, assess the effectiveness of the implemented measures, and explore further policy options to prepare for periods of heightened systemic risks in the future. The Bank of Thailand, the Office of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Office of Insurance Commission would continue to collaborate closely in assessing and monitoring risks to financial stability. The three regulators would also improve and enforce regulations to cope with emerging risks appropriately, with an aim to prevent the build-up of vulnerabilities that could undermine national financial stability."
Egypt,2019-07-11,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release July 11, 2019 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 1575 percent, 1675 percent, and 1625 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 1625 percen. Annual headline and core inflation declined to 94 percent and 64 percent in June 2019 from 141 percent and 78 percent in May 2019, respectively, recording the lowest rates since more than three year. This decline was strongly supported by favorable base effects, resulting from the direct and indirect impact of the implemented fiscal consolidation measures in June 2018, in addition to the significant decline of volatile food prices in June 201. Meanwhile real GDP growth continued to increase slightly to record a preliminary estimate of 57 percent in 2019 Q2, compared to 56 percent in the previous quarter, leading to an estimated growth rate of 56 percent for the fiscal year 2018/19, the highest since the fiscal year 2007/0. Moreover the unemployment rate continued to decline to record 81 percent in 2019 Q1, compared to 89 percent in the previous quarte. Globally the expansion of economic activity weakene. Furthermore international oil prices remain subject to volatility due to geopolitical risks and potential supply-side factor. The inflation outlook incorporated the recently implemented fiscal consolidation measures, that include reaching cost recovery for most fuel products as well as fuel price indexation to underlying cost. Since these measures were anticipated, the MPC decided that keeping key policy rates unchanged at this juncture remains consistent with achieving the inflation target of 9 percent (Â±3 percentage points) in 2020 Q4 and price stability over the medium ter. The MPC closely monitors all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust its stance to preserve monetary stabilit.

Peru,2019-07-11,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT JULY 2019 BCRP MAINTAINS REFERENCE RATE AT 2.75% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to maintain the reference rate at 2.75 percent, in light of the following developments: Year-on-year inflation and inflation trend indicators as of June were within the BCRP's target range; One-year ahead expected inflation as of June was 2.48 percent; Primary industries show a weak performance as a result of temporary supply shocks, while non-primary industries maintain a moderate growth momentum. Public investment has registered a slow pace in the first half of the year, which is expected to revert in the second half; and Global growth risks persist, although international financial volatility has decreased due to expectations of a more expansionary monetary policy stance in advanced economies. Year-on-year inflation is expected to remain within the target range and converge towards 2.0 percent over the forecast horizon, with a downside bias due to the possibility of a lower-than- expected increase in domestic demand. The BCRP Board considers that it is appropriate to maintain an expansionary monetary policy stance and pays close attention to new information on inflation and its determinants in assessing future changes in the stance. According to recent inflation and economic activity indicators: Monthly inflation was -0.09 percent in June, bringing down year-on-year inflation to 2.29 percent, from 2.73 percent in May. With monthly inflation excluding food and energy at 0.02 percent in June, the year-on-year figure decreased to 2.3 percent, from 2.6 percent in May. Business conditions expectations moderated in June, especially three-months ahead expectations. Non-primary activity indicators continue to point to a gradual closure of the output gap. The Board also decided to maintain the interest rates on BCRP off-auction credit and deposit operations in domestic currency with financial entities. Overnight deposits: 1.50 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 3.30 percent per year for financial entities' first 10 operations over the last 12 months; and the rate fixed by the BCRP Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations Committee for operations other than financial entities' first 10 operations over the last 12 months. Dollar swaps: a fee equal to a minimum annual effective cost of 3.30 percent. The BCRP Board's next monetary policy session will take place on August 8, 2019."
Kazakhstan,2019-07-15,"PRESS - RELEASE – 22 The base rate remains unchanged at 9.00% July 15, 2019 Almaty The National Bank of Kazakhstan has made a decision to maintain the base rate at 9.00% with the corridor of +/-1 percentage points. The annual inflation is developing in accordance with the National Bank outlook. Inflation expectations leveled with the annual inflation. According to the revised assessment of the National Bank, the inflation will continue to develop within the target range, close to its upper bound for the rest of the year. In the presence of risk escalation in the global resource markets and strengthening inflationary pressure from the expanding consumer demand, tightening monetary policy until the end of this year is possible. The annual inflation remains in the target range of 4-6%. In June it developed at 5.4% level amid of a 0.2% increase in consumer prices during the same month. The main contribution to this rise was made by the food items; their prices increased by 8.2% in annual terms. The price increase took place under the influence of supply-side drivers in certain domestic products markets (meat and meat products, bakery products, and cereal), as well as an increasing cost of grains and meat products in the global food markets. Non-food inflation remained at 6.1% level. Annual growth rate of tariffs for paid services continues to form at the minimum level of 1.2%. Inflation expectations of households, which tend to be sensitive to changing prices in food markets, increased. In June the expected inflation leveled the actual inflation and was equal to 5.4%, compared to 4.7% in May this year. The inflationary pressure, originating from the drivers of domestic demand, is observed. Real income growth in January-May reached 5.5%. The expansion of domestic demand is stimulated by the extending social focus of fiscal programs, and short-term consumer loans. In May consumer lending of banking sector grew up by 14.8% in annual terms. The economic activity demonstrates a positive trend. According to the statistics of the first six months of 2019, the economy of Kazakhstan grew by 4.1%. A positive investment activity remains, which is evidenced by the growth of investment in fixed capital by 11.7% in January- June 2019. The balance of risks in the external sector has changed from the previous decision- making. The average Brent oil price went to $66 a barrel since the beginning of the year, compared to $72 a barrel on average in 2018. International organizations made a downward revision of outlook for the global economic growth and the growth of the main trading partners of Kazakhstan in 2019, which will affect the slowdown in the external demand for the Kazakhstan export. Trade negotiations between the US and China remain incomplete. Nevertheless, inflation in countries - main trade partners is developing at the moderate level (4.7% and 2.7% in June, in Russia and China respectively; 1.6% in May in the EU) External monetary conditions are easing gradually. The recent rhetoric of the US Federal Reserve regarding a lower trajectory of rates in the future, and ECB statement about the additional measures of economic stimulation. In June the Central Bank of Russian Federation lowered the key rate to 7.5% with a possibility of further cut by the end of this year. Current level of base rate and monetary conditions promote conditions for sustaining inflation close to upper boundary of the 4-6% target range in the forecast horizon. In situation of rising probability of main risks realization that can prevent from achieving the inflation objective, the National Bank will consider raising the base rate until the end of this year. The next decision on the base rate will be announced on September 9, 2019, at 17:00 Nur-Sultan time.

Pakistan,2019-07-16,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement July 16, 2019. At its meeting on 16th July 2019, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise the policy rate by 100 bps to 13.25 percent with effect from 17th July 2019. The decision takes into account upside inflationary pressures from exchange rate depreciation since the last MPC meeting on 20th May 2019 and the likely increase in near term inflation from the one-off impact of recent adjustments in utility prices and other measures in the FY20 budget. The decision also takes into account downside inflation pressures from softening demand indicators. Taking these factors into consideration, the MPC expects average inflation of 1 12 percent in FY20, higher than previously projected. Nevertheless inflation is expected to fall considerably in FY21 as the one-off effect of some of the causes of the recent rise in inflation diminishes. With this decision on interest rates, the MPC is of the view that the adjustment related to interest rates and the exchange rate from previously accumulated imbalances has taken place. Going forward the MPC will be ready to take action depending on economic developments and data outturns. Unanticipated increases in inflation that adversely affect the inflation outlook may lead to further modest tightening. On the other hand, greater than expected softening in domestic demand and downward revision in projected inflation would provide grounds for easing monetary conditions. In reaching this decision the MPC considered the key economic developments since the last MPC meeting on 20th May 2019, developments in the real, external and fiscal sectors, and the resulting outlook for monetary conditions and inflation. Key developments since the last MPC. There have been three key developments since the last MPC meeting. First the Government of Pakistan has passed FY20 budget that seeks to credibly improve fiscal sustainability by focusing on revenue measures to widen the tax base. Adjustments in utility prices and other measures in the budget are expected to lead to one-time considerable increase in prices in the first half of FY20. On the other hand, the government has also committed to cease borrowing from the State Bank that would qualitatively improve the inflation outlook. Second the outlook for external financing has further strengthened with the disbursement of the first tranche associated with the IMF Extended Fund Facility, activation of the Saudi oil facility, and other commitments of support from multilateral and bilateral partners. The current account deficit has also continued to fall suggesting that external pressures continue to decline. On the other hand, the depreciation in the exchange rate since the last MPC has added to inflationary pressures. Finally on the international front, the sentiment towards emerging markets has improved with greater expectations of policy rate cut in the United States. Real sector. Domestic demand is estimated to moderate to about percent in FY19 and GDP growth to. percent. While current high frequency indicators point to slowing in economic activity, this is expected to turn around in the course of the year on the back of improved market sentiments in the context of IMF supported program, rebound in the agriculture sector and the gradual impact of government incentives for export- oriented industries. Conditional upon the latest available information. SBP expect the real GDP growth of around. percent in FY20. External sector. External conditions show continued steady improvement with sizeable reduction in the current account deficit which fell by 29. percent to US$ 12. billion in Jul-May FY19 as compared to US$ 17. billion during the same period last year. This improvement was primarily driven by import compression and healthy growth Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN in workers' remittances. Export volumes have been growing even though export values have remained subdued due to fall in unit prices as also experienced by competitor exporting countries. Future developments in export performance will also depend on growth rates of our trading partners and progress in alleviating domestic structural impediments. SBP's foreign exchange reserves have risen to about US$8 billion on 12th July 2019 with the disbursement of the first tranche of the IMF's Extended Fund Facility. Reserves are expected to rise further in FY20 on account of additional financial inflows from other international creditors including those related to the Saudi oil facility and continued improvement in current account deficit. The bulk of the needed adjustment in the real effective exchange rate to address the past overhang of overvaluation has been completed with the recent depreciation of the exchange rate. While the exchange rate is flexible and market determined, the SBP stands ready to take action to address disorderly market conditions in the foreign exchange market. Fiscal Sector. Led by substantial shortfall in revenue collection, higher than budgeted interest payments and security related expenditures, both the overall fiscal and primary deficits deteriorated in FY19. The FY20 budget seeks to credibly reverse the recent trend of fiscal deterioration by addressing long-standing weaknesses in the taxation system and to enhance documentation of economic activities. On the back of an ambitious target for tax collection and tight control over expenditures, the budget envisaged sizable reduction in primary deficit. This fiscal consolidation would support SBP's stabilization policies already in place. From monetary policy perspective, the government's strong commitment to end its borrowing from the SBP, and the implementation of liability management operation to restructure the outstanding debt held by SBP, would positively contribute towards monetary policy transmission while credibly anchor markets' inflation expectations going forward. Monetary and inflation outlook 10. Reflecting the impact of stabilization measures, private sector credit (PSC) growth has started to decelerate. PSC expanded 1. percent during 1st Jul 28th Jun FY19 as compared to 14. percent during the same period last year. The deceleration in credit was more pronounced in real terms as the increase in PSC was largely driven by higher input prices, which in turn increased the working capital needs of the businesses. This together with higher budgetary borrowing led to sharp increase in the net domestic assets (NDA) of the banking system. In aggregate, broad money supply (M2) grew by 12. percent during 1st Jul 28th Jun FY19 as compared to 10 percent during the comparable period last year. Going forward, the composition of money supply is expected to change as NFA of the banking system is projected to improve, while the growth in NDA is likely to show substantial moderation. Inflation rose considerably to. percent in FY19 due to higher government borrowing from SBP, lagged impact of exchange rate depreciations, hike in domestic fuel prices, and rising food prices. CPI inflation was. percent in June 2019 and is expected to rise in the near term due to the one-off impact of adjustment in utilities prices and other measures in the FY20 budget. These pressures are expected to recede in the second half of the fiscal year and the MPC expects inflation to average 1 12 percent in FY20. The MPC is of the view that real interest rates implied by these inflation projections and today's policy rate decision are at appropriate levels considering the cyclical weakening of aggregate demand.

Chile,2019-07-18,"Thursday, 18 July 2019 Monetary Policy Meeting In its Monetary Policy Meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to hold the monetary policy interest rate at 2.5%. The decision was adopted by the majority of its members, with the votes of Governor Mario Marcel. Vice-Governor JoaquÃ­n Vial, and Board members Rosanna Costa and Alberto Naudon. Board member Pablo GarcÃ­a voted for lowering the policy rate by 25 basis points, to 2.25%. On the external front, the expectations of a more expansionary monetary policy stance have been consolidating in various economies, both developed and emerging, some of which have already taken action in that direction. This has occurred in a context in which inflation remains well contained in the developed world and there is ongoing general concern over the performance of the global economy. Incoming data from manufacturing, investment and foreign trade have brought a negative surprise in several economies, contrasting with information about employment, consumption and services, which shows no major changes in the main economies. In this scenario, long- term interest rates posted new declines, the stock markets increased and risk premiums tightened, while capital flows into emerging economies increased at the margin and the dollar tended to weaken against other currencies. Commodities have seen limited price increases since the last Meeting, copper and oil included. The evolution of the domestic financial market has been dominated by more expansionary monetary policy in Chile and by external developments. Peso- denominated long-term interest rates have dropped, stock returns have risen and risk indicators have declined. The exchange rate, with some volatility, is lower than it was at the last Meeting. In the credit market, housing loans dynamism is similar to the one of the past few months, while commercial and consumer loans have slowed down slightly. Meanwhile, interest rates on commercial and mortgage loans have diminished further, so they continue around record lows. The Bank Lending Survey of the second quarter reflects fairly stable supply conditions, while demand appears to be somewhat weaker in large companies and with moderate upswings in the segments of construction firms and housing financing. Regarding activity and demand, the information at hand for the second quarter points to somewhat less than expected dynamism, partly due to poor performance of mining and some specific factors. Some qualitative background indicators suggest that additional downside risks may be expected for the coming months. About consumption, imports of consumer goods have slowed down and consumers' expectations have deteriorated significantly (IPEC). The labor market shows no significant changes, the unemployment rate remains around 7% and various indicators point to increasing job creation. On the investment side, the favorable evolution of some elements related to business services contrasts with the moderation of sales of construction materials and business expectations (IMCE), which are still slightly below [INF*RES*AS] their neutral levels. On the other hand, exports contracted beyond expectations, partly reflecting the weakness of some trading partners. In this context, the growth expectations contained in the Economic Expectations Survey (EES) decreased for both this year and next. The annual CPI variation remained at 2.3% in June, while core inflation (CPIEFE) continued to hover around 2% annually. Among core inflation components, it is worth noting the widespread drop in the prices of services, more closely linked to capacity gaps and labor costs. On the contrary, the goods component of the CPIEFE posted unexpected growth, although largely driven by tourist packages. As for inflation expectations, there is a decrease for both the end of 2019 and one year ahead. For two years ahead, while the EES median remained at 3%, the median of the Financial Brokers Survey dropped to 2.8%. The Board considers that information accumulated since the publication of the last Monetary Policy Report reflects increased risks associated with the timely convergence of inflation to the target over the policy horizon. In particular, due to lower services inflation figures, whose persistence is high relative to other CPI components and the risks surrounding the future evolution of activity and demand, in a context of high external uncertainty. In case these tendencies persist, the Board estimates that it will be necessary to extend the current monetary stimulus, in a magnitude to be assessed in the next Monetary Policy Report. Accordingly, it reiterates its will to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% in the two- year horizon. The minutes of this Monetary Policy Meeting will be published at 8:30 hours Friday 2 August 2019. The next Monetary Policy Meeting will take place on 3 September and the statement thereof will be published at 18 hours the same day. The Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2019-07-18,"Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points, from 1.75% to 1.50%. This press release is the English version of the Bank of Korea's policy statement. In the case of any inconsistency, the original version in Korean will prevail. The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points, from 1.75% to 1.50%. Based on currently available information the Board considers that the pace of global economic growth has continued to slow as trade contracted mainly due to the US-China trade dispute. Global financial markets have been stable in general, with stock prices in major countries increasing in line primarily with expectations of monetary easing in major countries. Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and the global financial markets as likely to be affected by factors such as the degree of the spread of trade protectionism, the changes in the monetary policies of major countries, and geopolitical risks. The Board judges that the pace of domestic economic growth has slowed as construction investment has continued undergoing an adjustment and the slowdowns in exports and facilities investment have deepened, although consumption has continued to grow moderately. Employment conditions have partially improved, with the increase in the number of persons employed having risen. With respect to future domestic economic growth, the Board expects that the adjustment in construction investment will continue and exports and facilities investment will recover later than originally expected, although consumption will continue to grow. GDP is forecast to grow at the lower-2% level this year, below the April forecast (2.5%). Consumer price inflation has remained low at the mid- to upper-0% level, in consequence mainly of the continued decline in petroleum product prices. Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has been at the mid- to upper-0% range, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has been at the low-2% level. Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will fall short of the path projected in April and fluctuate for some time below 1% and then run at the low- to mid-1% level from next year. Core inflation will also gradually rise. The volatility of price variables in the domestic financial markets has increased. Long- term market interest rates have fallen significantly, in line mainly with concerns about economic slowdowns at home and abroad. Stock prices and the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate have fluctuated considerably, mainly affected by the US-China trade dispute and Japan's export restrictions. The rate of increase in household lending has continued to slow, while housing prices have continued their downtrend. Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As it is expected that domestic economic growth will be moderate and it is forecast that inflationary pressures on the demand side will remain at a low level, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance. In this process it will carefully monitor developments such as the US-China trade dispute. Japan's export restrictions, any changes in the economies and monetary policies of major countries, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks, while examining their effects on domestic growth and inflation."
Ukraine,2019-07-18,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to cut the key policy rate to 17.0% per annum effective 19 July 2019. The NBU continues the cycle of monetary policy easing as inflation is declining towards the target of 5%. After temporary factors caused a deviation from the target in previous months, annual consumer price inflation came in at 9.0% in June 2019, approaching the trajectory of the April forecast. Core inflation slowed to 7.4% in Q2, which was close to the NBU's forecast. The tight monetary policy remained a strong factor that held back underlying pressures on prices, in particular through strengthening of the exchange rate against currencies of trading partners and lower inflation expectations of households, businesses, banks, and financial analysts. At the same time, inflation remained relatively high due to the pressure from consumer demand, production costs, and rapid growth in administered prices. Inflation will continue to decline gradually. The NBU reiterates its forecast that inflation will decline to 6.3% as of the end of 2019, return to the target range in early 2020, and reach the medium-term target of 5% at the end of 2020. The tight monetary conditions will continue to be the disinflation driver. Whereas the key policy rate is reduced gradually, its real value will remain high on the back of improved inflation expectations. High real interest rates will make hryvnia financial instruments more attractive for investors, which will support the exchange rate of the hryvnia. Moreover, such monetary policy stance will limit the pressure from consumer demand. Other factors behind the gradual disinflation will include:. a prudent fiscal policythe slowdown in wage growthrelatively low energy prices in the global marketsample supply of domestic and foreign food products.In 20192021, the economy of Ukraine will grow steadily, at 3%4%. The NBU has revised its economic growth forecast compared to the April macroeconomic forecast to 3% in 2019 (from 2.5%) and 3.2% in 2020 (from 2.9%) amid stronger domestic demand, more favorable terms of trade, and expectations of a larger harvest of grain crops. Domestic demand will remain the main driver of economic growth over the coming years. Private consumption growth will decelerate, albeit remaining high owing to an increase in real household income  wages, pensions, and remittances from abroad. Capital investment will continue to grow rapidly, which will also provide significant support to the economy. Economic growth will be dampened by a weak global economic activity and decrease in gas transit to European countries starting in 2020, due to the construction of bypassing gas pipelines. The 20192021 current account deficit will stay within the bounds of reason. In 2019, the current account deficit will narrow to 2.6% of GDP, thanks to the bumper grain harvest, a drop in energy prices, and a decline in dividend repatriation. In 2020-2021, the current account deficit will widen slightly, as a result of a decrease in natural gas transit, less favorable terms of trade, and stronger consumer and investment demand. Further cooperation with the International Monetary Fund remains the basic assumption of the macroeconomic forecast. This will allow Ukraine to attract other official financing, improve the conditions of access to the international capital markets, and support the interest of investors in Ukrainian assets. These borrowings will make it possible for the government to finance large payments on the external public debt. In addition, the private sector will get an opportunity to attract foreign investment. As a result, international reserves will reach USD 23 billion in 2021. The main internal risk to the above scenario is the further strengthening of threats to macrofinancial stability. A delay in implementing key reforms or steps offsetting previous achievements (in particular, court rulings or legislative decisions) might increase the vulnerability of Ukraine's economy and become an obstacle to further cooperation with the IMF. That could affect exchange rate and inflation expectations as well as the access to international capital markets as Ukraine will face a heavy debt load in the coming years. The following risks also remain important:. a suspension of Russian gas transit through Ukraine starting in 2020an escalation of trade wars and rising geopolitical tensionsan escalation of the military conflict, and the imposition of new trade restrictions by Russia.Considering the revised macroeconomic forecast and the balance of risks, the NBU Board has decided to lower its key policy rate to 17.0%. The NBU has also approved the decision to start publishing the interest rate forecast when making quarterly reviews of the macroeconomic forecast beginning today. Publishing the interest rate forecast marks an evolutionary improvement in transparency of monetary policy at central banks that apply inflation targeting. This makes the monetary policy more clear and predictable for market players, thus boosting its effectiveness. It should be noted that the forecast imposes no obligations on the NBU, and thus the actual key policy rate may differ from the forecast if macroeconomic conditions change. The NBU's baseline scenario envisages the key policy rate to decrease further, to 8% over the coming years, provided that inflation steadily declines to the 5% target. The largest decrease is expected over 2020, along with inflation returning to the target range and inflation expectations improving. If existing inflation risks, both internal and external, materialize, the key policy rate could decline to 8% more slowly. At the same time, higher demand for hryvnia domestic government bonds from nonresidents and the subsequent strengthening of the exchange rate will allow reducing the key policy rate at a faster pace than envisaged in the baseline scenario. The decision to cut the key policy rate to 17.0% has been approved by NBU Board Decision No.493-D On the Key Policy Rate dated 18 July 2019. A new detailed macroeconomic forecast will be published in the Inflation Report on 25 July 2019. A summary of the discussion by Monetary Policy Committee members that preceded this decision will be published on 29 July 2019. The next meeting of the NBU Board on monetary policy issues will be held on 5 September 2019 as scheduled. Q&amp;A: forecast of the NBU's key policy rate."
South Africa,2019-07-18,"South African Reserve Bank PRESS STATEMENT EMBARGO DELIVERY 18 July 2019 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the May meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), near-term indicators point to weaker-than-anticipated global economic activity. Global financial conditions have eased, as central banks in advanced economies signaled a move towards monetary accommodation. However, downside risks remain and are dominated by escalating trade and geo-political tensions. In the domestic economy. GDP contracted in the first quarter due to a combination of supply-side and demand-side factors. Monthly inflation outcomes have stayed around the mid-point of the inflation target range, as food and services price inflation remain subdued. The medium-term inflation outlook is unchanged. The year-on-year inflation rate, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas, was 4.5% in May (up from 4.4% in April). Goods price inflation was 4.2%, while services price inflation was 4.6%. The Bank's measure of core inflation, which MPC Statement July 18th, 2019 Page 1. The Bank's measure of core inflation, which MPC Statement July 18th, 2019 Page 1 excludes food, fuel and electricity, was 4.1%. Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods decreased to 6.4% (compared to 6.5% in April). The inflation forecast generated by the SARB's Quarterly Projection Model (QPM) is for headline inflation to average 4.4% in 2019 (down from 4.5%). The projections for 2020 and 2021 remain unchanged at 5.1% and 4.6%, respectively. Headline CPI inflation is expected to peak at 5.4% in the first quarter of 2020 and settle at 4.5% in the last two quarters of 2021. The forecast for core inflation is lower at 4.4% in 2019 (down from 4.5%), 4.7% in 2020 (down from 4.8%) and is unchanged at 4.5% in 2021. Electricity, food and fuel price inflation have shaped the trend in headline inflation. The assumptions for Brent crude oil in the QPM have been revised down from US$69.50 to US$67 for 2019. The assumptions for 2020 and 2021 are unchanged at US$68. Fuel price inflation is expected to average 3.2% in 2019 and to peak at 13.1% in the first quarter of 2020. Although food price inflation has continued to surprise on the downside, it is expected to start rising from the end of 2019 and to peak at 5.6% in the second and third quarters of 2020. Inflation expectations have continued to moderate. According to the Bureau for Economic Research (BER) second quarter survey, expectations are for headline inflation of 4.8% in 2019. Inflation expectations for 2020 and 2021 eased to 5.0% and 5.2%, respectively. Five-year-ahead inflation expectations remain unchanged at a historic low of 5.1%. The inflation expectations of market analysts in the July 2019 Reuters Econometer survey have been revised lower to 4.5% (from 4.7%) in 2019 and 5.0% (from 5.2%) in 2020 and remain unchanged at 5.0% in 2021. MPC Statement July 18th, 2019 Page 2. MPC Statement July 18th, 2019 Page 2 Market-based expectations implicit in the break-even inflation rates (i.e. the yield differential between conventional and inflation-linked government bonds) have declined significantly since our last meeting, reflecting a firmer exchange rate and subdued domestic and global inflation pressures. Five-year break-even rates decreased to 4.5% and ten-year break-even rates decreased to 5.3%, the lowest level since January 2015. Global GDP is expected to average 3.3% in 2019 and stabilise around 3.5% from 2020. While global growth remains relatively healthy overall, recent indicators on trade and manufacturing have deteriorated sharply and a range of downside risks to growth remain. Growth in world trade volumes contracted for the fifth consecutive month, declining by 2.1% in April 2019. Trade tensions remain heightened, weighing on market confidence and lowering investment. Other downside risks include geo-political developments and high levels of corporate and sovereign debt. Across most countries, there is limited policy space to respond to shocks. Inflation outcomes and inflation expectations in most advanced economies remain below targeted levels. Recent communication by the Federal Reserve Bank and the European Central Bank indicate that in the absence of significant shocks, monetary policy will remain accommodative over the medium term. However, market expectations of the extent of future central bank actions appear high, creating the risk of significant market volatility should these not materialise. Emerging market currencies are firmer, reflecting a combination of US dollar weakness and shifting market sentiment. However, country specific factors remain important, with currencies of countries with stronger macroeconomic fundamentals having fared better. MPC Statement July 18th, 2019 Page 3. MPC Statement July 18th, 2019 Page 3 Since the May MPC, the rand has appreciated by 3.3% against the US dollar, by 2.4% against the euro, and by 2.3% on a trade-weighted basis. The implied starting point for the rand is R14.30 against the US dollar, compared with R14.40 at the time of the previous meeting. At these levels, the QPM assesses the rand to remain slightly undervalued. While the rand has benefited from improved sentiment towards riskier assets, it underperformed its emerging market peers due to idiosyncratic factors. Domestic growth prospects and fiscal risks rate high among investor concerns. GDP contracted by 3.2% in the first quarter, reflecting weakness in most sectors of the economy. The sharp quarterly decline was primarily caused by electricity shortages and strikes that fed into broader weakness in investment, household consumption and employment growth. Based on recent short term indicators for the mining and manufacturing sectors, a rebound in GDP is expected in the second quarter of 2019. Continued low business confidence remains a concern for the MPC. The Absa Purchasing Managers' Index averaged 46.3 points in the second quarter, remaining below the neutral level. The RMB/BER Business Confidence Index remains unchanged at 28 points. The SARB's composite leading business cycle indicator continued to trend lower. The SARB now expects GDP growth for 2019 to average 0.6% (down from 1.0% in May). The forecast for 2020 and 2021 is unchanged at 1.8% and 2.0% respectively. The MPC assesses the risks to the growth forecast to be balanced in the near term but remains concerned about longer term risks. Investment prospects will continue to be limited in the absence of structural reforms. The escalation of trade tensions could have further negative impacts. MPC Statement July 18th, 2019 Page 4. MPC Statement July 18th, 2019 Page 4 While some cyclical factors constrained recent GDP growth outcomes, the Committee remains of the view that current challenges facing the economy are primarily structural in nature and cannot be resolved by monetary policy alone. Implementation of prudent macroeconomic policies together with structural reforms that raise potential growth and lower the cost structure of the economy remains urgent. The MPC welcomes the continued downward trend in recent inflation outcomes and the moderation in inflation expectations of about one percentage point since 2016. The Committee would like to see inflation remain close to the mid-point of the inflation target range on a more sustained basis, with inflation expectations also anchored around these levels. The overall risks to the inflation outlook are assessed to be largely balanced. Demand side pressures are subdued, wages and rental prices are expected to increase at moderate rates and global inflation should remain low. In the absence of shocks, relative exchange rate stability is expected to continue. However, the impact of upside risks to the inflation outlook could be significant. Global financial conditions can abruptly tighten due to small shifts in inflation outlooks in advanced economies and changing market sentiment. Domestically, the financing needs of State-Owned Enterprises (SOE) could place further upward pressure on the currency and long-term market interest rates for all borrowers. Food, electricity and water prices also remain important risks to the inflation outlook. Against this backdrop, the MPC unanimously decided to reduce the repurchase rate by 25 basis points to 6.5% per annum with effect from 19 July 2019. MPC Statement July 18th, 2019 Page 5. MPC Statement July 18th, 2019 Page 5 Monetary policy actions will continue to focus on anchoring inflation expectations near the mid-point of the inflation target range in the interest of balanced and sustainable growth. In this persistently uncertain environment, future policy decisions will continue to be highly data dependent, sensitive to the assessment of the balance of risks to the outlook, and will seek to look-through temporary price shocks. The implied path of policy rates generated by the Quarterly Projection Model was for one cut of 25 basis points to the repo rate by the end of fourth quarter of 2019. The endogenous interest rate path is built into the growth and inflation forecast. The implied path remains a broad policy guide which could change in either direction from meeting to meeting in response to new developments and changing risks.

Hungary,2019-07-23,"At its meeting on 23 July 2019, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 24 July 2019:. The Magyar Nemzeti Bank's (MNB) single anchor is inflation, its primary objective is to achieve and maintain price stability. The factors determining inflation continue to show volatility. Therefore, in assessing the outlook, the Monetary Council pays more attention to the measures of underlying inflation capturing persistent trends. Consistent with the MNB's expectations, the pace of increase in domestic consumer prices started to slow down in the summer months. In June 2019, inflation, core inflation and core inflation excluding indirect tax effects fell to 3.4 percent, 3.8 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively. Incoming data confirm the baseline projection in the June Inflation Report. A dichotomy remains between the factors determining likely developments in inflation. Buoyant domestic demand is boosting, and, from the second half of the year, weakening external activity is likely to restrain the pace of price increase. Due to a strengthening of external disinflationary effects, core inflation excluding indirect tax effects is likely to decline gradually to 3 percent from the end of 2019. The increase of excise duty on tobacco products on a six-monthly basis, which is outside the scope of monetary policy, is likely to raise the consumer price index over the entire forecast horizon. This measure does not cause any second-round effects, consequently, does not influence changes in core inflation excluding indirect tax effects. The Hungarian economy grew by 5.3 percent in the first quarter of 2019, mainly driven by market services, industry and construction. Based on monthly indicators, growth rate in retail sales and construction slowed in the second quarter. In line with our expectations, incoming data suggest that the dynamics of GDP growth is likely to slow down gradually from the second quarter. Compared to the previous high levels, wage growth continued at a slightly weaker rate in April. Labour demand remained strong, and the unemployment rate was close to its historically low level. The current account remained in surplus in the first quarter of 2019. Due mainly to dynamic growth in imports, the trade surplus declined in recent quarters, primarily reflecting strong investment activity in the corporate sector. Economic growth is expected to slow gradually from the middle of the year, but to remain strong. Subdued economic activity in Europe from the second half of the year is also reflected in the slowdown of growth in Hungary. The Hungarian economy is expected to grow by 4.3 percent in 2019 and by 3.3 percent in 2020. As a result of further dynamic growth in credit markets, the investment rate is likely to continue to rise and stabilise at high levels in the coming years. Regarding long-term, sustainable economic growth, the improvement in competitiveness by structural measures will be given increasing emphasis. In addition to monetary policy, the new retail government security strategy, the 2020 Budget Act and the provisions of the Economy Protection Action Plan to improve competitiveness, are aimed at further strengthening macroeconomic stability and sustainable convergence. The Hungarian Government Security Plus, introduced in June, is expected to raise households' savings rate, in addition to the structural change of their financial assets. Consequently, an increasing share of rapid wage growth is converted into savings instead of consumption, while the promotion of self-financing also helps to reduce Hungary's external vulnerability. Following its launch on 1 June, the outstanding amount of Hungarian Government Security Plus rose by over HUF 1,200 billion. More than half of this amount was registered as a new source of finance for the government sector. Based on the 2020 Budget Act, the budget deficit-to-GDP ratio is likely to decline to 1 percent, with the maintenance of a significant amount of reserves. After 2019, fiscal policy will remain counter-cyclical in 2020 as well. The announced Economy Protection Action Plan is expected to gradually improve the competitiveness of the domestic economy. The above measures jointly strengthen macroeconomic stability, reduce external vulnerability, and contribute to maintain a sustainable convergence path. Due to uncertainties related to the outlook for global economic activity, monetary policies across the world's leading central banks continue to be increasingly cautious. Consistent with the downside risks related to economic activity in Europe and the euro area and communications from the European Central Bank (ECB), market participants are pricing in the loosening of monetary conditions over the short term. According to market expectations, the Federal Reserve may reduce the policy rate in more than one step in 2019, while the Bank of Japan is likely to maintain its loose monetary policy for a longer period of time than earlier expected. Sentiment in international financial markets has slightly improved since the Council's previous interest rate decision. Risk appetite was influenced by developments in international trade policies, incoming macroeconomic data and measures taken by the world's leading central banks. Oil prices have decreased in the last month. To improve the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission, the Monetary Council launched its corporate bond purchasing programme with a total amount of HUF 300 billion on 1 July 2019. By introducing the Bond Funding for Growth Scheme (BGS), the Council's specific objective is to promote the diversification of funding to the domestic corporate sector. Corporate bond issuances are expected to take place in the fourth quarter. The MNB will neutralise excess liquidity arising from bond purchases by using the preferential deposit facility bearing interest at the central bank base rate. The programme complements the Funding for Growth Scheme Fix launched at the beginning of 2019 to build a healthier lending structure. Under the scheme, participating credit institutions concluded loan contracts with domestic SMEs totalling nearly HUF 175 billion in the first half of 2019. The Monetary Council left the base rate, the overnight collateralised lending rate and the one-week collateralised lending rate at 0.9 percent and the overnight deposit rate at -0.05 percent unchanged. In addition, in June, the Council set the average amount of liquidity, to be crowded out for the third quarter, at least at HUF 200-400 billion and will take this into account in setting the stock of central bank swap instruments. The MNB is ready to change the stock of the FX swap instrument in a flexible manner to ensure that the interest rate transmission changes in line with the decisions by the Monetary Council, and the volatility of interbank rates remains at low levels. In its decisions, the Monetary Council focuses on the maintenance of price stability. The monetary policy stance will continue to be accommodative, economic agents' financing costs will remain favourable. A dichotomy remains between the factors determining likely developments in inflation. Buoyant domestic demand is boosting, and, from the second half of the year, weakening external activity is likely to restrain the pace of price increase. Regarding the outlook for inflation, data to be received in the second half of the year will be decisive. Of these, the following are of key importance: the spillover of disinflationary effects of slowing European economic activity, changes in monetary policies of the world's leading central banks, the effect of the new retail government security on savings, and the economic consequences of counter-cyclical fiscal policy. The Monetary Council will assess their effects on the maintenance of price stability over the 5-8 quarter horizon of monetary policy. In its monetary policy decisions, the Council applies a cautious approach, relying mainly on the comprehensive projections for the macroeconomy and inflation of the quarterly published Inflation Report. The future developments in the outlook for inflation will be a decisive factor in the necessity of further measures."
Nigeria,2019-07-23,"CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO. 125 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING OF MONDAY 22nd AND TUESDAY 23rd July, 2019 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on the 22nd and 23rd of July, 2019, in an environment of subdued global growth and fragile domestic economic recovery. The Committee reviewed developments in the global and domestic macro-economy. It noted that the global environment is overwhelmed with vulnerabilities and financial fragilities. Inflation in the advanced economies is trending downwards and significantly below the long-run objective, necessitating the adoption of accommodative monetary policy, the global economy is poised to see another round of loose monetary policy. All Eleven (11) members of the Committee were at the meeting. Global Economic Developments Global output growth remained weak with persistent headwinds expected to continue for the rest of the year. Key amongst these headwinds is the rising trade tensions, particularly between the US and its key trading partners in Europe. Canada. China and India, rising debt levels in some Advanced Economies and Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs) as well as growing 1 political uncertainties across several regions. Consequently the International Monetary Fund (IMF) downgraded its 2019 global growth forecast from 36 per cent to 33 per cent. Price developments across the major advanced economies remained muted alongside softening output growth. In the Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs), however, inflationary developments were mixed in response to challenging macroeconomic conditions. The Committee noted, that the return to monetary accommodation by the advanced economies could see a new wave of capital flows to the EMDEs as investors continue to search for higher yields. Domestic Economic Developments Available data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 201 per cent in the first quarter of 2019, driven by the non-oil sector, compared with 238 and 189 per cent in the preceding and corresponding quarters of 2018, respectively. The Committee noted the continued but moderate expansion in the economy as indicated by the Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Indices (PMI), which grew for the 27th and 26th consecutive months in June 2019. The indices stood at 574 and 586 index points, respectively, in June 2019. Staff forecast indicate a 211, 239 and 256 per cent growth in GDP in Q2. Q3 and Q4 2019, respectively, expected to be driven largely by the non-oil sector. The Committee, however, noted that the downside risks to 2 the growth projections to include low credit to the private sector; high unemployment; delayed intervention of fiscal policy as well as low revenue and fiscal buffers, amongst others. The continued intervention by the Bank in the real sector is, however, expected to partly ameliorate the downside risks only in the short-run, while sound fiscal policy is expected to drive growth in the medium to the long-run. The Committee observed that broad money supply (M3) grew by 497 per cent in June 2019 from the level at end-December 2018, at an annualized rate of 995 per cent. It was also below the indicative benchmark of 1608 per cent for 2019. The growth in M3 was largely driven by the increase in Net Domestic Credit (NDC), which grew by 1726 per cent in June 2019 from the level at end- December 2018. The growth in Net Domestic Credit (NDC) was accounted for by the significant increase in credit to Government, which grew by 5580 per cent, while credit to the private sector grew by 90 per cent in June 2019. The Committee, however, noted that the constrained growth in the monetary aggregates as an indication of weak financial intermediation in the banking system and called on the Management of the CBN, to sustain the various initiatives of the Bank to improve lending to the private sector in Nigeria. The Committee welcomed the moderation in headline inflation (year-on-year) to 1122 per cent in June 2019 from 1140 per cent in May 2019. This was attributed to the decline in the Food and Core components to 1356 and 880 per cent in June 2019 from 3 1370 and 903 per cent in May 2019, respectively. It noted the development as being partly due to the CBN's support to the agricultural sector and the prevailing stability in the Nigerian foreign exchange market. The MPC further noted that although inflation moderated in June 2019, the continued pressure on prices continues to be associated with structural factors such as the high cost of electricity, transport and production inputs. The MPC, however, expects that with the commencement of the harvest season, food prices will taper further downwards. It thus, however, advised that the security challenges in some parts of the country should be addressed urgently to increase agricultural produce in order to sustain the downward trend in inflation. The MPC reiterated its commitment to ensure the maintenance of price stability. The net liquidity position and interest rates in the economy reflected the impact of liquidity injections and the Bank's liquidity management operations associated with fiscal federalism, transformation of maturing CBN Bills. Open Market Operations (OMO) auctions and foreign exchange interventions. Accordingly the monthly weighted average Inter-bank call and Open Buyback (OBB) rates, oscillated within the MPR corridor, increasing to 838 and 871per cent in June 2019 from 514 and 834 per cent in May 2019, respectively. The Committee noted with concern the continued bearish trend in the equities segment of the capital market in spite of the sustained capital inflow to the economy, reflecting continued 4 portfolio reallocation from equities to fixed income securities. Consequently the All-Share Index (ASI) declined by 911 per cent to 28,,56679 index points on July 12, 2019, from 31,,43050 index points at end-December 2018. Market Capitalization, however, grew by 1877 per cent to N1392 trillion on July 12, 2019, from N1172 trillion at end-December 2018. This was due largely to the additional listing of new firms during the review period. The Committee welcomed the continued stability in the foreign exchange market and the steady accretion to external reserves, which stood at US$4488 billion as at July 19, 2019, representing a 038 per cent increase from US$4471 billion at the end-June 2019. The MPC also noted the steady moderation in the Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) ratio of the banking industry to 936 per cent in June from 1095 per cent in May 2019. While this remained above the prudential benchmark of 50 per cent, its continued moderation indicates the improved resilience of the banking system. The Committee thus emphasised its resolve to further drive down the Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) in the industry so as to strengthen the strategic health of banks in the Country. Outlook The overall medium-term outlook for the global economy remains mixed with indications of continued softening of global output due to persisting policy uncertainties and sustained macroeconomic vulnerabilities. These are likely to be accentuated by the increasing trade tensions between the US 5 and its major trading partners, rising debt levels and geo-political tensions. On the domestic economy, output growth in 2019 is expected to remain weak, peaking at 227 per cent, while inflation is projected at 1137 per cent by the CBN staff projections by end-2019. The underlying arguments in favour of this forecast include: favourable oil prices; stable exchange rate; moderate inflationary pressures; enhanced flow of credit to the private sector; sustained CBN interventions in the real sector; effective implementation of the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP); building fiscal buffers; and improved security in the food producing areas of the country. Committee's Consideration In its considerations, the Committee noted the need to boost output growth through sustained increase in consumer credit and mortgage loans and granting loans to our Small and Medium Enterprises companies. It also observed that the Management of the Bank had started the prescription of using benchmark loan-to- deposit ratios to redirect the banks focus to lending. To mitigate credit risk, the Committee enjoined the Management of the Bank to de-risk the financial markets, via the development of a reliable credit scoring system, similar to what applies in the advanced countries as this will encourage Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) to safely grow their credit portfolios. The MPC called on the fiscal authorities to expedite action on expanding the tax base of the economy to improve government revenue and stem the growth in public borrowing. It further urged the fiscal authorities to build fiscal buffers to avert macroeconomic downturn in the event of a decline in oil prices. The Committee also called on the Bank to intensify efforts to encourage Nigerians in the diaspora to use official sources for home remittances, noting that the effort will complement other measures geared towards improving Nigeria's current account balance. It enjoined the Bank to consider introducing incentives such as the reduction of charges on diaspora home remittances into Nigeria. On the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA), the Committee urged the Federal Government to put in place measures to aid the economy in realising the benefits and full potentials of that Agreement. In particular, it noted the need to resuscitate moribund industries in Nigeria and improve key infrastructure in order to strengthen the productive base of the economy, create job opportunities as well as boost exports. The Committee noted the positive developments towards the creation of a common currency in the West African Zone by January 2020 and commended Government and the Central Bank for pushing forward the initiative. The Committee, however, enjoined the Bank to ensure that Nigeria is properly positioned to maximise the benefits of monetary integration. In consideration of the specific policy options to adopt; to hold, loosen or tighten, the MPC made the following observations: Whilst the focus on growth was imperative, the mandate of price stability remains sacrosanct; Given the happenings in the external sector and the fact that inflation is moderating, tightening of monetary policy should not be an option at this time, as restriction of the capacity of the DMBs to create money could curtail their credit creation capabilities. On the contrary, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) was of the view that, whilst loosening could increase money supply, stimulate aggregate demand and strengthen domestic production, the economy could be awash with liquidity especially if loosening drives growth in consumer credit without commensurate adjustment in aggregate output. On holding the current monetary policy position, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) observed that given the recent actions of the Bank's management involving the prescription of minimum lending thresholds by the deposit money banks to our Deposit Money Banks (DMBs), it is safe to assume that this action, targeted at stimulating credit growth to the real sector would increase credit delivery to the real sector and accelerate investment and economic growth. It also observed that since interest rates were currently trending downwards, it is safer to await the full impact of 8 these policy actions on the economy before a review of the position of monetary policy. The Committee's Decision In consideration of the foregoing, the Committee decided unanimously by a vote of all members present to retain the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) at 135 per cent and to hold all other policy parameters constant. The decision was informed by the conviction of members that key macroeconomic indicators are trending in the right direction. Consequently the MPC unanimously voted to: I Retain the MPR at 135 per cent; II. Retain the asymmetric corridor at +200/-500 basis points around the MPR; III. Retain the CRR at 225 per cent; and IV. Retain the Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent. Thank you. Godwin I Emefiele Governor. Central Bank of Nigeria 23rd July, 2019 9."
Georgia,2019-07-24,"24.07.2019 The National Bank of Georgia keeps its policy rate unchanged at 6.50 percent The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on July 24, 2019 and decided to keep the refinancing rate unchanged at 6.50 percent. In June, with a significant contribution from one-off factors, annual inflation rate equalled 4.3 percent. The contribution of the increased excise tax on tobacco on the annual inflation was 1.3 percentage points and has only temporary impact on inflation. It should be noted that the core inflation, which excludes food, energy and tobacco prices, stands at 1.4 percent, also indicating that the increase in inflation is only temporary. According to the current forecast, other things equal, the inflation will remain above the target during this year, will start to decline from March, 2020 and stay close to target in the medium term. Although the inflationary pressure stemming from the exchange rate depreciation increased against the background of the external shock, in the medium-term, this pressure is balanced by the weakened demand, which is still lagging the potential level of GDP. Moreover, current nominal effective exchange rate seems to be undervalued more than the size of the current shock would suggest. Hence, the possible appreciation of the nominal effective exchange rate is expected to exert a downward pressure on inflation. Therefore, at a current stage, the Monetary Policy Committee deemed appropriate to keep monetary policy unchanged. However, if the upward pressure on inflation stemming from the exchange rate will persist, then the Committee will consider the possibility of the monetary policy tightening. In the first half of 2019, external sector performance continued to improve. However, at the end of the second quarter additional risks from external sector appeared. In particular, the expected revenues from tourism declined. According to current estimates, despite the external shock, the current account deficit is still expected to improve in 2019. Considering the reduced external demand (export of tourism services), the revised GDP growth forecast for 2019 equals 4.5%. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all means and instruments at its disposal in order to ensure the price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on September 4, 2019."
Euroarea,2019-07-25,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Vice-President. Mr Dombrovskis. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We expect them to remain at their present or lower levels at least through the first half of 2020, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to our aim over the medium term. We intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. The Governing Council also underlined the need for a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy for a prolonged period of time, as inflation rates, both realised and projected, have been persistently below levels that are in line with its aim. Accordingly, if the medium-term inflation outlook continues to fall short of our aim, the Governing Council is determined to act, in line with its commitment to symmetry in the inflation aim. It therefore stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner. In this context, we have tasked the relevant Eurosystem Committees with examining options, including ways to reinforce our forward guidance on policy rates, mitigating measures, such as the design of a tiered system for reserve remuneration, and options for the size and composition of potential new net asset purchases. Incoming information since the last Governing Council meeting in early June indicates that, while further employment gains and increasing wages continue to underpin the resilience of the economy, softening global growth dynamics and weak international trade are still weighing on the euro area outlook. Moreover, the prolonged presence of uncertainties, related to geopolitical factors, the rising threat of protectionism, and vulnerabilities in emerging markets, is dampening economic sentiment, notably in the manufacturing sector. In this environment, inflationary pressures remain muted and indicators of inflation expectations have declined. Therefore, a significant degree of monetary stimulus continues to be necessary to ensure that financial conditions remain very favourable and support the euro area expansion, the ongoing build-up of domestic price pressures and, thus, headline inflation developments over the medium term. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Following a rise of 0.2% in the fourth quarter of 2018, euro area real GDP increased by 0.4%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter of 2019. Incoming economic data and survey information continue to point to somewhat slower growth in the second and third quarters of this year. This mainly reflects the ongoing weakness in international trade in an environment of prolonged global uncertainties, which are particularly affecting the euro area manufacturing sector. At the same time, activity levels in the services and construction sectors are resilient and the labour market is still improving. Looking ahead, the euro area expansion will continue to be supported by favourable financing conditions, further employment gains and rising wages, the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance and the ongoing  albeit somewhat slower  growth in global activity. The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the downside, reflecting the prolonged presence of uncertainties, related to geopolitical factors, the rising threat of protectionism, and vulnerabilities in emerging markets. Euro area annual HICP inflation increased to 1.3% in June 2019, from 1.2 % in May, as higher HICP inflation excluding food and energy more than offset lower energy price inflation. On the basis of current futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to decline over the coming months, before rising again towards the end of the year. Looking through the recent volatility due to temporary factors, measures of underlying inflation remain generally muted. While labour cost pressures have strengthened and broadened amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets, the pass-through of cost pressures to inflation is taking longer than previously anticipated. Over the medium term underlying inflation is expected to increase, supported by our monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion and stronger wage growth. Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth stood at 4.5% in June 2019, after 4.8% in May. Sustained rates of broad money growth reflect ongoing bank credit creation for the private sector and low opportunity costs of holding M3. The narrow monetary aggregate M1 continues to be the main contributor to broad money growth on the components side. The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations remained unchanged at 3.8% in June 2019. Notwithstanding some moderation from the peak recorded in September 2018, the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations continues to be robust. The annual growth rate of loans to households also remained unchanged at 3.3% in June, continuing its gradual improvement. Overall, loan growth is still benefiting from historically low bank lending rates. The euro area bank lending survey for the second quarter of 2019 indicates that loan growth continued to be supported by increasing demand across all loan categories. At the same time, credit standards for loans to enterprises tightened in the second quarter amid concerns about the economic outlook, while they remained broadly unchanged for loans for house purchase. Our monetary policy measures, including the forthcoming new series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO , will help to safeguard favourable bank lending conditions and will continue to support access to financing, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is still necessary for the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute more decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential and reducing vulnerabilities. The implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up to boost euro area productivity and growth potential, reduce structural unemployment and increase resilience. The 2019 country-specific recommendations should serve as the relevant signpost. Regarding fiscal policies, the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance is providing support to economic activity. At the same time, countries where government debt is high need to continue rebuilding fiscal buffers. All countries should reinforce their efforts to achieve a more growth-friendly composition of public finances. Likewise, the transparent and consistent implementation of the European Union's fiscal and economic governance framework over time and across countries remains essential to bolster the resilience of the euro area economy. Improving the functioning of Economic and Monetary Union remains a priority. The Governing Council welcomes the ongoing work and urges further specific and decisive steps to complete the banking union and the capital markets union."
Turkiye,2019-07-25,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to reduce the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) from 24 percent to 19.75 percent. Recently released data indicate a moderate recovery in the economic activity. Goods and services exports continue to display an upward trend despite the weakening in the global economic outlook, indicating improved competitiveness. In particular, strong tourism revenues support the economic activity through direct and indirect channels. Looking forward, net exports are expected to contribute to the economic growth and the gradual recovery is likely to continue with the help of the disinflation trend and the partial improvement in financial conditions. The composition of growth is having a positive impact on the external balance. Current account balance is expected to maintain its improving trend. Recently, weaker global economic activity and heightened downside risks to inflation have strengthened the possibility that advanced economy central banks will take expansionary monetary policy steps. While these developments support the demand for emerging market assets and the risk appetite, rising protectionism and uncertainty regarding global economic policies are closely monitored in terms of their impact on both capital flows and international trade. Inflation outlook continued to improve. In the second quarter, inflation displayed a significant fall with the contribution from a deceleration in unprocessed food and energy prices. Domestic demand conditions and the tight monetary policy continue to support disinflation. Underlying trend indicators, supply side factors, and import prices lead to an improvement in the inflation outlook. In light of these developments, recent forecast revisions suggest that inflation is likely to materialize slightly below the projections of the April Inflation Report by the end of the year. Accordingly, considering all the factors affecting inflation outlook, the Committee decided to reduce the policy rate by 425 basis points. The Committee assesses that maintaining a sustained disinflation process is the key for achieving lower sovereign risk, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery. Keeping the disinflation process in track with the targeted path requires the continuation of a cautious monetary stance. In this respect, the extent of the monetary tightness will be determined by considering the indicators of the underlying inflation trend to ensure the continuation of the disinflation process. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability and financial stability objectives. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Colombia,2019-07-26,"For the 15th consecutive month. For this decision, the Board mainly took into account the following information. In June, the average of core inflation indicators (2.96%) remained below the 3.0% target. Inflation increased to 3.43%, mainly due to the performance of food prices. This and other supply shocks could cause inflation to increase in the coming months, but it is expected to resume its convergence to the target later. The new figures of economic activity suggest that output growth in the second quarter will be higher than in the first, supported by the dynamism of consumption and investment in machinery and equipment, and by some recovery of growth in public consumption. However, it is estimated that the economy will maintain spare capacity. The prospects for global growth continue to moderate, and in the United States the likelihood that the Fed may reduce its policy interest rate increased, which has diminished upward pressures on the exchange rate. The projection of the current account deficit for 2019 continues to stand above 4.0% of GDP, but it will continue to be financed largely by foreign direct investment. Alberto Carrasquilla (. Minister of Finance) and Juan Jos Echavarra (Governor). Based on this information, the Board considered the following factors for its decision. The temporary deviations of inflation from the target and their persistence. Uncertainty regarding the size of the spare capacity of the economy and the speed at which it may reduce. The effects of changing external conditions on the Colombian economy. In this environment, upon assessing the situation of the economy and the risk balance, the Board unanimously decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate unaltered at 4.25%. The Board will continue to carefully monitor the behavior of inflation and the forecasts for economic activity, as well as the behavior of the balance of payments and the international context. Finally, the Board reiterates that the monetary policy will depend on the availability of new information. Press Conference. You can watch the press conference of the BDBR on Friday 26 July 2019 on video, following the Board's decision to maintain the benchmark interest rate unaltered at 4.25%. (Available in Spanish only).

Russia,2019-07-26,"On 26 July 2019, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to cut the key rate by 25 bp to 7.25% per annum. Inflation slowdown is continuing. At the same time, inflation expectations remain elevated. Russian economy's growth rate is coming in lower than the Bank of Russia's expectations. Weak economic activity, along with temporary factors, limits inflation risks over the short-term horizon. According to the Bank of Russia's forecast, taking into account the pursued monetary policy, annual inflation will return to 4% in early 2020. If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia admits the possibility of further key rate reduction at one of the upcoming Board of Directors' meetings and a transition to neutral monetary policy in the first half of 2020. In its key rate decision-making, the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic developments over the forecast horizon, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. Inflation dynamics. Inflation slowdown is continuing. Annual consumer price growth rate declined to 4.7% in June (from 5.1% in May 2019) and was close to 4.6% according to the estimates as of 22 July. June results show that annual core inflation declined for the first time since March 2018 and reached 4.6%. Seasonally adjusted monthly consumer price growth rate slowed down to 0.1% in June vs 0.3-0.4% in February-May. According to Bank of Russia estimates, most monthly inflation indicators reflecting the most sustainable price movements are close to 4% (annualised). Consumer demand trends constrain inflation. Temporary disinflationary factors also contributed to slowing consumer price growth, including ruble appreciation since the beginning of the year and the decline in fruit and vegetable prices on the back of early new harvest arrival. Annual inflation dynamics were also influenced by base effects. In June and July, business price expectations continued to decline. Households' inflation expectations have not materially changed since April and remain elevated. Inflation slowdown paves the way for a future decline in inflation expectations. According to the Bank of Russia's forecast, taking into account the pursued monetary policy, annual inflation will return to 4% in early 2020. Monetary conditions. Monetary conditions continued to ease since the last Board meeting. Among other things, this was driven by the change in expectations of financial market participants with regard to the Bank of Russia's key rate path and the downward revision of expected interest rate paths in the US and the euro area. OFZ yields and deposit interest rates continued to decline. The Bank of Russia's decisions to cut the key rate and the decline in OFZ yields observed since the beginning of this year create conditions for the decrease in deposit and lending rates in the future. In June, real sector lending continued to grow on the back of eased monetary conditions. Annual growth rate of loans to non-financial organisations reached the maximum level since 2015 while the growth rate of household loans stabilised after a tangible increase in the previous months. Economic activity. Russian economy's growth rate since the beginning of the year has been lower than the Bank of Russia's expectations. This was caused by weak investment activity dynamics and a significant drop in annual export growth rates, including on the back of weaker external demand. The second quarter saw an increase in annual industrial production growth, which may not be steady. Retail trade turnover growth continued to decline YoY amid falling real disposable household incomes. Unemployment remains at the historic lows. However, given the contracting number of employees and the labour force, it does not create any additional inflationary pressure. In the first half of the year, fiscal policy had additional constraining effect on the economic activity, which is in part related to the shift of implementation schedule of a number of national projects planned by the Government. Since the second half of 2019, government spending, including investment expenditures, is expected to rise. Inflation risks. Disinflationary risks exceed pro-inflationary risks over the short-term horizon. This is primarily related to the weak dynamics of domestic and external demand. That said, significant risks are posed by elevated and unanchored inflation expectations. The risk of a slowdown in global economic growth still looms caused, among other things, by the further tightening of international trade restrictions. Geopolitical factors might lead to strengthened volatility in global commodity and financial markets, affecting exchange rate and inflation expectations. Supply-side factors in the oil market may amplify volatility of global oil prices. However, the revision of interest rate paths in the US and the euro area in June and July reduces the risks of considerable capital outflows from emerging markets. Fiscal policy may cause a meaningful impact on inflation dynamics over both the short- and medium-term horizons. The catch-up growth of budget spending in the second half of the current year may have a pro-inflationary effect in late 2019 â€” early 2020. Moving on, potential decisions on the use of the liquid part of the National Wealth Fund in excess of the threshold level set at 7% of GDP may exert upward pressure on inflation. The Bank of Russia leaves mostly unchanged its estimates of risks associated with wage movements, prices of individual food products, and possible changes in consumer behaviour. These risks remain moderate. If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia admits the possibility of further key rate reduction at one of the upcoming Board of Directors' meetings and a transition to neutral monetary policy in the first half of 2020. In its key rate decision-making, the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic developments over the forecast horizon, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next rate review meeting on 6 September 2019. The press release on the Bank of Russia Board decision and the medium-term forecast is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time.

Armenia,2019-07-30,"PRESS RELEASE 30.07.2019 In the July 30, 2019 meeting the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia decided to leave the refinancing rate unchanged, at a 5.75% level. There was 1.9% deflation in June of 2019 compared with that of 1.6% registered in the same period of the previous year, in which case the 12-month inflation has reduced to 2.5%, determined by a much deeper seasonal fall in prices of agricultural products. In the meantime however, core inflation has increased to some extent over the month. In the external sector, global economic growth keeps slowing and demand slackening, and the central banks of the main partner countries to the Republic of Armenia will pursue a policy of easing monetary conditions in the near future. In this situation, the inflation environment in international markets for basic commodities and food products remains weak, and the Board of the Central Bank estimates that inflationary pressures from the external sector generally are not likely. The Board states that growth rates of economic activity remained strong during the second quarter, as was expected, which is driven by private consumption growth. The impact of the second quarter's fiscal policy on the domestic demand is estimated notably contractionary, too. There is anticipation that in the second half of the year it will be expansionary and, consequently, the fiscal policy's contractionary impact on aggregate demand will reduce markedly, according to the year's results. In this circumstance, the Board prefers to letting the inflation recover gradually and finds it appropriate to sustain current monetary conditions by leaving the refinancing rate unchanged. At the same time, in view of the anticipated macroeconomic developments, to keep the policy expansionary for a long while will be needed in fulfillment of the mid-term inflation target. As a result, the expectation is that the inflation will run below the target in the coming months but will stabilize around the target in the medium run. It should be noted that risks to inflation deviating from the projection path are mostly downside, and these depend on the global economic developments and how the state budget will perform further. The Central Bank will respond to the emergence of any of such risks and developments adequately while maintaining price stability in the medium run. Detailed information that underlies the decision on setting the interest rate will be available in Press Release (Minutes on Interest Rate) to be published by August 13, 2019. â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦.â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦ Press Service of the Central Bank of Armenia."
Brazil,2019-07-31,"In its 224th meeting, the Copom unanimously decided to lower the Selic rate to 6.00% p.a. The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario:. Recent data on economic activity suggest a possible resumption of the process of economic recovery. Copom's baseline scenario assumes that this recovery will occur at a gradual pace. The global outlook has become benign, owing to changes in monetary policy in major economies. Nevertheless, the risks associated with a slowdown in global growth remain. The Committee judges that various measures of underlying inflation are running at comfortable levels. This includes the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy. Inflation expectations for 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 collected by the Focus survey are around 3.8%, 3.9%, 3.75%, and 3.50%, respectively; and. The Copom's inflation projections in the scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the Focus survey stand around 3.6% for 2019 and 3.9% for 2020. This scenario assumes a path for the Selic rate that ends 2019 at 5.50% p.a. and remains at that level until the end of 2020. It also assumes a path for the exchange rate that ends 2019 at R$/US$ 3.75 and 2020 at R$/US$ 3.80. In the scenario with a constant interest rate, at 6.50% p.a., and a constant exchange rate, at R$/US$ 3.75*, the projections for both 2019 and 2020 stand around 3.6%. The Committee emphasizes that risks around its baseline scenario remain in both directions. On the one hand, the high level of economic slack may continue to produce lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory. On the other hand, a possible frustration of expectations regarding the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy may affect risk premia and increase the path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy. Risk intensifies in case of reversal of the benign outlook for emerging economies. The Committee acknowledges that the balance of risks has evolved favorably, but risk still prevails. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the wide array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to lower the Selic rate to 6.00% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation and the associated balance of risks, and is consistent with convergence of inflation to target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, which includes 2020. The Copom reiterates that economic conditions prescribe stimulative monetary policy, i.e., interest rates below the structural level. The Copom recognizes progress in the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy, but emphasizes that the continuation of this process is essential for the reduction of its structural interest rate and for sustainable economic recovery. The Committee stresses that the perception of continuation of the reform agenda affects current expectations and macroeconomic projections. In particular, the Committee judges that concrete progress in this agenda is fundamental for the consolidation of the benign scenario for prospective inflation. In the Copom's assessment, the evolution of the baseline scenario and, especially, of the balance of risks prescribes adjusting the degree of monetary stimulus, lowering the Selic rate by 0.50 percentage point. The Committee deems that the consolidation of the benign scenario for prospective inflation should permit additional adjustment of the degree of stimulus. The Copom emphasizes that communicating this assessment does not restrict its next decision and reiterates that the next steps in the conduct of monetary policy will continue to depend on the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, and on inflation projections and expectations. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Roberto Oliveira Campos Neto (Governor). Bruno Serra Fernandes. Carlos Viana de Carvalho. Carolina de Assis Barros. Fernanda Feitosa Nechio. Joao Manoel Pinho de Mello. Mauricio Costa de Moura. Otavio Ribeiro Damaso, and Paulo Srgio Neves de Souza. *Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average R$/US$ exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the Friday prior to the Copom meeting."
United States,2019-07-31,"EDT July 31, 2019 Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate. Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Although growth of household spending has picked up from earlier in the year, growth of business fixed investment has been soft. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. In light of the implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflation pressures, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 2 to 2-1/4 percent. This action supports the Committee's view that sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective are the most likely outcomes, but uncertainties about this outlook remain. As the Committee contemplates the future path of the target range for the federal funds rate, it will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. EDT July 31, 2019 - 2 - The Committee will conclude the reduction of its aggregate securities holdings in the System Open Market Account in August, two months earlier than previously indicated. Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H Powell. Chair; John C Williams. Vice Chair; Michelle W Bowman; Lael Brainard; James Bullard; Richard H Clarida; Charles L. Voting against the action were Esther L George and Eric S. Rosengren, who preferred at this meeting to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent."
Czech Republic,2019-08-01,"At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank decided unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged. The two-week repo rate thus remains at 2%, the discount rate at 1% and the Lombard rate at 3%.. The decision adopted by the Bank Board is underpinned by a new macroeconomic forecast. Consistent with the forecast is a modest rise in domestic market interest rates initially, followed by a decline next year. According to the external assumptions of the new forecast, economic growth in the euro area will accelerate slightly next year following a slowdown this year. Foreign producer price inflation is expected to slow further over the rest of this year and then rise towards 2%. By contrast, consumer price inflation in the euro area will not reach 2% over the next two years. Partly for this reason, the European Central Bank has declared its readiness to ease monetary policy even further. The market therefore expects significantly negative 3M EURIBOR rates over the entire forecast horizon. With regard to oil prices, the market expects a slight decrease over the next two years. The interest rate reduction in the USA will foster a narrowing of the spread between dollar and euro interest rates. According to the assumptions of the forecast, this should cause the euro to appreciate against the dollar. Domestic inflation will stay above the Czech National Bank's 2% target but still within the tolerance band around the target in the quarters ahead. This will continue to reflect persisting strong domestic inflation pressures and high growth in administered prices and food prices. Inflation will start to decrease at the start of next year, owing to the previous monetary policy tightening and an unwinding of the currently high growth in administered prices. It will approach the target over the monetary policy horizon, i.e. in the second half of next year. However, the decrease in inflation will be slowed throughout next year by the impacts of changes to indirect taxes. The Czech economy will grow by 2.6% this year and accelerate slightly over the next two years. Growth in economic activity will continue to be driven by all components of domestic demand except inventories. Robust growth in household consumption will reflect continued, albeit gradually slowing, growth in household income. Growth in private investment will remain solid over the entire forecast horizon, owing to high capacity utilisation. Government investment expenditure will also grow further, supported by drawdown of EU funds. Net exports will hinder economic growth this year but will make a slightly positive contribution to economic growth next year. The unemployment rate is at a record low and will not fall any further. Owing to labour shortages and gradually weakening demand for labour, total employment growth will slow as well. However, persisting labour market tightness will cause wage growth to approach its steady-state level only gradually. A markedly positive interest rate differential vis-Ã -vis the euro area and continued real convergence of the Czech economy will cause the koruna to firm gradually this year. The exchange rate appreciation will slow next year, reflecting a decrease in the interest rate differential vis-Ã -vis the euro area. Consistent with the forecast is a modest rise in domestic market interest rates initially, followed by a decline next year. The modest rise in interest rates at the start of the forecast primarily reflects persisting strong domestic inflation pressures due to rapid growth in wages and household consumption. The initial rise in interest rates in the forecast is also fostered by the second-round effects of changes to indirect taxes next year. By contrast, the decline in domestic interest rates forecasted for 2020 will be due mainly to persisting deeply negative interest rates in the euro area. By comparison with the previous forecast, the inflation outlook has been raised slightly. This is due mainly to stronger price pressures and the newly incorporated changes to indirect taxes. The economic growth forecast is little changed. Interest rates remain roughly at the same level as in the previous forecast for the rest of this year and are slightly lower in the longer term. The koruna-euro exchange rate is rather weaker than in the previous projection."
Romania,2019-08-05,"In its meeting of 5 August 2019, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided the following:. In June 2019, the annual CPI inflation rate went down to 3.8 percent (from 4.1 percent in May), slightly below the forecast, but above the variation band of the target. This owed to the significant drop in the prices of vegetables and fuels. Compared to end-Q1, when it had stood at 4.03 percent, the annual inflation rate decreased owing solely to developments in June. Behind the slowdown versus March stood entirely the exogenous CPI components, especially the dynamics of fuel prices. By contrast, the annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate (which excludes from the CPI inflation administered prices, volatile prices, and tobacco product and alcoholic beverage prices) reported faster growth from 2.7 percent in March to 3.3 percent in June. Apart from the impact of the new tax levied on telecom companies and of the hike in some international agri-food prices, the advance mirrors rising demand-pull and wage cost-push inflationary pressures, alongside the upward adjustment of short-term inflation expectations. The average annual CPI inflation rate continued to decline to 4.1 percent in June from 4.2 percent in May 2019; calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, the average annual inflation rate went down to 4.0 percent from 4.1 percent December 2018 through May 2019. The new statistical data confirm the step-up in economic growth to 5 percent in 2019 Q1 from 4.1 percent in 2018 Q4. On the demand side, final consumption continued to be the main driver of economic expansion (4.5 percentage points), ahead of the change in inventories (2.4 percentage points) and gross fixed capital formation, whose positive contribution saw a slight decline versus the previous version (0.6 percentage points). Conversely, net exports had a smaller negative contribution to GDP dynamics amid the revision of the negative differential between the growth rates of exports and imports of goods and services. The latest statistical data show a slowdown in the annual growth rate of the deficit on trade in goods and services in the first two months of Q2, as well as a faster widening of the current account deficit in annual terms amid the deterioration of the balance on secondary income. During the same period, mixed developments were reported by consumption, investment and production: an ongoing robust growth, albeit at a mildly slower pace, in retail trade and services, a persistently fast pace of increase in the construction activity, as well as further sluggish dynamics of industrial output, especially in manufacturing. The annual growth rate of credit to the private sector slowed somewhat to 7.1 percent in June 2019 versus 7.7 percent in Q1 amid the ongoing softening of the dynamics of leu-denominated loans, which, however, stayed solid. Against this background, the share of leu-denominated loans in total private sector credit widened to a post-June 1996 high of 66.6 percent. In today's meeting, the NBR Board examined and approved the August 2019 Inflation Report, which incorporates the most recent data and information available. The new forecast reconfirms the outlook for the annual inflation rate to remain above the variation band of the target for the remainder of the year, before returning and staying in the upper half of the band until the end of the forecast horizon, on a path relatively similar to that envisaged previously. The major uncertainties and risks surrounding the inflation outlook stem from the future stance of fiscal and income policies, while the evolution of the current account deficit is a matter of concern. In addition, the impact that the new benchmark index for loans to consumers (IRCC) will have on lending and the monetary policy transmission mechanism is uncertain. Moreover, there is an increasing number of signs on a worsening of the euro area and global economies and the ensuing uncertainties about their outlook are growing, especially amid the trade war and Brexit. Particularly relevant are the ECB's and the Federal Reserve's decisions on monetary policy easing, as well as the stance of central banks in the region. In today's meeting, based on the currently available data and assessments, the NBR Board decided to keep unchanged the monetary policy rate at 2.50 percent, while maintaining strict control over money market liquidity. Moreover, the NBR Board decided to leave unchanged the deposit facility rate at 1.50 percent per annum and the lending (Lombard) facility rate at 3.50 percent per annum. Furthermore, the central bank maintained the current levels of the minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board's decisions aim to ensure and preserve price stability over the medium term in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth and amid safeguarding financial stability. The NBR Board underlines that the balanced macroeconomic policy mix and the implementation of structural reforms designed to foster the growth potential over the long term are of the essence in preserving a stable macroeconomic framework and strengthening the capacity of the Romanian economy to withstand potential adverse developments. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be presented to the public in a press conference on 8 August 2019, at 11:00 a.m. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR's website on 12 August 2019, at 3:00 p.m. The next monetary policy meeting of the NBR Board is scheduled for 3 October 2019."
India,2019-08-07,"Third Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2019-20 Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) Reserve Bank of India On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today decided to: reduce the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 35 basis points (bps) from 5.75 per cent to 5.40 per cent with immediate effect. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF stands revised to 5.15 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate to 5.65 per cent. The MPC also decided to maintain the accommodative stance of monetary policy. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Assessment Global Economy 2. Global economic activity has slowed down since the meeting of the MPC in June 2019, amidst elevated trade tensions and geo-political uncertainty. Among advanced economies (AEs). GDP growth in the US decelerated in Q2:2019 on weak business fixed investment. In the Euro area too. GDP growth moderated in Q2 on worsening external conditions. Economic activity in the UK was subdued in Q2 with waning consumer confidence on account of Brexit related uncertainty and weak industrial production. In Japan, available data on industrial production and consumer confidence suggest that growth is likely to be muted in Q2. Economic activity remained weak in major emerging market economies (EMEs), pulled down mainly by slowing external demand. The Chinese economy decelerated to a multi-year low in Q2, while in Russia subdued economic activity in Q1 continued into Q2 on slowing exports and retail sales. In Brazil, the economy is struggling to gain momentum after contracting in Q1 on weak service sector activity and declining industrial production. Economic activity in South Africa appears to be 12 as the manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) contracted for the sixth month in succession in June and business confidence remained weak. Crude oil prices fell sharply in mid-May on excess supplies from an increase in non-OPEC production, combined with a further weakening of demand. Consequently, extension of OPEC production cuts in early July did not have much impact on prices. Gold prices have risen sharply since the last week of May, propelled by increased safe haven demand amidst rising downside risks to growth and a worsening geo-political situation. Inflation remained benign in major advanced and emerging market economies. Financial markets were driven by the monetary policy stances of major central banks and intensifying geo-political tensions. In the US, the equity market recovered most of the losses suffered in May, boosted by dovish guidance by the US Fed and some transient respite in trade tensions with China. EM stocks lagged behind their developed market counterparts, mainly reflecting the weak performance of Chinese and South Korean stocks. Bond yields in the US, which were already trading with a softening bias on increased probability of policy rate cuts, fell markedly in early August on escalation of trade tensions. Bond yields in some more member countries in the Euro area moved into negative territory as expectations of more accommodative monetary policy by the European Central Bank gained traction. In EMEs, bond yields edged lower on more accommodative guidance by systemic central banks. In currency markets, the US dollar weakened against major currencies in June on dovish guidance by the US Fed but appreciated in July. EME currencies, which traded with an appreciating bias in July, depreciated in early August on escalation of trade tensions. Domestic Economy 6. On the domestic front, the south-west monsoon gained intensity and spread with the cumulative rainfall 6 per cent below the long-period average (LPA) up to August 6, 2019. In terms of its spatial distribution, 25 of the 36 sub-divisions received normal or excess rainfall as against 28 sub-divisions last year. The total area sown under kharif crops was 6.6 per cent lower as on August 2 than a year ago. The live storage in major reservoirs on August 1 was at 33 per cent of the full reservoir level as compared with 45 per cent a year ago. Rainfall during the second half of the season (August- September) has been forecast to be normal by the India Meteorological Department (IMD). Industrial growth, measured by the index of industrial production (IIP), moderated in May 2019, pulled down by manufacturing and mining even as electricity generation picked up on strong demand. In terms of the use-based classification, the production of capital goods and consumer durables decelerated. However, consumer non-durables accelerated for the third consecutive month in May. The growth in the index of eight core industries decelerated in June, dragged down by a contraction in petroleum refinery products, crude oil, natural gas and cement. Capacity utilisation (CU) in the manufacturing sector, measured by the order books, inventory and capacity utilisation survey (OBICUS) of the Reserve Bank rose marginally to 76.1 per cent in Q4:2018-19 from 75.9 per cent in Q3; seasonally adjusted CU, however, fell to 74.5 per cent in Q4 from 75.6 per cent in Q3. The Reserve Bank's business assessment index (BAI) for Q1:2019-20 improved marginally, supported by a modest recovery in profit margins of the surveyed firms even as production and order books slowed. The manufacturing PMI rose to 52.5 in July from 52.1 in June, underpinned by a pick- up in production, higher new orders and optimism on demand conditions in the year ahead. High frequency indicators of services sector activity for May-June present a mixed picture. Tractor and motorcycle sales  indicators of rural demand  continued to contract. Amongst 23.8 in July from 49.6 in June on increase in new business activity, new export orders and employment. Retail inflation, measured by y-o-y change in the CPI, edged up to 3.2 per cent in June from 3.0 per cent in April-May, driven by food inflation, even as fuel inflation and CPI inflation excluding food and fuel moderated. Inflation in the food group rose to 2.4 per cent in June from 2.0 per cent in May and 1.4 per cent in April, caused by a sharp pick up in prices of meat and fish, pulses and vegetables. Inflation also edged up in cereals, milk, spices and prepared meals. However, inflation in eggs and non- alcoholic beverages softened. Prices of fruits, and sugar and confectionery remained in deflation in June. Inflation in the fuel and light group moderated in June, with electricity moving into deflation. Fuels such as firewood and chips, and dung cake have been in deflation from April. Inflation in liquified petroleum gas (LPG) and subsidised kerosene prices, however, remained elevated. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel fell by 50 basis points to 4.1 per cent in May from 4.6 per cent in April, and remained unchanged in June. The softness in inflation in this category was broad-based across clothing and footwear; household goods and services; transport and communication; and recreation and amusement. Housing inflation remained unchanged over the last three months. Despite some moderation, inflation in the health sub-group remained elevated. Inflation in personal care and effects edged up in June due to a resurgence in gold prices. Inflation expectations of households remained unchanged in the July 2019 round of the Reserve Bank's survey for the three months ahead horizon as compared with the previous round, but they moderated by 20 basis points for the one year ahead horizon. Input cost pressures from prices of agricultural and industrial raw materials continued to ease in May and June. Nominal growth in rural wages was muted, while growth in staff costs in the manufacturing sector eased in Q1. Manufacturing firms participating in the Reserve Bank's industrial outlook survey expect input cost pressures to soften on account of lower raw material costs in Q2. Liquidity in the system was in large surplus in June-July 2019 due to return of currency to the banking system; drawdown of excess cash reserve ratio (CRR) balances by banks; open market operation (OMO) purchase auctions; and the Reserve Bank's foreign exchange market operations. The Reserve Bank absorbed liquidity of 51,710 crore in June, 1,30,931 crore in July and 2,04,921 crore in August (up to August 6, 2019) on a daily net average basis under the LAF. Two OMO purchase auctions amounting to 27,500 crore were conducted in June, thereby injecting durable liquidity into the system. The weighted average call money rate (WACR)  the operating target of monetary policy  was aligned with the policy repo rate in June, but it traded below the policy repo rate on a daily average basis by 14 bps in July and 17 bps in August (up to August 6, 2019). Outlook 17. In the second bi-monthly monetary policy resolution of June 2019. CPI inflation was projected at 3.0-3.1 per cent for H1:2019-20 and 3.4-3.7 per cent for H2:2019-20, with risks broadly balanced. The actual headline inflation outcome for Q1:2019-20 at 3.1 per cent was in alignment with these projections. The baseline inflation trajectory for the next four quarters will be shaped by several factors. First, the uptick in food inflation may be sustained by price pressures in vegetables and pulses as more recent data suggest. Uneven spatial and temporal distribution of monsoon could exert some upward pressure on food items, though this risk is likely to be mitigated by the recent catch up in rainfall. Second, despite excess supply conditions, crude oil prices may likely remain volatile due to geo-political tensions in the Middle-East. Third, the outlook for CPI inflation excluding food and fuel remains soft. Manufacturing firms participating in the industrial outlook survey expect output prices to ease in Q2. Fourth, one year ahead inflation expectations of households polled by the Reserve Bank have moderated. Taking into consideration these factors and the impact of recent policy rate cuts, the path of CPI inflation is projected at 3.1 per cent for Q2:2019-20 and 3.5-3.7 per cent for H2:2019-20, with risks evenly balanced. CPI inflation for Q1:2020-21 is projected at 3.6 per cent (Chart 1). In the MPC's June resolution, real GDP growth for 2019-20 was projected at 7.0 per cent  in the range of 6.4-6.7 per cent for H1:2019-20 and 7.2-7.5 per cent for H2  with risks evenly balanced. Various high frequency indicators suggest weakening of both domestic and external demand conditions. The Business Expectations Index of the Reserve Bank's industrial outlook survey shows muted expansion in demand conditions in Q2, although a decline in input costs augurs well for growth. The impact of monetary policy easing since February 2019 is also expected to support economic activity, going forward. Moreover, base effects will turn favourable in H2:2019-20. Taking into consideration the above factors, real GDP growth for 2019-20 is revised downwards from 7.0 per cent in the June policy to 6.9 per cent  in the range of 5.8-6.6 per cent for H1:2019-20 and 7.3- 45 per cent for H2  with risks somewhat tilted to the downside; GDP growth for Q1:2020-21 is projected at 7.4 per cent (Chart 2). The MPC notes that inflation is currently projected to remain within the target over a 12-month ahead horizon. Since the last policy, domestic economic activity continues to be weak, with the global slowdown and escalating trade tensions posing downside risks. Private consumption, the mainstay of aggregate demand, and investment activity remain sluggish. Even as past rate cuts are being gradually transmitted to the real economy, the benign inflation outlook provides headroom for policy action to close the negative output gap. Addressing growth concerns by boosting aggregate demand, especially private investment, assumes the highest priority at this juncture while remaining consistent with the inflation mandate. All members of the MPC unanimously voted to reduce the policy repo rate and to maintain the accommodative stance of monetary policy. Four members (Dr.Ravindra H. Dholakia. Dr.Michael Debabrata Patra. Shri Bibhu Prasad Kanungo and Shri Shaktikanta Das) voted to reduce the policy repo rate by 35 basis points, while two members (Dr.Chetan Ghate and Dr.Pami Dua) voted to reduce the policy repo rate by 25 basis points. The minutes of the MPC's meeting will be published by August 21, 2019. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during October 1, 3 and 4, 2019.

Philippines,2019-08-07,"At its meeting on monetary policy today, the Monetary Board decided to cut the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) facility by 25 basis points (bps) to 4.25 percent. Accordingly, the interest rates on the overnight deposit and lending facilities were reduced to 3.75 percent and 4.75 percent, respectively. The Monetary Board's decision is based on its assessment that price pressures have continued to ease since the previous meeting. Latest baseline forecasts of the BSP indicate that inflation remains likely to settle within the inflation target of 3.0 percent Â± 1 percentage point for 2019 up to 2021. Inflation expectations have also moderated further to levels consistent with the inflation target based on the BSP's survey of private sector economists. Moreover, the risks to the inflation outlook continue to be seen as broadly balanced for 2019 and 2020, while they are seen to tilt to the downside for 2021. Weaker global economic prospects continue to temper the inflation outlook. The potential adverse effects of a prolonged El NiÃ±o episode to inflation have subsided. The Monetary Board noted that prospects for global economic activity are likely to remain weak amid sustained trade tensions among major economies. Domestically, the outlook for growth continues to be firm on the back of a projected recovery in household spending and the accelerated implementation of the government's infrastructure spending program, after the delay in expenditures due to the legislative impasse in the approval of the budget in January to April 2019. On balance, therefore, the Monetary Board believes that the benign inflation outlook provides room for a further reduction in the policy rate as a pre-emptive move against the risks associated with weakening global growth. Going forward, the BSP will continue to monitor price and output conditions to ensure that monetary policy remains appropriately supportive of sustained non-inflationary economic growth over the medium term."
Thailand,2019-08-07,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 5/2019 Mr. Titanun Mallikamas. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 7 August 2019 as follows. The Committee voted 5 to 2 to cut the policy rate by 025 percentage point from 175 to 150 percent, effective immediately. Two members voted to maintain the policy rate at 175 percent. In deliberating their policy decision, the Committee assessed that the Thai economy would expand at a lower rate than previously assessed due to a contraction in merchandise exports, which started to affect domestic demand. Inflation was projected to be lower than the lower bound of the inflation target. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative. Financial stability risks had already been addressed to some extent, although there remained pockets of risks that warranted monitoring. more accommodative monetary policy stance would contribute to the continuation of economic growth and should support the rise of headline inflation toward target. Most members thus voted to cut the policy rate at this meeting. Nevertheless two members viewed that the policy rate cut under the already accommodative monetary policy might not lend additional support to economic growth, compared with potentially increased financial stability risks. Moreover there remained a need to preserve policy space. The Thai economy was expected to expand at a lower rate than previously assessed and below potential. Merchandise exports contracted more than the previous assessment due to the slowdown of trading partner economies and global trade, which were affected by intensifying trade tensions that could expand to other countries. Tourism would grow at a lower rate. Regarding domestic demand, private consumption was expected to moderate in tandem with a decline in non-farm household income and employment, particularly employment in the export-related manufacturing sector. In addition, private consumption would be restrained by elevated household debt. Private investment was projected to slow down. However the relocation of production base to Thailand and public-private partnership projects for infrastructure investment would support investment in the period ahead. Public expenditure would grow at a slower pace than previously estimated on account of public investment, which was partly a result of constrained budget disbursement, as well as the expected delay in the enactment of the Annual Budget Expenditure Act. BE. 2563 (AD. 2020). The Committee would monitor external risks from intensifying trade tensions, the economic outlook of China and advanced economies that could affect domestic demand, as well as geopolitical risks. Furthermore the Committee would monitor policy implementation of the new government and public expenditure, as well as the progress of major infrastructure investment and its knock-on effects on private investment, which could affect the momentum of economic growth in the period ahead. The annual average of headline inflation was projected to be below the lower bound of the inflation target. Key drivers were energy prices, which declined at a fast pace, and core inflation, which was expected to moderate owing to subdued demand-pull inflationary pressures. The Committee viewed that structural changes contributed to more persistent inflation than in the past. Such changes included the expansion of e-commerce, rising price competition, and technological development which reduced costs of production. Financial conditions over the previous period had been accommodative, with ample liquidity in the financial system. Real interest rates remained at a low level, allowing financing by the private sector to continue expanding. However loans extended to both businesses and consumers would exhibit slower growth. With regard to exchange rates, the Committee expressed concerns over the baht appreciation against trading partner currencies, which might affect the economy to a larger degree amid intensifying trade tensions. However The Committee would closely monitor developments of exchange rates and capital flows as well as assess the necessity of additional appropriate measures. Financial stability remained sound overall but there remained a need to monitor risks that might pose vulnerabilities to financial stability in the future. The Committee viewed that the implemented macroprudential measures had to some extent curbed accumulation of vulnerabilities in the financial system. Nevertheless the Committee would monitor rising household debt accumulation, growth in assets held by saving cooperatives and the interconnectedness among saving cooperatives, and leverage by large corporates that could underprice risks. In the following period, given the softening outlook of the Thai economy and a prolonged low interest rate environment, microprudential and macroprudential measures would need to play an increasing role in addressing financial stability risks. Looking ahead, the Committee would continue to closely monitor developments of economic growth, inflation, and financial stability, together with associated risks, especially impacts of trade tensions, in deliberating appropriate monetary policy going forward. Nevertheless the Thai economy would continue to face structural problems, which would affect competitiveness and economic growth outlook. This should be firmly addressed by all related parties."
Peru,2019-08-08,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT AUGUST 2019 BCRP LOWERED REFERENCE RATE TO 2.50% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to cut the reference rate from 2.75 to 2.50 percent, thereby loosening the monetary policy stance, in light of the following developments: Year-on-year inflation and inflation trend indicators as of July were within the BCRP's target range; One-year ahead expected inflation as of July was 2.32 percent; Primary industries show a weak performance as a result of temporary supply shocks, while non-primary industries show slowing growth momentum. The slowdown in public investment in January-July is expected to revert in the remainder of the year; and Global growth risks persist and the recent escalation in trade tensions exacerbated international financial volatility. This decision does not necessarily imply additional reductions in the policy rate. The BCRP Board pays close attention to new information on inflation and its determinants in assessing future changes in the monetary policy stance. Year-on-year inflation is expected to remain within the target range close to 2.0 percent over the forecast horizon, with a downside bias due to the possibility of a lower-than-expected increase in domestic demand. According to recent inflation and economic activity indicators: Monthly inflation was 0.20 percent in July, bringing down year-on-year inflation to 2.11 percent, from 2.29 percent in June. With monthly inflation excluding food and energy at 0.12 percent in July, the year-on-year figure decreased to 2.15 percent, from 2.30 percent in June. Business conditions expectations continued its moderation in July. Non-primary activity indicators continue to point to a more gradual closure of the output gap. The Board also decided to reduce the interest rates on BCRP off-auction credit and deposit operations in domestic currency with financial entities. Overnight deposits: 1.25 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 3.05 percent per year for financial entities' first 10 operations over the last 12 months; and the rate fixed by the BCRP Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations Committee for operations other than financial entities' first 10 operations over the last 12 months. Dollar swaps: a fee equal to a minimum annual effective cost of 3.05 percent. The BCRP Board's next monetary policy session will take place on September 12, 2019."
Mexico,2019-08-15,"Banco de Mexico's Governing Board has decided to lower the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to 8.00%. World economic activity decelerated during the second quarter of the year due to moderation of growth in the main advanced and emerging economies. In this environment, the outlook for growth for the world economy has been revised downwards once more. Likewise, disputes arose between the United States and other economies related both to trade as well as to issues associated with migration, technology and exchange rate policy. Headline and core inflation in the main advanced economies have remained at low levels and below their central banks' targets. In this context, a large number of central banks have adopted more accommodative monetary policy stances. In its July meeting the US Federal Reserve cut the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points and anticipated the end of its balance sheet reduction. Episodes of volatility in financial markets associated with the tensions between the United States and China, and with a greater than expected deceleration in some economies, have taken place. This environment has led to expectations of further monetary policy easing by several central banks. The risks faced by the global economy have increased: escalation of trade disputes, a disorderly Brexit, and the worsening of certain political and geopolitical risks stand out. For this reason, the balance of risks for world economic activity has deteriorated. Domestic financial markets have been influenced by the effects of lower interest rates for all terms in the major advanced economies and by episodes of volatility. Thus, while the peso exchange rate fluctuated under these episodes, interest rates on government securities have decreased, including longer term ones. Regarding the risks that may affect the performance of financial assets in Mexico, uncertainty persists with respect to the bilateral relationship between Mexico and the United States and to the credit rating outlook both for Pemex's debt and for Mexico's sovereign debt. The current environment continues to pose significant medium- and long-term risks that could affect the country's macroeconomic conditions, its ability to grow, and the economy's price formation process. In this regard, it is particularly important that, in addition to a prudent and firm monetary policy, measures to foster an environment of confidence and certainty for investment and higher productivity are adopted, and that public finances are consolidated in a sustainable way. In this context, addressing the deterioration of both the sovereign's and Pemex's credit ratings and achieving the fiscal targets for 2019 are necessary. It is also important that the Economic Package for 2020 generates confidence. Strengthening the rule of law, tackling corruption, and fighting insecurity are equally imperative. The latest information suggests that during the second quarter of 2019, the stagnation of economic activity in Mexico observed in the previous quarters continued, due to a further weakening of most of the components of aggregate demand. Thus, slack conditions in the economy have continued to loosen, 1 even more than expected, widening the negative output gap. In an environment of significant uncertainty, the balance of risks for growth remains biased to the downside. Between June and July, headline inflation fell from 3.95% to 3.78%, due mainly to a decline of the non- core component, which went from 4.19% to 3.64%, reflecting the lower increases especially in the prices of energy products and in fruits and vegetables prices as well, while the rate of growth of livestock product prices has increased at the margin. As for core inflation, it has remained persistent around 3.8%. Inflation expectations for different terms from surveys and financial markets have remained relatively stable, although at levels above 3%. As for upside inflation risks, core inflation may continue to show persistence and there is the possibility that the peso exchange rate comes under pressure stemming from external or domestic factors. Should the economy require an adjustment of the real exchange rate. Banco de Mexico will contribute to an orderly process, preventing second-round effects on the economy's price formation process. Additional risks are the threat by the United States to impose tariffs on Mexican imports and the adoption of compensatory measures, although these have dissipated somewhat; that energy prices revert their trend or that agricultural and livestock product prices exhibit increases; weak public finances; and, that global protectionist measures escalate. In addition, given the magnitude of several wage revisions, that cost- related pressures arise, insofar as such revisions exceed productivity gains. Regarding downside risks, the peso exchange rate may appreciate, possibly associated with a context of more accommodative monetary policy stances and lower interest rates worldwide, or in case greater certainty arises regarding the trade relation with the United States. Another downside risk is that the prices of certain goods included in the non-core subindex register lower rates of change, as observed in the case of energy goods, due to the greater weakness exhibited by the world economy, which would also contribute to reduce core inflation. In addition, that slack conditions widen more than anticipated, which would impact the behavior of core inflation. Given the aforementioned, high uncertainty still persists regarding the risks that might affect inflation. In this context. Banco de Mexico will be alert to the possible materialization of inflation risks, both to the downside and to the upside. To guide its monetary policy actions. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board follows closely the development of inflation vis-Ã -vis its forecasted trajectory, taking into account the monetary policy stance and the time frame in which monetary policy operates. In this process, it uses available information on all inflation determinants as well as on medium- and long-term inflation expectations, including the balance of risks for such factors. Monetary policy must also respond prudently if for any reason the uncertainty faced by the economy increases significantly. In this context, considering that headline inflation has decreased as foreseen by Banco de Mexico, the greater than expected widening in the amount of slack in the economy, and the recent behavior of the external and domestic yield curves at various terms. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board decided by majority to lower the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to 8.00%, considering that under the current environment such level is consistent with the convergence of headline inflation to the central bank's target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates. One member voted to maintain the target at 8.25%. In order to consolidate a low and stable inflation, in an environment in which price formation and slack conditions in the economy are subject to risks, the Governing Board will continue to follow closely all factors and elements of uncertainty that have an impact on inflation and its outlook, and will take the required actions based on incoming information so that the policy rate is consistent with the orderly convergence of headline inflation to Banco de Mexico's target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board will maintain a prudent monetary policy stance and, under the current environment of uncertainty, will follow closely the potential pass-through of exchange rate 2 fluctuations to prices. Mexico's monetary policy stance relative to that of the U.S.-in an external environment that it is still subject to risks- and the behavior of slack conditions and cost-related pressures in the economy. In the presence and possible persistence of factors that, by their nature, involve risks to both inflation and its expectations, monetary policy will be adjusted in a timely and firm manner to achieve the convergence of inflation to its 3% target and to strengthen the anchoring of medium- and long-term inflation expectations so that they attain such target."
Egypt,2019-08-22,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release August 22, 2019 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation by 150 basis points to 1425 percent, 1525 percent, and 1475 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also cut by 150 basis points to 1475 percen. Annual headline and core inflation continued to decline to record 87 percent and 59 percent in July 2019, respectively, the lowest rates in almost four years, notwithstanding the recently implemented fiscal consolidation measures that reached cost recovery for most fuel product. This decline was supported by the containment of inflationary pressures, as evident in the relatively tame monthly inflation figures, and by favorable base effects, as the recently implemented measures were weaker compared to the previous yea. Real GDP growth continued to increase slightly to record a preliminary estimate of 57 percent in 2019 Q2 and 56 percent in fiscal year 2018/19, the highest in eleven year. Meanwhile the unemployment rate continued to decline to record 75 percent in 2019 Q2, thereby narrowing by almost 6 percentage points from its peak in 2013 Q. Globally the expansion of economic activity continued to weaken, financial conditions eased, and trade tensions continued to weigh on the outloo. International oil prices recently declined, yet remain subject to volatility due to geopolitical risks and potential supply-side factor. As incoming data continued to confirm the moderation of underlying inflationary pressures, the MPC decided to cut key policy rates by 150 basis point. This remains consistent with achieving the inflation target of 9 percent (Â±3 percentage points) in 2020 Q4 and price stability over the medium ter. The path for future policy rates remains a function of inflation expectations, rather than of prevailing inflation rate. Accordingly the pace and magnitude of future policy rates adjustment will continue to be subject to confirmation that inflation expectations are anchored at target levels that are consistent with disinflation and price stability over the medium ter. The MPC closely monitors all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust its stance to preserve monetary stabilit.

Hungary,2019-08-27,"At its meeting on 27 August 2019, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 28 August 2019:. The Magyar Nemzeti Bank's (MNB) single anchor is inflation, its primary objective is to achieve and maintain price stability. The factors determining inflation continue to show volatility. Therefore, in assessing the outlook, the Monetary Council pays more attention to the measures of underlying inflation capturing persistent trends. Consistent with the MNB's expectations, the annual consumer price index started to decline in the summer months. In July 2019, inflation, core inflation and core inflation excluding indirect tax effects fell to 3.3 percent, 3.7 percent and 3.2 percent, respectively. Both industrial goods and services inflation slowed compared to the previous month. Persistent inflation developments were overall lower even than expected. A dichotomy remains between the factors determining likely developments in inflation. Buoyant domestic demand is boosting, and weakening external activity is increasingly restraining the pace of inflation. Due to a strengthening of external disinflationary effects, core inflation excluding indirect tax effects is likely to decline gradually to 3 percent from the end of 2019. The increase of excise duty on tobacco products on a six-monthly basis, which is outside the scope of monetary policy, is likely to raise the consumer price index over the entire forecast horizon. This measure does not cause any second-round effects, consequently, does not influence changes in core inflation excluding indirect tax effects. Lower-than-expected underlying inflation data for recent months and the ongoing deterioration in external activity indicate strengthening in downside risks to the longer-term inflation outlook. The Hungarian economy grew by 4.9 percent in the second quarter of 2019, mainly driven by market services, industry and construction. On the expenditure side, domestic demand might have continued to grow. Labour demand remained strong, and the unemployment rate was close to its historically low level. The current account remained in surplus in the first quarter of 2019. Due mainly to dynamic growth in imports, the trade surplus declined in recent quarters, primarily reflecting strong investment activity in the corporate sector. Economic growth is expected to slow gradually from the middle of the year, but to remain strong. Subdued economic activity in Europe from the second half of the year is also reflected in the slowdown of growth in Hungary. The Hungarian economy is expected to grow by 4.3 percent in 2019 and by 3.3 percent in 2020. As a result of further dynamic growth in credit markets, the investment rate is likely to continue to rise and stabilise at high levels in the coming years. Regarding long-term, sustainable economic growth, the improvement in competitiveness by structural measures will be given increasing emphasis. In addition to monetary policy, the new retail government security strategy, the 2020 Budget Act and the provisions of the Economy Protection Action Plan to improve competitiveness, are aimed at further strengthening macroeconomic stability and sustainable convergence. The Hungarian Government Security Plus, introduced in June, is expected to raise households' savings rate, in addition to the structural change of their financial assets. Consequently, an increasing share of rapid wage growth is converted into savings instead of consumption, while the promotion of self-financing also helps to reduce Hungary's external vulnerability. Since its launch, more than HUF 1,650 billion of Hungarian Government Security Plus has been purchased. More than half of the purchases was registered as a new source of financing for the government sector. Based on the 2020 Budget Act, the budget deficit-to-GDP ratio is likely to decline to 1 percent, with the maintenance of a significant amount of reserves. After 2019, fiscal policy will remain counter-cyclical in 2020 as well. The announced Economy Protection Action Plan is expected to gradually improve the competitiveness of the domestic economy. The above measures jointly strengthen macroeconomic stability, reduce external vulnerability, and contribute to maintain a sustainable convergence path. Due to the deteriorating outlook for global economic growth, monetary policy stances of the world's leading central banks have become increasingly looser recently. Consistent with unfavourable European activity data and continued moderate inflation developments, the possibility of an interest rate cut appeared in the European Central Bank's July forward guidance. In line with this, market participants expect an easing of monetary policy already in September. In July, the Federal Reserve reduced the policy rate for the first time since 2008. Meanwhile, market participants expect further loosening measures over the remainder of the year. In its forward guidance, the Bank of Japan signalled that, if necessary, it was ready to ease policy further. Sentiment in international financial markets has deteriorated since the Council's previous interest rate decision. Risk appetite was influenced by developments in international trade policies, measures taken by the world's leading central banks and expectations of their future policy measures, domestic political tensions in Italy and news relating to Brexit. To improve the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission, the Monetary Council launched its corporate bond purchasing programme with a total amount of HUF 300 billion on 1 July 2019. By introducing the Bond Funding for Growth Scheme (BGS), the Council's specific objective is to promote the diversification of funding to the domestic corporate sector. Corporate bond issuances are expected to pick up in the fourth quarter. The MNB will neutralise excess liquidity arising from bond purchases by using the preferential deposit facility bearing interest at the central bank base rate. The programme complements the Funding for Growth Scheme Fix launched at the beginning of 2019 to build a healthier lending structure. Under the scheme, participating credit institutions have concluded loan contracts with domestic SMEs totalling HUF 219 billion until end of July. The Monetary Council left the base rate, the overnight collateralised lending rate and the one-week collateralised lending rate at 0.9 percent and the overnight deposit rate at -0.05 percent unchanged. In addition, in June, the Council set the average amount of liquidity, to be crowded out for the third quarter, at least at HUF 200-400 billion and will take this into account in setting the stock of central bank swap instruments. The MNB changes the stock of the FX swap instrument in a flexible manner to ensure that the interest rate transmission changes in line with the decisions by the Monetary Council, and the volatility of interbank rates remains at low levels. Accordingly, the stock of FX swaps providing forint liquidity has increased recently in order to achieve the average amount of liquidity to be crowded out. In its decisions, the Monetary Council focuses on the maintenance of price stability. The monetary policy stance will continue to be accommodative, economic agents' financing costs will remain favourable. A dichotomy remains between the factors determining likely developments in inflation. Buoyant domestic demand is boosting, and weakening external activity is increasingly restraining the pace of inflation. Regarding the persistent inflation trends, downside risks have strengthened. In assessing their extent data to be received in the second half of the year will be decisive. Of these, the following are of key importance: the spillover of disinflationary effects of slowing European economic activity, changes in monetary policies of the world's leading central banks, the effect of the new retail government security on savings, and the economic consequences of counter-cyclical fiscal policy. The Monetary Council will assess their effects on the maintenance of price stability over the 5-8 quarter horizon of monetary policy. In its monetary policy decisions, the Council applies a cautious approach, relying mainly on the comprehensive projections for the macroeconomy and inflation of the quarterly published Inflation Report. The future developments in the outlook for inflation will be a decisive factor in the necessity of further measures."
Israel,2019-08-28,"Since the previous interest rate decision, the inflation environment has shifted downward. The CPI readings for June and July were markedly lower than expected, and the inflation ratein the past 12 months is 0.5 percent. Inflation excluding energy and fruits and vegetables is 0.9 percent. Most of the negative contribution to the CPI is from the fruit and vegetables component, which is highly volatile, and from components affected by the appreciation of the shekel and the decline in energy prices. Short- and medium-term inflation expectations declined, with one-year expectations ranging around the lower bound of the target range, but long-term expectations remained anchored near the midpoint of the target range. The shekel strengthened by 3 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate since the previous interest rate decision, and by 8.7 percent since the beginning of the year.If the appreciation persists, it will be harder for a more extended period to return inflation to the target range. Economic activity continues to grow at close to its potential rate, and thus far it seems that activityin Israel is not being adversely affected by the negative global sentiment. Private consumption excluding durable goods and public consumption drove growth in the second quarter, and the trend of expansion that has characterized exports in the past two years continued, led by services exports. Initial data for the third quarter support the assessment that growth is continuing at around the potential rate. The labor market remains tight. The risks to the global economy have become more severe since the last interest rate decision, mainly in view of the worsening trade war. Interest rates were lowered in the US and other economies, and further reductions are expected. In Europe,further monetary accommodation is expected. The Monetary Committee's assessment is that in view of the turnaround in the inflation environment in Israel and in the monetary policies of major central banks, the slowing in the global economy, and the continued appreciation of the shekel, the interest rate will not be increased for an extended period. Moreover, if necessary, the Committee will take additional steps toward making monetary policy even more accommodativein order to support a process at the end of which inflation will stabilize around the midpoint of the target range, and to support economic activity. The Bank of Israel continues to monitor developments in inflation, the real economy, fiscal policy, the financial markets, and the global economy, and will act to attain the monetary policy targets in accordance with such developments. For the file of figures accompanying this notice, click here. Graphs and data. Since the last interest rate decision, the inflation environment has shifted downward. After most index readings since the beginning of the year surprised to the upside, the readings for June and July were markedly lower than expected. Inflation in the past 12 months was 0.5 percent (compared with 1.5 percent at the time of the previous interest rate decision) (Figure 1 in the attached file of figures), while inflation excluding energy and fruit and vegetables was 0.9 percent (1.1 percent at the time of the previous interest rate decision) (Figure 2). Most of the negative contribution to the CPI came from the highly volatile fruit and vegetables component, the effect of which is felt in the inflation of nontradable goods prices. Therewas also a negative contribution from declines in the cost of travel abroad andof private vehicle maintenance: items that were apparently impacted by the cumulative appreciation of the shekel since the beginning of the year and the decline in energy prices: which led to negative inflation in the prices of tradable goods. In view of the decline in inflation and the appreciation of the shekel, short-and medium-term inflation expectations also declined. A further decline in the year over year inflation rate is expected over the coming months, one-year expectations are close to the lower bound of the target range (Figure 4), and there was a decline in forward expectations up to three years. Long-term expectations remained anchored near the midpoint of the target range. (Figure 5). Since the previous interest rate decision, the exchange rate has been volatile, with the shekel strengthening by 3 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate since the last interest rate decision, and by 8.7 percent since the beginning of the year (Figure 6). To the extent that the appreciation persists, it will be harder for a more extended period to return inflation to the target range. Economic activity continues to grow at near its potential rate (Figure 11), and so far it seems that activity in Israel is not being adverselyaffected by the negative global sentiment. However, uncertainty regarding the measures to be taken by the government to reduce the deficit following the electionsis leading to increased uncertainty about developments in the domestic economy. National Accounts data for the second quarter were affected by volatility in vehicle imports (Figure 12). GDP grew by 1 percent, but according to Research Department assessments, the growth rate net of this effect was above the potential rate. Growth was driven by private consumption excluding durablesand by public consumption, both of which grew by more than 7 percent. The trendof expansion that has characterized exports in the past two years continues, led by services exports, as total exports (excluding diamonds and startups) increased by 4.6 percent. The Central Bureau of Statistics Business Tendency Survey indicates that there is no significant deterioration in the profitability of exports (Figure 16). Investment in residential construction seems to be recovering in 2019, after having contracted in the previous year. Initial third-quarter indicators (such as the Composite State of the Economy Index and the Business Tendency Survey; Figure 14) support the assessment that the economy is continuing to grow at around its potential rate. The labor market remains tight: the unemployment rate continued to decline, and the latest data on the employment and participation rates showthey declined slightly but remain high. Wage increases are continuing, led by the business sector. The job vacancy rate has been declining moderately for several months, but remains high. Equityindices in Israel declined since the previous interest rate decision, in parallel to global markets. Similar to global yields, medium- and long-term government bond yields declined sharply and eased financial conditions in the economy. For example, since the beginning of the year, the 10-year yield declined by 1.3 percentage points (Figure 7). Yield spreads between corporate bonds in Israel and comparable government bonds increased slightly, after having declined since the beginning of the year. In recent months, home prices increased moderately: The increase in the past year is approximately 1.4 percent, while rents continue to rise. The number of purchases grew, led by first home buyers. Mortgage volume continued to expand, and mortgage interest rates continued to decline in view of the decline in government bond yields. The risks to the global economy became more severe since the last interest rate decision, mainly in view of the intensifying trade war. In July, even before the intensification of the trade war, the IMF revised its 2019 global growth and world trade forecasts downward (Figure 20). The deterioration in world trade continues (Figure 21). In the financial markets, equity indices declined (Figure 26), and government bond yields declined sharply, in view of the actual and expected changes in monetary policy in various economies (Figure 25). In the US, the Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate by 0.25 percentage points, and assessments in the markets are that the interest rate will continue to decline this year. Growth in the second quarter was lower than in the first quarter, but higher than expected, and inflation is slightly below the target. In Europe, there was a slowdown in growth, and industrial production continues to contract, particularly in Germany and Italy, and inflation remained low. The ECB leftits interest rate unchanged, but indicated that additional accommodative measures are expected. In Japan, growth was higher than expected in the second quarter, supported by domestic consumption and investments, and despite a decline in exports in view of the slowdown of activity in China. Growth in China continued to moderate. Manufacturing exports grew by a very low rate, and there is a continued slowdown in retail sales and exports. Oil prices declined since the previous interest rate decision, in view of the continued weakness in demand (Figure 23). The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on September 11, 2019. The next decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Monday. October 7, 2019, followed by a press briefing by the Governor."
South Korea,2019-08-30,"Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period. This press release is the English version of the Bank of Korea's policy statement. In the case of any inconsistency, the original version in Korean will prevail. The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Board considers that the pace of global economic growth has slowed as trade has contracted. Volatility in the global financial markets has increased. Government bond yields and stock prices in major countries have fallen significantly in line mainly with the US-China trade dispute and concerns about the consequent global economic slowdown. Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and the global financial markets as likely to be affected by factors such as the degree of the spread of trade protectionism, the changes in the monetary policies of major countries, and geopolitical risks. The Board judges that the pace of domestic economic growth has remained slow, as consumption growth has weakened, while the adjustment in construction investment and the sluggishness in exports and facilities investment have continued. Employment conditions have partially improved, with the increase in the number of persons employed having risen. With respect to future domestic economic growth, the Board judges that the uncertainties concerning the growth path forecast have further increased, owing chiefly to the escalation of the US-China trade dispute and the heightened geopolitical risks. Consumer price inflation has slowed to the mid-0% range, in consequence mainly of the declines in the prices of petroleum products and agricultural, livestock and fisheries products. Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has been at the upper-0% range, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has been at the 2% level. Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will fluctuate for some time at the lower-0% level as downside risks to the path projected in July have increased, and then run at the low- to mid-1% level from next year. Core inflation will also gradually rise. The high volatility of price variables in the domestic financial markets has continued, in line mainly with concerns about the US-China trade dispute, geopolitical risks, and the consequent economic slowdowns at home and abroad. Long-term market interest rates and stock prices have fallen significantly, while the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has risen considerably. The slowdown in household lending growth has weakened somewhat, while housing prices have continued their downtrend but have risen in some parts of Seoul and its surrounding areas. Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As it is expected that domestic economic growth will be moderate and it is forecast that inflationary pressures on the demand side will remain at a low level, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance. In this process it will judge whether to adjust the degree of monetary policy accommodation, while closely examining any changes in macroeconomic and financial stability conditions. It will also carefully monitor the US-China trade dispute, any changes in the economies and monetary policies of major countries, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks."
Chile,2019-09-03,"Thursday, 3 September 2019 Monetary Policy Meeting  September 2019 At its Monetary Policy Meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to lower the monetary policy interest rate by 50 basis points, to 2.0%. The decision was adopted by the unanimous vote of the Board members. The main development since the previous Meeting has been the worsening of the external scenario. Especially significant has been the escalating trade conflict between the United States and China, with an impact on other economies that are integrated into value chains and financial markets. Global activity continued to slow in an important group of economies, where the weakening of manufacturing stood out, while services activity remains dynamic. The deterioration is deeper for global trade volumes, which virtually stagnated, and for expectations indicators. The trade conflict is compounded by the greater likelihood of a non-deal exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union, various geopolitical risks and a severe deterioration of the situation in Argentina. In this context, monetary policy has become more expansionary globally, but still financial markets continue to show high volatility and risk aversion. Thus, further declines in interest rates were observed in the fixed-income market, together with stock market relapses, depreciation of most currencies against the dollar and widespread falls in commodity prices. Inflationary figures remain contained in many economies around the world. The local financial market followed the external developments, where worth singling out were the depreciation of the peso against the dollar and the fall of stock prices and long-term interest rates. The latter, combined with the prospects of a more expansionary monetary policy, has resulted in low borrowing costs for all categories of credits and maturities. In real terms, consumer and commercial loans show a somewhat reduced dynamism, while housing loans have sped up their growth pace. In the second quarter, domestic activity and demand growth disappointed expectations. GDP growth was influenced by one-off supply-side factors and a fall in manufacturing. On the expenditure side, less progress was made in private consumption, although some of the one-off factors that affected GDP also had an impact on consumption growth. This, in a context in which consumer expectations have deteriorated from early in the year and private salaried employment shows less dynamism. Investment grew more than anticipated, thanks especially to its [INF*RES*AS] construction and other works component, offsetting a lower-than-expected expansion of machinery and equipment. Exports performed worse than expected. In this scenario, economic growth expectations have been adjusted downwards. The August Economic Expectations Survey (EES) anticipates GDP growth of 2.6% for 2019, 3.1% for 2020, and 3.3% for 2021. Annual CPI and CPIEFE variation has remained around 2%. Among the components of the latter, services inflation continues to be low in historical terms and the evolution of the prices most closely related to the output gap and wages continues to stand out. Over the two-year horizon, private expectations for headline inflation remained at 3% and 2.8% according to the EES and the Financial Brokers Survey (FBS), respectively. The Board's decision considers that the economy's performance of the second quarter and its outlook indicate that inflation will take longer to converge to the target, calling for a stronger monetary stimulus. It also estimates that further stimulus might be required, which will be evaluated in the upcoming meetings in light of the evolution of the macroeconomic scenario. With that, the Board reiterates that it will conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the two- year horizon. The September Monetary Policy Report containing the projections and analyses that provide ground for the Board's decision, will be published tomorrow Wednesday 4 September at 8:30 hours. The minutes of this Monetary Policy Meeting will be published at 8:30 hours on Monday, 23 September 2019. The next Monetary Policy Meeting will be held on Tuesday 22 and Wednesday 23 October, and the statement thereof will be released at 18:00 hours of this latter date. The Spanish original prevails."
Georgia,2019-09-04,"04.09.2019 NBG raises Its Policy Rate by 0.5 Percentage Points to 7.0% The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on September 4, 2019 and decided to raise the refinancing rate by 0.5 percentage points to 7 percent. In August, annual inflation rate stood at 4.9 percent. Overshooting the target was caused by several factors. One-off factors, such as increase in excise tax on cigarettes (contribution of 0.8 percentage points), remain one of the major contributors to high inflation. Moreover, the pass through of the exchange rate depriciation to inflation increased in recent periods. It should be noted that the core inflation which excludes food, energy and tobacco prices, is still low at 2.4 percent indicating that the demand-side pressure on inflation is low. Present depreciation of the nominal effective exchange rate is amplifying inflation expectations. In line with the previous decision of the MPC meeting, stating that if inflationary pressure driven by the exchange rate depreciation persisted, the Committee would consider monetary policy tightening, the Monetary Policy Committee decided to increase the policy rate by 0.5 percentage points. Moreover, the Committee stands ready to further continue policy tightening until the pressures from exchange rate recedes. Preliminary data indicated improved economic growth. Nevertheless, aggregate demand remains below the potential, partially offseting pressures from exchange rate. According to the forecast, other things equal the inflation will remain above the target during this year, will start to decline from March, 2020 and stay close to target in the medium term. According to preminary indicators, export of goods increased considerably (12.4 percent) during Janury-July 2019. Remittance inflows increased moderately (7.8 percent) during the same period. Against the background of the ban on air travel from Russian Federation, revenues from international travelers declined in July, as expected. Overall, during January-July, this indicator grew by 2.1 percent as opposed to 7.0 percent in the first half of the year. Despite this, total inflows continue to grow and further reduction in the current account deficit is expected in 2019. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all means and instruments at its disposal in order to ensure the price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee is scheduled on October 23, 2019. However, if necessary, the Committee will consider the possibility of extraordinary meeting."
Ukraine,2019-09-05,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to cut the key policy rate to 16.5% per annum, effective 6 September 2019. The NBU is continuing the cycle of monetary policy easing, as it expects inflation to decline to the target of 5%. In July, inflation was at 9.1% yoy, which was above the forecast trajectory published in the latest Inflation Report. The NBU expects inflation to have declined in August, although still remaining above the forecast level. The deviation was mostly driven by temporary factors related to food supply, in particular the supply of vegetables. Core inflation, at 7.4% yoy in July, was in line with the NBU's projections. The tight monetary policy was a strong factor holding back the underlying pressures on prices, in particular through the exchange rate channel. However, greater domestic demand and higher wages kept on restraining the slowdown in inflation. The NBU reiterates its forecast that inflation will meet the 5% medium-term target at the end of next year. Macroeconomic factors in place since the previous monetary policy meeting of the NBU Board have not changed the balance of risks to the forecast. On the one hand, according to the NBU's estimates, a strengthening in the exchange rate will help curb inflation in the next few months. The hryvnia appreciation was driven by fundamental market factors, such as the favorable global commodity prices, good grain harvest, the continued growth in IT services exports, a stronger investor confidence in the Ukrainian economy, and the simplification of access to the government securities market for investors. That reduced the amount of repatriated dividends and spurred demand for domestic government bonds. Although the impact of foreign capital inflows on the domestic government bond market weakened substantially over past weeks, the foreign exchange market has remained in balance. The current drops in global oil and gas prices will be translated to domestic prices, with a certain time lag. On the other hand, the rapidly rising domestic demand and strong wage growth will push prices upward. The more rapid GDP growth seen in Q2 2019 (4.6% per annum) was mainly driven by a pick-up in domestic consumption amid a faster improvement in consumer sentiment. The preliminary estimates of economic activity in July showed that sustained domestic demand had persisted. The NBU Board said that internal political risks to reducing inflation to its target decreased after the new convocation parliament started to operate and a new government was formed. This makes it possible to intensify negotiations on a new cooperation program with the International Monetary Fund. At the same time, threats to financial stability are still arising from current court proceedings related to the decisions made by the state aimed at recovery of the banking sector. The external risks identified by the NBU Board at the previous monetary policy meeting in July still persist. a suspension of Russian gas transit through Ukraine starting in 2020increased trade tensions and more turbulent global financial marketsan escalation of the military conflict and new trade restrictions introduced by Russia.The NBU will continue the cycle of monetary policy easing, provided inflation is steadily declining to the target of 5%. How quickly the key policy rate is reduced to its neutral level of 8% will depend on both internal and external risks. If structural reforms speed up, the NBU Board could cut the key policy rate more quickly. Another important condition is inflation decreasing steadily to its target. Conversely, if inflation risks materialize, in particular through persistent demand pressure, the easing of monetary policy will be more gradual. The decision to cut the key policy rate to 16.5% has been approved by NBU Board Decision No.645-D On the Key Policy Rate dated 5 September 2019. A summary of the discussion by Monetary Policy Committee members that preceded this decision will be published on 16 September 2019. The next meeting of the NBU Board on monetary policy issues will be held on 24 October 2019 as scheduled."
Russia,2019-09-06,"On 6 September 2019, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to cut the key rate by 25 bp to 7.00% per annum. Inflation slowdown is continuing. At the same time, inflation expectations remain elevated. The Russian economy's growth rate is still coming in lower than the Bank of Russia's expectations. Risks of a global economic slowdown have increased. Risks of inflation accelerating or slowing down by the year-end are balanced. In these circumstances and taking actual inflation dynamics into account, the Bank of Russia has lowered its end-of-year annual inflation forecast for 2019 from 4.2-4.7% to 4.0-4.5%. Moving on, according to the Bank of Russia's forecast and taking into account the monetary policy stance, annual inflation will remain close to 4%. If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia will consider the necessity of further key rate reduction at one of the upcoming Board of Directors' meetings. In its key rate decision-making, the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic developments over the forecast horizon, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. Inflation dynamics. Inflation slowdown is continuing. Annual consumer price growth rate declined to 4.3% in August (from 4.6% in July 2019). August results show that annual core inflation also declined to 4.3% vs 4.5% in July. According to the Bank of Russia estimates, most inflation indicators reflecting the most sustainable price movements are close to 4%. Consumer demand trends constrain inflation. Temporary disinflationary factors also contributed to slowing consumer price growth, including the seasonality shift in fruit and vegetable price dynamics on the back of early new harvest arrival. Annual inflation slowdown is also influenced by the high base effect in respect of the price dynamics of principal types of motor fuel. In August, households' inflation expectations somewhat decreased but still remain elevated. Business price expectations showed mixed dynamics amid August ruble depreciation. Annual inflation slowdown paves the way for a future decline in inflation expectations. Taking actual inflation dynamics into account, the Bank of Russia has lowered its end-of-year annual inflation forecast for 2019 from 4.2-4.7% to 4.0-4.5%. Moving on, according to the Bank of Russia's forecast and taking into account the monetary policy stance, annual inflation will remain close to 4%. Monetary conditions. Monetary conditions have continued to ease since the last Board meeting. Among other things, this was driven by the change in expectations of financial market participants with regard to the Bank of Russia's key rate path and further downward revision of expected interest rate paths in the US and the euro area. OFZ yields and interest rates in most credit and deposit market segments continued to decline. The Bank of Russia's decisions to cut the key rate and the decline in OFZ yields create conditions for a decrease in deposit and lending rates in the future. Real sector lending continues to grow on the back of eased monetary conditions. At the same time, annual growth in lending to households has been slowing down since June after noticeable growth in 2018 â€” early 2019. Economic activity. The Russian economy's growth rate is still coming in lower than the Bank of Russia's expectations. This is driven by weakening external demand for Russian exports on the back of a global economic slowdown as well as by weak investment activity dynamics, including government investment expenditures. July saw continuing annual growth of industrial production; however, leading indicators for July and August point to a potential worsening of economic conditions in industry. Retail trade turnover growth is further declining YoY amid stagnating real disposable household incomes. The labour market creates no additional inflationary pressure. The fact that unemployment remains at historic lows is not driven by expanding labour demand but rather by a simultaneously contracting number of employees and the labour force. In the first half of the year, fiscal policy had a constraining effect on economic activity. This is in part related to slower than expected implementation of national projects planned by the Government. The expansion of government spending, including investment expenditures, in the second half of 2019 will support economic growth. Given the weak economic activity observed since the beginning of this year, the Bank of Russia has lowered its GDP growth rate forecast for 2019 from 1.0-1.5% to 0.8-1.3%. Growth rates of the Russian economy in 2020-2021 have also been reviewed downwards considering the expected slowdown in the global economy. Economic growth might accelerate to 2-3% by 2022 should the Government's measures for overcoming structural constraints, including the implementation of national projects, be realised. Inflation risks. Disinflationary and pro-inflationary risks are balanced till the end of the year. Disinflationary factors are primarily related to the weak dynamics of domestic and external demand. That said, growth in budget spending in 2019 H2 â€” early 2020 will potentially be more distributed over time, which lowers pro-inflationary risks posed by this factor. At the same time, should the global economic slowdown be more pronounced, including due to tightening international trade restrictions and on the back of other geopolitical factors, this might lead to strengthened volatility in global commodity and financial markets, affecting exchange rate and inflation expectations. A number of internal conditions continue to pose pro-inflationary risks over a longer-term horizon. Significant risks are posed by elevated and unanchored inflation expectations. The mid-term inflation dynamics may also be affected by fiscal policy parameters, including decisions on the use of the liquid part of the National Wealth Fund in excess of the threshold level set at 7% of GDP. The Bank of Russia leaves mostly unchanged its estimates of risks associated with wage movements, prices of individual food products, and possible changes in consumer behaviour. These risks remain moderate. If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia will consider the necessity of further key rate reduction at one of the upcoming Board of Directors' meetings. In its key rate decision-making, the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic developments over the forecast horizon, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next rate review meeting on 25 October 2019. The press release on the Bank of Russia Board decision is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time. In the follow-up to the Board of Directors meeting of 6 September 2019 the Bank of Russia released its medium-term forecast. The reference to the Press Service is mandatory if you intend to use this material."
Kazakhstan,2019-09-09,"– 28 The base rate raised to 9.25% September 9, 2019 Almaty The National Bank of Kazakhstan has made a decision to raise the base rate by 25 b.p to 9.25% per annum. The aÑtual inflation is formed higher than the expectations and reached 5.5% year-on- year this August. The inflationary pressure, caused by the expanding consumer demand, increased compared to the previous forecast, pushing the inflation to the upper boundary of the target range at the level of 5.7%-5.8% by the end of 2019. In the medium-term forecast horizon, the inflation is anticipated in 2020 to be within target range 4-6% with some slowdown. The economic growth during the 7 months of 2019 exceeded the forecast of the National Bank, reaching 4.2%, which creates an inflationary pressure in the economy. In order to achieve the announced inflation target, the National Bank will make further decisions on the base rate taking into account the alignment of the actual and forecast inflation to the target range, risk realization originating from the domestic demand, import growth, and developments in the global economy. The annual inflation was formed at the level of 5.5% in August 2019. Food-stuff goods continue to be the driving force of the inflation, an annual price growth for those accelerated to 9% (5.1% in December 2018). Amid the expanding external demand and contracting domestic supply, the prices of meat, bread products and cereal have increased. The annual price increase for these groups of items amounted to 12.8% and 12.6%, respectively. The prices of non-food items demonstrate a moderate growth rate of 5.7% in annual terms (6.4% in December 2018). The overall price increase of the entire category is restricted by the falling prices of gasoline (by 5.2% in annual terms) and stable prices of diesel fuel. The prices for paid services remained on the historically low level of 0.8% in annual terms (4.5% in December 2018). A slowdown of inflation for unregulated services is observed, which is related to the cuts in costs of production amid the falling utility costs and the price of gasoline. In August of this year inflation expectations of households declined. According to the households' survey, 60% of respondents expect the inflation to remain at the same level or to decrease 12 months ahead. The respondents assess that the inflation in the 12 months horizon will amount to 5.3%. In the medium-term horizon the annual inflation will be formed within the target range. Nevertheless, in the short run the inflation is expected to rise due to the growing domestic demand, price acceleration of particular food-stuff goods, and exhausting effect of the reduced tariffs for regulated services in the 1st quarter of 2020. All of the above cause the risks for inflation to exceed the upper boundary of the target range. The expanding domestic demand remains to be the core driver of inflation. The real income growth among the population in January-June reached 5.1%. In the 2nd quarter of 2019 the real wage accelerated to 8.9%. The growth of this indicator was observed in all sectors of the economy. The expansion of the domestic demand is promoted by the extensive fiscal spending on the social support, salaries, along with persisting growth in consumer lending by 24.1% in annual terms in July of this year. A growth 5.4% in retail trade turnover is observed in January-July 2019. In the 1st half of this year the consumer import grew up by 4.8%. The main contribution was observed from the non-food items import, which increased by 7.3%. The growth of the domestic economic activity remains above the National Bank's expectations. In January-July of this year short-term economic indicator grew up by 4.4%, including the growth in construction by 11.5%, trade by 7.5%, transport by 5.4%, agriculture by 3.5%, manufacturing and mining industries by 3.2% and 2.4%, respectively. This development is fostered by the expanding investment, which increased by 11.3% in January-August 2019. The demand for imported capital goods expanded by 24.9% as a result of implementation of large- scale infrastructure and investment projects (TCO expansion, â€œSaryarkaâ€ gas pipeline, etc.) According to the National Bank estimates, in 2019 the economic growth in Kazakhstan is projected to reach 3.8%. In the medium-term Kazakhstan's economic growth rate will slow down marginally, but will remain at a relatively high level of 3.5% in 2020. In the short term expanding household consumption and growth of investments will become the main drivers of economic development. Forthcoming economic slowdown will occur as a result of weakening fiscal stimulus effect, as well as lowering dynamics of net export. Amid the growing consumer and investment demand, the output gap, i.e. the difference between the actual and potential GDP, will be positive in the forecast horizon, signaling the existence of the inflationary pressure. External sector factors will make a negative impact on the domestic prices. The oil prices had declined this year. Since the beginning of the year the average Brent oil price level stood at 65 US dollars a barrel (72 US dollars a barrel of Brent oil in 2018). An increasing volatility of oil prices is observed in recent months. From the middle of July 2019 world oil prices started falling due to the weakening demand and high production volumes in the US, which in conjunction led to the growth of the world oil supply. Since the beginning of this year the FAO Food Price Index rose by 5.1% as a result of consumption growth and anticipated reduced stocks of certain food items. In particular, since the beginning of the year world prices for meat (11%) and bread products (14%) increased substantially. The growth of world prices is not fully compensated by the inflation slowdown in countries-main trade partners of Kazakhstan. External monetary conditions were easing as a result of interest rate reductions by the central banks, changing rhetoric regarding the future trajectory of interest rates, as well as measures, stimulating the economies. The external drivers of rising inflation forecast trajectory are the unresolved disputes in trade policy between the world's leading economies, and, as a consequence, intensifying trade wars and slowing global economy, which lowers the demand for Kazakhstan's export. Raising the base rate will promote the attractiveness of the tenge denominated assets and enable to prevent the upsurge of inflation caused by the rising cost of imports. Current monetary conditions are assessed as neutral. The level of the base rate in real terms (accounting for the expected inflation by the end of forecast horizon) remains to be within the 3.0-3.5% target benchmark. The National Bank's further decisions on the base rate will be based on the accordance of the actual and forecast inflation dynamics with the 4-6% target range in 2019-2020, emerging risks coming from the domestic economy and the development in the global economy. In order to enhance the transparency and improve communication strategy, the National Bank will post the Statement of the Governor about the base rate on the National Bank's official website. In addition, the Inflation Report that contains the detailed analysis of key macroeconomic indicators in the short and medium-term horizon will be posted a week later. During the next two weeks the results of the forecast round, as well as meetings with experts will get a more extensive coverage in the media.

Poland,2019-09-11,"Warsaw, 11 September 2019 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 10-11 September 2019 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: â–ª reference rate at 1.50%; â–ª lombard rate at 2.50%; â–ª deposit rate at 0.50%; â–ª rediscount rate at 1.75%. Incoming data suggest that global economic growth continues at a relatively slow pace, while the global outlook has deteriorated. In the euro area. GDP growth remained low in 2019 Q2. Although the situation in the services sector is still good, activity in the industrial sector remains weak. In the United States, economic conditions continue to be strong, even though GDP growth slowed in 2019 Q2 and economic indicators signal a possible weakening of activity in the coming quarters. In China. GDP growth declined as well in 2019 Q2. In the recent period global oil prices have fallen. At the same time, inflation in many countries remains moderate. The European Central Bank is keeping interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero, and reinvests maturing securities bought under the asset purchase programme. The ECB is also signalling the possibility of easing its monetary policy in the near future. The US Federal Reserve has lowered interest rates and stopped reducing its balance sheet. In Poland, despite weaker growth abroad, economic conditions remain good, and GDP grew by 4.5% y/y in 2019 Q2. Activity growth is driven by rising consumption, fuelled by increasing employment and wages, very high consumer sentiment, and social benefit payments. Investment also grew in 2019 Q2, although at a slightly slower pace compared to the previous quarter. At the same time, growth in exports and imports slowed down. According to the GUS flash estimate, inflation stood at 2.8% y/y in August 2019. Higher price growth is primarily driven by significant growth in food prices, while lower energy prices than a year ago, including fuel prices, have a curbing effect on price growth. At the same time, core inflation continues to run at moderate levels. In the Council's assessment, the outlook for economic conditions in Poland remains favourable, and GDP growth will continue at a relatively high level in the coming years. However, uncertainty about the scale and persistence of the slowdown abroad and its impact on domestic economic activity has increased. After a temporary rise in 2020 Q1, inflation will stay close to the target in the monetary policy transmission horizon. 1/2 The Council judges that the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability. The Council adopted Monetary Policy Guidelines for 2020."
Euroarea,2019-09-12,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we have conducted a thorough assessment of the economic and inflation outlook, also taking into account the latest staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. As a result, the Governing Council took the following decisions in pursuit of its price stability objective. First, as regards the key ECB interest rates, we decided to lower the interest rate on the deposit facility by 10 basis points to -0.50%. The interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the rate on the marginal lending facility will remain unchanged at their current levels of 0.00% and 0.25% respectively. We now expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until we have seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within our projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics. Second, the Governing Council decided to restart net purchases under its asset purchase programme (APP) at a monthly pace of â‚¬20 billion as from 1 November. We expect them to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of our policy rates, and to end shortly before we start raising the key ECB interest rates. Third, we intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. Fourth, we decided to change the modalities of the new series of quarterly targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO to preserve favourable bank lending conditions, ensure the smooth transmission of monetary policy and further support the accommodative stance of monetary policy. The interest rate in each operation will now be set at the level of the average rate applied in the Eurosystem's main refinancing operations over the life of the respective TLTRO. For banks whose eligible net lending exceeds a benchmark, the rate applied in TLTRO III operations will be lower, and can be as low as the average interest rate on the deposit facility prevailing over the life of the operation. The maturity of the operations will be extended from two to three years. Fifth, in order to support the bank-based transmission of monetary policy the Governing Council decided to introduce a two-tier system for reserve remuneration in which part of banks' holdings of excess liquidity will be exempt from the negative deposit facility rate. Separate press releases with further details of the measures taken by the Governing Council will be published this afternoon at 15:30 CET. The Governing Council reiterated the need for a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy for a prolonged period of time and continues to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry. Today's decisions were taken in response to the continued shortfall of inflation with respect to our aim. In fact, incoming information since the last Governing Council meeting indicates a more protracted weakness of the euro area economy, the persistence of prominent downside risks and muted inflationary pressures. This is reflected in the new staff projections, which show a further downgrade of the inflation outlook. At the same time, robust employment growth and increasing wages continue to underpin the resilience of the euro area economy. With today's comprehensive package of monetary policy decisions, we are providing substantial monetary stimulus to ensure that financial conditions remain very favourable and support the euro area expansion, the ongoing build-up of domestic price pressures and, thus, the sustained convergence of inflation to our medium-term inflation aim. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro area real GDP increased by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2019, following a rise of 0.4% in the previous quarter. Incoming economic data and survey information continue to point to moderate but positive growth in the third quarter of this year. This slowdown in growth mainly reflects the prevailing weakness of international trade in an environment of prolonged global uncertainties, which are particularly affecting the euro area manufacturing sector. At the same time, the services and construction sectors show ongoing resilience and the euro area expansion is also supported by favourable financing conditions, further employment gains and rising wages, the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance and the ongoing  albeit somewhat slower  growth in global activity. This assessment is broadly reflected in the September 2019 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. These projections foresee annual real GDP increasing by 1.1% in 2019, 1.2% in 2020 and 1.4% in 2021. Compared with the June 2019 staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real GDP growth has been revised down for 2019 and 2020. The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the downside. These risks mainly pertain to the prolonged presence of uncertainties, related to geopolitical factors, the rising threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.0% in August 2019, unchanged from July. Lower energy inflation was offset by higher food inflation, while the rate of HICP inflation excluding food and energy was unchanged. On the basis of current futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to decline before rising again towards the end of the year. Measures of underlying inflation remained generally muted and indicators of inflation expectations stand at low levels. While labour cost pressures strengthened and broadened amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets, their pass-through to inflation is taking longer than previously anticipated. Over the medium term underlying inflation is expected to increase, supported by our monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion and robust wage growth. This assessment is also broadly reflected in the September 2019 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation at 1.2% in 2019, 1.0% in 2020 and 1.5% in 2021. Compared with the June 2019 staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for HICP inflation has been revised down over the whole projection horizon, reflecting lower energy prices and the weaker growth environment. Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth increased to 5.2% in July 2019, after 4.5% in June. Sustained rates of broad money growth reflect ongoing bank credit creation for the private sector and low opportunity costs of holding M3. The narrow monetary aggregate M1 continues to be the main contributor to broad money growth on the components side. The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations remained unchanged at 3.9% in July 2019. The annual growth rate of overall loans to non-financial corporations continues to be solid, although short-term loans  which are more sensitive to the cycle  show signs of weakness. The annual growth rate of loans to households stood at 3.4% in July, after 3.3% in June, continuing its gradual improvement. Overall, loan growth is still benefiting from historically low bank lending rates. The monetary policy measures we have taken today, including the more accommodative terms of the new series of TLTROs, will help to safeguard favourable bank lending conditions and will continue to support access to financing, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is still necessary for the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute more decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential, supporting aggregate demand at the current juncture and reducing vulnerabilities. The implementation of structural policies in euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up to boost euro area productivity and growth potential, reduce structural unemployment and increase resilience. The 2019 country-specific recommendations should serve as the relevant signpost. Regarding fiscal policies, the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance is currently providing some support to economic activity. In view of the weakening economic outlook and the continued prominence of downside risks, governments with fiscal space should act in an effective and timely manner. In countries where public debt is high, governments need to pursue prudent policies that will create the conditions for automatic stabilisers to operate freely. All countries should reinforce their efforts to achieve a more growth-friendly composition of public finances. Likewise, the transparent and consistent implementation of the European Union's fiscal and economic governance framework over time and across countries remains essential to bolster the resilience of the euro area economy. Improving the functioning of Economic and Monetary Union remains a priority. The Governing Council welcomes the ongoing work and urges further specific and decisive steps to complete the banking union and the capital markets union."
Malaysia,2019-09-12,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.00 percent. The global economy is expanding at a more modest pace amid slower growth in most major advanced and emerging economies. The recent escalation of trade tensions point to weaker global trade going forward, with increasing signs of spillovers to domestic economic activity in a number of countries. Monetary policy easing in several major economies has eased global financial conditions, but uncertainty from the prolonged trade disputes and geopolitical developments could lead to excessive financial market volatility. For Malaysia, the stronger economic growth performance in the second quarter of 2019 was underpinned by the resilience of private spending amid broad-based expansion in key economic sectors. Going forward, these domestic drivers of growth, alongside stable labour market and wage growth, are expected to remain supportive of economic activity. On the external front. Malaysia's diversified exports will partly mitigate the impact of softening global demand. Overall, the baseline growth projection for 2019 remains unchanged, within the range of 4.3% - 4.8%. This projection, however, is subject to further downside risks from worsening trade tensions, uncertainties in the global and domestic environment, and extended weakness in commodity-related sectors. Average headline inflation year-to-date is 0.3%. Headline inflation is projected to average higher for the remaining months of the year and into 2020. However, headline inflation is expected to remain low. This reflects the lapse in the impact of consumption tax policy changes, the relatively subdued outlook on global oil prices, and policy measures in place to contain food prices. The trajectory of headline inflation will, however, be dependent on global oil and commodity price developments. Underlying inflation is expected to remain stable, supported by the continued expansion in economic activity and in the absence of strong demand pressures. At the current level of the OPR, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and supportive of economic activity. The MPC will continue to assess the balance of risks to domestic growth and inflation, to ensure that the monetary policy stance remains conducive to sustainable growth amid price stability.

Peru,2019-09-12,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT SEPTEMBER 2019 BCRP MAINTAINS REFERENCE RATE AT 2.50% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to maintain the reference rate at 2.50 percent, in light of the following developments: Year-on-year inflation and inflation trend indicators as of August were within the BCRP's target range. One-year ahead expected inflation as of August was 2.30 percent. Primary industries had a weak performance in the first half of the year as a result of temporary supply shocks, which began to reverse in July. On the other hand, non-primary industries have begun to recover, although at a lower rate than expected. Public investment showed a lower performance in January-August, which is expected to revert in the remainder of the year. Global growth risks persist and trade tensions continue to create high international financial volatility. Year-on-year inflation is expected to remain within the target range and converge towards 2.0 percent over the forecast horizon, with a downside bias due to the possibility of a lower-than- expected increase in domestic demand. The BCRP Board considers that it is appropriate to maintain an expansionary monetary policy stance and pays close attention to new information on inflation and its determinants in assessing future changes in this stance. According to recent inflation and economic activity indicators: Monthly inflation was 0.06 percent in August, bringing down year-on-year inflation to 2.04 percent, from 2.11 percent in July. With monthly inflation excluding food and energy at 0.14 percent in August, the year-on-year figure increased to 2.20 percent, from 2.15 percent in July. Business conditions expectations continued to moderate in August. Non-primary activity indicators continue to point to a more gradual closure of the output gap. The Board also decided to maintain the interest rates on BCRP off-auction credit and deposit operations in domestic currency with financial entities. Overnight deposits: 1.25 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 3.05 percent per year for financial entities' first 10 operations over the last 12 months; and the rate fixed by the BCRP Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations Committee for operations other than financial entities' first 10 operations over the last 12 months. Dollar swaps: a fee equal to a minimum annual effective cost of 3.05 percent. The BCRP Board's next monetary policy session will take place on October 10, 2019."
Turkiye,2019-09-12,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to reduce the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) from 19.75 percent to 16.50 percent. Recently released data indicate that moderate recovery in economic activity continues. In the first half of the year, the contribution of net exports to economic growth continued, while investment demand remained weak and the contribution of private consumption gradually increased. Goods and services exports continue to display an upward trend despite the weakening in the global economic outlook, indicating improved competitiveness. In particular, strong tourism revenues support the economic activity through direct and indirect channels. Leading indicators point to a partial improvement in the sectoral diffusion of economic activity. Looking forward, net exports are expected to contribute to economic growth and the gradual recovery is likely to continue with the help of the disinflation trend and the improvement in financial conditions. The composition of growth is having a positive impact on the external balance. Current account balance is expected to maintain its improving trend. Recently, advanced economy central banks have started to adopt more expansionary policies as global economic activity weakened and downside risks to inflation heightened. While these developments support the demand for emerging market assets and the risk appetite, rising protectionism and uncertainty regarding global economic policies are closely monitored in terms of their impact on both capital flows and international trade. Inflation outlook continued to improve. In addition to the stable course of the Turkish lira, improvement in inflation expectations and mild domestic demand conditions supported the disinflation in core indicators. In August, consumer inflation displayed a significant fall with the contribution of core goods, energy and food groups. Domestic demand conditions and the level of monetary tightness continue to support disinflation. Underlying trend indicators, supply side factors, and import prices lead to an improvement in the inflation outlook. In light of these developments, recent forecast revisions suggest that inflation is likely to materialize slightly below the projections of the July Inflation Report by the end of the year. Accordingly, considering all the factors affecting inflation outlook, the Committee decided to reduce the policy rate by 325 basis points. At this point, the current monetary policy stance, to a large part, is considered to be consistent with the projected disinflation path. The Committee assesses that maintaining a sustained disinflation process is the key for achieving lower sovereign risk, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery. Keeping the disinflation process in track with the targeted path requires the continuation of a cautious monetary stance. In this respect, the extent of the monetary tightness will be determined by considering the indicators of the underlying inflation trend to ensure the continuation of the disinflation process. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability and financial stability objectives. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Pakistan,2019-09-16,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement September 16, 2019. At its meeting on 16th September 2019, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to leave the policy rate unchanged at 13.25 percent. The decision reflected the MPC's view that inflation outcomes have been largely as expected and inflation projections for FY20 have remained unchanged since the last MPC meeting on 16th July, 2019. The MPC also viewed that, based on available information, the current stance of monetary policy was appropriate to bring inflation down to the target range of percent over the next twenty-four months. In reaching this decision, the MPC considered key economic developments since the last MPC meeting, developments in the real, external and fiscal sectors, and the resulting outlook for monetary conditions and inflation. Key developments since the last MPC meeting. The MPC noted two key developments since the last MPC meeting. First the interbank foreign exchange market had adjusted relatively well to the introduction of the market-based exchange rate system. The initial volatility and associated uncertainty in the exchange market had subsided. Reflecting these improved sentiments and continued adjustment in the current account, the rupee had strengthened modestly against the US dollar since the last MPC, unlike its previous trend. Second on the external front, the US Fed, as anticipated, reduced its policy rate by 25 basis points (bps), followed by policy rate cuts by other major central banks around the world. This would help in lowering pressures on emerging markets' currencies and potentially increase financial inflows. Real sector. Recent economic activity indicators show gradual slowdown, in line with earlier expectations, and the MPC continued to expect average growth in FY20 of around. percent. The slowdown is more pronounced in domestic oriented industries such as automobiles and steel. This trend is also reflected in the Large-scale Manufacturing (LSM) index which contracted by. percent in FY19, somewhat more than earlier expectations. On the other hand, the MPC noted that the LSM index does not fully capture activity in some key industries such as high value-added textile products. Export volumes have been growing briskly even though the growth in export dollar proceeds has been less pronounced due to declining international unit prices. The MPC also noted that the SBP-IBA Consumer and Business Confidence Surveys conducted during Aug-Sep 2019 show modest improvement in the outlook for the economy. The outlook for agriculture and the services sectors was largely unchanged from the time of the previous MPC meeting. The agriculture sector growth is expected to improve considerably in FY20 over the last fiscal year while growth in services is expected to moderate gradually. In sum, the MPC continued to expect that economic activity would gradually turn around as business sentiment improves. External sector. The external sector continued to show significant improvement with sizeable reduction of around 32 percent (or. percent of GDP) in the current account deficit during FY19. The trend continued in the first month of FY20 as well. Specifically driven by an encouraging 1 percent growth in exports and contraction of 25. percent in imports, the current account deficit declined to US$ 579 million in July 2019 compared to US$ ,130 million in the same period last year. This together with the disbursement of program related inflows and activation of the Saudi oil facility, helped to build SBP's foreign exchange reserves, which as of 6th September 2019, stood at US$.46 billion. This is an increase of around US$.18 billion from the end- Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN June FY19 level. The improvements in the balance-of-payments and market sentiment allowed SBP to reduce its forward short liability position and hence increase its net international reserves. Fiscal Sector. Recent developments in the fiscal sector had been mixed. On the one hand, revised figures showed that fiscal policy had been considerably more expansionary in FY19 than earlier expected with primary deficit of. percent of GDP and an overall fiscal deficit of. percent of GDP. On the other hand, tax revenues (net of refunds) had grown considerably in July and August of FY20 which suggested that the economic slowdown may not be as pronounced as may have been feared. The MPC noted that fiscal prudence and meeting the program targets is essential to sustaining the improvement in macroeconomic stability. Monetary and inflation outlook. On cumulative basis, private sector credit (PSC) contracted by. percent in Jul-Aug FY20 showing the results of previous monetary tightening. The MPC noted that inflation developments were broadly similar between the new and the old base CPI: inflation had gradually risen over the previous months and remained high in both year-on-year and month-on-month terms. Core inflation had also risen in recent months. These developments were in line with the SBP's earlier projections and reflected the pass-through of earlier exchange rate depreciation, adjustment in utility prices, and an increase in food prices. In sum, the MPC expected inflation to average 1 12 percent in FY20. The MPC also considered risks to the inflation outlook. On the one hand, inflation could rise above the baseline projections in case of fiscal slippage or other adverse developments. On the other hand, inflation could begin to fall earlier than expected if oil prices decline, aggregate demand slows faster than expected, or the exchange rate appreciates. Page."
Mongolia,2019-09-17,"MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Keeping the policy rate unchanged Number: 2019/03 Effective date: 17 September 2019 The Monetary Policy Committee meeting was held on 17 September 2019, and it was decided to keep the Policy rate unchanged at 11 percent. As of August 2019, annual inflation has reached 8.9 percent nationwide. Prices of meat and vegetables, tuition fee of universities and other administrative prices rose in recent months, pushing supply-driven inflation up. The demand-driven core inflation remains stable. Inflation is expected to be around its target level, taking into consideration the current economic developments and factors shaping the inflation outlook. The strong economic growth in recent quarters was supported by mining activities that outperformed the expectations, stable expansions of corporate lending, private and public consumptions, and investments. Further escalation in trade tensions among large nations have amplified uncertainty in the external environment and policy makers are concerned over the risk of potential adverse impacts to the domestic market through the external demand, commodity prices and foreign direct investments. In this regard, it is imperative to conduct macroeconomic policy aiming to sustain the external and internal balance and to accumulate financial buffer in order to strengthen resilience at all levels of the economic sectors. The Monetary Policy Committee decided to keep the policy rate unchanged this time, considering the current macroeconomic outlook, its prospects, and main driving factors, as well as uncertainties and risks in the domestic and external environment. The decision is consistent with the Bank of Mongolia's objective to keep inflation rate around the target rate, to support economic growth without inflationary pressures and to ensure macroeconomic and financial stability in the medium term. Extracts of the meeting minutes will be released in two weeks on the Bank of Mongolia's website. MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE."
Brazil,2019-09-18,"In its 225th meeting, the Copom unanimously decided to lower the Selic rate to 5.50% p.a. The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario:. Data on economic activity since the previous Copom meeting suggest resumption of the process of economic recovery. Copom's baseline scenario assumes that this recovery will occur at a gradual pace. Regarding the global outlook, the provision of additional monetary stimulus in major economies, in a context of economic slowdown and below-target inflation, has been able to generate a relatively favorable environment for emerging economies. The outlook remains uncertain, however, and risks of a more pronounced slowdown in global growth persist. The Committee judges that various measures of underlying inflation are running at comfortable levels. This includes the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy. Inflation expectations for 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 collected by the Focus survey are around 3.5%, 3.8%, 3.75%, and 3.5%, respectively; and. The Copom's inflation projections in the scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the Focus survey stand around 3.3% for 2019 and 3.6% for 2020. This scenario assumes a path for the Selic rate that ends 2019 at 5.00% p.a. and remains at that level until the end of 2020. It also assumes a path for the exchange rate that ends 2019 at R$/US$ 3.90, and remains at that level until the end of 2020. In the scenario with a constant interest rate, at 6.00% p.a., and a constant exchange rate, at R$/US$ 4.05*, the projections for 2019 and 2020 stand around 3.4% and 3.6%, respectively. The hybrid scenario with a constant exchange rate and the interest rate path from the Focus survey yields projections around 3.4% for 2019 and 3.8% for 2020. The Committee emphasizes that risks around its baseline scenario remain in both directions. ;On the one hand, the high level of economic slack may continue to produce lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory. On the other hand, a possible frustration regarding the continuation of reforms and the perseverance in the necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy may affect risk premia and increase the path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy. Risk intensifies in case the outlook for emerging economies deteriorates. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the wide array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to lower the Selic rate to 5.50% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation and the associated balance of risks, and it is consistent with convergence of inflation to target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, which includes 2020. The Copom reiterates that economic conditions prescribe stimulative monetary policy, i.e., interest rates below the structural level. The Copom sees progress in the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy, but emphasizes that persevering in this process is essential for the reduction of its structural interest rate and for sustainable economic recovery. The Committee stresses that the perception of continuation of the reform agenda affects current expectations and macroeconomic projections. In particular, the Committee judges that concrete progress in this agenda is fundamental for the consolidation of the benign scenario for prospective inflation. In the Copom's assessment, the evolution of the baseline scenario and of the balance of risks prescribes adjusting the degree of monetary stimulus, lowering the Selic rate by 0.50 percentage point. The Committee deems that the consolidation of the benign scenario for prospective inflation should permit additional adjustment of the degree of stimulus. The Copom reiterates that communicating this assessment does not constrain its next decision, and emphasizes that the next steps in the conduct of monetary policy will continue to depend on the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, and on inflation projections and expectations. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Roberto Oliveira Campos Neto (Governor). Bruno Serra Fernandes. Carlos Viana de Carvalho. Carolina de Assis Barros. Fernanda Feitosa Nechio. Joao Manoel Pinho de Mello. Mauricio Costa de Moura. Otavio Ribeiro Damaso, and Paulo Srgio Neves de Souza. *Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average R$/US$ exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the Friday prior to the Copom meeting."
United States,2019-09-18,"EDT September 18, 2019 Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in July indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate. Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Although household spending has been rising at a strong pace, business fixed investment and exports have weakened. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. In light of the implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflation pressures, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 1-3/4 to 2 percent. This action supports the Committee's view that sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective are the most likely outcomes, but uncertainties about this outlook remain. As the Committee contemplates the future path of the target range for the federal funds rate, it will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. EDT September 18, 2019 - 2 - Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H Powell. Chair. John C Williams. Vice Chair; Michelle W Bowman; Lael Brainard; Richard H Clarida; Charles L Evans; and Randal K Quarles. Voting against the action were James Bullard, who preferred at this meeting to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent; and Esther L George and Eric S Rosengren, who preferred to maintain the target range at 2 percent to 2-1/4 percent."
South Africa,2019-09-19,"South African Reserve Bank PRESS STATEMENT EMBARGO DELIVERY 19 September 2019 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the July meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), economic indicators confirm weaker global economic conditions and low inflation. Central banks in advanced economies have provided more monetary accommodation, helping to ease global financial conditions. Downside risks from escalating trade and geo-political tensions remain pronounced. In the second quarter of this year. South Africa's GDP rebounded from the contraction experienced in the first quarter, but economic activity levels still remain weak. Monthly inflation has been around the mid-point of the inflation target range, as food and services inflation remains subdued. The year-on-year inflation rate, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas, was 4.3% in August (up from 4.0% in July). Goods price inflation in August was 3.9% (up from 3.4% in July), while services price inflation remained at 4.7%. Food price inflation rose to 3.9% (up from 3.4%), due to rising cereal and bread MPC Statement September 19th, 2019 Page 1. Food price inflation rose to 3.9% (up from 3.4%), due to rising cereal and bread MPC Statement September 19th, 2019 Page 1 prices. The Bank's measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity, rose slightly to 4.3%. Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods decreased to 4.9% in July (compared to 5.8% in June). The medium-term inflation outlook is largely unchanged. The inflation forecast generated by the SARB's Quarterly Projection Model (QPM) is for headline inflation to average 4.2% in 2019 (down from 4.4%). The projection for 2020 is unchanged at 5.1%, and for 2021 slightly up to 4.7% (from 4.6%). Headline CPI inflation is expected to peak at 5.3% in the first quarter of 2020 and settle at 4.5% in the last quarter of 2021. The forecast for core inflation is lower at 4.3% in 2019 (down from 4.4%), is unchanged at 4.7% in 2020 and is slightly higher at 4.6% in 2021 (up from 4.5%). Electricity, food and fuel price inflation continue to shape the near and medium-term trajectory of headline inflation. Fuel price inflation is expected to average 2.4% in 2019 and to peak at 11.8% in the first quarter of 2020. While food price inflation has generally surprised on the downside, it is expected to peak at about 6.0% in the third quarter of 2020. Electricity prices came out higher than expected in August, at 11.8%, but remain in line with the forecast. Inflation expectations have continued to moderate gradually. According to the Bureau for Economic Research (BER) third quarter survey, expectations for headline inflation are down slightly for 2019 to 4.6% (from 4.8%). Expectations for 2020 remain unchanged at 5.0% and eased from 5.2% to 5.1% for 2021, reaching the lowest levels since 2007. Five-year-ahead inflation expectations also declined to 5.0% (from 5.1%). MPC Statement September 19th, 2019 Page 2. MPC Statement September 19th, 2019 Page 2 The inflation expectations of market analysts in the September 2019 Reuters Econometer survey have been revised lower to 4.3% (from 4.4%) for 2019 and remain unchanged at 4.9% and 4.8% in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Market based expectations implicit in the break-even inflation rate (the yield differential between conventional and inflation-linked bonds) have remained stable since the previous MPC. Five-year break-even rates are currently about 4.6% and ten-year break-even rates at 5.4%. Global GDP is expected to slow to 3.2% in 2019 and rise to around 3.5% in 2020. While global growth remains resilient, recent indicators on trade and manufacturing have deteriorated and a range of downside risks to growth remain. Growth in world trade volumes has continued to decline, with trade tensions weighing on market confidence and lowering investment. Other downside risks include geo-political developments, further oil price shocks, and high levels of corporate and sovereign debt. Across most countries, there is limited policy space to respond to shocks. Inflation outcomes and inflation expectations in most advanced economies remain below targeted levels. Barring significant shocks, monetary policy in major advanced economies will remain accommodative over the medium term. However, market expectations of further accommodation appear high, creating ongoing risk of market volatility should these not materialise. Since the July MPC, the rand has depreciated by 4.6% against the US dollar, and by 3.0% against the euro. The implied starting point for the rand is R14.88 against the US dollar, compared with R14.40 at the time of the previous meeting. At these levels, the QPM assesses the rand to remain slightly undervalued. While the rand has benefited MPC Statement September 19th, 2019 Page 3. While the rand has benefited MPC Statement September 19th, 2019 Page 3 from improvements in global sentiment, investors remain concerned about domestic growth prospects and fiscal risks. GDP rebounded to 3.1% in the second quarter, following a decline of 3.1% in the first quarter. The sharp quarterly rebound was caused by stronger output in nearly all sectors, including investment and government consumption spending. However, longer term weakness in most sectors remains a serious concern. Based on recent short term economic indicators for the mining and manufacturing sectors, the third quarter GDP outcome is expected to be muted. The Absa Purchasing Managers' Index came out at 45.7 points in August (from 46.3), and the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index fell to 21 points (from 28). The SARB's composite leading business cycle indicator also continued to trend lower, although the coincident indicator remains positive. The forecast of GDP growth for 2019 remains unchanged at 0.6%. The forecasts for 2020 and 2021 have decreased to 1.5% (from 1.8%) and 1.8% (from 2.0%), respectively, due to revisions to global growth and domestic potential growth. The MPC assesses the risks to the growth forecast to be balanced in the near term, but remains concerned about medium term growth and weak employment prospects. Escalation in global trade tensions, further domestic supply constraints and/or sustained higher oil prices could generate headwinds to growth. Public sector financing needs remain high, exerting pressure on the currency and pushing local bond yields higher relative to country peers. Implementation of prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms that lower costs, and raise investment and potential growth, remains urgent. MPC Statement September 19th, 2019 Page 4. MPC Statement September 19th, 2019 Page 4 The overall risks to the inflation outlook are assessed to be largely balanced. Demand side pressures remain subdued and food, wages and rental prices are expected to increase at moderate rates. In the absence of shocks, relative exchange rate stability is expected to continue. Some upside risks to the inflation outlook remain, in particular from fuel, electricity and water prices. The MPC welcomes the sustained moderation in inflation outcomes and the fall in inflation expectations of about one percent since 2016. The Committee would like to see inflation expectations also anchored closer to the mid-point of the inflation target range on a sustained basis. Against this backdrop, the MPC unanimously decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 6.5% per annum. Monetary policy actions will continue to focus on anchoring inflation expectations near the mid-point of the inflation target range in the interest of balanced and sustainable growth. In this persistently uncertain environment, future policy decisions will continue to be highly data-dependent, sensitive to the assessment of the balance of risks to the outlook, and will seek to look-through temporary price shocks. The implied path of policy rates over the forecast period generated by the Quarterly Projection Model indicated no changes to the repo rate. This remains a broad policy guide which could change in either direction from meeting to meeting in response to new developments and changing data and risks.

Nigeria,2019-09-20,"CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO. 126 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING OF THURSDAY 19th AND FRIDAY 20th SEPTEMBER 2019 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on the 19th and 20th of September 2019, in the light of softening global growth and weaker- than-anticipated domestic output recovery. The Committee evaluated developments in the global and domestic economies and examined the outlook for the rest of the year. It noted the build- up of vulnerabilities in major Advanced Economies and its spill-over to the Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs). Nine out of the eleven (11) members of the Committee were present at the meeting. Global Economic Developments Output growth across major advanced economies remained subdued, confronted by legacy headwinds, including the subsisting trade war between the US and China, regional hostilities in the Middle-East, rising debt levels, growing uncertainties around BREXIT and increasing political tensions between the US and Iran, including fragilities in the financial markets. In the EMDEs, output growth remained broadly mixed with some economies performing stronger than others. Consequently, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) revised its projected global growth forecast to 32 per cent in 2019 from 36 per cent. Price developments continued to soften across the major advanced and EMDEs as aggregate demand continually weaken, resulting in softening monetary policy by major central banks to address downward trending prices and to strengthen aggregate demand. Domestic Economic Developments Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 194 per cent in the second quarter of 2019, compared with 210 and 150 per cent in the preceding and corresponding quarters, respectively. This mediocre growth, we believe, is consistent with global trends of dampening output growth and was driven mainly by the oil sector, which grew by 515 per cent while the non-oil sector grew by 164 per cent. At 577 and 580 index points, the Manufacturing and Non- Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Indices (PMI) grew moderately for the 30th and 29th consecutive months, respectively, in September 2019. Staff projections indicate that real GDP in Q3 and Q4 2019 would average 211 and 234 per cent, respectively, driven primarily by the non-oil sector. This optimism in growth prospects is anchored on the new momentum of rising credit to the private sector. However the headwinds to the growth prospects 2 remain high unemployment, rising public debt and heightening insecurity across the country. The Committee noted the continued moderation in headline inflation (year-on-year) to 1102 per cent in August 2019 from 1108 per cent in July 2019, driven by decline in the food and core components to 1317 and 868 per cent in August 2019 from 1339 and 880 per cent in July 2019, respectively. The development in the food and core components of inflation was partly due to improved agricultural production in the current harvest season, supported by the Bank's sustained intervention in the agricultural sector as well as the continued stability in the foreign exchange market. The Committee, however, noted the upward pressure imposed on prices due to rising insecurity in the food producing areas of the country, increased liquidity injection from FAAC disbursements and late budget cycles. It also highlighted the imperative to address the economy's infrastructural deficits, such as power supply, upgrade of transport and production infrastructure as a means of reducing cost-push inflation. The Committee observed that broad money supply (M3) grew by 565 per cent in August 2019, compared with the level at end- December 2018, annualized to 848 per cent, but remaining below the 2019 indicative benchmark of 1608 per cent. The growth was largely driven by the increase in Net Domestic Credit (NDC), which grew by 2436 per cent in August 2019 from the level at end- December 2018. The growth in NDC was accounted for by the 3 significant increase in credit to Government, which grew by 9433 per cent while credit to the private sector grew by 936 per cent in August 2019. The Committee urged the Management of the Bank to explore new initiatives to further improve lending to the private sector, while calling on Government to adopt other ways of funding its operations outside the banking sector. In the review period, money market rates oscillated within the standing facilities corridor due to prevailing liquidity conditions in the banking system. The monthly weighted average Inter-bank Call and Open Buyback (OBB) rates increased to 800 and 1337 per cent in August 2019 from 652 and 1101 per cent in July 2019, respectively. The Committee observed the continued bearish trend in the equities market, while noting the increased activity in the sovereign bonds market, reflecting global trends and investor preference for fixed income securities. In the light of this development, the All- Share Index (ASI) declined by 1162 per cent to 27,,77900 index points on September 13, 2019, from 31,,43050 index points at end- December 2018. Market Capitalization (MC), however, grew by 1537 per cent to N1362 trillion on September 13, 2019, from N1172 trillion at end-December 2018. This increase in market capitalisation was attributed to the listing of 275 billion ordinary shares by Airtel Africa in July 2019. The MPC noted the improved performance and resilience of the banking sector, evidenced by the continued moderation in the ratio of Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) from 112 to 94 per cent in 4 May and August 2019, respectively. While noting that this was still above the prudential benchmark of 50 per cent, the Committee called on the Management of the Bank to drive this ratio below the prudential benchmark. Outlook The persistence of policy uncertainties, financial vulnerabilities and rising geo-political tensions continued to cloud the medium-term outlook. This is evidenced by the sustained weakening of global growth across regions, amplified by the persisting trade tensions between the US and its major trading partners, rising corporate and public debt levels. On the domestic economy, output growth in 2019 is expected to peak at 21 per cent (IMF), 22 per cent (World Bank) and 227 per cent (CBN). These forecasts remain underpinned by expectations of favourable oil prices which would lead to higher external reserves, stable exchange rate, moderate inflationary pressure as government increases capital expenditure, including enhanced flow of credit to the private sector to stimulate investment, sustained CBN interventions in the real sector, effective implementation of the Economic Recovery Growth Plan (ERGP), build-up of fiscal buffers, as well as improved security in the country. Committee's Considerations The Committee noted the decline in output growth in the second quarter of 2019, partly attributable to the delay in implementation of the 2019 budget. It however, observed that this was an improvement over the corresponding quarter of 2018. In addition, it noted the broad slowdown across key economies and the response of major central banks to revise their policy rates downwards. On price developments, the Committee commended the progressive moderation in consumer prices and urged the Bank to sustain its intervention in the real sector of the economy to reduce the output gap. The MPC noted the improvements in the financial soundness indicators and urged the Management of the Bank to sustain its regulatory surveillance to ensure continued financial system stability. The Committee, particularly noted the growth in the size of industry loans from N154 trillion in June to N1623 trillion in September 2019. On the recent directives to deposit money banks to increase their Loan-to-Deposit Ratio (LDR), the Committee underscored the need to grow consumer, mortgage and corporate credit to drive aggregate demand and ensure a reduction in unemployment and increase in output growth. Consequently the Committee urged the Management of the Bank to fast-track the development of the credit scoring system, to 6 promote increased intermediation. In addition, the Committee commended the introduction of the Global Standing Instruction (GSI) initiative aimed at de-risking credit in the industry by committing bank customers to repay their loans to banks. The MPC further noted the increased supply of micro credit to key Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and efforts through the Nigeria Incentive-Based Risk Sharing System for Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL) Microfinance Bank to extend the reach of its credit facilities across the country. The MPC however, observed that the growth in credit to the private sector remained significantly low, relative to the absorptive capacity of the economy. The MPC further underscored the linkage between high unemployment and heightened insecurity, emphasizing the critical need for urgent steps towards more jobs and wealth creation in the country. As an interim solution, the Committee called on Government at all levels to ratchet up public works programmes aimed at easing the threat of rising unemployment in the country. This the Committee argued, would be achieved through efficiency in public spending. The MPC also noted the Government's current drive to increase Value Added Tax (VAT), adding that this will improve fiscal revenue to support expenditure and reduce the budget deficit as well as Government borrowing when implemented. The Committee, however, noted that this was too little to close the gap in Government finances. Consequently the MPC called on the Government to, as a matter of urgency, adopt 7 what it termed a BIG BANG approach towards building fiscal buffers by purposefully freeing-up redundant public assets through an efficient, effective and transperent privatization process. This would raise significant revenue for Government and resuscitate the redundant assets to generate employment and contribute effectively to national economic growth. The MPC noted the unstable oil prices, its implications on accretion to external reserves and its persistent call on the Government to build fiscal buffers. Consequently the Committee called on the National Assembly to exercise restraint from increasing the oil price budget benchmark to avoid budgetary overruns at the implementation stage of the budget. Projections from the oil futures market, indicate that oil prices will remain tight around the budget oil price benchmark in the medium term. The Committee's Decision In its considerations regarding the policy options to adopt, the MPC as usual, felt compelled to review the options of whether to tighten, hold or loosen. The Committee noted the positive moderation in inflation, though slowly from 1108 per cent in July to 1102 per cent in August 2019. Given that this was still above the target range of 6-9 per cent, and considering the pressure on reserve accretion caused by the relatively weak crude oil price, the MPC felt the imperative to tighten. On the contrary, the Committee was of the view that doing so in the midst of a fragile growth outlook would increase the cost 8 of credit, and further contract investment and constrain output growth. On loosening, the Committee felt that this would result in increased system liquidity and hence, heighten inflationary tendencies in the economy. In particular, the MPC was of the view that loosening would drive growth in consumer credit but without a corresponding adjustment in real sector output. The Committee was also convinced that increased liquidity and interest rate moderation would result in exchange rate pressures as money supply rises. As regards the option to hold, the MPC opined that the option requires a clear understanding of the quantum and timing of liquidity injections into the economy, before deciding on possible adjustments to the stance of monetary policy. The Committee was also of the opinion that retaining the current position of policy offers pathways to appraising the effects of the suit of heterodox monetary policy to encourage credit delivery to the real sector, especially in the light of the subsisting implementation of the Loan- to-Deposit Ratio policy. In view of the foregoing, the Committee decided by a unanimous vote to retain the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) at 135 per cent and to hold all other policy parameters constant. In summary, the MPC voted to: I Retain the MPR at 135 per cent; II. Retain the asymmetric corridor of +200/-500 basis points around the MPR; III. Retain the CRR at 225 per cent; and IV. Retain the Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent. Thank you. Godwin I Emefiele Governor. Central Bank of Nigeria 20th September, 2019 10."
Colombia,2019-09-23,"For the 16th consecutive month. For this decision, the Board mainly took into account the following information:=AF. As expected, headline inflation in August (3.75%) was slightly lower than in July (3.79%). Core inflation indicators continue to stand around 3.0%. Supply shocks are expected to begin fading by the end of 2019, and inflation is expected to resume its convergence to the target, as reflected by market expectations. The new information of economic activity led the Central Bank's technical staff to revise its growth forecast upwards for 2019, from 3.0%. 3.2%.=AFThe spare capacity of the economy is expected to decline gradually over the policy horizon. The prospects for global growth continue moderating.=AFThe Fed and the European Central Bank cut their benchmark reference rates and injected new liquidity to their economies.=AF. The projection of the current account deficit for 2019 continues to stand above 4.0% of GDP, and will continue to be financed largely by foreign direct investment.=AF. Based on this information, the Board considered the following factors for its decision. The temporary deviations of inflation from the target and the prospect that they may continue reducing. The magnitude of the spare capacity of the economy and the pace at which it may reduce. The effects of changing external conditions on the Colombian economy. The Board will continue to carefully monitor inflation and the forecasts for economic activity, as well as the performance of the balance of payments and the international context.

Hungary,2019-09-24,"At its meeting on 24 September 2019, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 25 September 2019:. The Magyar Nemzeti Bank's (MNB) single anchor is inflation, its primary objective is to achieve and maintain price stability. Therefore, in assessing the outlook, the Monetary Council pays more attention to the measures of underlying inflation capturing persistent trends. In August 2019, inflation, core inflation and core inflation excluding indirect tax effects stood at 3.1 percent, 3.7 percent and 3.2 percent, respectively. In the summer months, the consumer price index was in line with the MNB's expectations. However, underlying inflation developments were significantly lower than expected. This was mainly attributable to the slowing price dynamics of industrial goods. A dichotomy remains between the factors determining likely developments in inflation. Buoyant domestic demand is boosting, while weakening external activity is increasingly restraining the pace of inflation. The significantly lower-than-expected core inflation excluding indirect tax effects and the effects of the slowdown in European economic activity indicate a strengthening in downside risks to the longer-term outlook for inflation. Due to the base effects of the fall in fuel prices last year, the consumer price index is likely to rise again until the end of 2019, and then to stabilise at the level of the 3 percent inflation target following a gradual decline. In the coming months, core inflation excluding indirect tax effects is expected to rise slightly, before decreasing to 3 percent along a lower than previously expected path, due to external disinflationary effects. The Hungarian economy grew by 4.9 percent in the second quarter of 2019, primarily driven by investment and consumption on the expenditure side, as well as market services, industry and construction on the production side. Labour demand remained strong, and the unemployment rate was close to its historically low level. Due to dynamic import growth, the trade surplus declined in recent quarters, primarily reflecting strong investment activity in the corporate sector. Economic growth is expected to slow in the coming quarters. Weakening economic activity in Europe is likely to have an increasingly strong effect on the development of Hungarian GDP as well. Consistent with the gradual deceleration in economic growth, the increase in wages is likely to slow. In parallel, the growth rate of consumption is also likely to slow down. Hungary's export growth may be more muted, reflecting the deterioration in the global and European demand outlook. Hungary's GDP is expected to grow by 4.5 percent in 2019 and by 3.3 percent in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Despite weakening external activity, the convergence of the Hungarian economy with the euro area is likely to continue in the coming years, with the maintenance of the at least 2 percentage-points growth rate surpluses. In addition to monetary policy, several government measures jointly strengthen Hungary's macroeconomic stability and reduce external vulnerability. Since its launch in June, nearly HUF 2,000 billion of Hungarian Government Security Plus has already been purchased. More than half of the purchases was registered as a new source of financing for the government sector. Based on the ratified 2020 Budget Act, the budget deficit-to-GDP ratio is likely to decline to 1 percent, with the maintenance of a significant amount of reserves. After 2019, fiscal policy will remain counter-cyclical in 2020 and, in line with the Convergence Programme, in 2021 as well. The Economy Protection Action Plan announced in May is expected to gradually improve the competitiveness of the domestic economy. As result of the deterioration of the global economic outlook and the muted inflationary processes, the external monetary policy environment has become looser again. After July, the Federal Reserve reduced its policy rate in September as well. At its latest policy meeting, the European Central Bank (ECB) decided to lower the deposit rate by 10 basis points and restart its asset purchase programme in an open-ended manner. According to the ECB's communication, policy rates are likely to remain at their present or lower levels until inflation rises close to the central bank target in a sustainable manner. According to global leading central banks' indications and analysts' expectations, a looser monetary policy environment will be persistently maintained, and additional loosening measures can be expected. Sentiment in international financial markets has been volatile since the Council's previous interest rate decision. Risk appetite was influenced by developments in international trade policies and the Brexit and measures taken by the global leading central banks. Oil prices have risen in the period since the Council's previous interest rate decision and geopolitical risks point to higher volatility in the oil market. To improve the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission, the Monetary Council launched its corporate bond purchasing programme with a total amount of HUF 300 billion on 1 July 2019. Under the programme, the MNB purchased corporate bonds in September for the first time, possibly to be followed by further purchases in the near future. The MNB will neutralise excess liquidity arising from bond purchases by using the preferential deposit facility bearing interest at the central bank base rate. The programme complements the Funding for Growth Scheme Fix launched at the beginning of 2019 to build a healthier lending structure. Under the scheme, participating credit institutions concluded loan contracts with domestic SMEs totalling nearly HUF 250 billion until the end of August. The Monetary Council left the base rate, the overnight collateralised lending rate and the one-week collateralised lending rate at 0.9 percent and the overnight deposit rate at -0.05 percent unchanged. In addition, in September, the Council raised the average amount of liquidity, to be crowded out for the fourth quarter, by HUF 100 billion from the previous HUF 200-400 billion band to at least HUF 300-500 billion and will take this into account in setting the stock of central bank swap instruments. The MNB changes the stock of the FX swap instrument in a flexible manner to ensure that the interest rate transmission changes in line with the decisions by the Monetary Council, and the volatility of interbank rates remains at low levels. In its decisions, the Monetary Council focuses on the maintenance of price stability. The monetary policy stance will continue to be accommodative, economic agents' financing costs will be favourable. A dichotomy remains between the factors determining likely developments in inflation. Buoyant domestic demand is boosting, while weakening external activity is increasingly restraining the pace of inflation. In the Monetary Council's assessment, previously symmetric risks to inflation became asymmetric in the last quarter. The downside inflation risks have strengthened further, reflecting the effects of the slowdown in European economic activity. Due to the measures taken by global leading central banks, the external monetary policy environment has become looser. The Council will assess the effects of these factors on the maintenance of price stability over the 5-8 quarter horizon of monetary policy. In its monetary policy decisions, the Monetary Council applies a cautious approach, relying mainly on the incoming data and the projections in the quarterly published Inflation Report. Future developments in the outlook for inflation will be a decisive factor in the necessity of further measures."
Czech Republic,2019-09-25,"At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank decided to keep interest rates unchanged. The two-week repo rate thus remains at 2%, the discount rate at 1% and the Lombard rate at 3%. Five members voted in favour of this decision, and two members voted for increasing rates by 25 basis points.. This decision is underpinned by the August macroeconomic forecast and by an assessment of information obtained since the current forecast was prepared. The current forecast expects inflation to stay above the 2% target but still within the tolerance band around the target for the rest of this year. It will start to decrease at the start of next year and will approach the target over the monetary policy horizon, i.e. in the second half of next year. Consistent with the forecast is a modest rise in domestic market interest rates in the second half of this year, followed by a decline next year. At its meeting today, the Bank Board assessed the risks to the August inflation forecast at the monetary policy horizon as being rather substantial in both directions and slightly inflationary overall. As regards the external assumptions of the forecast, the outlook for producer price inflation and GDP growth in the euro area for this year and the next has been lowered slightly. The outlook for euro area consumer price inflation is virtually unchanged. The 3M EURIBOR market outlook has shifted slightly to more negative levels over the longer horizon. The market outlook for the Brent crude oil price decreased in late August. Following a correction due to the attacks in Saudi Arabia, the market outlook returned roughly to the level assumed by the CNB's August forecast. The euro-dollar exchange rate has shifted to slightly weaker levels, but the euro is still expected to appreciate slightly. So far in Q3, domestic inflation has been very close to the upper boundary of the tolerance band around the target. It was slightly above the forecast, mainly because of higher core inflation. Faster-than-expected growth in food prices in August and a smaller decline in fuel prices in both July and August acted in the same direction. The forecast for administered prices materialised. In Q2, the Czech economy grew at the same pace as in the previous quarter, in line with the forecast. Some demand components deviated from the forecast. Net exports made a higher-than-expected contribution, owing to slightly stronger growth in goods and services exports and more moderate growth in total imports. Growth in real government consumption was also higher than forecasted. By contrast, gross capital formation was significantly below the forecast, mainly as a result of markedly weaker fixed investment growth. Additions to inventories were also slightly lower. Household consumption was broadly in line with the forecast. Recent economic data signal continued solid economic growth in 2019 Q3. This is suggested by the July retail sales figures and by still favourable construction data. Seasonally adjusted industrial production declined modestly year on year in July, but this was accompanied by growth in new orders in this sector. The unemployment rate stabilised in line with the projection. Growth in employment slowed more markedly than forecasted. The number of job vacancies remained high due to persisting strong demand for labour. Wage growth in market sectors slowed slightly in Q2, in line with the forecast. However, wages in market sectors continue to rise apace, primarily reflecting continued labour market tightness. Wages in non-market sectors are increasing even faster and their growth in Q2 exceeded the forecast. The koruna-euro exchange rate has been between CZK 25.50 and CZK 26 to the euro so far in Q3. Its average level of CZK 25.70 to the euro is 30 hellers weaker than the current forecast for Q3. The koruna continues to be strongly affected by global factors. Domestic money market interest rates are slightly below the forecast. To sum up the important facts about recent developments in the Czech economy, the economic growth forecast is broadly materialising, with prices and wages rising slightly faster and the domestic monetary conditions being slightly easier. The Bank Board assessed the risks to the current inflation forecast at the monetary policy horizon as being rather substantial in both directions and slightly inflationary overall. The weaker-than-forecasted koruna exchange rate, which may persist, is fostering higher inflation and interest rates. The inflationary effect of the exchange rate is being partly offset by a decrease in expected industrial producer price inflation in the euro area. In addition, the risk of a more pronounced slowdown of the external and, in turn, domestic economy still persists. The impacts of protectionist measures in global trade and a disorderly Brexit remain sources of uncertainty."
Georgia,2019-09-25,"25.09.2019 The National Bank of Georgia raises monetary policy rate by 0.5 percentage points to 7.5%. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) held an extraordinary meeting on September 25, 2019 and decided to raise the refinancing rate by 0.5 percentage points to 7.5 percent. At the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the National Bank of Georgia started tightening monetary policy aiming at neutralizing inflationary pressures stemming from the exchange rate depreciation. As stated in the committee's decision from September 4, policy tightening was expected to continue until the pressure on the exchange rate was eliminated. Moreover, in the same decision the Committee also referred to the possibility of holding an extraordinary session if necessary. Since the last committee meeting, the nominal effective exchange rate of the GEL has remained undervalued and inflationary expectations persist. Hence, at today's extraordinary meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee decided to increase the refinancing rate by 0.5 percentage points. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all means and instruments at its disposal to ensure the price stability. The data from the external sector reveal the positive dynamics. Specifically, the balance of trade in goods and services continued to improve in August, which, in addition to the tighter monetary policy stance, promotes the strengthening of the exchange rate through expectations channel and, as a result, should provide the desired dynamics of inflation over the medium term. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee is scheduled on October 23, 2019."
Thailand,2019-09-25,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 6/2019 Mr. Titanun Mallikamas. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 25 September 2019 as follows. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 150 percent. In deliberating their policy decision, the Committee assessed that the Thai economy would expand at a lower rate than previously assessed due to a decline in exports which affected domestic demand. Headline inflation was projected to be below the lower bound of the inflation target. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative. Financial stability risks had already been addressed to some extent, although there remained pockets of risks that warranted monitoring. The Committee viewed that accommodative monetary policy stance would contribute to the continuation of economic growth and should support the rise of headline inflation toward target. The Committee thus voted to maintain the policy rate. The Thai economy was expected to expand at a lower rate than previously assessed and below potential. Merchandise exports contracted more than the previous assessment due to the slowdown of trading partner economies and global trade, which were affected by intensifying trade tensions that could expand to other countries, as well as a prolonged downturn in the electronic cycle. Tourism would grow at a lower rate. Regarding domestic demand, private consumption was expected to slow down, despite supports from fiscal stimulus measures. This was due to declining household income and employment, particularly in export-related manufacturing sectors, elevated household debt as well as impacts from natural disasters. Private investment would expand at a lower rate than previously assessed. However the relocation of production base to Thailand and public-private partnership projects for infrastructure investment would support investment in the period ahead. Public expenditure would grow at a slower pace than previously estimated owing partly to delay in state-owned enterprise investment projects. The Committee would monitor external risks from intensifying trade tensions, the economic outlook of China and advanced economies that could affect domestic demand, as well as geopolitical risks. Furthermore the Committee would monitor policy implementation of the government and public expenditure, together with the progress of major infrastructure investment and its knock-on effects on private investment. The annual average of headline inflation in 2019 was projected to be below the lower bound of the inflation target due to lower-than-expected energy prices in tandem with global economic slowdown. In addition, core inflation was expected to moderate owing to subdued demand-pull inflationary pressures. The Committee viewed that structural changes contributed to more persistent inflation than in the past. Such changes included the expansion of e-commerce, rising price competition, and technological development which reduced costs of production. Nevertheless the Committee viewed that headline inflation was expected to increase toward the inflation target in 2020 in line with the outlook of economic expansion. Financial conditions over the previous period had been accommodative with ample liquidity in the financial system. Real interest rates remained at a low level. Government bond yields declined. These allowed financing by the private sector to continue expanding. However loans extended to both businesses and consumers would exhibit slower growth. With regard to exchange rates, the Committee expressed concerns over the baht appreciation against trading partner currencies, which might affect the economy to a larger degree amid heightened uncertainties pertaining to the external front. The Committee would, therefore, closely monitor developments of exchange rates and capital flows, and would consider implementing additional appropriate measures if necessary. Financial stability remained sound overall but there remained a need to monitor risks that might pose vulnerabilities to financial stability in the future. The Committee viewed that the implemented macroprudential measures had to some extent curbed accumulation of vulnerabilities in the financial system. However there remained a need to monitor search-for- yield behavior in the prolonged low interest rate environment that could lead to underpricing of risks, debt accumulation and debt serviceability of households and SMEs, growth in assets held by saving cooperatives and the interconnectedness among saving cooperatives, and leverage by large corporates that might underprice risks. The Committee viewed that microprudential and macroprudential measures should be appropriately combined to ensure financial stability. Looking ahead, the Committee would continue to closely monitor developments of economic growth, inflation, and financial stability, together with associated risks, especially impacts from trade tensions, in deliberating appropriate monetary policy going forward. The Committee would stand ready to use policy tools as appropriate. Nevertheless the Thai economy would continue to face structural problems, which would affect competitiveness and economic growth outlook. This should be firmly addressed by all related parties."
Egypt,2019-09-26,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release September 26, 2019 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation by 100 basis points to 1325 percent, 1425 percent, and 1375 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also cut by 100 basis points to 1375 percen. Annual headline and core inflation continued to decline to record 75 percent and 49 percent in August 2019, respectively, the lowest rates in more than six year. The decline continued to be supported by the containment of inflationary pressures as well as favorable base effects, as monthly inflation recorded 07 percent in August 2019 compared to 18 percent in August 201. Real GDP growth continued to increase slightly to record a preliminary estimate of 57 percent in 2019 Q2 and 56 percent in fiscal year 2018/19, the highest in eleven year. Meanwhile the unemployment rate continued to decline to record 75 percent in 2019 Q2, thereby narrowing by almost 6 percentage points from its peak in 2013 Q. Globally the expansion of economic activity continued to weaken, financial conditions eased, and trade tensions continued to weigh on the outloo. International oil prices remain subject to volatility due to potential supply-side factors that include geopolitical risk. As incoming data continued to confirm the moderation of underlying inflationary pressures, the MPC decided to cut key policy rates by 100 basis point. This remains consistent with achieving the inflation target of 9 percent (Â±3 percentage points) in 2020 Q4 and price stability over the medium ter. The path for future policy rates remains a function of inflation expectation. Accordingly the pace and magnitude of future policy rates adjustment will continue to be subject to confirmation that inflation expectations are anchored at target levels that are consistent with disinflation and price stability over the medium ter. The MPC closely monitors all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust its stance to preserve monetary stabilit.

Mexico,2019-09-26,"Banco de Mexico's Governing Board has decided to lower the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to 7.75%. Available information suggests that the moderation of world economic growth continued during the third quarter of the year. Likewise, the outlook for global growth has continued to be revised downwards, in an environment where headline and core inflation in the main advanced economies are below their central banks' targets. In this context, several central banks have loosened their monetary policy stances. In its September meeting, the US Federal Reserve cut the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points. The European Central Bank also implemented several monetary policy easing measures. During this period, episodes of volatility in financial markets have taken place, mainly associated with trade tensions between the United States and China, although they have recently diminished. The world economy also faces other political and geopolitical risks. Thus, the balance of risks for world economic activity remains biased to the downside. Domestic financial markets have reflected the effects of lower interest rates for all terms in the main advanced economies as well as episodes of volatility with exchange rate adjustments, although these have diminished over the last weeks. In this regard, interest rates on government securities for all terms have continued to decrease. Regarding the risks that may affect the performance of financial assets in Mexico, uncertainty persists with respect to the bilateral relationship between Mexico and the United States and to the credit rating outlook both for Pemex's debt and for Mexico's sovereign debt. The current environment continues to pose significant risks that could affect the country's macroeconomic conditions, its ability to grow, and the economy's price formation process. In this regard, it is particularly important that, in addition to a prudent and firm monetary policy, measures to foster an environment of confidence and certainty for investment and higher productivity are adopted, and that public finances are consolidated in a sustainable way. In this context, addressing the deterioration of both the sovereign's and Pemex's credit ratings as well as achieving both the fiscal targets for 2019 and the goals set in the 2020 Economic Package are necessary. Strengthening the rule of law, tackling corruption, and fighting insecurity are equally imperative. Although economic activity in the previous quarters and in July remained stagnant, it is expected to recover slightly over the rest of the year. Slack conditions in the economy during the early part of the quarter remained at levels similar to those of the previous one, with a persistent negative output gap. In an environment of significant uncertainty, the balance of risks for growth remains biased to the downside. Between July and the first fortnight of September, headline inflation fell from 3.78% to 2.99%, due mainly to a decline of the non-core component, which went from 3.64% to 0.57%, reflecting the lower increases of energy, agricultural and livestock product prices. Core inflation has remained persistent around 3.8%. As for inflation expectations from surveys, short-term expectations have followed the latest data, while longer term ones have remained relatively stable, although at levels above 3%. 1 As for upside inflation risks, core inflation may continue to show persistence and there is the possibility that the exchange rate comes under pressure stemming from external or domestic factors. Should the economy require an adjustment of the real exchange rate. Banco de Mexico will contribute to an orderly process, preventing second-round effects on the economy's price formation process. Additional risks are the threat by the United States to impose tariffs on Mexican imports and the adoption of compensatory measures, although this risk has dissipated somewhat; that energy prices or agricultural and livestock product prices increase; weak public finances; and that global protectionist measures escalate. In addition, given the magnitude of various wage revisions, that cost-related pressures arise, insofar as such revisions exceed productivity gains. Regarding downside risks, the peso exchange rate may appreciate, possibly associated with a context of more accommodative monetary policy stances and lower interest rates worldwide, or in case greater certainty arises regarding the trade relation with the United States. Another downside risk is that the prices of certain goods included in the non-core subindex register lower rates of change. In addition, that slack conditions widen more than anticipated, which would impact the behavior of core inflation. Given the aforementioned, high uncertainty still persists regarding the risks that might affect inflation. In this context. Banco de Mexico will be alert to the possible materialization of inflation risks, both to the downside and to the upside. To guide its monetary policy actions. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board follows closely the development of inflation vis-Ã -vis its forecasted trajectory, taking into account the monetary policy stance and the time frame in which monetary policy operates. In this process, it uses available information on all inflation determinants as well as on medium- and long-term inflation expectations, including the balance of risks for such factors. Monetary policy must also act prudently if for any reason the uncertainty faced by the economy increases significantly. In this context, considering the reduction of headline inflation, the ample slack in the economy, and the recent behavior of external and domestic yield curves. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board decided by majority to lower the target for the overnight interbank interest rate to 7.75%, taking into account that under the current environment such level is consistent with the convergence of headline inflation to the central bank's target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates. Two members voted for lowering said target to 7.50%. In order to consolidate a low and stable inflation, in an environment in which price formation and slack conditions in the economy are subject to risks, the Governing Board will continue to follow closely all factors and elements of uncertainty that have an impact on inflation and its outlook, and will take the required actions based on incoming information so that the policy rate is consistent with the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to Banco de Mexico's target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board will maintain a prudent monetary policy stance and, under the current environment of uncertainty, will follow closely the potential pass-through of exchange rate fluctuations to prices. Mexico's monetary policy stance relative to that of the U.S.-in an external environment that it is still subject to risks- and the behavior of slack conditions and cost-related pressures in the economy. In the presence and possible persistence of factors that, by their nature, involve risks to both inflation and its expectations, monetary policy will be adjusted in a timely and firm manner to achieve the convergence of inflation to its 3% target and to strengthen the anchoring of medium- and long-term inflation expectations so that they attain such target."
Poland,2019-10-02,"Warsaw, 2 October 2019 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 1-2 October 2019 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: reference rate at 1.50%; lombard rate at 2.50%; deposit rate at 0.50%; rediscount rate at 1.75%; Incoming data suggest that global economic growth remains relatively low, with the global outlook deteriorating further. In the euro area, economic growth remains low against the backdrop of a downturn in industry. Still favourable situation in the service sector is the factor mitigating the scale of the slowdown. In the United States, economic conditions continue to be strong, even though economic indicators signal a weakening of activity in 2019 Q3. In China, incoming data point to further weakening of GDP growth. In September, global oil prices rose, yet remained below the level recorded a year ago. At the same time, inflation in many countries remains moderate. The European Central Bank significantly loosened its monetary policy, lowering the deposit rate further below zero and announcing the resumption of the asset purchase programme as well as relaxing the terms of long-term refinancing operations. The ECB also signalled that the interest rates are likely to stay at the present or lower level in the subsequent quarters. The Federal Reserve also loosened its monetary policy by cutting interest rates again. In Poland, economic conditions remain good. At the same time, incoming data point to a possible decrease in the economic growth rate in 2019 Q3, which is driven mainly by the economic downturn abroad. Rising consumption, fuelled by the increasing employment and wages, very strong consumer confidence and social benefit payments, exerts a stabilising influence on GDP growth. Investment in the economy also continues to rise. Inflation in September  according to GUS flash estimate  stood at 2.6% y/y. Higher price growth is primarily driven by a previous marked increase in food prices, while lower energy prices than a year ago, including fuel prices, have a curbing effect on price growth. At the same time, core inflation continues to run at moderate levels. In the Council's assessment, the outlook for economic conditions in Poland remains favourable, and GDP growth, despite the expected decline, will continue at a relatively high level in the coming years. However, uncertainty about the scale and persistence of the slowdown abroad and its impact on domestic economic activity has increased. Inflation  after a temporary rise in 2020 Q1  will stay close to the target in the monetary policy transmission horizon. The Council judges that the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability."
Romania,2019-10-03,"In its meeting of 3 October 2019, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided:. The annual CPI inflation rate went up to 4.1 percent in July from 3.8 percent in June, whereas in August it declined to 3.9 percent, in line with the forecast, remaining above the variation band of the target. The evolution owed mainly to the hike in tobacco product prices and, to a lower extent, to the upward path followed by fuel prices and core inflation, the impact of which was only partly counterbalanced by that of a slowdown in the annual growth rate of administered prices and volatile food prices. The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate (which excludes from the CPI inflation administered prices, volatile prices, and tobacco product and alcoholic beverage prices) continued to increase, at a relatively slower pace than anticipated, to reach 3.4 percent in August from 3.3 percent in June. The advance reflected the opposite influences stemming from the rise in some international agri-food prices and from the cut in the prices of some telephony services, overlapping significant demand-pull and wage cost-push inflationary pressures, as well as the elevated short-term inflation expectations. Average annual CPI inflation rate continued to decline from 4.1 percent in June to 4.0 percent in July and 3.9 percent in August; calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, the average annual inflation rate remained at 4.0 percent (the level recorded in June) July through August. Statistical data on economic growth in 2019 Q2 indicate a mild deceleration in real GDP to 4.4 percent from 5 percent in the previous quarter (annual changes). On the demand side, the contribution made by household consumption continued to be significant, albeit on a decrease, being marginally exceeded by that of gross fixed capital formation, whose annual dynamics surged (to 18 percent from 3.9 percent in Q1). Net exports had a smaller negative contribution to GDP dynamics amid a more pronounced slowdown in the annual growth rate of imports than in that of exports of goods and services, also visible in the relative slowing of the annual pace of increase of the negative balance on trade. However, the current account deficit saw a faster deepening against the same period of the previous year, as a result of the worsening of the primary and secondary income balances. The latest statistical data point to a further fast pace of increase of the activity in retail trade and services in July, a further strong uptrend in the dynamics of construction works, as well as a faster drop in industrial production, including manufacturing. The growth rate of credit to the private sector picked up slightly in the first two months of Q3, to 7.9 percent in July, from 7.1 percent in June, and then to 8 percent in August. Behind the advance stood both leu-denominated loans and the foreign currency component. The latter continued to record faster dynamics ascribable solely to corporate credit. Against this background, the share of domestic currency loans in total private sector credit increased only marginally, to 66.7 percent in August. The latest assessments indicate the outlook for the annual inflation rate to remain above the variation band of the target until the end of this year, on a trajectory slightly below that shown in the latest medium-term forecast published in the August 2019 Inflation Report. Domestically, the future fiscal and income policy stance represents a source of heightened uncertainties and risks to the inflation outlook, also amid the 2019-2020 election calendar, while the widening of the current account deficit is increasingly becoming a matter of concern. On the external front, rising uncertainties stem from the increasingly obvious weakening of the euro area and global economies, as well as from the growing risks to their outlook, in the context of the trade war and Brexit. Particularly relevant are the ECB's and the Federal Reserve's decisions on monetary policy easing, as well as the stance of central banks in the region. In today's meeting, based on the currently available data and assessments, the NBR Board decided to keep unchanged the monetary policy rate at 2.50 percent per annum, while maintaining strict control over money market liquidity. Moreover, the NBR Board decided to leave unchanged the deposit facility rate at 1.50 percent per annum and the lending (Lombard) facility rate at 3.50 percent per annum. Furthermore, the central bank maintained the current levels of the minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board's decisions aim to ensure and preserve price stability over the medium term in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth and amid safeguarding financial stability. The NBR Board underlines that the balanced macroeconomic policy mix and the implementation of structural reforms designed to foster the growth potential over the long term are of the essence in preserving a stable macroeconomic framework and strengthening the capacity of the Romanian economy to withstand potential adverse developments. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR's website on 10 October 2019, at 3:00 p.m. In line with the announced calendar, the next monetary policy meeting of the NBR Board is scheduled for 6 November 2019, when a new quarterly Inflation Report is to be examined."
India,2019-10-04,"Fourth Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2019-20 Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) Reserve Bank of India On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (October 4, 2019) decided to: reduce the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 25 basis points to 5.15 per cent from 5.40 per cent with immediate effect. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF stands reduced to 4.90 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate to 5.40 per cent. The MPC also decided to continue with an accommodative stance as long as it is necessary to revive growth, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Assessment Global Economy 2. Since the MPC's last meeting in August 2019, global economic activity has weakened further. Heightened uncertainty emanating from trade and geo-political tensions continues to cloud the outlook. Among advanced economies (AEs), the slowdown in the US economy in Q2:2019 appears to have extended into Q3:2019, weighed down by softer industrial production. The Institute for Supply Management's index for September indicates that manufacturing slipped further into contraction to touch its lowest reading in a decade; hiring by the private sector also slowed down. In the Euro area too, incoming data suggest that activity may have moderated further in Q3, with retail sales declining and manufacturing PMI remaining in contraction for the eighth consecutive month in September. The UK economy decelerated in Q2; the contraction in industrial production and soft retail sales in July suggest that the loss of speed has continued into Q3 as well. In Japan, the loss of momentum in Q2 spilled over into Q3, albeit cushioned by a fiscal stimulus and frontloaded consumer spending ahead of a planned sales tax hike.2 3. The macroeconomic performance of major emerging market economies (EMEs) was weighed down by a deteriorating global environment in Q3. The Chinese economy appears to have slowed down in Q3 as well, with both retail sales and industrial production growth weakening in July-August and exports contracting in August; attention is now focussed on the efficacy of fiscal and monetary policy stimuli in averting a sharper deceleration. In Russia, economic activity ticked up in Q2, though still subdued consumer sentiment and weak industrial production may restrain momentum, going forward. Economic activity in both South Africa and Brazil rebounded in Q2, emerging out of contraction in the previous quarter; however, this nascent recovery faces both domestic and external headwinds. Crude oil prices were pulled down by softer demand, amidst adequate supplies in early August. Prices remained range bound until mid-September when supply disruptions on account of an escalating geo-political conflict resulted in a spike which has abated faster than expected. Gold prices remained elevated on safe haven demand. Central banks became more accommodative with inflation remaining below targets across major AEs and EMEs. Global financial markets have remained unsettled since the MPC's early August meeting with bouts of volatility unleashed by protectionist policies and worsening global growth prospects. In the US, the equity market's August losses were recouped by early September  investor sentiment was buoyed by signs of an easing in US-China trade tensions. Stock markets in EMEs fell, as the strong US dollar led to capital outflows, though they recovered partially in September. Bond yields in the US continued easing till August on growth worries, before a slight uptick was triggered in early September by better than expected US retail sales data and hopes of conciliatory trade negotiations between the US and China. In the Euro area, bond yields sank further into negative territory, propelled by the cut in the deposit rate by the European Central Bank (ECB) to (-) 0.5 per cent and the reintroduction of quantitative easing. In EMEs, bond yields exhibited mixed movements, driven by country-specific factors. In currency markets, the US dollar strengthened against currencies of other AEs. EME currencies, which were trading with a depreciating bias in August, appreciated in early September on country-specific factors and a revival of global risk-on sentiment. Domestic Economy 6. On the domestic front, growth in gross domestic product (GDP) slumped to 5.0 per cent in Q1:2019-20, extending a sequential deceleration to the fifth consecutive quarter. Of its constituents, private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) slowed down to an 18- quarter low. Gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) improved marginally on a sequential basis but remained muted as in the preceding quarter. Government final consumption expenditure (GFCE) cushioned the overall loss of momentum to some extent. On the supply side, gross value added (GVA) growth decelerated to 4.9 per cent in Q1:2019-20, pulled down by manufacturing growth, moderating to 0.6 per cent. Agriculture and allied activities were lifted by higher production of wheat and oilseeds during the 2018- 19 rabi season. Growth in the services sector was stalled by construction activity. Turning to Q2:2019-20, the initial delay in the onset of the south-west monsoon rapidly caught up from July. By September 30, 2019, the cumulative all-India rainfall surpassed the long period average (LPA) by 10 per cent. The first advance estimates of3 major kharif crops for 2019-20 have placed production of foodgrains 0.8 per cent lower when compared with the last year's fourth advance estimates. Looking ahead at the rabi season, the live storage of water in major reservoirs was 115 per cent of the live storage of the corresponding period of the previous year on September 26, 2019 and 121 per cent of average storage level over the last ten years. Abundant rains in August and September have led to improved soil moisture conditions in most parts of the country, particularly central India, compared to the corresponding period of the last year. Overall, the prospects of agriculture have brightened considerably, positioning it favourably for regenerating employment and income, and the revival of domestic demand. Industrial activity, measured by the index of industrial production (IIP), weakened in July 2019 (y-o-y), weighed down mainly by moderation in manufacturing. In terms of uses, the production of capital goods and consumer durables contracted. Consumer non-durables, led by edible oils, and intermediate goods, mainly mild steel slabs, posted sustained expansion and have emerged as potential growth drivers. Infrastructure/construction sector activity turned around to register a growth of 2.1 per cent vis-Ã -vis (-)1.9 per cent in the previous month. The output of eight core industries contracted in August, pulled down by coal, electricity, crude oil and cement. Capacity utilisation (CU) in the manufacturing sector, measured by the OBICUS (order books, inventory and capacity utilisation survey) of the Reserve Bank, declined to 73.6 per cent in Q1:2019-20 from 76.1 per cent in the previous quarter. Manufacturing firms polled for the industrial outlook survey (IOS) expect capacity utilisation to moderate in Q2:2019-20. The Reserve Bank's business assessment index (BAI) fell in Q2:2019-20 due to a decline in new orders, contraction in production, lower capacity utilisation and fall in profit margins of the surveyed firms. The manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) for September 2019 was unchanged at its previous month's level; new orders and employment improved, albeit marginally, and new export orders declined. High frequency indicators suggest that services sector activity weakened in July- August. Indicators of rural demand, viz., tractor and motorcycles sales, contracted. Of underlying indicators of urban demand, passenger vehicle sales contracted in July-August, while domestic air passenger traffic accelerated in August. The sales of commercial vehicles, a key indicator for the transportation sector, contracted by double digits in July- August. Of the two indicators of construction activity, finished steel consumption decelerated sharply in August and cement production contracted. The services PMI moved into contraction in September 2019, dragged down mainly by a decline in new business inflows. Retail inflation, measured by y-o-y changes in the CPI, moved in a narrow range of 3.1- 3.2 per cent between June and August. While food inflation picked up, fuel prices moved into deflation. Inflation excluding food and fuel softened in August. Food inflation in August was elevated by a spike in the rate of increase in vegetables prices, a pick-up in pulses inflation and persistently high meat and fish inflation. On the other hand, softer increases in prices of eggs, oils and fats, non-alcoholic beverages and prepared meals, and deflation in prices of fruits and sugar cushioned the rise in overall food inflation.4 13. Deflation in the fuel group deepened in August largely due to the pass-through from a sharp decline in international prices of liquified petroleum gas (LPG). Subsidised kerosene prices, however, have been rising in a calibrated manner as oil marketing companies continued a gradual reduction in subsidies. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel increased in July, but its roots were largely confined to prices of personal care and effects  mainly bullion prices, and transport and communication, reflecting rise in prices of petrol and diesel. By contrast, there was moderation in August, which was spread across most of the sub-groups; however, gold prices spiked further on global uncertainties. The Reserve Bank's September 2019 round of inflation expectations survey indicates that households expect inflation to rise by 40 basis points over a 3-month ahead horizon and 20 basis points over a one-year ahead horizon, possibly responding adaptively to the rise in food prices in recent months. The Reserve Bank's consumer confidence survey shows weak consumer sentiment and tepid consumption demand, especially relating to non-essential items. Manufacturing firms see weakening of demand conditions in Q2:2019-20 and Q3 and expect their output prices to soften, going forward, as the cost of finance and salary outgoes remain muted. Overall liquidity remained surplus in August and September 2019 despite expansion of currency in circulation and forex operations by the Reserve Bank draining liquidity from the system. Net daily average absorption under the LAF amounted to 1,40,497 crore in August, essentially on account of spending by the government, which resulted in availment of ways and means advances (WMA) and intermittent overdraft facilities from the beginning of the month (till August 25, 2019). In September, with a steady build-up of cash balances, particularly with advance tax inflows around September 15, surplus liquidity moderated, and the Reserve Bank undertook daily net absorption of 1,22,392 crore in September. Reflecting easy liquidity conditions, the weighted average call rate (WACR) traded below the policy repo rate (on an average) by 8 basis points (bps) in August and by 6 bps in September. Monetary transmission has remained staggered and incomplete. As against the cumulative policy repo rate reduction of 110 bps during February-August 2019, the weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans of commercial banks declined by 29 bps. However, the WALR on outstanding rupee loans increased by 7 bps during the same period. Net exports had contributed to aggregate demand in Q1:2019-20 on account of a deeper contraction in imports relative to exports. In Q2, merchandise exports remained weak in July and August 2019, caused by lower shipments of engineering goods, petroleum products, gems and jewellery and cotton yarn. Imports contracted faster during the period mainly due to lower international crude oil prices downsizing the oil import bill and a large fall in the volume of gold imports. Non-oil non-gold imports were pulled down into contraction by coal, pearls and precious stones and transport equipment. These developments led to a narrowing of the trade deficit during July-August 2019. Higher net services receipts and private transfer receipts helped contain the current account deficit to 2.0 per cent of GDP in Q1:2019-20 from 2.3 per cent a year ago. On the financing side, net5 foreign direct investment rose to US$ 17.7 billion in April-July 2019 from US$ 11.4 billion a year ago. Net foreign portfolio investment (excluding the voluntary retention route) was of the order of US$ 3.3 billion during April-September 2019 as against net outflow of US$ 11.5 billion in the same period of last year. Net disbursals of external commercial borrowings rose to US$ 8.2 billion during April-August 2019 as against net repayments of US$ 0.2 billion during the same period a year ago. India's foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 434.6 billion on October 1, 2019  an increase of US$ 21.7 billion over end-March 2019. Outlook 19. In the third bi-monthly resolution of August 2019. CPI inflation was projected at 3.1 per cent for Q2:2019-20, 3.5-3.7 per cent for H2:2019-20 and 3.6 per cent for Q1: 2020-21 with risks evenly balanced. The actual inflation outcomes for Q2 so far (July-August) at 3.2 per cent have been broadly in line with these projections. Going forward, several factors are likely to shape the inflation trajectory. First, the outlook for food inflation has improved considerably since the August bi-monthly policy. Kharif production is estimated at close to last year's level, auguring well for the overall food supply situation. Vegetable prices may remain elevated in the immediate months but are likely to moderate as winter supplies enter the market. Prices of pulses are expected to remain contained by adequate buffer stocks. Secondly, forward looking surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank point to weak demand conditions persisting, with indications of softening of output prices in Q3:2019-20. Accordingly, price pressures in CPI excluding food and fuel are likely to be muted. Thirdly, crude oil prices may remain volatile in the near-term; while global demand is slowing down, the persisting geo-political uncertainties pose some upside risks to the inflation outlook. Fourthly, three-month and one-year ahead inflation expectations of households polled by the Reserve Bank have risen in the current round reflecting near-term price pressures. Finally, financial markets remain volatile with currencies of several emerging market economies trading with a depreciating bias in the recent period. Taking into consideration these factors and the impact of recent policy rate cuts, the CPI inflation projection is revised slightly upwards to 3.4 per cent for Q2:2019-20, while projections are retained at 3.5-3.7 per cent for H2:2019-20 and 3.6 per cent for Q1:2020-21, with risks evenly balanced (Chart 1). Turning to the growth outlook, real GDP growth for 2019-20 in the August policy was projected at 6.9 per cent  in the range of 5.8-6.6 per cent for H1:2019-20 and 7.3-7.5 per cent for H2  with risks somewhat tilted to the downside; GDP growth for Q1:2020-21 was projected at 7.4 per cent. GDP growth for Q1:2019-20 was significantly lower than projected. Various high frequency indicators suggest that domestic demand conditions have remained weak. The business expectations index of the Reserve Bank's industrial outlook survey shows muted expansion in demand conditions in Q3. Export prospects have been impacted by slowing global growth and continuing trade tensions. On the positive side, however, the impact of monetary policy easing since February 2019 is gradually expected to feed into the real economy and boost demand. Several measures announced by the Government over the last two months are expected to revive sentiment and spur domestic demand, especially private consumption. Taking into consideration the above factors, real GDP growth for 2019-20 is revised downwards from 6.9 per cent in the August policy to 6.16 per cent  5.3 per cent in Q2:2019-20 and in the range of 6.6-7.2 per cent for H2:2019-20  with risks evenly balanced; GDP growth for Q1:2020-21 is also revised downwards to 7.2 per cent (Chart 2). The MPC notes that the negative output gap has widened further. While the recent measures announced by the government are likely to help strengthen private consumption and spur private investment activity, the continuing slowdown warrants intensified efforts to restore the growth momentum. With inflation expected to remain below target in the remaining period of 2019-20 and Q1:2020-21, there is policy space to address these growth concerns by reinvigorating domestic demand within the flexible inflation targeting mandate. It is in this context that the MPC decided to continue with an accommodative stance as long as it is necessary to revive growth, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target. All members of the MPC voted to reduce the policy repo rate and to continue with the accommodative stance of monetary policy. Dr.Chetan Ghate. Dr.Pami Dua. Dr.Michael Debabrata Patra. Shri Bibhu Prasad Kanungo and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted to reduce the repo rate by 25 basis points. Dr.Ravindra H. Dholakia voted to reduce the repo rate by 40 basis points. The minutes of the MPC's meeting will be published by October 18, 2019. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during December 3-5, 2019.

Israel,2019-10-07,"The inflation environment remains low. Inflation in the past 12 months was 0.6 percent while inflation excluding energy and fruit and vegetables has been stable in the range of 0.9-1.1 percent since the beginning of the year. Most of the negative contribution to the CPI in recent months came from the components that are traditionally volatile, but also from the cumulative appreciation of the shekel since the beginning of the year. Annual inflation is expected to decline in the coming months, and to return to near the lower bound of the target range within a year. Long-term expectations are anchored near the midpoint of the target range. Since the previousinterest rate decision, the shekel has strengthened by 1.2 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, and by 9.1 percent since the beginning of the year. The appreciation is making it more difficult to return inflation to the target range. The risks to the global economy have increased, mainly due to the trade war and uncertainty regarding Brexit. Growth forecasts were revised downward, and the major central banks adopted monetary accommodation measures. Economic activity continues to grow at near its potential rate, and so far it seems that it is not being adversely affected by the negative global sentiment or by the political situation in Israel. However, uncertainty regarding the measures that the government will take to reduce the deficit increases the uncertainty regarding developmentsin the domestic economy. Most of the indicators show that in the third quarter, the economy continued to grow at near the potential rate. Exports are increasing solidly, but the Business Tendency Survey indicates some increase in the rate of companies reporting serious constraints in export profitability, following a decline in this rate during 2018. The labor market remains tight. The Monetary Committee's assessment is that in view of the inflation environment in Israel, the monetary policies of major central banks, the slowing in the global economy, and the continued appreciation of the shekel, it will be necessary to leave the interest rateat its current level for a prolonged period, or to reduce it in order to support a process at the end of which inflation will stabilize around the midpoint ofthe target range, and so that the economy will continue to grow strongly. Moreover, if necessary, the Committee will take additional steps to make monetary policy even more accommodative. The Bank of Israel continues to monitor developments in inflation, the real economy, fiscal policy, the financial markets, and the global economy, and will act to attain the monetary policy targets in accordance with such developments. For the file of figures accompanying this notice, click here. After about a year in which it hovered in the lower portion of the target range, annual inflation has, forthe past three months, been below the target. The CPI reading for August increased by 0.2 percent, slightly above expectations, after the readings for June and July were markedly lower than expected. Inflation in the past 12 months was 0.6 percent (Figure 1 in the attached file of figures), while inflation excluding energy and fruit and vegetables has been stable in the range of 0.9-1.1 percent since the beginning of the year (Figure 2). Most of the negative contribution to the CPI in recent months came from the components that are traditionally volatile: the fruit and vegetables component, the effect of which is felt in the inflation of nontradable goods prices, and the travel abroadand vehicle maintenance components, which were apparently impacted by the cumulative appreciation of the shekel since the beginning of the year and the decline in energy prices, and led to a continued decline in the prices of tradable goods. In view of the decline in inflation and the appreciation ofthe shekel, short-term inflation expectations also declined, and one-year expectations are around the lower bound of the target range (Figure 4). The Research Department's staff forecast indicates that inflation in 2020 is expected to be 1.2 percent, 0.4 percentage points lower than the previous forecast. In the capital markets, there was an increase in forward expectations up to three years, and long-term expectations are anchored near the midpoint of the target range. (Figure 5). The shekel has strengthened by 1.2 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate since the previous interest rate decision, and by 9.1 percent since the beginning of the year (Figure 6). Economic activity continues to grow at near its potential rate (Figure 11), and so far it seems that activity in Israel is not being adverselyaffected by the negative global sentiment or by the political situation in Israel. However, uncertainty regarding the measures to be taken by the government to reduce the deficit increases the risk regarding developments in the domestic economy. Most indicators, such as the Composite State of the Economy Index (Figure 12), the sentiment index calculated from the Business Tendency Survey, initial data from the Companies Survey (Figure 13), and the Consumer Confidence Index, show that the economy continued to grow in the third quarter at near its potential rate. In contrast, the Purchasing Managers Index declined significantly in August, and indicates a contraction of activity. The most recent data on goods exports were relatively good, in view of improved exports of electronic components, and the trend of growth in services exports continues. However, the Business Tendency Surveyshows some increase in the rate of companies reporting serious constraints in export profitability, following a decline in this rate during 2018 (Figure 15). The labor market remains tight: the latest data on the employment, participation, and unemployment rates show they increased slightly, and wage increases arecontinuing, led by the business sector, although the rate of increase has slowed somewhat. The job vacancy rate has been declining moderately for several months, but remains high. A breakdown of the unemployed by how long they have been waiting to return to employment, and the decline in the number of people who are involuntarily employed part-time also indicate a tight labor market. According to the Research Department's staff forecast. GDP is expected to grow by 3.1 percent in 2019, similar to the previous forecast. GDP growth in 2020 is expected to be 3.0 percent, similar to the long-term rate. Growth in 2020 is expected to be about 0.5 percentage points lower than in the previous forecast, as a result of the decline in export forecasts due to the expected slowdown in world trade, and due to the assumption that the government will need to take certain measures to lower the deficit. Equityindices in Israel increased since the previous interest rate decision, in parallel to global markets. Medium- and long-term government bond yields increased following the previous interest rate decision, but then declined again, similar to developments in US yields (Figure 7). Yield spreads between corporate bonds of the nonfinancial business sector in Israel and comparable government bonds continued the downward trend that began at the start of the year. In recent months, home prices increased moderately: The increase in the past year is approximately 0.7 percent, while the rate of increase in rents remained stable around 2.5 percent. The number of purchases among all purchaser types grew, led by first home buyers. Mortgage volume continued to expand, as a result of a combination of an increase in the number of transactions and an increase in the average mortgage level, and mortgage interest rates continued to decline. The risks to the global economy have increased, mainly in view of the trade war and uncertainty regarding Brexit. The OECD revised its 2019 and 2020 global growth and world trade forecasts downward (Figure 20). The deterioration in world trade worsened (Figure 21). In the financial markets, equity price increased (Figure 26), in view of the deepening monetary accommodation in various markets (Figure 25). In the US, the Federal Reserve againlowered the federal funds rate by 0.25 percentage points, and assessments in the markets are that the interest rate may continue to decline this year. Inflation increased slightly, but remains slightly below the target, and third quarter growth is expected to be moderate, in addition to the slowdown that was recorded in the second quarter. In Europe, there was a slowdown in growth, and industrial production continues to contract, weighing particularly on the manufacturing-intensive German economy. Inflation in the eurozone remained low, and the ECB loweredits interest rate, as expected, by 0.1 percentage points, and adopted additional significant accommodative measures. In Japan, second quarter growth declined in view ofthe weakness of exports and investments. Growth in China continued to moderate,and the ramifications of the trade war and the slowdown in the growth rate led the regime to continue its monetary accommodation measures. In mid-September, oil prices increased sharply following the attack on the Saudi oil installations, but then declined back to its third-quarter environment (Figure 24). The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on October 22, 2019. The next decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Monday. November 25, 2019."
Armenia,2019-10-09,"PRESS RELEASE 10.09.2019 In the September 10, 2019 meeting the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia decided to reduce the refinancing rate by 0.25 pp to 5.5%. There was 0.4% deflation in August of 2019 as opposed to 0.6% inflation registered in the same period of the previous year, which continued to be largely driven by a deeper seasonal decline in prices of agricultural products. As a result, the 12-month inflation rate further reduced, reaching 0.6% at the end of the month. Unlike headline inflation, core inflation has been relatively stable in recent months, fluctuating around 1.5%. In the external sector, trends of notable slowdown in economic growth, demand and inflation are observable amid increasing uncertainty over global economic outlook, and these trends are also evident in international commodity markets. Based on the aforementioned, the Board of the Central Bank estimates that it generally anticipates deflationary pressures from the external sector. The Board states that economic activity in Armenia remained high in the third quarter, which is mainly driven by the growths in services and manufacturing in terms of supply and the growth of private consumption in terms of demand. In the meantime, the fiscal policy is further having a contractionary impact on aggregate demand. Given the deflationary environment in the external sector and the stance of the fiscal policy, and in view of further preference to a gradual recovery of inflation, the Board of the Central Bank finds it reasonable to add to the monetary stimulus by reducing the refinancing rate, as well as is considering measures for directing financial resources to the development of the economy's potential. The Board also finds that in view of anticipated macroeconomic developments, keeping the policy expansionary in the near future will be needed in order to fulfil the mid-term inflation target. As a result, the expectation is that the inflation will run below the target in the coming months but will stabilize around the target in the medium run. At present, downside risks to inflation deviating from the projection path are prevailing and mainly depend on the developments in the external sector. In the event such risks emerge, the Central Bank will respond adequately while maintaining price stability in the medium run. Detailed information that underlies the decision on setting the interest rate will be available in Inflation Report (Monetary Policy Program. Q3, 2019) to be published by September 24, 2019. â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦.â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦ Press Service of the Central Bank of Armenia."
Peru,2019-10-10,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT OCTOBER 2019 BCRP MAINTAINS REFERENCE RATE AT 2.50% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to maintain the reference rate at 2.50 percent, in light of the following developments: Year-on-year inflation and inflation trend indicators as of September were within the BCRP's target range. One-year ahead expected inflation as of September was 2.21 percent. Primary industries' weak performance during the first half of the year began to reverse in July, and non-primary industries continue to recover. The recovery of public investment in September, after a lower performance in January-August, is expected to continue in the remainder of the year. Global growth risks persist as trade tensions continue. Year-on-year inflation is expected to remain within the target range and converge towards 2.0 percent over the forecast horizon, with a downside bias due to the possibility of a lower-than- expected increase in domestic demand. The BCRP Board considers that it is appropriate to maintain its expansionary monetary policy and pays close attention to new information on inflation and its determinants in considering future changes in this stance. According to recent inflation and economic activity indicators: Monthly inflation was 0.01 percent in September, bringing down year-on-year inflation to 1.85 percent, from 2.04 percent in August. With monthly inflation excluding food and energy at 0.01 percent in September, the year-on-year figure decreased to 2.16 percent, from 2.20 percent in August. Business conditions expectations improved slightly in September. Activity indicators point to a more gradual closure of the output gap. The Board also decided to maintain the interest rates on BCRP off-auction credit and deposit operations in domestic currency with financial entities. Overnight deposits: 1.25 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 3.05 percent per year for financial entities' first 10 operations over the last 12 months; and the rate fixed by the BCRP Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations Committee for operations other than financial entities' first 10 operations over the last 12 months. Dollar swaps: a fee equal to a minimum annual effective cost of 3.05 percent. The BCRP Board's next monetary policy session will take place on November 7, 2019."
United States,2019-10-11,"EDT October 11, 2019 Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation Consistent with its January 2019 Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet Normalization, the Committee reaffirms its intention to implement monetary policy in a regime in which an ample supply of reserves ensures that control over the level of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of the Federal Reserve's administered rates, and in which active management of the supply of reserves is not required. To ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample, the Committee approved by notation vote completed on October 11, 2019 the following steps: â€¢ In light of recent and expected increases in the Federal Reserve's non-reserve liabilities, the Federal Reserve will purchase Treasury bills at least into the second quarter of next year in order to maintain over time ample reserve balances at or above the level that prevailed in early September 2019. â€¢ In addition, the Federal Reserve will conduct term and overnight repurchase agreement operations at least through January of next year to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample even during periods of sharp increases in non- reserve liabilities, and to mitigate the risk of money market pressures that could adversely affect policy implementation. These actions are purely technical measures to support the effective implementation of the FOMC's monetary policy, and do not represent a change in the stance of monetary policy. The Committee will continue to monitor money market developments as it assesses the level of reserves most consistent with efficient and effective policy implementation. The Committee stands ready to adjust the details of these plans as necessary to foster efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy. In connection with these plans, the Federal Open Market Committee voted unanimously to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: â€œEffective October 15, 2019, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 1-3/4 to 2 percent. In light of recent and expected increases in the Federal Reserve's non-reserve liabilities, the Committee directs the Desk to purchase Page 1 of 2 Treasury bills at least into the second quarter of next year to maintain over time ample reserve balances at or above the level that prevailed in early September 2019. The Committee also directs the Desk to conduct term and overnight repurchase agreement operations at least through January of next year to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample even during periods of sharp increases in non-reserve liabilities, and to mitigate the risk of money market pressures that could adversely affect policy implementation. In addition, the Committee directs the Desk to conduct overnight reverse repurchase operations (and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at an offering rate of 1.70 percent, in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for such operations and by a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day. The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities and to continue reinvesting all principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities received during each calendar month. Principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities up to $20 billion per month will continue to be reinvested in Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding; principal payments in excess of $20 billion per month will continue to be reinvested in agency mortgage-backed securities. Small deviations from these amounts for operational reasons are acceptable. The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.â€ More information about these plans may be found on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's website."
Armenia,2019-10-12,"PRESS RELEASE 10.12.2019 In the December 10, 2019 meeting the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia decided to leave the refinancing rate unchanged, at 5.5%. There was 1.1% inflation in November of 2019 compared to that of 1.0% registered in the same period of the previous year, and the 12-month inflation rate remained almost unaltered, reaching 1.0% at the end of the month. In the external sector, some reducing of economic uncertainties was observable, yet the slow pace of global economic growth has been persisting, reflecting both weak global demand and low inflationary environment in international commodity markets. The Board of the Central Bank estimates that no considerable pressures from the external sector on the inflation environment are expected. The Board admits that economic activity in Armenia in the third quarter exceeded the projected level, which will continue so during the fourth quarter, mainly thanks to the contribution by the services sector. Domestic demand remains strong as well, owing to increased private consumption, which continues to be sustained by the monetary policy's stimulative stance. At the same time, although the fiscal policy's impact on aggregate demand is estimated contractionary from the beginning of the year, the impact in the fourth quarter and throughout the next year is anticipated to be expansionary. Given the abovementioned actual and expected developments in the external and domestic economies, and in view of further preference to a gradual recovery of inflation, the Board of the Central Bank finds it reasonable to keep the monetary stimulus under current terms by leaving the refinancing rate unchanged. The Board also finds that in view of anticipated macroeconomic developments, keeping the policy stance still expansionary will be needed. As a result, the expectation is that the inflation will run below the target in the coming months but will gradually return to the target in the mid-term perspective. At present, risks to inflation deviating from the projection path are generally balanced; in the event such risks materialize, the Central Bank will respond adequately while maintaining price stability in the medium run. Detailed information that underlies the decision on setting the interest rate will be available in Inflation Report (Monetary Policy Program.

South Korea,2019-10-16,"Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points, from 1.50% to 1.25%. This press release is the English version of the Bank of Korea's policy statement. In the case of any inconsistency, the original version in Korean will prevail. The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points, from 1.50% to 1.25%. Based on currently available information the Board considers that the pace of global economic growth has continued to slow as trade has contracted. The global financial markets have shown high levels of volatility, affected mainly by the uncertainties concerning the US-China trade dispute and the sluggishness of economic indicators in major countries. Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and the global financial markets as likely to be affected by factors such as the degree of the spread of trade protectionism, the changes in the monetary policies of major countries, and geopolitical risks. The Board judges that the pace of domestic economic growth has remained slow, as consumption growth has weakened, while the adjustment in construction investment and the sluggishness in exports and facilities investment have continued. Employment conditions have partially improved, with the increase in the number of persons employed having risen. Going forward the Board expects domestic economic growth to fall below the July projection, owing chiefly to the continued US-China trade dispute and the heightened geopolitical risks. Consumer price inflation recorded a negative rate, in consequence mainly of the declines in the prices of petroleum products, agricultural, livestock and fisheries products, and public services. Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has been at the mid-0% range, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has fallen to the upper-1% level. Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will fall short of the path projected in July and fluctuate for some time at around the 0% level, and then run in the 1% range from next year. Core inflation will also gradually rise. In the domestic financial markets, long-term market interest rates and stock prices have risen and the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has fallen, with major price variables fluctuating considerably due to movements in the global financial markets. The rate of increase in household lending has continued to slow. Housing prices have remained steady overall but have risen in Seoul and its surrounding areas. Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As it is expected that domestic economic growth will be moderate and it is forecast that inflationary pressures on the demand side will remain at a low level, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance. In this process it will judge whether to adjust the degree of monetary policy accommodation, while observing any changes in macroeconomic and financial stability conditions and the effects of the two Base Rate cuts. It will also carefully monitor the US-China trade dispute, any changes in the economies and monetary policies of major countries, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks."
Hungary,2019-10-22,"At its meeting on 22 October 2019, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 23 October2019:. The Magyar Nemzeti Bank's (MNB) single anchor is inflation, its primary objective is to achieve and maintain price stability. Therefore, in assessing the outlook, the Monetary Council pays more attention to the measures of underlying inflation capturing persistent trends. In September 2019, inflation, core inflation and core inflation excluding indirect tax effects stood at 2.8 percent, 3.9 percent and 3.4 percent, respectively. Declines in the price indices for unprocessed food and fuel contributed to the moderation in headline inflation. The increase in the core inflation measures in September reflected the rise in telecommunication sector prices, which exceeded regional dynamics. A dichotomy remains between the factors determining likely developments in inflation. Buoyant domestic demand is boosting, while weakening external activity is increasingly restraining the pace of inflation. The significantly lower-than-expected core inflation excluding indirect tax effects over the summer months and the effects of the slowdown in European economic activity indicate a strengthening in downside risks to the longer-term outlook for inflation. Due to the base effects of the fall in fuel prices last year, the consumer price index is likely to rise again until the end of 2019, and then to stabilise at the level of the 3 percent inflation target following a gradual decline. In the coming months, core inflation excluding indirect tax effects is expected to rise slightly, before decreasing to 3 percent along a lower than previously expected path, due to external disinflationary effects. The Hungarian economy grew by 4.9 percent in the second quarter of 2019. Over the summer months, production growth in industry and construction slowed, while the volume of retail sales continued to expand dynamically. Labour demand remained strong, and the unemployment rate was close to its historically low level. Due to dynamic import growth, the trade surplus has declined in recent quarters, primarily reflecting strong investment activity in the corporate sector. Economic growth is expected to slow in the coming quarters. Weakening economic activity in Europe is likely to have an increasingly strong effect on developments in Hungarian GDP as well. Consistent with the gradual deceleration in economic growth, the increase in wages is likely to slow. In parallel, the growth rate of consumption is also likely to slow down. Hungary's export growth may be more muted, reflecting the deterioration in the global and European demand outlook. Hungary's GDP is expected to grow by 4.5 percent in 2019 and by 3.3 percent in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Despite weakening external activity, the convergence of the Hungarian economy with the euro area is likely to continue in the coming years, with the maintenance of the at least 2 percentage-points growth rate surpluses. In addition to monetary policy, several government measures jointly strengthen Hungary's macroeconomic stability and reduce external vulnerability. The amount of the Hungarian Government Security Plus purchased continued to be considerable, more than half of which was registered as a new source of financing for the government sector. The significant part of sales was related to the capital, while the level of purchases was lower in the rest of the country. Based on the ratified 2020 Budget Act, the budget deficit-to-GDP ratio is likely to decline from 1.7-1.8 percent in the current year to 1 percent, with the maintenance of a significant amount of reserves. After 2019, fiscal policy will remain counter-cyclical in 2020 and, in line with the Convergence Programme, in 2021 as well. The Economy Protection Action Plan announced in May is expected to gradually improve the competitiveness of the domestic economy. As result of the deterioration in the global economic outlook and subdued inflation, the external monetary policy environment has become looser again. The Federal Reserve has reduced its policy rate twice in this year. At its policy meeting in September, the European Central Bank announced a comprehensive package of easing measures. According to global leading central banks' indications and analysts' expectations, a looser monetary policy environment will be persistently maintained, and additional loosening measures can be expected. Sentiment in international financial markets has been volatile since the Council's previous policy decision. Risk appetite was influenced by developments in international trade policies, the intensification of concerns related to the slowdown in global growth, the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and the events related to Brexit. The oil prices have decreased over the past month. To improve the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission, the Monetary Council launched its corporate bond purchasing programme with a total amount of HUF 300 billion on 1 July 2019. Under the programme, the MNB started purchases in September, accompanied by great interest. The MNB will neutralise excess liquidity arising from bond purchases by using the preferential deposit facility bearing interest at the central bank base rate. The programme complements the Funding for Growth Scheme Fix launched at the beginning of 2019 to build a healthier lending structure. Under the scheme, participating credit institutions concluded loan contracts with domestic SMEs totalling more than HUF 270 billion until the end of September. The Monetary Council left the base rate, the overnight collateralised lending rate and the one-week collateralised lending rate at 0.9 percent and the overnight deposit rate at -0.05 percent unchanged. In addition, in September the Council set the average amount of liquidity to be crowded out for the fourth quarter at least at HUF 300-500 billion and will take this into account in setting the stock of central bank swap instruments. The MNB changes the stock of the FX swap instrument in a flexible manner to ensure that the interest rate transmission changes in line with the decisions by the Monetary Council and the volatility of interbank rates remains at low levels. In its decisions, the Monetary Council focuses on the maintenance of price stability. The monetary policy stance will continue to be accommodative, economic agents' financing costs will be favourable. A dichotomy remains between the factors determining likely developments in inflation. Buoyant domestic demand is boosting, while weakening external activity is increasingly restraining the pace of inflation. In the Monetary Council's assessment, previously symmetric risks to inflation became asymmetric in the last quarter. The downside inflation risks have strengthened further, reflecting the effects of the slowdown in European economic activity. Due to the measures taken by global leading central banks, the external monetary policy environment has become looser. The Council will assess the effects of these factors on the maintenance of price stability over the 5-8 quarter horizon of monetary policy. In its monetary policy decisions, the Monetary Council applies a cautious approach, relying mainly on the incoming data and the projections in the quarterly published Inflation Report. Future developments in the outlook for inflation will be a decisive factor in the necessity of further measures."
Chile,2019-10-23,"Monetary Policy Meeting  October 2019 In its monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to lower the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points, to 1.75%. The decision was adopted unanimously by all five Board members. The external scenario is in line with forecasts in the September Monetary Policy Report, and continues to be marked by major tension spots, a deterioration of manufacturing, investment, and global trade. Accordingly, the growth outlook has been adjusted downward in several economies. The monetary authorities have further increased the stimuli while the markets, with ups and downs, show bounded increases in long-term interest rates and stock indexes. The copper price posted virtually no change since the last monetary policy meeting, and the oil price, despite transient supply disruptions, tended to decline. Third-quarter data at hand are in line with the last Report's baseline scenario. The expansion of activity outperformed that of the first half, while investment remained dynamic. On the consumption side, growth in the wage mass has been flat, consumer confidence has deteriorated and consumer goods imports have declined. Financial conditions are still favorable. CPI inflation is still near 2% annually, with persistently weak services in the CPIEFE. The various inflation expectations indicators show no significant variation. The complex developments that have occurred in the country in recent days will have an impact on the evolution of the economy. Short-run activity will be affected by the partial breakdown of the country and damaged infrastructure. Towards the medium term, most important will be the magnitude and timeline of reconstruction works, the impact on confidence and the effects of the course of action announced by the Government. So far this scenario has had bounded effects on the local financial markets, including a depreciation of the peso and corrections in the fixed-income market. The stock exchange showed a somewhat sharper decline. The December Report will bring a thorough more [INF*RES*AS] informed analysis of the impact of the recent events on the economy, the inflation outlook and the response of monetary policy. The Board's decision assumes that for inflation to converge to the target a further monetary boost is needed, which will be assessed in the light of the macroeconomic scenario, especially after the events of recent days. With that, the Board reiterates its will to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the two-year horizon. The minutes from this monetary policy meeting will be published at 8:30 hours of Monday 11 November 2019. The next monetary policy meeting will be held on Friday 6 December, and the statement thereof will be published at 18:00 hours the same day. The Spanish original prevails."
Georgia,2019-10-23,"23.10.2019 The National Bank Of Georgia Raises The Monetary Policy Rate By 1 Percentage Point To 8.5% The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on October 23, 2019, and decided to raise the refinancing rate by 1 percentage point to 8.5 percent. In September, the annual inflation rate stood at 6.4 percent. Along with one-off factors, the overshooting the target was caused by the increased pass-through from the nominal exchange rate depreciation to inflation in recent periods. According to the forecast, other things equal, the inflation will remain above the target during this year, will start to decline from March 2020 and stay close to the target in the medium term. From September. The NBG started to tighten monetary policy aiming at neutralizing inflationary pressures stemming from the exchange rate depreciation. Over the last two meetings, the Monetary Policy Committee raised the policy rate in total by one percentage point. As it was noted in the statements, the policy tightening would continue until the pressure from exchange rate receded. The GEL nominal effective exchange rate remains undervalued, exerting upward pressure on inflation. This inflationary pressure is only partially offset by the aggregate demand-side factors as the economic activity is enhanced compared to previous periods, based on preliminary estimates. Hence, on today's meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee decided to increase the refinancing rate by one percentage point. The future decisions of the committee will depend upon the speed of neutralization of exchange rate pressure stemming from the exchange rate depreciation. According to the preliminary estimates, in the third quarter, the current account balance continued to improve. The persistence of positive dynamics in the external sector, together with the monetary policy tightening, should support the strengthening of the exchange rate through expectations channel, and, hence, provide favorable inflation dynamics in the medium term. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all means and instruments at its disposal to ensure price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee is scheduled on December 11, 2019."
Euroarea,2019-10-24,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Vice-President. Mr Dombrovskis, and the incoming President. Ms Lagarde. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We expect them to remain at their present or lower levels until we have seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within our projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics. As decided at our last meeting in September, we will restart net purchases under our asset purchase programme (APP) at a monthly pace of â‚¬20 billion as from 1 November. We expect them to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of our policy rates, and to end shortly before we start raising the key ECB interest rates. We also intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. The Governing Council reiterated the need for a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy for a prolonged period of time to support underlying inflation pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term. In particular, the Governing Council's forward guidance will ensure that financial conditions adjust in accordance with changes to the inflation outlook. In any case, the Governing Council continues to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry. The incoming data since the last Governing Council meeting in early September confirm our previous assessment of a protracted weakness in euro area growth dynamics, the persistence of prominent downside risks and muted inflation pressures. At the same time, ongoing employment growth and increasing wages continue to underpin the resilience of the euro area economy. The comprehensive package of policy measures that we decided at our last meeting provides substantial monetary stimulus, which will contribute to a further easing in borrowing conditions for firms and households. This will support the euro area expansion, the ongoing build-up of domestic price pressures and, thus, the sustained convergence of inflation to our medium-term inflation aim. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro area real GDP growth was confirmed at 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2019, following a rise of 0.4% in the previous quarter. Incoming economic data and survey information continue to point to moderate but positive growth in the second half of this year. This slowdown in growth mainly reflects the ongoing weakness of international trade in an environment of persistent global uncertainties, which continue to weigh on the euro area manufacturing sector and are dampening investment growth. At the same time, the services and construction sectors remain resilient, despite some moderation. The euro area expansion is supported by favourable financing conditions, further employment gains in conjunction with rising wages, the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance and the ongoing  albeit somewhat slower  growth in global activity. The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain on the downside. In particular, these risks pertain to the prolonged presence of uncertainties, related to geopolitical factors, rising protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets. Euro area annual HICP inflation decreased from 1.0% in August 2019 to 0.8% in September, reflecting lower food and energy price inflation. On the basis of current futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to decline slightly further before rising again at the end of the year. Measures of underlying inflation remained generally muted and indicators of inflation expectations stand at low levels. While labour cost pressures have strengthened amid tighter labour markets, the weaker growth momentum is delaying their pass-through to inflation. Over the medium term inflation is expected to increase, supported by our monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion and robust wage growth. Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth increased to 5.7% in August 2019, after 5.1% in July. Sustained rates of broad money growth reflect ongoing bank credit creation for the private sector and low opportunity costs of holding M3. The narrow monetary aggregate M1 continues to be the main contributor to broad money growth on the components side. The growth of loans to firms and households remained solid, benefiting from the continued pass-through of our accommodative monetary policy stance to bank lending rates. The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations increased to 4.3% in August, from 4.0% in July 2019, while the annual growth rate of loans to households remained unchanged at 3.4% in August. The euro area bank lending survey for the third quarter of 2019 indicates a slight easing of credit standards and increasing demand for loans to households, while demand for loans to firms remained broadly stable. Our accommodative monetary policy stance will help to safeguard favourable bank lending conditions and will continue to support access to financing, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is still necessary for the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute more decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential, supporting aggregate demand at the current juncture and reducing vulnerabilities. The implementation of structural policies in euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up to boost euro area productivity and growth potential, reduce structural unemployment and increase resilience. The 2019 country-specific recommendations should serve as the relevant signpost. Regarding fiscal policies, the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance is currently providing some support to economic activity. In view of the weakening economic outlook and the continued prominence of downside risks, governments with fiscal space should act in an effective and timely manner. In countries where public debt is high, governments need to pursue prudent policies and meet structural balance targets, which will create the conditions for automatic stabilisers to operate freely. All countries should intensify their efforts to achieve a more growth-friendly composition of public finances. Likewise, the transparent and consistent implementation of the European Union's fiscal and economic governance framework over time and across countries remains essential to bolster the resilience of the euro area economy. Improving the functioning of Economic and Monetary Union remains a priority. The Governing Council welcomes the ongoing work and urges further specific and decisive steps to complete the banking union and the capital markets union."
Turkiye,2019-10-24,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to reduce the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) from 16.50 percent to 14 percent. Recently obtained data indicate that moderate recovery in economic activity continues. Leading indicators point to continuing improvement in the sectoral diffusion of economic activity. However, investment demand remains weak. While industrial production has been highly volatile due to working day effects associated with official holidays in recent months, its underlying trend has maintained a moderate pace of growth. While favorable effects of improved competitiveness prevail, weakening global economic outlook tempers external demand. Looking forward, net exports are expected to contribute to economic growth, although to a lesser extent, and the gradual recovery is likely to continue with the help of the disinflation trend and improvement in financial conditions. Current account balance, which has recently recorded significant improvement due to the composition of growth, is expected to maintain a moderate course. Recently, advanced economy central banks have been pursuing more expansionary policies as weakening global economic activity and downside risks to inflation became more evident. While these developments support the demand for emerging market assets and the risk appetite, rising protectionism and uncertainty regarding global economic policies are closely monitored in terms of their impact on both capital flows and international trade. Inflation outlook continued to improve. In addition to the stable course of the Turkish lira, improvement in inflation expectations and mild domestic demand conditions supported the disinflation in core indicators. In September, with the contribution of strong base effects, consumer inflation displayed a significant fall particularly in core goods and food inflation. Domestic demand conditions and the level of monetary tightness continue to support disinflation. Underlying trend indicators, supply side factors, and import prices lead to an improvement in the inflation outlook. In light of these developments, recent forecast revisions suggest that inflation is likely to materialize notably below the projections of the July Inflation Report by the end of the year. Accordingly, considering all the factors affecting inflation outlook, the Committee decided to reduce the policy rate by 250 basis points. At this point, the current monetary policy stance, to a large part, is considered to be consistent with the projected disinflation path. The Committee assesses that maintaining a sustained disinflation process is the key for achieving lower sovereign risk, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery. Keeping the disinflation process in track with the targeted path requires the continuation of a cautious monetary stance. In this respect, the extent of the monetary tightness will be determined by considering the indicators of the underlying inflation trend to ensure the continuation of the disinflation process. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability and financial stability objectives. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Ukraine,2019-10-24,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has taken a decision to cut its key policy rate to 15.5% per annum effective 25 October 2019. The NBU continues the cycle of monetary policy easing as inflation is firmly declining towards the target of 5%. In September 2019, consumer inflation declined to 7.5% yoy, below the forecast published in the July Inflation Report. Inflation continued to slow in October according to the NBU's preliminary estimates. The steady disinflation has been driven by a gradual easing of underlying pressures on prices, reflected in a rapid slowdown of core inflation. The tight monetary policy was one of the reasons behind the strengthening of the hryvnia and improvement in inflation expectations. That has a major impact on prices, surpassing the effect of factors that push prices upwards, particularly the effect of the sustained consumer demand. Inflation will continue to decline towards the target of 5%. Same as before, inflation is projected to decline to 6.3% as of the end of 2019, meet the target range in early 2020, and reach the medium-term target of 5% at the end of 2020. By the end of 2019, core inflation will slow more than expected, while fuel prices will remain below last year's levels due to the stronger hryvnia. At the same time, supply of vegetables affected by unfavorable weather will put an upward pressure on prices. Therefore, considering the offsetting effect of these factors, the NBU maintains its inflation forecast for the end of 2019. Same as this year, the tight monetary stance will continue to push inflation lower, to 5% in 20202021. Despite the gradual reduction in the key policy rate, its real value will remain high on the back of improved inflation expectations. Relatively high real interest rates will keep hryvnia financial instruments attractive for investors and thus influence the exchange rate of the national currency. As a result, the more favorable FX market will neutralize the pressure domestic demand has on prices, which will be somewhat higher according to the new forecast. Other factors behind the gradual disinflation will include:. a prudent fiscal policyrelatively low energy prices on the global marketsan increase in food supply driven by higher productivity in agriculture.In 20192021, the economy of Ukraine will grow steadily, at 3.5%4%. Compared to the July macroeconomic forecast, the NBU has revised its economic growth forecast upwards, to 3.5% in 2019 and 2020 and 4% in 2021. The revision was driven by the sustained domestic demand, higher productivity in agricultural production, and improved consumer sentiment. In the meantime, slower growth in the global economy and worsened terms of trade will weigh on economic growth in 2020. The 20192021 current account deficit will remain acceptable. Despite the stronger hryvnia, the current account deficit in 2019 will narrow to 2.9% of GDP, thanks to an improvement in the terms of trade and the rich grain harvest. In 20202021, the current account deficit will widen slightly, as a result of a decrease in natural gas transit and less favorable global commodity prices (lower iron ore prices and gradually rising energy prices). Further cooperation with the International Monetary Fund remains the basic assumption of the macroeconomic forecast. The current NBU forecast assumes the new IMF cooperation program will be approved by the end of 2019. This will allow Ukraine to attract other official financing, improve the conditions of access to the international capital markets, and support the interest of investors in Ukrainian assets. As a result, notwithstanding the large external debt repayments, the international reserves will range at around USD 2324 billion in 2019 and the following years, which is sufficient to cover three months of future imports. A delay in entering into a new cooperation agreement with the IMF, and increased threats to macrofinancial stability  mainly due to Ukrainian court rulings  pose the key risks to the said macroeconomic forecast, and in particular to inflation decreasing to its target in 2020. When materialized, these risks could deteriorate exchange rate and inflation expectations, and make it harder for Ukraine to access the international capital markets in order to repay a heavy debt load in the coming years. The following risks also remain important:. the complete halt of the transit of Russian gas through Ukraineintensified trade tensions and more turbulent global financial marketsan escalation of the military conflict and new trade restrictions introduced by Russia.A more rapid decline in underlying inflationary pressures than anticipated, coupled with no change in the balance of risks, have made it possible to ease monetary policy somewhat more quickly this year than envisaged in the previous macroeconomic forecast. As a result, the Board has cut the key policy rate by 1 pp, to 15.5%. The NBU's forecast scenario envisages that the key policy rate will be cut further, to 8% as of the end of 2021, provided that inflation steadily declines to its 5% target. As before, the largest decrease in the key policy rate is expected to take place in 2020, along with inflation returning to its target range and inflation expectations improving. If the above inflation risks, both internal and external, materialize, the key policy rate could decline to 8% more slowly. That said, the key policy rate could be cut, to 8%, much more quickly. These cuts will greatly depend on whether or not key internal reforms are sped up. These reforms are those that are envisaged in the memorandum of understanding signed by the Ukrainian government and the NBU, and the judicial reform required to establish the rule of law in Ukraine. The decision to cut the key policy rate to 15.5% was approved by NBU Board Decision No.797-D On the Key Policy Rate, dated 24 October 2019. A summary of the discussion by Monetary Policy Committee members that preceded this decision will be published on 4 November 2019. A new detailed macroeconomic forecast will be published in the central bank's Inflation Report on 31 October 2019. The next meeting of the NBU Board on monetary policy issues will be held on 12 December 2019 as scheduled."
Russia,2019-10-25,"On 25 October 2019, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to cut the key rate by 50 bp to 6.50% per annum. Inflation slowdown is overshooting the forecast. Inflation expectations continue to decrease. The Russian economy's growth rate still remains subdued. Risks of a substantial global economic slowdown persist. Disinflationary risks exceed pro-inflationary risks over the short-term horizon. In these circumstances, the Bank of Russia has lowered its annual inflation forecast for 2019 from 4.04.5% to 3.23.7%. Given the monetary policy stance, annual inflation will come in at 3.54.0% in 2020 and will remain close to 4% further on. If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia will consider the necessity of further key rate reduction at one of the upcoming Board of Directors' meetings. In its key rate decision-making, the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic developments over the forecast horizon, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. Inflation dynamics. Inflation slowdown is overshooting the forecast. Annual consumer price growth rate declined to 4.0% in September (from 4.3% in August 2019) and was close to 3.8% according to the estimate as of 21 October. September results show that annual core inflation also decreased to 4.0% as compared to 4.3% in August. According to the Bank of Russia's estimates, inflation indicators reflecting the most sustainable price movements are close to or below 4%. In Septemberâ€”October, disinflationary factors had a more pronounced influence on the slowdown of price growth rates than it had been estimated before. At the same, time pro-inflationary risks related to the external conditions did not materialise. Taking into account one-off factors amid a good harvest and expanded supply in individual food market segments, seasonally adjusted food price growth rates remained low. The ruble appreciation since the beginning of the year alongside with inflation slowdown in Russia's trading partners limits the price growth of imports. In addition, the impact of subdued demand on inflation is becoming increasingly strong. Domestic demand dynamics is also affected by the persisting delay in the financing of budget expenditures, including the expenditures on national projects, compared to earlier announced plans. In Septemberâ€”October, households' inflation expectations continued to decrease, while remaining elevated. Business price expectations slightly lowered. Annual inflation slowdown paves the way for a future decline in inflation expectations of households and businesses. The Bank of Russia has lowered its annual inflation forecast for 2019 from 4.04.5% to 3.23.7%. Meanwhile, annual inflation will be slightly below 3% in 2020 Q1 when the effect of the VAT rate hike is factored out from the calculation of annual inflation. Given the monetary policy stance, annual inflation will come in at 3.54% in 2020 and will remain close to 4% further on. Monetary conditions. Monetary conditions have continued to ease since the last Board meeting. Among other things, this was driven by the change in expectations of financial market participants with regard to the Bank of Russia's key rate path. OFZ yields and deposit and lending rates continued to decline. The Bank of Russia's decisions to cut the key rate and the decline in OFZ yields create conditions for a further reduction in deposit and lending rates. Real sector lending continues to grow on the back of eased monetary conditions. At the same time, annual growth in lending to households has been slowing down since June after noticeable growth in 2018 â€” early 2019. Economic activity. The Russian economy's growth rate still remains subdued. In these circumstances, the Bank of Russia keeps unchanged its 2019 GDP growth forecast in the range of 0.81.3%. However, current data suggests that the growth of the Russian economy might accelerate in 2019 Q3, partially driven by temporary factors. Economic activity continues to be constrained by weakening external demand for Russian exports on the back of a global economic slowdown as well as by weak investment activity dynamics, including government investment expenditures. August-September saw continuing annual growth of industrial production; however, leading indicators point to worsening business sentiment in the industrial sector, which is mostly specific of export orders. Growth in real disposable household incomes has yet to influence the dynamics of retail trade turnover. The labour market creates no additional inflationary pressure. The fact that unemployment remains near historic lows is not driven by expanding labour demand but rather by a simultaneously contracting number of employees and the labour force. Since the beginning of 2019, fiscal policy has had a constraining effect on economic activity. This is in part related to a slower than expected implementation of national projects planned by the Government. Going forward, the rise in government expenditures, including investment ones, and their impact on economic growth will be more distributed over time. The Bank of Russia has left the 20192022 GDP growth forecast unchanged. The GDP growth rate will gradually increase from 0.81.3% in 2019 to 23% in 2022. This will be possible should the Government's measures for overcoming structural constraints, including the implementation of national projects, be realised. However, the global economic slowdown expected over the forecast horizon will continue to exert a constraining impact on growth of the Russian economy. Inflation risks. Disinflationary risks exceed pro-inflationary risks over the short-term horizon. This is primarily related to the weak dynamics of domestic and external demand. Disinflationary risks associated with movements in prices of certain food products persist, including on the back of a rise in supply of farm produce. Pro-inflationary risks posed by budget expenditures growth in the second half of 2019 â€” early 2020 hold low because the rise in expenditures is likely to be more distributed over time. At the same time, should global economic slowdown be more pronounced, including due to tightening international trade restrictions and on the back of other geopolitical factors, this might lead to strengthened volatility in global commodity and financial markets, affecting exchange rate and inflation expectations. A number of internal conditions continue to pose pro-inflationary risks over a longer-term horizon. Significant risks are posed by elevated and unanchored inflation expectations. The mid-term inflation dynamics may also be affected by fiscal policy parameters, including decisions on the investment of the liquid part of the National Wealth Fund in excess of the threshold level set at 7% of GDP. The Bank of Russia leaves mostly unchanged its estimates of risks associated with wage movements and possible changes in consumer behaviour. These risks remain moderate. If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia will consider the necessity of further key rate reduction at one of the upcoming Board of Directors' meetings. In its key rate decision-making, the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic developments over the forecast horizon, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next key rate review meeting on 13 December 2019. The press release on the Bank of Russia Board decision and the medium-term forecast are to be published at 13:30 Moscow time. In the follow-up to the Board of Directors meeting of 25 October 2019 the Bank of Russia released its medium-term forecast in connection to the publication of Monetary Policy Guidelines for 20202022, which are to be issued on 29 October 2019. The reference to the Press Service is mandatory if you intend to use this material."
Kazakhstan,2019-10-28,"–39 The base rate remains unchanged at 9.25% October 28, 2019 Almaty The National Bank of Kazakhstan has made a decision to maintain the base rate at the level of 9.25% per annum with the corridor of +/-1 percentage points. The dynamics of actual annual inflation, which amounted to 5.3% in September, is formed in accordance with the estimates of the National Bank made on the basis of the previous forecast. Inflation expectations of households are close to the level of actual inflation. At the end of 2019, inflation is expected to be at the level of 5.7-5.8%, that is, within the target corridor of 4-6%. On the horizon until the end of 2020 the inflation will remain within the target corridor of 4-6% despite the presence of inflation risks associated with the dynamics of prices for regulated services and certain types of food products. The National Bank will make further decisions on the base rate taking into account the alignment of the actual and forecast inflation in order to achieve its target range. In September 2019 the annual inflation slowed down to 5.3% compared to 5.5% in August. The core inflation calculated excluding price increases for vegetables and fruits, regulated services and energy resources also fell from 7.9% to 7.7%. The slowdown in the growth of prices for non-food items to 5.4% and paid services to 0.7% in annual terms continues to have a restraining effect on inflation. The dynamics of non- food inflation is characterized by the absence of a seasonal acceleration in the growth of prices for clothes, shoes and diesel fuel. Gasoline and solid fuel prices continued to decline (by 4.8% and 3.5% in annual terms, respectively). Regulated services have become 8.2% cheaper over the past 12 months. Price increase in food items accelerated to 9.1% in September 2019, which is mainly due to the increase in domestic prices following global market prices amid the increased consumption of meat and cereals. Meat and meat products became 13.5% more expensive in annual terms, whereas the price for bakery products and cereals increased by 12.7%. In September 2019, inflation expectations of households did not change significantly compared to August. On the horizon of the next 12 months they are estimated at 5.4%. According to the survey, the proportion of respondents expecting persisting or higher consumer price increase over the next 12 months fell to 54% (59% in August). Consumer demand for goods and services is expanding. The growth of household real disposable income reached 6.7% in January-August 2019. These trends are reinforced by the budget spending on social support, wages and the expansion of consumer lending, that grew by 22.6% in annual terms in September. Business activity has continued to grow. In January-September this year, the short-term economic indicator increased by 4.7% on the background of growth in construction by 13.5%, trade - by 7.6%, transport - by 5.5%, manufacturing and mining - by 3.5% and 3.1% respectively. The expansion of investments in January-September 2019 reached 9.7%. The impact of external factors has not changed significantly compared to the previous decision. Dynamics of the oil prices remained moderate. Since the beginning of 2019, the average price level is formed at the level of 64 US dollars per barrel. Risks from global food markets remain balanced out. The value of the FAO Food Price Index in September was 170 points, remaining almost unchanged compared to the level of August. The decline in sugar prices was fully offset by the continued rise in vegetable oil and meat prices. External monetary conditions are loosening. The Central Bank of Russia is pursuing a policy of reducing the key rate amid the decrease in actual and expected inflation associated with weak dynamics of domestic and external demand. Both the People's Bank of China and the European Central Bank continue to cut rates on their operations and communicate further stimulus measures. Inflation at the end of 2019 is estimated at 5.7-5.8%. During 2020, inflation is expected to slow down to the middle of the target 4-6% corridor. This will be facilitated by the current monetary conditions. Multidirectional factors of inflation increase the risks of volatility in the short term. The main risks are associated with the expected increase in marginal tariffs for certain types of regulated services. Further decisions on the base rate will be made taking into account the dynamics of internal and external risks, which will determine the level of actual inflation and its alignment with the target range. The next decision on the base rate will be announced on December 9, 2019, at 15:00 Nur-Sultan time."
Armenia,2019-10-29,"PRESS RELEASE 29.10.2019 In the October 29, 2019 meeting the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia decided to leave the refinancing rate unchanged, at 5.5%. There was 0.2% inflation in September of 2019 compared to that of 0.3% registered in the same period of the previous year, and the 12-month inflation rate remained almost unaltered, reaching 0.5% at the end of the month. Core inflation continues to run above headline inflation, amounting to up 1.1%. In the external sector, the slowing of global economic growth is persisting and the trend is noticeable in world commodity markets as well. Central banks of main partner countries to Armenia are further prone to easing monetary conditions. The Board of the Central Bank estimates that inflationary pressures from the external sector are not expected. The Board admits that economic activity in Armenia remained high in the third quarter, as was projected, thanks to the productivity growth. Domestic demand also remained strong over the quarter, driven by increased private consumption, which continues to be sustained by the monetary policy's stimulative stance and largely injected dram liquidity. At the same time, notwithstanding a slightly expanded effect in the third quarter, the fiscal policy's impact on aggregate demand is still estimated to be contractionary since the beginning of the year. Given the developments in the external environment and the stance of the fiscal policy, and in view of further preference to a gradual recovery of inflation, the Board of the Central Bank finds it reasonable to keep the monetary stimulus under current terms by leaving the refinancing rate unchanged. The Board also finds that in view of anticipated macroeconomic developments, keeping the policy stance expansionary in the medium run will be needed in order to fulfil the inflation target. As a result, the expectation is that the inflation will run below the target in the coming months but will return to the target in the mid-term perspective. At present, downside risks to inflation deviating from the projection path are prevailing and mainly depend on the developments in the external sector. In the event such risks materialize, the Central Bank will respond adequately while maintaining price stability in the medium run. Detailed information that underlies the decision on setting the interest rate will be available in Press Release (Minutes on Interest Rate) to be published by November 12, 2019. â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦.â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦ Press Service of the Central Bank of Armenia."
Brazil,2019-10-30,"In its 226th meeting, the Copom unanimously decided to lower the Selic rate to 5.00% p.a. The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario:. Data on economic activity since the previous Copom meeting reinforce the continuity of the process of economic recovery. Copom's baseline scenario assumes that this recovery will occur at a gradual pace. Regarding the global outlook, the provision of additional monetary stimulus in major economies, in a context of economic slowdown and below-target inflation, has been able to generate a relatively favorable environment for emerging economies. The outlook remains uncertain, however, and risks of a more pronounced slowdown in global growth persist. The Committee judges that various measures of underlying inflation are running at comfortable levels, including the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy. Inflation expectations for 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 collected by the Focus survey are around 3.3%, 3.6%, 3.75%, and 3.5%, respectively. The Copom's inflation projections in the scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the Focus survey stand around 3.4% for 2019, 3.6% for 2020, and 3.5% for 2021. This scenario assumes a path for the Selic rate that ends 2019 at 4.50% p.a., remains at that level during 2020, and ends 2021 at 6.38% p.a. It also assumes a path for the exchange rate that ends 2019 at R$4.00/US$, remains at that level during 2020, and ends 2021 at R$3.95/US$; and. The Committee emphasizes that risks around its baseline scenario remain in both directions. On the one hand, the combination of the high level of economic slack and the potential propagation of current inflation, through inertia, may continue to produce lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory. On the other hand, the current degree of monetary stimulus, which affects the economy with lags, increases the uncertainty about the transmission channels and may raise the path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy. Risk intensifies in case of a deterioration of the outlook for emerging economies or a possible frustration regarding the continuation of reforms and the perseverance in the necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to lower the Selic rate to 5.00% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation and the associated balance of risks, and it is consistent with convergence of inflation to its target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, which includes 2020 and, to a lesser extent, 2021. The Copom reiterates that economic conditions prescribe stimulative monetary policy, i.e., interest rates below the structural level. The Copom sees progress in the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy. The Committee emphasizes that persevering in this process is essential to allow for the consolidation of the reduction of the structural interest rate and for a sustainable economic recovery. The Copom stresses that the perception of the continuation of the reform agenda affects current expectations and macroeconomic projections. In the Copom's assessment, the evolution of the baseline scenario and of the balance of risks prescribes adjusting the degree of monetary stimulus, lowering the Selic rate by 0.50 percentage point. The Committee deems that the consolidation of the benign scenario for prospective inflation should permit an additional adjustment of the same magnitude. The Copom judges that the current stage of the business cycle recommends caution when considering possible new changes in the degree of stimulus. The Committee reiterates that communicating this assessment does not restrict its next decisions, and emphasizes that the next steps in the conduct of monetary policy will continue to depend on the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, and on inflation projections and expectations. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Roberto Oliveira Campos Neto (Governor). Bruno Serra Fernandes. Carolina de Assis Barros. Fernanda Feitosa Nechio. Joao Manoel Pinho de Mello. Mauricio Costa de Moura. Otavio Ribeiro Damaso, and Paulo Srgio Neves de Souza."
United States,2019-10-30,"EDT October 30, 2019 Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate. Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Although household spending has been rising at a strong pace, business fixed investment and exports remain weak. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. In light of the implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflation pressures, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. This action supports the Committee's view that sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective are the most likely outcomes, but uncertainties about this outlook remain. The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook as it assesses the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. EDT October 30, 2019 - 2 - Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H Powell. Chair; John C Williams. Vice Chair; Michelle W Bowman; Lael Brainard; James Bullard; Richard H Clarida; Charles L. Voting against this action were: Esther L George and Eric S.

Colombia,2019-10-31,"This reference rate has remained unaltered for 18 consecutive months. Visit our photo gallery on Flickr. In this decision, the Board mainly considered the following information. The annual inflation rate in September (3.82%) was slightly higher than in August. Core inflation indicators increased slightly, and their average stood slightly above 3.0%. The supply shocks that have affected inflation are expected to begin fading, and inflation is expected to resume convergence to the target at the beginning of 2020, as suggested by market expectations. With the new data on economic activity, the Central Bank's technical staff maintained its economic growth forecast for 2019 at 3.2%. The spare capacity of the economy is expected to decline gradually over the policy horizon. The prospects for global growth continue moderating. In the United States, the Fed reduced its benchmark interest rate. The projection of the current account deficit for 2019 is still above 4.0% of GDP and will continue to be funded largely by foreign direct investment. The main factors that led the Board to its decision were the following. The temporary deviations of inflation from the target and uncertainty regarding the persistence of depreciation of the peso. The size of the spare capacity and the pace at which it may reduce. The effects of changing external conditions on the Colombian economy. In this environment, upon assessing the situation of the economy and the risk balance, the Board unanimously decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate unaltered at 4.25%. The Board will continue to carefully monitor the behavior of inflation and the projections of the country's economic activity, as well as the performance of the balance of payments and the international situation. Finally, the Board reiterates that monetary policy will depend on the new information available. Press Conference.

Pakistan,2019-11-02,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement November 2, 2019. At its meeting on 2 November 2019, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to leave the policy rate unchanged at 13.25 percent. The decision reflected the MPC's view that recent developments have had offsetting implications for the inflation outlook. On the one hand, recent inflation outturns have been on the higher side. On the other, the causes behind these outturns have primarily been increases in food prices which are expected to be temporary. Also market sentiment has begun to gradually improve on the back of sustained improvements in the current account and continued fiscal prudence. The MPC noted that the SBP's projection for average inflation for FY20 remained broadly unchanged at 1 12 percent and maintaining the current monetary policy stance was appropriate. In reaching this decision, the MPC considered key developments since the last MPC meeting, developments in the real, external and fiscal sectors, and the resulting outlook for monetary conditions and inflation. Key developments since the last MPC meeting. There have been three key developments since the last MPC meeting. One the current account balance recorded surplus in October 2019 after gap of four years, clear indication of receding pressures on the country's external accounts. Two the government's primary balance is estimated to record surplus in the first quarter of FY20, first since Q2-FY16. This together with the end of deficit monetization has qualitatively improved the inflation outlook. Three the most recent business confidence survey shows that businesses expect inflation to fall in the near term suggesting that inflation expectations remain anchored despite the recent increases in food prices. Real sector. Recent economic data suggest that economic activity is strengthening in export oriented and import competing sectors while inward oriented sectors continue to experience slowdown in activity. Specifically large-scale manufacturing (LSM) shows gains in electronics, engineering goods and fertilizer sectors and decline in auto, food, and construction allied industries of steel and cement. The latest production estimates of major kharif crops suggest that agriculture sector is likely to grow in line with projections although cotton production is likely to remain below target. In sum, the SBP kept its projection for GDP growth for FY20 unchanged at around. percent. External sector. The external sector continued to show steady improvement, reflecting the benefits of recent policy adjustments and other factors. In the first four months of the current fiscal year, the current account deficit contracted by 73. percent to US$. billion. This improvement reflected notable reduction in imports, modest growth in exports and steady workers' remittances. Export volumes, especially of rice, textile made- ups, leather products, and fish meat, increased despite weakening external demand. The capital and financial account have also improved due to higher FDI and continued portfolio inflows reflecting renewed investor confidence. On account of favorable balance of payment developments, the rupee has appreciated. percent since its low in June 2019. These favorable developments have allowed the SBP to begin rebuilding gross reserves Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN and reducing liabilities. Since the beginning of the fiscal year, gross reserves have risen by US$1.16 billion through November 15 and the SBP has reduced its foreign currency swaps forward liabilities by US$1.95 billion through end October. The combined increase in net reserves from these two sources is well in excess of the US$863 million Special Convertible Rupee Account (SCRA) portfolio inflows in government securities since the beginning of the fiscal year. Fiscal Sector. Fiscal consolidation gained traction during the year to date on account of broad-based taxation reforms and strict control over non-development expenditures. FBR tax collections grew 16. percent (y/y) in Jul-Oct FY20 compared to. percent during the same period last year. On the expenditure side, the federal releases for public sector development programs (PSDP) more than doubled to Rs 257 billion during Jul-Oct FY20 from Rs 105. billion during the same period last year. The increased infrastructure spending is expected to stimulate business activity in construction-allied industries. On the financing side, the government has strictly adhered to its commitment of zero fresh budgetary borrowing from SBP, which has not only helped the government meet its continuous performance criteria under the IMF program, but also bodes well for the inflation outlook. The MPC emphasized that continued fiscal prudence would remain critical for sustaining the improving market sentiment. Monetary and inflation outlook. Private sector credit fell by Rs. billion during the first four months of the current fiscal year compared to an expansion of Rs 2. billion during the same period last year on account of slowing economic activity. However fixed investment loans increased, supported by the SBP's long term financing facility under which loans grew by Rs 1. billion during this period. Inflation (based on the new index) rose 1 percent (y/y) and. percent (m/m) in October 2019. These outturns, especially recent month-on-month outturns, were somewhat higher than expectations but largely reflected upward adjustments in administered prices and rise in prices of food items primarily due to temporary supply disruptions. The MPC noted that recent outturns of month-on-month inflation had been higher than in previous months and if sustained could affect inflation expectations. Nevertheless in light of the temporary nature of these increases, continued softness in domestic demand, and recent appreciation of the currency on the back of improving market sentiment, the MPC was of the view that inflationary pressures were expected to recede in the second half of the fiscal year, as noted in the last MPS. The MPC noted that the current stance of monetary policy and real interest rates on forward-looking basis were appropriate to bring inflation down to the target range of percent over the next twenty-four months.

Malaysia,2019-11-05,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.00 percent. The global economy is expanding at a more moderate pace, with the slowdown becoming more synchronised across both the advanced and emerging economies. There is also evidence of the weak global trade affecting domestic demand, particularly investment activity. Going forward, geopolitical tensions, policy uncertainty and the unresolved trade disputes could exacerbate financial market volatility and further weigh on the global growth outlook. Monetary easing and other policy measures are expected to provide some support to growth. For the Malaysian economy, latest indicators are in line with expectations, suggesting moderate expansion of economic activity for the third quarter. Going forward, growth is expected to remain anchored by firm private sector expenditure. While private investment is projected to remain modest, household spending will be supported by continued employment and wage growth. The recent Government measures will provide additional impetus to economic activity. On the external front, while exports will continue to be affected by slower global demand, this will be partly mitigated by its diversified structure. Overall, growth of the Malaysian economy is expected to be within projections in 2019 and the pace sustained going into 2020. This projection remains subject to downside risks, mainly stemming from uncertainties in global economic and financial conditions as well as weakness in commodity-related sectors. Average headline inflation in 2019 will be low. In 2020, headline inflation is expected to average higher but remain modest. This reflects mainly the lapse in the impact from consumption tax policy changes, the lifting of the domestic retail fuel price ceiling amid the relatively subdued outlook on global oil prices, and measures in place to contain food prices. The trajectory of headline inflation will, however, be dependent on global oil and commodity price developments. Underlying inflation is expected to remain stable, supported by the continued expansion in economic activity and in the absence of strong demand pressures. At the current level of the OPR, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and supportive of economic activity. The MPC will continue to assess the balance of risks to domestic growth and inflation, to ensure that the monetary policy stance remains conducive to sustainable growth amid price stability. The meeting also approved the schedule of MPC meetings for 2020. In accordance with the Central Bank of Malaysia Act 2009, the MPC will convene six times during the year. The meetings will be held over two days, with the Monetary Policy Statement released at 3 p.m. on the second day of the MPC meeting. Bank Negara Malaysia 05 November 2019."
Armenia,2019-11-06,"PRESS RELEASE 11.06.2019 In the June 11, 2019 meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia decided to leave the refinancing rate unchanged, at a 5.75% level. There was 0.4% deflation in May of 2019 compared with that of 1.0% recorded in the same period of the previous year, in which case the 12-month inflation has increased, amounting to 2.8% at the end of the month, determined by a seasonal rise in prices of some agricultural products. In the external sector, trade wars gaining more tension have considerably added to uncertainties over global economic development, which have touched on trends in both financial and raw commodity markets. In addition, the US economic growth outlooks have deteriorated notably considerably, with the Federal Reserve System expected to make a much milder monetary policy in the future. Although some short-term inflationary trends are observable in the main food commodity markets, the Board of the Central Bank considers that, generally, significant inflationary pressures from the external sector are not likely. The Board states that growth rates of economic activity remain strong, and the economic growth registered in the first quarter of 2019 has outpaced the expected indicator, with high private consumption growth still as the main driver to it. The impact of fiscal policy carried out over the first half of the year on the domestic demand is estimated as contractionary. There is anticipation that in the second half of the year it will be notably expansionary and, consequently, the fiscal policy will have a neutral impact, according to the year's results. The Board believes that the currently low inflation contributes to the anchoring of long-term inflation expectations and maintaining of purchasing power of incomes. At present, the Board prefers to letting the inflation recover gradually and finds it reasonable to keep monetary conditions expansionary by leaving the refinancing rate unchanged. At the same time, in view of the anticipated macroeconomic developments, to leave the policy's stance expansionary for a long period of time will be needed in fulfillment of the mid-term inflation target. As a result, the expectation is that the inflation will run below the target in the coming months but will stabilizing around the target in the medium run. It should be noted that risks to inflation deviating from the projection path, which is associated with global economic development uncertainties and the pace of a possibly more contractionary fiscal policy, are still persisting. The Central Bank will respond to the emergence of any of such risks and developments adequately while maintaining price stability in the medium run. Detailed information that underlies the decision on setting of the interest rate will be available in Inflation Report (Monetary Policy Program for the second quarter of 2019) to be published by June 25, 2019.

Poland,2019-11-06,"Warsaw, 6 November 2019 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 5-6 November 2019 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: â–ª reference rate at 1.50%; â–ª lombard rate at 2.50%; â–ª deposit rate at 0.50%; â–ª rediscount rate at 1.75%. Global economic growth remains relatively low and uncertainty about the global outlook persists. In the euro area, annual GDP growth in 2019 Q3 declined alongside the ongoing downturn in industry. In the United States, economic conditions continue to be relatively strong, however. GDP growth in 2019 Q3 in the US economy also declined. At the same time, in China economic activity growth continues to slow down. In recent months, inflation declined in many countries and continues to run at a moderate level, supported by lower oil prices than a year ago. In particular, inflation is low in the euro area. The European Central Bank is keeping the deposit rate unchanged, after lowering it further below zero in September. At the same time it has resumed the asset purchase programme and signalled the maintenance of loose monetary policy in the coming quarters. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates again in October. In Poland, economic conditions remain good, although the incoming data point to a possible decrease in the economic growth rate in 2019 Q3, mainly due to the economic downturn abroad. However, rising consumption, fuelled by increasing employment and wages, very strong consumer confidence and social benefit payments, exerts a stabilising influence on GDP growth. At the same time, the incoming data indicates that investment continues to rise, albeit at a slower pace. Inflation in October 2019  according to the GUS flash estimate  stood at 2.5% y/y. Food price growth, despite a gradual slowdown, remains elevated and is contributing to higher inflation. On the other hand, lower energy prices than a year ago, including fuel prices, are having a curbing effect on price growth. At the same time, in the recent period core inflation has risen, but continues to run at moderate levels. The Council became acquainted with the results of the November projection of inflation and GDP, prepared under the assumption of unchanged NBP interest rates. The November projection takes into account data and information published up to 18 October 2019. In line with the November projection based on the NECMOD model, there is a 50- percent probability that the annual price growth will be in the range of 2.2-2.4% in 2019 (against 1.7-2.3% in the July 2019 projection), 2.1-3.6% in 2020 (compared to 1.9-3.7%) and 1.6-3.6% in 2021 (compared to 1.33.5%). At the same time, the annual GDP growth  according to this projection  will be with a 50-percent probability in the range of 3.9-4.7% in 2019 (against 3.9-5.1% in the July 2019 projection), 2.7-4.4% in 2020 (compared to 3.0- 4.8%) and 2.3-4.2% in 2021 (compared to 2.4-4.3%). In the Council's assessment, the outlook for economic conditions in Poland remains favourable, and GDP growth, despite the expected decline, will continue at a relatively high level in the coming quarters. At the same time, there remains uncertainty about the scale and persistence of the slowdown abroad and its impact on domestic economic activity. Inflation  after a temporary rise in 2020 Q1  will stay close to the target in the monetary policy transmission horizon. Such an assessment is supported by the results of the November NBP projection of inflation and GDP. The Council judges that the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability. The Council adopted the Inflation Report  November 2019 and the resolution on the principles for creating and releasing the provision against the foreign exchange rate risk of the zÅ‚oty at Narodowy Bank Polski and amended the resolution on the NBP accounting principles."
Romania,2019-11-06,"In its meeting of 6 November 2019, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided the following:. In September 2019, the annual CPI inflation rate went down to 3.5 percent (from 3.9 percent in August), thus returning to the upper bound of the variation band of the target. The evolution owed mainly to the pronounced slowdown in the annual growth rate of volatile food prices and that of fuel prices. Compared to end-Q2, when it had stood at 3.8 percent, the annual inflation rate posted a slightly larger-than-expected decrease. The decline was attributed to the deceleration in the dynamics of vegetable prices, administered prices and fuel prices. The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate (which excludes from the CPI inflation administered prices, volatile prices, and tobacco product and alcoholic beverage prices) continued to increase in Q3, albeit at a slower-than-anticipated pace, going up from 3.3 percent in June to 3.4 percent in September. The advance reflected opposite influences stemming from the rise in some international agri-food prices and from the cut in the prices of telecommunication services, overlapping significant demand-pull and wage cost-push inflationary pressures. The average annual CPI inflation rate continued to decline to 3.8 percent in September from 3.9 percent in August 2019; calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, the average annual inflation rate went down to 3.9 percent from 4.0 percent July through August 2019. The new statistical data on economic growth in 2019 Q2 confirm the slight deceleration in real GDP to 4.4 percent from 5 percent in the previous quarter (annual changes). According to the revised data, the contribution of household consumption was further prevalent, followed by that of gross fixed capital formation. Compared to the previous version, net exports had a smaller negative contribution to GDP dynamics, in the context of a sharper narrowing of the negative differential between the growth rates of exports and imports of goods and services. The evolution was also visible in the moderation of the annual pace of increase of the negative balance on trade. The annual dynamics of the current account deficit remained, however, at the previous quarter's level amid the marked worsening of the primary and secondary income balances. The latest statistical data point to mixed developments for consumption, investment and production July through August: a faster rise in retail sales concurrently with a slower annual growth rate of services to households than in Q2, a step-up in the construction activity, as well as a larger contraction in industrial output, particularly on account of manufacturing. The growth rate of credit to the private sector moderated slightly in September, to 7.7 percent, from 8 percent in August. During Q3 overall, its average dynamics picked up, however, to 7.9 percent versus 7.5 percent in the previous quarter. The share of domestic currency loans in total private sector credit widened further, reaching 66.6 percent in September, against 65.4 percent in September 2018 (from a low of 35.6 percent in May 2012). In today's meeting, the NBR Board examined and approved the November 2019 Inflation Report, which incorporates the most recent data and information available. The new forecast points to the outlook for the annual inflation rate to end this year slightly above the variation band of the target, before returning and staying in the upper half of the band until the end of the forecast horizon, on a trajectory below that envisaged previously. Heightened uncertainties and risks surrounding the inflation outlook stem from the future fiscal and income policy stance, especially amid the 2019-2020 election calendar, while the level and the trend of the current account deficit remain a matter of concern. Rising uncertainties are also generated by the increasingly obvious weakening of the euro area and global economies, as well as by the growing risks to their outlook, in the context of the trade war and Brexit. Particularly relevant are the ECB's and the Fed's decisions on monetary policy easing, as well as the stance of central banks in the region. In today's meeting, based on the currently available data and assessments, the NBR Board decided to keep unchanged the monetary policy rate at 2.50 percent per annum, while maintaining strict control over money market liquidity. Moreover, the NBR Board decided to leave unchanged the deposit facility rate at 1.50 percent per annum and the lending (Lombard) facility rate at 3.50 percent per annum. Furthermore, the central bank maintained the current levels of the minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board's decisions aim to ensure and preserve price stability over the medium term in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth and amid safeguarding financial stability. The NBR Board underlines that the balanced macroeconomic policy mix and the implementation of structural reforms designed to foster the growth potential over the long term are of the essence in preserving a stable macroeconomic framework and strengthening the capacity of the Romanian economy to withstand potential adverse developments. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be presented to the public in a press conference on 8 November 2019, at 11:00 a.m. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR's website on 13 November 2019, at 3:00 p.m. The next monetary policy meeting of the NBR Board is scheduled for 8 January 2020."
Thailand,2019-11-06,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 7/2019 Mr. Titanun Mallikamas. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 6 November 2019 as follows. The Committee voted 5 to 2 to cut the policy rate by 025 percentage point from 150 to 125 percent, effective immediately. Two members voted to maintain the policy rate at 150 percent. In deliberating their policy decision, the Committee assessed that the Thai economy would expand at a lower rate than previously assessed and further below its potential due to a decline in exports which affected employment and domestic demand. Headline inflation was projected to be below the lower bound of the inflation target. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative. Financial stability risks had already been addressed to some extent, although there remained pockets of risks that warranted monitoring. Most members viewed that a more accommodative monetary policy stance would contribute to economic growth and support the rise of headline inflation toward the target. Most members thus voted to cut the policy rate at this meeting. Nevertheless two members viewed that under the already accommodative monetary policy at present, the policy rate cut might not lend additional support to economic growth, compared with potentially increased financial stability risks. In addition, there remained a need to preserve the limited policy space for coping with potentially increasing risks in the future. The Thai economy was expected to expand at a lower rate than previously assessed and further below its potential. Merchandise exports contracted more than the previous assessment and were projected to recover more slowly than expected due to the slowdown of global trade volume affected by trade tensions. Tourism would grow at a lower rate. Regarding domestic demand, private consumption was expected to slow down despite supports from fiscal stimulus measures. This was due to moderated household income and sharp decline in employment, particularly in export-related manufacturing sectors, as well as elevated household debt. Private investment would expand at a lower rate than previously assessed. However the relocation of production base to Thailand and public-private partnership projects for infrastructure investment would support investment in the period ahead. Public expenditure would grow at a lower rate than previously estimated owing partly to delay in state-owned enterprise investment projects. The Committee viewed that the Thai economy would face higher risks in the following period, especially external risks from trade tensions, the economic outlook of China and advanced economies that could affect domestic demand, as well as geopolitical risks. Furthermore the Committee would monitor the impact of fiscal stimulus measures and public expenditure, together with the progress of major infrastructure investment and its knock-on effects on private investment. The annual averages of headline inflation in 2019 and 2020 were projected to be below the lower bound of the inflation target due to lower-than-expected energy prices in tandem with global economic slowdown. In addition, core inflation was expected to moderate owing to subdued demand-pull inflationary pressures. The Committee viewed that structural changes contributed to more persistent inflation than in the past. Such changes included the expansion of e-commerce, rising price competition, and technological development which reduced costs of production. Financial conditions over the previous period had been accommodative. Real interest rates and government bond yields remained low. Liquidity in the financial system remained ample. These allowed financing by the private sector to continue expanding. However loans extended to both businesses and consumers would exhibit slower growth. With regard to exchange rates, the Committee expressed concerns over the baht appreciation against trading partner currencies, which might affect the economy to a larger degree amid heightened uncertainties pertaining to the external front. The Committee supported the relaxation of foreign exchange regulations to encourage capital outflows and promote more balanced capital flows, which would alleviate pressures on the baht and help the private sector to better manage exchange rate risks. The Committee still saw a need to continue to closely monitor developments of exchange rates and capital flows and would consider implementing appropriate measures in addition if necessary. Financial stability remained sound overall, but there remained a need to monitor risks that might pose vulnerabilities to financial stability in the future, especially the deterioration in the quality of SME loans. The Committee viewed that the implemented macroprudential measures had, to some extent, curbed accumulation of vulnerabilities in the financial system. However there remained a need to monitor search-for-yield behavior in the prolonged low interest rate environment, debt accumulation and debt servicing capability of households and SMEs, growth in assets held by saving cooperatives and the interconnectedness among saving cooperatives, and leverage by large corporates that might underprice risks. The Committee viewed that microprudential and macroprudential measures should be appropriately combined to ensure financial stability. Looking ahead, the Committee would monitor developments of economic growth, inflation, and financial stability, together with associated risks, in deliberating appropriate monetary policy going forward. Nevertheless the Thai economy would continue to face structural problems, which would affect competitiveness and economic growth outlook. This should be firmly addressed by all related parties."
Czech Republic,2019-11-07,"At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank decided to keep interest rates unchanged. The two-week repo rate thus remains at 2%, the discount rate at 1% and the Lombard rate at 3%. Five members voted in favour of this decision, and two members voted for increasing rates by 25 basis points.. The Bank Board assessed the new macroeconomic forecast at today's meeting. Consistent with the forecast is a rise in domestic market interest rates in this quarter and the next, followed by a decline from mid-2020. However, the Bank Board assessed the balance of risks to this forecast as being anti-inflationary. According to the external assumptions of the new forecast, economic growth in the euro area will remain low over the next two years but will recover gradually. The economic slowdown and decline in oil prices will be reflected in subdued producer and consumer price inflation. Negative 3M EURIBOR interest rates over the entire forecast horizon reflect continued monetary policy easing by the European Central Bank, including the renewed quantitative easing programme. In the context of the cuts in US interest rates, the market expects a modest appreciation of the euro against the dollar. The price of oil will remain below USD 60 a barrel over the next two years. Domestic inflation will stay in the upper half of the tolerance band around the inflation target in the coming quarters, due to only gradually abating overall inflation pressures, rapid growth in administered prices and the impacts of changes to indirect taxes. Domestic inflation pressures will gradually ease further over the forecast horizon as a result of slowing wage growth and a renewed acceleration of labour efficiency growth. Import prices will also have a temporary anti-inflationary effect. Inflation will thus gradually decrease during 2020 and converge towards the 2% target over the monetary policy horizon, i.e. in late 2020 and early 2021. This will be due partly to a fading-out of the high administered price inflation and to monetary policy tightening. However, the decrease in inflation will be slowed by the price impacts of changes to indirect taxes. Monetary policy-relevant inflation will be below headline inflation next year, owing to the positive overall first-round effects of changes to indirect taxes. The forecast assumes that excise duty on cigarettes and alcohol will be increased significantly in January 2020. The third and fourth phases of electronic sales registration will be launched in May 2020. This will be associated with a decline in the VAT rate on certain consumer basket items. The growth of the domestic economy will slow in the rest of this year due to weakening external demand. GDP growth will not return close to the potential output growth rate of 3% until 2021. Solid growth rates of household and government consumption will contribute to growth in economic activity over the entire forecast horizon. Investment growth will initially stay at the low rates observed in mid-2019. It will be driven mainly by government investment, with projects co-financed from EU funds contributing significantly. Private investment is forecasted to return to growth during next year. The positive contribution of net exports will temporarily disappear during 2020 as a result of a transitory slowdown in external demand growth. The tightness in the labour market peaked in previous quarters. The unemployment rate is at a record low and will not fall any further. Amid persisting labour shortages on the one hand and gradually weakening demand for labour on the other, total employment growth will remain subdued. Wage growth will decrease gradually, but its slowdown will be dampened by a further increase in the minimum wage and growth in salaries in the non-market part of the economy. Slight appreciation of the koruna will reflect continued real convergence of the Czech economy and a temporary further widening of the interest rate differential vis-Ã -vis the euro area. However, the impact of these factors on the koruna exchange rate will be largely offset by deteriorating economic and price developments abroad. Consistent with the forecast is a rise in domestic market interest rates in this quarter and the next, followed by a decline from mid-2020. The rise in domestic rates at the start of the forecast primarily reflects domestic cost pressures, which are fading only gradually. The subsequent decline in domestic interest rates will be due mainly to persisting negative interest rates in the euro area, accompanied by continued quantitative easing of monetary policy by the European Central Bank. By comparison with the previous forecast, the outlooks for economic growth and especially inflation in the euro area have been lowered. As a result, expected domestic economic growth in the next two years has also been revised downwards. By contrast, the inflation outlook for next year is higher due to stronger domestic inflation pressures, a weaker exchange rate and greater effects of tax changes. The new forecast implies higher interest rates in 2020. The koruna will appreciate more gradually against the euro than in the previous forecast."
Peru,2019-11-07,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT NOVEMBER 2019 BCRP LOWERED REFERENCE RATE TO 2.25% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to cut the reference rate from 2.50 to 2.25 percent, in light of the following developments: Year-on-year inflation is expected to remain within the target range close to 2.0 percent over the forecast horizon, with a downside bias due to the possibility of a lower-than expected increase in domestic demand. Monthly inflation was 0.11 percent in October, bringing up year-on-year inflation to 1.88 percent, from 1.85 percent in September. With monthly inflation excluding food and energy at 0.23 percent in October, the year-on-year figure increased to 2.34 percent, from 2.16 percent in September due to a transitory increase in water, electricity, and transportation rates. Monthly inflation would have been negative without these items. One-year ahead expected inflation as of October remains at 2.2 percent. Primary industries' weak performance in January-September was partially offset by a recovery in non-primary industries. The slowdown in public investment over the same period is expected to revert in the remainder of the year. Business conditions expectations improved slightly in October. Economic activity indicators point to a more gradual closure of the output gap. Global growth risks decreased as trade tensions moderated. This decision does not necessarily imply additional reductions in the policy rate. The BCRP Board pays close attention to new information on inflation and its determinants in assessing future changes in the monetary policy stance. The Board also decided to reduce the interest rates on BCRP off-auction credit and deposit operations in domestic currency with financial entities. Overnight deposits: 1.00 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 2.80 percent per year for financial entities' first 10 operations over the last 12 months; and the rate fixed by the BCRP Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations Committee for operations other than financial entities' first 10 operations over the last 12 months. Dollar swaps: a fee equal to a minimum annual effective cost of 2.80 percent. The BCRP Board's next monetary policy session will take place on December 12, 2019."
Georgia,2019-11-12,"December 11, 2019 The National Bank of Georgia raises the monetary policy rate by 0.5 percentage points to 9.0% The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on December 11, 2019, and decided to raise the refinancing rate by 0.5 percentage points to 9.0 percent. In November, the annual inflation rate stood at 7.0 percent. Along with one-off factors, the inflation overshooting was caused by the nominal exchange rate depreciation. From September, the NBG started to tighten monetary policy aiming at neutralizing inflationary pressures stemming from the exchange rate depreciation. Despite the appreciation observed during the last few days, the GEL nominal effective exchange rate remains undervalued, pinning inflation expectations above the target level. As it was stated in previous decisions of the Committee, in order to maintain inflation close to the target level in the medium term, the policy tightening would continue until the pressure from exchange rate is receded. Therefore, the MPC increased the refinancing rate by 0.5 percentage points. According to the forecast, other things equal the inflation will start declining from March 2020 and approach the target by the end of the year. The future decisions of the Committee will depend upon the speed of neutralization of inflationary pressure stemming from the exchange rate depreciation. Moderate growth rate of export and money transfers is retained. After the decline in the previous months, tourism revenues increased in October and November in annual terms. Moreover, the FDI inflows grew as well in the third quarter. Against described external developments and robust credit growth, the preliminary estimates indicate high economic activity. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all means and instruments at its disposal to ensure price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee is scheduled on January 29, 2020."
Philippines,2019-11-13,"At its meeting on monetary policy today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) facility at 4.0 percent. Accordingly, the interest rates on the overnight deposit and lending facilities were held unchanged at 3.5 percent and 4.5 percent, respectively.Latest baseline forecasts of the BSP continue to indicate that inflation is likely to settle within the lower half of the target band of 3.0 percent Â± 1 percentage point for 2019 up to 2021, with the balance of risks to the inflation outlook leaning toward the upside for 2020 and toward the downside for 2021. Upside risks to inflation over the near term emanate mainly from the potential impact of the African Swine Fever outbreak on food prices and from potential volatility in oil prices amid geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. At the same time, weak global economic prospects continue to temper the inflation outlook, as uncertainty over trade policies weigh down on global economic activity and demand. Meanwhile, inflation expectations based on the BSP's survey of private sector economists also remain well-anchored within the inflation target range. Notwithstanding prospects in the global front, firm private domestic spending and sustained progress in policy reforms will serve as a buffer against external headwinds.Given these considerations, the Monetary Board believes that prevailing monetary policy settings remain appropriate. This is supported by the benign inflation outlook and a firm outlook for domestic economic growth. At the same time, a prudent pause in monetary adjustments will enable the cumulative 75-basis-point reduction in policy rates as well as the cut in reserve requirement ratios to continue working their way through the economy. The Monetary Board also trusts that the fiscal budget for 2020 will be passed within this year.Going forward, the BSP will continue to monitor emerging price and output conditions to ensure that the monetary policy stance remains consistent with ensuring stable prices while supporting economic growth over the medium term."
Egypt,2019-11-14,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release November 14, 2019 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation by 100 basis points to 1225 percent, 1325 percent, and 1275 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also cut by 100 basis points to 1275 percen. Annual headline inflation continued to decline to record 48 percent in September 2019 and 31 percent in October 2019, the lowest rate since December 200. The decline was driven by lower annual food inflation, supported by favorable base effects stemming from the transitory shock to prices of fresh vegetables in the previous year, while annual non-food inflation inched up in October 2019 due to relatively higher services price. The decline was further affected by the release of the 10th CPI series as well as its linking methodology with the 9th CPI serie. The decline of annual food inflation was mostly driven by fresh vegetable. Accordingly higher annual non-food inflation led annual core inflation to increase slightly to 27 percent in October 2019 from 26 percent in September 2019, the lowest rate since April 200. Real GDP growth stabilized, recording a preliminary estimate of 56 percent in 2019 Q3, after recording 56 percent in fiscal year 2018/19, the highest growth since fiscal year 2007/0. The contribution of real output growth by the private sector witnessed a broad-based increase in 2019 Q2 for the first time since 2017 Q2, and real private demand growth has been picking up to support the stability of real aggregate demand growt. Employment rose, contributing favorably to the continued decline of the unemployment rate to 75 percent in 2019 Q2, thereby narrowing by almost 6 percentage points from its peak in 2013 Q. Globally the expansion of economic activity continued to weaken, financial conditions eased, and uncertainty regarding trade policies continued to weigh on the outloo. Meanwhile international oil prices remain subject to volatility due to potential supply-side factors that include geopolitical risk. Incoming data continued to confirm the moderation of underlying inflationary pressures, notwithstanding the expected impact of unfavorable base effects on near-term inflation rates due to the reversal of the transitory shock to prices of fresh vegetables in the previous yea. Accordingly the MPC decided to cut key policy rates by 100 basis point. The reduction of policy rates in today's and in previous meetings of the MPC provide appropriate support to economic activity, while remaining consistent with achieving the inflation target of 9 percent (Â±3 percentage points) in 2020 Q4 and price stability over the medium-ter. The MPC closely monitors all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust its stance to preserve monetary stabilit.

Mexico,2019-11-14,"Banco de Mexico's Governing Board has decided to lower the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to 7.50%. During the third quarter of the year, the world economy continued to decelerate and its growth outlook was revised downwards again. This has taken place in an environment where headline and core inflation in the main advanced economies remain below their central banks' targets. In this context, some of these institutions eased monetary policy in the last months. In its October meeting, the US Federal Reserve cut the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points and mentioned in its communications that such range is appropriate considering the risks faced. International financial markets exhibited lower volatility due mainly to a reduction in trade tensions between the United States and China, and to a lower probability of a disorderly exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union. Additionally, the accommodative policy stances of the main central banks have contributed to the better performance of international financial markets over the last weeks. Nevertheless, risks to the global economy associated with trade tensions and geopolitical factors as well as political and social uncertainty in several countries persist. Thus, the balance of risks for world economic activity remains biased to the downside. The easing of global financial conditions has contributed to the more favorable performance of financial markets in emerging economies. In Mexico, albeit having experienced episodes of volatility, since the last monetary policy decision the peso exchange rate appreciated slightly, while interest rates on government securities have reflected the effects of the lower external interest rates. Regarding the risks that may affect the performance of domestic financial assets, uncertainty persists with respect to the bilateral relation between Mexico and the United States and to the credit rating outlook for Pemex and Mexico's sovereign debt. The current environment continues to pose significant risks that could affect the country's macroeconomic conditions, its ability to grow, and the economy's price formation process. In this regard, it is particularly important that, in addition to a prudent and firm monetary policy, measures to foster an environment of confidence and certainty for investment and higher productivity are adopted, and that public finances are consolidated in a sustainable way. In this context, strengthening the credit rating outlook for the sovereign and Pemex's debt, as well as achieving the fiscal targets for 2019 and the goals set in the 2020 Economic Package are necessary. Strengthening the rule of law, tackling corruption, and fighting insecurity are equally imperative. Latest information on the third quarter of 2019 shows that the stagnation that economic activity has been exhibiting for several quarters continues, thus implying that slack conditions have widened more than anticipated. Based on incoming information, the foreseen trajectory of GDP growth for 2019 and for the next year would likely be below that published in Banco de Mexico's Quarterly Report for April-June 2019. In an environment of significant uncertainty, the balance of risks for growth remains biased to the downside. 1 In October, headline inflation was 3.02%. The non-core subindex has remained at low levels, standing at 1.01% in October, while core inflation has persisted at high levels, albeit exhibiting a slight reduction to 3.68% during the same month. As for inflation expectations from surveys, short-term expectations have followed the latest data, while longer term ones have remained relatively stable, although at levels above 3%. The recent behavior of the factors that affect the foreseen headline inflation trajectory suggests that it may lie slightly below the trajectory set forth in Banco de Mexico's past Quarterly Report. This is the result of the materialization of certain downward risks to non-core inflation during the last months. As for core inflation, it has continued to show persistence. Regarding inflation risks, those to the upside are: that core inflation remains persistent; wage revisions that exceed productivity gains and generate cost-related pressures; that the peso exchange rate comes under pressure from external or domestic factors; the threat of tariffs by the United States and that compensatory measures are adopted, although this risk has diminished; that public finances deteriorate; and, increases in agricultural, livestock or energy prices greater than expected. As for downside risks: an appreciation of the peso exchange rate, possibly associated with a context of greater appetite for risk in international financial markets or in case the trade agreement with the United States and Canada is ratified; a widening of slack conditions or its impact on core inflation greater than foreseen; and, that the prices of certain goods included in the non-core subindex register lower rates of change. In this context, uncertainty still persists regarding the risks that could make inflation deviate from its foreseen trajectory. To guide its monetary policy actions. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board follows closely the development of inflation vis-Ã -vis its forecasts, taking into account the monetary policy stance and the time frame in which monetary policy operates. In this process, it uses available information on all inflation determinants as well as on medium- and long-term inflation expectations, including the balance of risks for such factors. Monetary policy must also act prudently if for any reason the uncertainty faced by the economy increases significantly. In this context, considering that the lower levels registered by headline inflation, the ample slack in the economy, as well as the recent behavior of external and domestic yield curves allow for decreasing the policy rate. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board decided by majority to lower the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to 7.50%. Two members voted for lowering the target to 7.25%. In order to consolidate a low and stable inflation, in an environment in which price formation and slack conditions in the economy are subject to risks, the Governing Board will continue to follow closely all factors and elements of uncertainty that have an impact on inflation and its outlook, and will take the required actions based on incoming information so that the policy rate is consistent with the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to Banco de Mexico's target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board will maintain a prudent monetary policy stance and, under the current environment of uncertainty, will follow closely the potential pass-through of exchange rate fluctuations to prices. Mexico's relative monetary policy stance in an external environment that it is still subject to risks, and the behavior of slack conditions and cost-related pressures in the economy. In the presence and possible persistence of factors that, by their nature, involve risks to both inflation and its expectations, monetary policy will be adjusted in a timely and firm manner to achieve the convergence of inflation to its 3% target and to strengthen the anchoring of medium- and long-term inflation expectations so that they attain such target."
Hungary,2019-11-19,"At its meeting on 19 November 2019, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 20 November 2019:. The Magyar Nemzeti Bank's (MNB) single anchor is inflation, its primary objective is to achieve and maintain price stability. Therefore, in assessing the outlook, the Monetary Council pays more attention to the measures of underlying inflation capturing persistent trends. In October 2019, inflation, core inflation and core inflation excluding indirect tax effects stood at 2.9 percent, 4.0 percent and 3.7 percent, respectively. The increase in headline inflation and core inflation in October reflected changes in the price index for processed food. A dichotomy remains between the factors determining likely developments in inflation. Buoyant domestic demand is boosting, while weakening external activity is increasingly restraining the pace of inflation. The effects of the slowdown in European economic activity indicate a strengthening in downside risks to the longer-term outlook for inflation. Due to the base effects of the fall in fuel prices last year, the consumer price index is likely to rise again until the end of 2019, and then to stabilise at the level of the 3 percent inflation target following a gradual decline. In the coming months, core inflation excluding indirect tax effects is expected to remain close to its current level, before decreasing gradually to 3 percent from the beginning of the next year, due to external disinflationary effects. Based on the preliminary data release, the Hungarian economy grew by 5.0 percent in the third quarter of 2019, mainly driven by market services, industry and construction. Labour demand remained strong, and the unemployment rate was close to its historically low level. With dynamic export growth, in the last quarter, the trade surplus exceeded significantly its value one year earlier. Economic growth is expected to slow in the coming quarters. Weakening economic activity in Europe is likely to have an increasingly strong effect on developments in Hungarian GDP as well. Consistent with the gradual deceleration in economic growth, the increase in wages is likely to slow. In parallel, the growth rate of consumption is also likely to slow down. Hungary's export growth may be more muted, reflecting the deterioration in the global and European demand outlook. Hungary's GDP is expected to grow by 4.5 percent in 2019 and by 3.3 percent in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Despite weakening external activity, the convergence of Hungary with the euro area economy is likely to continue in the coming years, with the maintenance of the at least 2 percentage-points growth rate surpluses. In addition to monetary policy, several government measures jointly strengthen Hungary's macroeconomic stability and reduce external vulnerability. The Hungarian Government Security Plus (MÃP+) strengthens financial stability and supports sustainable economic growth through several channels. The amount of securities purchased continued to be considerable, more than half of which was registered as a new source of financing for the government sector. A significant part of sales was located in the capital, while the level of purchases was lower in the rest of the country. Based on the ratified 2020 Budget Act, the budget deficit-to-GDP ratio is likely to decline from 1.7-1.8 percent in the current year to 1 percent, with the maintenance of a significant amount of reserves. After 2019, fiscal policy will remain counter-cyclical in 2020 and, in line with the Convergence Programme, in 2021 as well. The Economy Protection Action Plan announced in May is expected to gradually improve the competitiveness of the domestic economy. As result of the deterioration in the global economic outlook and subdued inflation, the external monetary policy environment has become looser again in recent months. The Federal Reserve has reduced its policy rate three times in this year. In line with its September decision, the European Central Bank has begun asset purchases in November. In October, the possibility of a reduction in interest rates appeared in the Bank of Japan's forward guidance. According to global leading central banks' indications and market pricing, a loose monetary policy environment will be persistently maintained, and additional moderate loosening measures can be expected. Sentiment in international financial markets has improved since the Council's previous policy decision. Risk appetite was influenced by developments in international trade policies, decisions of the world's leading central banks and the events related to Brexit. The oil prices have risen over the past month. To improve the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission, the Monetary Council launched its Bond Funding for Growth Scheme with a total amount of HUF 300 billion on 1 July 2019. Under the Scheme, the MNB started corporate bond purchases in September. Due to great interest, three-quarters of the amount available under the Scheme is expected to be used until the end of 2019, with the remaining part likely to be used early next year. The MNB will neutralise excess liquidity arising from bond purchases by using the preferential deposit facility bearing interest at the central bank base rate. The programme complements the Funding for Growth Scheme Fix launched at the beginning of 2019 to build a healthier lending structure. Under the scheme, participating credit institutions concluded loan contracts with domestic SMEs totalling more than HUF 310 billion until the end of October. The Monetary Council left the base rate, the overnight collateralised lending rate and the one-week collateralised lending rate at 0.9 percent and the overnight deposit rate at -0.05 percent unchanged. In addition, in September the Council set the average amount of liquidity to be crowded out for the fourth quarter at least at HUF 300-500 billion and will take this into account in setting the stock of central bank swap instruments. The MNB changes the stock of the FX swap instrument in a flexible manner to ensure that the interest rate transmission changes in line with the decisions by the Monetary Council and the volatility of interbank rates remains at low levels. In its decisions, the Monetary Council focuses on the maintenance of price stability. The monetary policy stance will continue to be accommodative, economic agents' financing costs will be favourable. A dichotomy remains between the factors determining likely developments in inflation. Buoyant domestic demand is boosting, while weakening external activity is increasingly restraining the pace of inflation. In the Monetary Council's assessment, previously symmetric risks to inflation became asymmetric in the last quarter. The downside inflation risks have strengthened further, reflecting the effects of the slowdown in European economic activity. Due to the measures taken by global leading central banks, the external monetary policy environment has become looser. The Council will assess the effects of these factors on the maintenance of price stability over the 5-8 quarter horizon of monetary policy. In its monetary policy decisions, the Monetary Council applies a cautious approach, relying mainly on the incoming data and the projections in the quarterly published Inflation Report. Future developments in the outlook for inflation will be a decisive factor in the necessity of further measures."
South Africa,2019-11-21,"South African Reserve Bank PRESS STATEMENT EMBARGO DELIVERY 21 November 2019 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the September meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), global economic indicators have remained weak and global inflation low. Central banks in advanced economies provided more monetary accommodation, helping to ease global financing conditions, but further easing appears less likely. Downside risks from heightened trade tensions and geo-political developments remain. Despite a rebound in local GDP in the second quarter of this year, indicators suggest that economic activity will remain weak for the rest of the year. Recent monthly inflation has been lower than the mid-point of the inflation target range, as owners' equivalent rent, food and services inflation remain subdued. The year-on-year inflation rate, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas, was 3.7% in October (down from 4.1% in September). Goods price inflation in October was 3.1% (down from 4.0% in September), while services price inflation remained at 4.2%. Food and non-alcoholic beverage price inflation slowed to 3.6% (down from 3.9%). The Bank's measure of core inflation, which excludes food. MPC Statement November 21st, 2019 Page 1. The Bank's measure of core inflation, which excludes food. MPC Statement November 21st, 2019 Page 1 fuel and electricity, remains unchanged at 4.0%. Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods decreased to 4.1% in September (compared to 4.5% in August). The medium-term inflation outlook is largely unchanged since September. The inflation forecast generated by the SARB's Quarterly Projection Model (QPM) is unchanged compared to September, averaging 4.2% in 2019, 5.1% for 2020 and 4.7% for 2021. Headline CPI inflation is expected to peak at 5.3% in the first quarter of 2020 and settle at 4.5% in the last quarter of 2021. The forecast for core inflation is lower at 4.2% in 2019 (down from 4.3%), at 4.5% in 2020 (down from 4.7%) and remains steady at 4.6% in 2021. Food price inflation continues to surprise to the downside on a monthly basis, and is expected to peak at about 6.1% in the third quarter of 2020. Inflation expectations have continued to moderate gradually. According to the Bureau for Economic Research (BER) third quarter survey, expectations for headline inflation are down slightly for 2019 to 4.6% (from 4.8%). Expectations for 2020 remain unchanged at 5.0% and eased from 5.2% to 5.1% for 2021, reaching the lowest levels since 2007. Five-year-ahead inflation expectations also declined to 5.0% (from 5.1%). The inflation expectations of market analysts in the November 2019 Reuters Econometer survey remain unchanged at 4.3% for 2019, revised lower to 4.7% (from 4.9%) for 2020 and are unchanged at 4.8% in 2021. Market based expectations implicit in the break-even inflation rates (the yield differential between conventional and inflation-linked bonds) have moderated somewhat since the previous MPC. Five-year break-even inflation rates are currently about 4.5% and ten-year break-even rates are at 5.4%. MPC Statement November 21st, 2019 Page 2. MPC Statement November 21st, 2019 Page 2 Global GDP is expected to average 3.0% in 2019, rising to about 3.4% in 2020. While trade and manufacturing indicators continue to be weak, services have remained more resilient, keeping overall global growth rates up. However, services have shown weakness in some regions and a range of downside risks to growth remain. These include geo-political developments, trade tensions, further oil price shocks, and high levels of corporate and sovereign debt. Across most countries, there is limited policy space to respond to shocks. Inflation outcomes and inflation expectations in most advanced economies remain below targeted levels. Barring significant shocks, monetary policy in major advanced economies will remain accommodative over the medium term. While global financial market sentiment has turned more positive in recent weeks, the risk of renewed market volatility remains high. Since the September MPC, the rand has depreciated slightly by 0.6% against the US dollar, and by 0.8% against the euro. The implied starting point for the rand is R14.94 against the US dollar, compared with R14.88 at the time of the previous meeting. While the rand has benefited from improvements in global sentiment, investors remain concerned about domestic growth prospects and fiscal risks. Although GDP growth rebounded to 3.1% in the second quarter, longer term weakness in most sectors remains a serious concern. Based on recent short term economic indicators for the mining and manufacturing sectors, the third quarter GDP outcome is expected to be weak. Public sector investment has declined, export growth remains low, whereas government and household consumption continue to grow, albeit modestly. MPC Statement November 21st, 2019 Page 3. MPC Statement November 21st, 2019 Page 3 Business confidence remains weak. The RMB/BER Business Confidence Index fell to 21 points (from 28), while the Absa Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 48.1 points in October (from 45.1). The SARB's composite leading business cycle indicator also continued to trend lower, and the coincident indicator decreased month-on-month while remaining positive on a year on year basis. The forecast of GDP growth for 2019 is revised lower at 0.5% (from 0.6%). The forecasts for 2020 and 2021 have decreased to 1.4% (from 1.5%) and 1.7% (from 1.8%), respectively, due to lower growth than previously expected in the third and fourth quarters and downward revisions to global growth. The MPC assesses the risks to the growth forecast to be to the downside. Escalation in global trade tensions, geo-political risks, further domestic supply constraints and/or sustained higher oil prices could generate headwinds to growth. Public sector financing needs have risen, raising the prospect of further pressure on the currency and pushing borrowing costs for the broader economy higher. Implementation of prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms that lower costs and increase investment, potential growth and job creation, remains urgent. The overall risks to the inflation outlook are assessed to be balanced, but uncertainty about inflation risks is unusually high. Demand side pressures remain subdued and house rental prices are expected to increase at only moderate rates. Global inflation should also remain low. Food price inflation has continued to surprise to the downside, but rising imported food prices and uncertain domestic weather patterns raise uncertainty about the future price trajectory. Further upside risks to the inflation outlook include wage growth and fuel, electricity and water prices. The risk of further MPC Statement November 21st, 2019 Page 4. The risk of further MPC Statement November 21st, 2019 Page 4 capital flow volatility has also increased, which could put pressure on the exchange rate. The MPC welcomes the sustained moderation in inflation outcomes and inflation expectations and would like to see inflation expectations anchored closer to the mid- point of the inflation target range on a sustained basis. Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 6.5% per annum. Three members preferred to keep interest rates on hold and two members preferred a cut of 25 basis points. Monetary policy actions will continue to focus on anchoring inflation expectations near the mid-point of the inflation target range in the interest of balanced and sustainable growth. In this persistently uncertain environment, future policy decisions will continue to be highly data-dependent, sensitive to the balance of risks to the outlook, and will seek to look-through temporary price shocks. The implied path of policy rates over the forecast period generated by the Quarterly Projection Model indicated one repo cut of 25 basis points in the third quarter of 2020. This remains a broad policy guide which could change in either direction from meeting to meeting in response to new developments and changing data and risks.

Israel,2019-11-25,"The inflation environment remains low. Inflation in the past 12 months is 0.4 percent, and in the past two months, there has also been a decline in inflation excluding energy and fruits and vegetables, in view of the appreciation of the shekel and the slowdown in the increases of housing and food prices. One-year inflation expectations remained stable around the lower bound of the target range, and medium- and long-term expectations declined slightly. Following the previous interest rate decision, the shekel weakened slightly and then strengthened again, so that in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, it remained stable. However, since the beginning of the year, the shekel has strengthened by 8.9 percent, and the appreciation continues to make it difficult to return inflation to the target range. Economic activity continues to grow at close to its potential rate, despite the negative global sentiment. Services exports are growing strongly, but the standstill in goods exports continues. The labor market remains tight. However, the political situation remains uncertain, and if the government is forced to operate on a continuance budget for a prolonged period, it may have a contractionary effect. Global economic activity continues to slow, and the deterioration in world trade continues. It appears that the process of deepening monetary accommodation by the major central banks has reached its limit at this stage. The signals sent out by the Federal Reserve indicate that the interest rate will remain at its current level unless there is a significant change in the state of the economy, and market assessments are that the ECB is not expected to change its interest rate in the next two years. The Monetary Committee's assessment is that in view of the inflation environment in Israel, the monetary policies of major central banks, the slowing in the global economy, and the continued appreciation of the shekel, it will be necessary to leave the interest rateat its current level for a prolonged period or to reduce it in order to support a process at the end of which inflation will stabilize around the midpoint ofthe target range, and so that the economy will continue to grow strongly. Furthermore, the Committee is taking additional steps as necessary to make monetary policy more accommodative. The Bank of Israel continues to monitor developments in inflation, the real economy, fiscal policy, the financial markets, and the global economy, and will act to attain the monetary policy targets in accordance with such developments. For the file of figures accompanying this notice, clickhere. The CPI reading for September declined by 0.2 percent, and the reading for October increased by 0.4 percent as expected, so that annual inflation remained below the target range. In the past 12 months, inflation was 0.4 percent (Figure 1 in the attached fileof figures). In recent months, there has also been a decline in inflation excluding energy and fruit and vegetables, to 0.5 percent, after having been stable between 0.9 percent and 1.1 percent since the beginning of the year (Figure 2). This decline is mainly due to a slowdown in the rate of increase ofthe housing and food components in the CPI. Inflation of nontradable goods prices continued to moderate, and inflation in the prices of tradable goods remained negative. Despite the decline in actual inflation, one-year expectations remained stabled around the lower bound of the target range (Figure 4). Therewas a slight decline in forward expectations for medium and long terms derived from the capital market, and in the past few months, there has been a moderate but continued decline in long-term expectations (Figure 5). Since the beginning of the year, the shekel has strengthened by 8.9 percent (Figure 6). The appreciation continues to make it difficult to return inflation to the target range. Economic activity continues to grow at near its potential rate, despite the negative global sentiment. However, the continuing uncertainty regarding the political situation in Israel may leave its mark on economic activity. In addition, fiscal policy has so far been expansionary, and if the government is forced to operate on a continuance budget for a prolonged period, it may have a contractionary effect. According to the first estimate of National Accounts data for the third quarter. GDP grew by 4.1 percent (Figure 11). The volatility in vehicle imports continues to be reflected in the data, and the Research Department's assessment is that the growth rate net of this effect was slightly below 3 percent. The gap between the high GDP growth and uses (private and public consumption grew moderately, investment and exports contracted) was reflected in growth of inventory (Figure 12), but itis reasonable to assume that when the data for the quarter are revised, this gap will narrow. Over time, services exports have grown strongly, while goods exports have continued to stagnate. The former has benefited from the continuing boom in the global shares of technology companies (Figure 15), whilethe latter is more sensitive to world trade and to the appreciation of the shekel. The most recent data show a decline in the unemployment rate, alongside declines in the participation and employment rates. Wage increases are continuing, led by the business sector, but at a slightly slower pace than prevailed at the beginning of the year. The job vacancy rate has been declining moderately for several months, but remains high, and at this stage, it is unclear whether it indicates a slowdown in activity. Equityindices in Israel continued to increase, alongside increases in global markets. Long-term government bond yields remained stable since the previous interest rate decision, despite the increase in yields in Europe and the US (Figure 7). Yield spreads between corporate bonds of the nonfinancial business sector and comparable government bonds continued the downward trend that started at the beginning of the year. Home prices continued to increase moderately, and in the past year they have increased by 1.9 percent, while the annual rate of increase in rents is moderating. The number of purchases grew, but purchases by investors appear to be moderating. Mortgage volume continued to expand, and mortgage interest rates continued to decline. The global economy continued to slow (Figure 20). With the exceptionof the United States, most third quarter growth data surprised to the downside, and the main weakness is focused on manufacturing. The balance of risks continues to tend downward, and the deterioration in world trade continues (Figure 21), but the riskof significant worsening in view of the trade war and Brexit has declined. Inflation remains lower than the central banks' guiding targets <b> (Figure 23), but it appears that the process of deepening monetary accommodation by the major central banks has reached its limit at this stage. In the financial markets, the price increases in equity indices have continued (Figure 26). In the US, the Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate by 0.25 percentage points, but signaled that the rate will remain at its current level unless there is a significant change in the state of the economy. Growth surprised to the upside in the third quarter, but it is expected to slow in the fourth quarter. In Europe, growth remains moderate, and industrial production continues to contract, particularly in Germany. The ECB left its interest rate unchanged, and according to market assessments, it is not expected to change in the coming two years. In Japan, growth slowed and is expected to continue slowing in the fourth quarter, in view of the increase in VAT. Growth in China continued to moderate. Oil prices increased since the previous interest rate decision, in view of an expected increase in demand and a reduction of supply (Figure 24). The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on December 9, 2019. The next decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Thursday. January 9, 2020, followed by a press briefing by the Governor."
Nigeria,2019-11-26,"CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO. 127 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING OF MONDAY 25th AND TUESDAY 26th NOVEMBER 2019 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on the 25th and 26th of November 2019 in an environment of continued global macroeconomic uncertainty, but gradual improvements in the domestic economy. The Committee appraised the developments in both the global and domestic economies, as well as the outlook for the rest of the year and the first quarter of 2020. All the eleven (11) members of the Committee were in attendance. The Committee reviewed the effect of monetary policy on developments in the economy in 2019, particularly, price stability, improved credit delivery, low interest rate regime, exchange rate stability, financial system stability, reduction in non-performing loans (NPLs), job creation and output growth. The Committee noted the use of home-grown heterodox policies used by the Bank to successfully achieve substantial macroeconomic stability in 2019. Amongst the policies were the use of the Global Standing Instruction (GSI) to address the predatory impact of serial borrowers in the banking system, a phenomenon that reduced the level of NPLs over time, the Loan to Deposit Ratio (LDR) to boost credit delivery by the deposit money banks (DMBs) to the real sector. Differentiated Cash Reserve Requirement (DCRR). Development Finance Initiatives in agriculture, micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and other real sector activities, including restriction of patronage by local corporate and individual investors in CBN OMO bills. Global Economic Developments Global output growth remained weak due to the impact of the trade war between the US and China; growing vulnerabilities in the financial markets, downturn in global manufacturing, sustained downward pressure on oi prices, lingering uncertainty around BREXIT, which has continued to dampen 1 investment growth in the United Kingdom, subdued growth in the European Union and Japan, and dampening output growth in China. These headwinds resulted in slowing global trade, weakening aggregate demand and contraction in the aggregate supply chain. Major Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDEs) particularly China and India also slowed, while South Africa. Russia and Brazil, recorded slower-than-expected growth. Consequently there was a broad slowdown in global output. In the light of these developments, the IMF revised global growth forecast downwards to 30 per cent in October 2019 from its previous projection of 32 per cent in July 2019. Inflation in most Advanced Economies remained well below their long-run objectives, with price development staying subdued and unemployment trending mostly below the Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment (NAIRU). In the US, wage growth and aggregate demand continued to perform below the long run average even though unemployment remained below the NAIRU. Consequently, the recent trend towards monetary accommodation by key central banks is expected to continue into the foreseeable future. In key EMDEs, however, prices trended upwards with the output gaps widening and unemployment remaining relatively high. Domestic Economic Developments Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 228 per cent in the third quarter of 2019, compared with 212 and 181 per cent in the preceding and corresponding quarters, respectively. The improved growth was driven largely by the performance of the oil sector, which grew by 649 per cent, while the non-oil sector grew by 185 per cent. The Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Indices (PMI) also expanded for the 31st and 30th consecutive months at 582 index points, apiece, in October 2019. Staff projections indicate that real GDP in Q4 2019 is expected to grow by 238 per cent, driven by the non-oil sector. Headwinds to this projection, include: continued high level of unemployment, mild resurgence of anticipated 2 inflationary pressures towards the December festive season, rising public debt, high level of insecurity, and slow pace of oil price recovery. Despite these headwinds, growth is expected to pick on the back of recent actions to boost credit to the private sector through the recent Loan-to-Deposit Ratio (LDR) and Global Standing Instruction (GSI) initiatives, sustained interventions by the Bank in selected employment and growth-enhancing sectors, as well as fiscal policy measures to support growth. The Committee noted the uptick in headline inflation (year-on-year) from 1124 in September to 1161 per cent in October 2019. This was anticipated as part of the seasonal end-of-the year uptick in prices; but was further accentuated by the border closure, an expected temporary food supply shock which will adjust over the medium-to-long term as the economy increase investments in food production. Consequently food inflation rose from 1351 to 1409 per cent in September and October 2019, respectively. Core inflation, the underlying inflation in the economy, however, declined marginally from 894 to 888 per cent in September and October, respectively. The decline observed in core inflation was attributed to the relative stability in the foreign exchange market. The Nigerian land borders were closed to address the incidence of increased cross-border banditry, smuggling and dumping, insurgency and the illegal trade practices of neighbouring countries whose economies had become dependent on Nigeria through smuggling through the borders. The Bank's continued intervention in the agricultural sector is expected to improve medium-term food supply. Indeed there has been reports of bumper harvest in some staples like rice, maize, etc. The Committee observed that broad money supply (M3) grew by 572 per cent (year-to-date) in October 2019, compared with the 2019 indicative benchmark of 1608 per cent. Growth in Net Domestic Credit (NDC) moderated to 2638 per cent in October 2019 from 3033 per cent in the previous month. This was attributed to a significant reduction in credit to Government in October 2019 to 8599 per cent from 11479 per cent in the previous month. Growth in credit to the private sector, however, improved to 1308 per cent in October 2019 from 1249 per cent in the previous month, 3 reflecting the impact of the Bank's recent policy on loan-to-deposit ratio. An increase in absolute gross credit, amounting to N1,,16970 billion, was recorded between end-May and end-October 2019. Consequently the manufacturing sector received N45969 billion, the highest in two decades. This was followed by consumer loans of N35665 billion. General Commerce (N14298 billion). Information and Communications (N8207 billion). Construction (N7452 billion). Agriculture. Forestry and Fishing (N7320 billion). Mining and Quarrying (N364 billion) and Transportation and Storage (N309 billion), amongst others. The Committee, therefore, urged the Management of the Bank to sustain its current efforts to improve lending to the private sector and to explore other initiatives to provide funding to other critical sectors of the Nigerian economy. In the review period, money market interest rates reflected the prevailing liquidity conditions in the banking system. Overall the monthly weighted average Inter-bank call and Open Buy Back (OBB) rates fell to 787 and 722 per cent, respectively, in October 2019, from 1141 and 1073 per cent, respectively, in September 2019. The Committee noted that the persisting bearish trend in the equities market, had started to abate in November 2019, and was pleased by the increased patronage in the sovereign bonds market. The All-Share Index (ASI) grew by 241 per cent to 26,,99142 index points on November 22, 2019, from 26,,35535 index points at end-October 2019. Market Capitalization (MC) also grew by 154 per cent to N1303 trillion on November 22, 2019, from N1283 trillion at end- October 2018, due largely to portfolio shift from short-term Government securities to the equities market. The MPC also noted the improved resilience of the banking system, as the Non- Performing Loans (NPLs) ratio declined further to 656 per cent at end-October 2019 from 667 per cent at end-September 2019 and from 1405 per cent in October 2018. The Committee, however, noted that this figure remained above the prudential benchmark of 50 per cent, and urged the Bank to sustain its current efforts, which have created this exorable prudential regime. Outlook Overall, the medium-term outlook for the domestic and global economies continue to be clouded with uncertainties, associated with the persisting trade wars between the US and its major trading partners, financial vulnerabilities, rising levels of public and corporate debts, pockets of geopolitical tensions and weakening global output. However the reforms underway in the domestic economy; aimed at diversification away from oil over the last three years have provided adequate shock absorber to withstand the headwinds. However the Committee urged the fiscal authorities to invest massively in public works programme and improve fiscal buffers to complement these efforts. Forecasts of key macroeconomic variables, however, indicate prospects of improved output growth for the economy. Based on recent revised projections, the economy is expected to grow in 2019 by 23 per cent (IMF estimate), 21 per cent by the World Bank, and 220 per cent by the CBN. The Committee noted the tailwinds to these developments, to include: sustained stable exchange rate; enhanced flow of credit from the Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) to the private sector; expected improvements in tax revenue and efficiency in public expenditure; continued improvement in the business environment and activities; and the sustained interventions by the Bank in the real sector. The Committee's Considerations The Committee welcomed the improvements in output growth in the third quarter of 2019, noting that the current direction of the Purchasing Managers Index suggests stronger growth in the fourth quarter. It however, re-emphasized the need for diversification to strengthen the productive base of the economy and reduce dependence on oil. Diversification has become necessary now that Nigeria has signed the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCTA). To achieve this, the Committee urged the Federal Government to continue to improve the investment climate and ease of doing business to attract Foreign Direct Investment. Particularly Government should, as a 5 priority, improve conditions for global auto manufacturers, including for aviation and rail industries to invest in the country. The Committee commended the expansion in manufacturing output, noting that it was a direct fallout of the policy on loan-to-deposit ratio. The Committee, called on Government to urge the Pensions Commission to improve the prudential requirements for Pension Funds to refocus their investment portfolio away from their traditional choice of Government securities in favour of other viable long-term investments in real estate, manufacturing and agriculture; and indeed infrastructure. Moreover the Committee called for strong visibility of fiscal and structural policies to improve infrastructure and investment conditions in the economy. It expressed strong optimism that the current policies of the Bank, in a regime of solid fiscal and structural policy support, would yield strong dividends in closing the current negative output gap in the medium to long term, and place the economy on a sustainable and self-sufficient path of output growth. As a key pillar of economic diversification, the MPC directed the attention of the fiscal authorities to the immense potentials of the gas sub-sector and the urgency to encourage horizontal integration through private sector participation. This the Committee argued will improve domestic power supply and export earnings. On price developments, the Committee considered the moderate uptick in headline inflation in October 2019, attributing it partly to an expected temporary shortfall in food supply because of the recent land border closure and rise in demand as the festive season approaches. Although it noted that the price increase was not unexpected, the Committee believed that the medium to long-term benefits far outweigh the short-term cost. Consequently it noted the need to drive down food prices through increased support for local production of staples foods, including rice, fish, poultry, palm oil, tomatoes etc. It also urged the Government to follow through with a sustainable policy on backward integration in the milk industry and other priority sectors of the economy. On the fiscal sector, the Committee identified the need for institutional reforms through policies that would automate day to day processes of key revenue generating and security agencies such as the Nigerian Customs. This would provide additional advantage of stemming smuggling, kidnapping and the migration of terrorists into the country. The MPC reiterated the need for increased efficiency in public expenditure and the building of fiscal buffers. On the impact of the recent closure of Nigerian land borders on domestic food prices, the Committee noted that any upward price movement arising from the closure was reactionary and therefore temporary. Moreover significant investment has been made over the last three years to sustainably increase domestic food supply. It noted some of the key initiatives in this direction to include: the Commodity Development Initiatives, designed to finance the agricultural value chain of ten ((10) commodities namely; Cassava. Cocoa. Cotton. Rice. Tomato. Poultry. Livestock and Dairy. Fish. Oil Palm and Maize, which has received N17166 billion in funding. Four of these crops received over 14012 billion naira or 816 per cent of total disbursements (Cassava, 1144 billion naira; Cotton, 4047 billion naira; Rice, 5340 billion naira; Oil palm, 3481 billion naira). It is, therefore, expected that the outcome of these interventions will close the supply gaps already envisaged in the medium to long term, including dampening domestic prices. It thus, expressed support for the temporal closure of Nigeria's land borders, noting that securing the country's land borders should be further enhanced. On crude oil price, the Committee noted the lull in the futures market, suggesting that prices would remain relatively weak into the foreseeable future. The Committee, therefore, urged the Federal Government to reconsider its 2020 budget oil price benchmark of US$57 per barrel, to build fiscal buffers. The Committee was confident that despite the weaknesses from the external sector, efforts to ramp-up domestic production, through several measures by both the monetary and fiscal authorities, would douse the adverse effects on the domestic economy in the medium term, through the reduction of importation of food and other commodities. The Committee's Decision The MPC reviewed the upsides and the downsides of the options to tighten, hold or loosen. It was conscious that, while tightening may encourage capital inflows, it also has the downside consequence of constraining the already nascent recovery in output growth. The Committee also noted that a reduction in the policy rate will improve growth prospects, but in view of the uptick in inflationary pressures, it decided that the balance of risks was in favour of protecting price stability. Considering the recovery, decline in market interest rates, growth in domestic credit amongst other positive developments, the Committee felt that there would be more gains in the short to medium term in holding policy at its current position. In its consideration to hold, the MPC noted with pleasure, the positive outcome of actions already taken by the Bank. These actions include: current policy on loan-to-deposit ratio, which has resulted in loans and advances rising by over N11trillion between June to October 2019. It further noted that these actions have assisted in boosting credit to the agricultural and manufacturing sectors, hence, the positive outcome on the GDP. The MPC is hopeful that the LDR initiative must be sustained as interest rates being paid by borrowers have so far dropped by up to 400 basis points between June and October 2019. These have happened with corresponding decline in NPLs to 65 per cent at end- October 2019. The MPC is, therefore, of the view that sustaining the MPR at its current level is crucial for better understanding of the unfolding impetus of growth before deciding on any probable variations. The MPC also feels that holding its current policy position offers pathways for appraising the effect of the heterodox policies to encourage lending by the banking industry without varying the policy rate as the downside risk to growth and caution on inflation looks stable. The MPC is also of the view that the improvements in the macroeconomic indicators such as the GDP. NPLs. CAR, and the LDR, suggest that current monetary policy stance is yielding results. It therefore, feels that maintaining the current stance would be necessary in order to sustain the improvements. In view of the foregoing, the Committee decided by a unanimous vote to retain the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) at 135 per cent and to hold all other policy parameters constant. In summary, the MPC voted to: I Retain the MPR at 135 per cent; II. Retain the asymmetric corridor at +200/-500 basis points around the MPR; III. Retain the CRR at 225 per cent; and IV. Retain the Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent. Thank you. Godwin I Emefiele Governor. Central Bank of Nigeria 26th November 2019 9."
South Korea,2019-11-29,"Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period. This press release is the English version of the Bank of Korea's policy statement. In the case of any inconsistency, the original version in Korean will prevail. The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Board considers that the pace of global economic growth has continued to slow as trade has contracted. The global financial markets have been stable in general, as risk aversion has subsided in line mainly with progress in the US-China trade negotiations. Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and the global financial markets as likely to be affected by factors such as the degree of the spread of trade protectionism, the changes in the monetary policies of major countries, and geopolitical risks. The Board judges that the pace of domestic economic growth has remained slow, as consumption growth has weakened, while the adjustment in construction investment and the sluggishness in exports and facilities investment have continued. Employment conditions have continued to improve in some respects, with the increase in the number of persons employed having risen. With respect to the domestic economy during next year, the Board expects the sluggishness in exports and facilities investment will ease somewhat and the consumption growth rate will moderately rise, although the adjustment in construction investment will continue. GDP is forecast to grow at around 2% in 2019 and the lower-2% level in 2020. Consumer price inflation was at the 0% level, due largely to a smaller decline in the prices of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products. Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has been at the mid-0% range, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has remained at the upper-1% level. Looking ahead, it is forecast that during next year consumer price inflation will moderately increase to around 1% and core inflation will be at the upper-0% level. In the domestic financial markets, long-term market interest rates and stock prices have risen and the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has fallen, affected chiefly by movements in the global financial markets. The rate of increase in household lending has continued to slow. Housing prices have risen as the pace of increase has expanded in Seoul and its surrounding areas. Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As it is expected that domestic economic growth will be moderate and it is forecast that inflationary pressures on the demand side will remain at a low level, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance. In this process it will judge whether to adjust the degree of monetary policy accommodation, while carefully monitoring developments in the US-China trade negotiations, the economies and monetary policies of major countries, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks and examining their effects on domestic macroeconomic and financial stability conditions."
Armenia,2019-12-03,"PRESS RELEASE 12.03.2019 In the March 12, 2019 meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) decided to leave the refinancing rate unchanged, at a 5.75% level. There was 0.6% inflation in February of 2019, compared with 0.5% deflation registered in the same month of 2018, in which case the 12-month inflation rate has increased, amounting to 1.9%. The rise in prices of seasonal products has totally contributed to the month's inflation. As global economic growth rates are slowing down, the global demand has somewhat weakened, with a low inflation environment persisting in international markets of basic commodities. In the meantime, central banks of leading countries temporarily withheld from adjusting their monetary conditions. In view of these developments, the Board of the CBA considers that no inflationary pressures from the external sector are likely in the upcoming months. The Board states that, according to Q4, 2018 actual results, the economic activity has been higher than expected, which was driven mainly by the high growth in private consumption. The relatively high economic activity was also observable at the start of 2019; it made up 6.1% in January. It should be noted that at the beginning of the year too, the fiscal policy continues to have a contractionary effect on the domestic demand, which, according to the CBA estimation, will phase out over the first half of the year. In consideration of the current situation, the Board has a preference for the gradual recovery of inflation, as low inflation contributes to anchoring long-term inflation expectations and maintaining purchasing power of incomes. Taking into account the aforementioned trends, the Board finds it reasonable to keep monetary conditions expansionary, leaving the refinancing rate unchanged. At the same time, in view of the anticipated macroeconomic developments, to leave monetary conditions expansionary for a long period of time will be needed for maintaining price stability in the medium run. As a result, the expectation is that the inflation will be running below the target but later stabilizing around the target value in the coming months. Risks to fulfillment of the inflation target in the forecast horizon are assessed still downside, due to both external and internal factors. An adequate monetary policy response will come along if such risks emerge, in order to maintain price stability in the medium run. Detailed information that underlies the decision on setting of the interest rate will be available in Inflation Report (Monetary Policy Program. Q1. 2019) to be published by March 26, 2019. Press Service of the Central Bank of Armenia."
Chile,2019-12-04,"Wednesday, 4 December 2019 Monetary Policy Meeting  December 2019 At its Monetary Policy Meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 1.75%. The decision was adopted by the unanimous vote of all the Board members. In the external scenario, developments relating to the trade war between the United States and China continue to influence the behavior of global activity and financial markets, which adds to the impact of idiosyncratic factors on Latin America's worsened performance. Activity and trade have been in line with expectations. In this context, monetary policy has remained expansionary around the world and stock market indices have risen in the main economies. Despite ups and downs, long-term interest rates and the multilateral dollar are virtually unchanged from the previous Meeting, as are the prices of copper and oil. Locally, the social outbreak has prompted significant changes in various economic sectors and the financial markets, giving way to increased uncertainty. This has resulted in a greater perception of country risk, a deterioration of stock market indicators and increases in fixed-income rates and corporate spreads. The Bank has taken various measures aimed at enhancing market liquidity and mitigating volatility in key financial prices. The peso posted a significant depreciation that, beyond the level reached by the exchange rate, occurred amid a rapid succession of movements in the same direction that resulted in volatility, which was deemed excessive. In this context, the Board announced an intervention program in the forex market that started on 2 [INF*RES*AS] December, which has succeeded in bringing said volatility down. Credit conditions have also been affected, as evidenced by a special poll under the Bank Credit Survey that reports lower demand for credit in some sectors and more stringent supply for persons and companies. Activity and demand have been affected negatively and growth expectations for this year and next have worsened, pointing at significantly lower rates than were foreseen up until mid-October. The labor market is already showing signs of deterioration, as reflected in various sources of information. Meanwhile, household and business confidence indicators has fallen sharply. In this context, the Government announced a package of reactivation measures that entails a major increase in fiscal spending in 2020. In October, annual inflation was 2.5% and market expectations are that it will close the year at or slightly above 3%, reflecting the sharp depreciation of the peso. Two years ahead, the various expectations measures place it at 3%. The path of inflation in the monetary policy horizon will be determined by two key factors. On one hand, lower inflationary pressures deriving from widened capacity gaps and, on the other, cost- push pressures above those previously considered, in particular because of the idiosyncratic nature of the recent peso depreciation. The uncertainty that surrounds the future evolution of the macroeconomic scenario is higher than normal, so it is still premature to figure out which of these two factors will dominate. In accordance to achieving the inflation target, and in a context of increased fiscal impulse and forex intervention, the Board foresees that the monetary policy rate will be kept at its current level over the coming months. The Board reaffirms its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% in the two-year horizon. The December Monetary Policy Report containing the forecasts and analyses that back the decision of the Board will be released tomorrow. Thursday 5 December at 8:30 hours. The minutes from this monetary policy meeting will be published at 8:30 hours of Thursday 19 December 2019. The next monetary policy meeting will be held on Tuesday 28 and Wednesday 29 January 2020, and the statement thereof will be published at 18:00 hours of this latter date. The Spanish original prevails."
Poland,2019-12-04,"Warsaw, 4 December 2019 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 3-4 December 2019 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: â–ª reference rate at 1.50%; â–ª lombard rate at 2.50%; â–ª deposit rate at 0.50%; â–ª rediscount rate at 1.75%. Global economic growth remains relatively low, and uncertainty about the global outlook persists. In the euro area, economic activity growth remains slow alongside the ongoing downturn in industry. In the United States, economic conditions continue to be relatively strong, although, like in many other economies, industrial activity is declining. In China economic activity growth continues to slow down. In these conditions, inflation in many countries is running at a moderate level and in the euro area it is low. The European Central Bank is keeping the deposit rate below zero, while conducting asset purchases and signalling the maintenance of loose monetary policy in the coming quarters. After the interest rate cuts of recent months, the US Federal Reserve is keeping the rates unchanged. In Poland, economic conditions remain good, despite slower economic growth in 2019 Q3. GDP growth is supported by stable consumption growth, fuelled by favourable labour market conditions, very strong consumer confidence and social benefit payments. Investment continues to rise in 2019 Q3, albeit at a slower pace. At the same time, the contribution of net exports to GDP growth remained positive in 2019 Q3. According to the GUS flash estimate, inflation stood at 2.6% y/y in November 2019. Inflation is driven up by elevated food price growth, while being curbed by lower than a year ago energy prices, including fuel prices. Alongside that, core inflation, after a rise in recent months, has remained moderate. In the Council's assessment, the outlook for economic conditions in Poland remains favourable, and GDP growth, despite the expected decline, will continue at a relatively high level in the coming quarters. At the same time, there remains uncertainty about the scale and persistence of the slowdown abroad and its impact on domestic economic activity. Inflation  after a temporary rise in 2020 Q1  will stay close to the target in the monetary policy transmission horizon. The Council judges that the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability."
India,2019-12-05,"Fifth Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2019-20 Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) Reserve Bank of India On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (December 5, 2019) decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 5.15 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains unchanged at 4.90 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 5.40 per cent. The MPC also decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long as it is necessary to revive growth, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Assessment Global Economy 2. Since the MPC's meeting in October 2019, global economic activity has remained subdued, though some signs of resilience are becoming visible. Among the advanced economies (AEs). GDP growth in the US picked up in Q3 on strong private investment and personal consumption expenditure. More recent data, however, indicate that factory activity contracted for the fourth consecutive month in November, while retail sales and industrial production declined in October. In the Euro area. GDP growth remained stable in Q3 relative to the previous quarter on improved household consumption and government spending, although manufacturing activity continued to struggle with lingering geo-political uncertainties. With weak global demand pulling down exports, the Japanese economy lost momentum in Q3. Economic activity in the UK accelerated in Q3, primarily driven by the services sector and construction activity.2 3. Among emerging market economies (EMEs). GDP growth in China decelerated further in Q3, reflecting weak industrial production and declining exports amidst trade tensions with the US. While retail sales edged lower in October, fiscal and monetary stimuli are expected to temper the slowdown. In Russia. GDP growth accelerated in Q3 on the back of an upturn in agricultural output and industrial activity. In South Africa, economic activity contracted in Q3, pulled down by slowing mining and manufacturing activity. In Brazil. GDP growth accelerated further in Q3, driven by agriculture, industry and business investment activity. Crude oil prices have moved in a narrow range in both directions since the last meeting of the MPC, reflecting changing sentiments relating to progress in US-China trade talks. Gold prices traded sideways before falling in early November as a revival of risk appetite eased safe haven demand. Inflation remained benign in major AEs and EMEs in Q3, except in China where it firmed up to its highest level in eight years. Global financial markets were buoyed in October by risk-on sentiment stemming from renewed optimism on a trade truce between the US and China and possibility of a Brexit deal. In the US, equity markets rallied in this environment, also supported by better than expected corporate earnings and strong jobs data. Stock markets in EMEs too registered gains in October before some selling pressure took hold in the second half of November on renewed fears of US-China trade talks stalling on the Hong Kong stand-off. Bond yields in the US firmed up from early October on risk-on sell-offs; however, they softened from mid-November on waning hopes of a near-term resolution of trade disputes. Bond yields in the Euro area remained negative, but expectations that a no-deal Brexit is less likely improved sentiment. In EMEs, bond yields showed mixed movements, driven initially by optimism on US-China trade talks and country-specific factors. In currency markets, the US dollar weakened against other major currencies, while EME currencies have been trading with an appreciating bias. Domestic Economy 6. On the domestic front, gross domestic product (GDP) growth moderated to 4.5 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) in Q2:2019-20, extending a sequential deceleration to the sixth consecutive quarter. Real GDP growth was weighed down by a sharp slowdown in gross fixed capital formation (GFCF), cushioned by a jump in government final consumption expenditure (GFCE). Excluding GFCE. GDP growth would have been at 3.1 per cent. Growth in real private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) recovered from an 18- quarter trough. The drag from net exports eased on account of a sharper contraction in imports than in exports. On the supply side, gross value added (GVA) growth decelerated to 4.3 per cent in Q2:2019-20, pulled down by a contraction in manufacturing. The slowdown in manufacturing activity was also reflected in a decline in capacity utilisation (CU) to 68.9 per cent in Q2:2019-20 from 73.6 per cent in Q1 in the early results of the Reserve Bank's order books, inventories and capacity utilisation survey (OBICUS). Seasonally adjusted CU also fell to 69.8 per cent from 74.6 per cent during the same period. Growth in the services sector moderated, weighed down mainly by trade, hotels, transport,3 communication, broadcasting services and construction activity. However, growth in public administration, defence and other services accelerated in line with the surge in government final consumption expenditure. Agricultural GVA growth increased marginally, despite contraction in kharif foodgrains production in the first advance estimates. Looking beyond Q2, rabi sowing is catching up from the setback caused by delay in kharif harvesting and unseasonal rainfall in October and early November. By November 29, it was only 0.5 per cent lower than the acreage covered a year ago. North-east monsoon precipitation was 34 per cent above the long-period average up to December 4. Storage in major reservoirs, the main source of irrigation during the rabi season, was at 86 per cent of the full reservoir level as on November 28 as compared with 61 per cent in the same period a year ago. Contraction in output of eight core industries  which constitute 40 per cent of the index of industrial production (IIP)  extended into the second consecutive month in October and became more pronounced, dragged down by coal, electricity, cement, natural gas and crude oil. However, output of fertilisers rose sharply, reflecting expectations of robust sowing activity in the rabi season. According to the early results of the Reserve Bank's industrial outlook survey, overall sentiment in the manufacturing sector remained in pessimism in Q3:2019-20 due to continuing downbeat sentiments on production, domestic and external demand, and the employment scenario. The purchasing managers' index (PMI) for manufacturing increased from 50.6 in October to 51.2 in November 2019, driven up by an increase in new orders and output. High frequency indicators suggest that service sector activity generally remained weak in October. Tractors and motorcycles sales  indicators of rural demand  continued to contract but at a moderated pace; however, passenger vehicle sales  an indicator of urban demand  posted a slender positive growth in October after 11 months of decline, reflecting festival season demand and promotional measures by auto companies. Commercial vehicle sales and railway freight traffic contracted. The PMI for services remained in negative zone in October (49.2) due to a decline in new export business and turning down of business expectations. However, it moved into expansion zone to 52.7 in November on a pick-up in new business. Retail inflation, measured by y-o-y changes in the CPI, increased sharply to 4.6 per cent in October, propelled by a surge in food prices. Fuel group prices remained in deflation, while inflation in CPI excluding food and fuel moderated further from its level a month ago. Turning to the drivers of CPI, food inflation spiked to 6.9 per cent in October  a 39- month high  pushed up by a sharp increase in prices of vegetables due to heavy unseasonal rains. Prices of onions, in particular, shot up by 45.3 per cent in September and further by 19.6 per cent in October. Inflation in several other food items such as fruits, milk, pulses and cereals also increased, reflecting diverse factors  the cost push of fodder prices in the case of milk; decline in production and sowing area of pulses; and minimum support price effects. Sugar and confectionery prices moved out of deflation in October as sugarcane output shrank on a y-o-y basis.4 13. Fuel group prices remained weak for the fourth consecutive month in October due to deflation in prices of LPG, firewood and chips. Electricity prices, however, picked up in October following a rise in user charges by power distribution companies (DISCOMs) across 13 states as reflected in the CPI. Inflation in CPI excluding food and fuel softened further from 4.2 per cent in September to 3.4 per cent in October, primarily due to favourable base effects. Price increases also moderated across several services as reflected in transportation fares, telephone charges, tuition fees and house rentals. Households' inflation expectations, measured by the Reserve Bank's November 2019 round of the survey, increased by 120 basis points over the 3-month ahead horizon and 180 basis points over the 1-year ahead horizon as they adapted to the spike in food prices in recent months. Based on the Reserve Bank's consumer confidence survey, spending on non-essential items of consumption has shrunk compared to a year ago; however, consumers expect their overall spending to remain unchanged going forward largely due to an increase in prices. Manufacturing firms polled in the industrial outlook survey of the Reserve Bank expect weak demand conditions and reduced input price pressures in Q3:2019-20 and Q4; and muted output prices reflecting further weakening of pricing power. Overall liquidity in the system remained in surplus in October and November 2019 despite an expansion of currency in circulation due to festival demand. Average daily net absorption under the LAF amounted to 1,98,566 crore in October. The Centre availed of ways and means advances (WMA) in the first week and the last three days of the month to fund its expenditure. In November, the average daily net absorption of surplus liquidity soared to 2,40,566 crore with more frequent and larger recourse to WMA by the Government. Consequently, the Reserve Bank decided to conduct longer-term variable rate reverse repo auctions with effect from November 4, 2019 in addition to overnight variable rate reverse repo auctions. So far, four longer term reverse repo auctions have been conducted  two auctions of 21 days tenor and one each of 35 days and 42 days tenor  absorbing 78,934 crore. Reflecting easy liquidity conditions, the weighted average call rate (WACR) traded below the policy repo rate (on an average) by 8 basis points (bps) in October and by 10 bps in November. Monetary transmission has been full and reasonably swift across various money market segments and the private corporate bond market. As against the cumulative reduction in the policy repo rate by 135 bps during February-October 2019, transmission to various money and corporate debt market segments ranged from 137 bps (overnight call money market) to 218 bps (3-month CPs of non-banking finance companies). Transmission to the government securities market, however, has been partial at 113 bps (5-year government securities) and 89 bps (10-year government securities). Credit market transmission remains delayed but is picking up. The 1-year median marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) has declined by 49 basis points. The weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans sanctioned by banks declined by 44 basis points, while the WALR on outstanding rupee loans increased by 2 basis points during this period. However, transmission is expected to improve going forward as the share5 of base rate loans, interest rates on which have remained sticky, declines; and MCLR- based floating rate loans, which typically have annual resets, become due for renewal. After the introduction of the external benchmark system, most banks have linked their lending rates to the policy repo rate of the Reserve Bank. The median term deposit rate has declined by 47 bps during February-November 2019. The weighted average term deposit rate declined by 9 bps in October as against a decline of just 7 bps in eight months during February-September. This augurs well for transmission to lending rates, going forward. Exports contracted in September-October 2019, reflecting the persisting weakness in global trade. Excluding petroleum products, however, the decline in exports was less pronounced and, in fact, non-oil export growth returned to positive territory in October after a hiatus of two months. Imports contracted faster than exports, with lower international crude oil prices resulting in a decline in the oil import bill. A sharp contraction in the volume of gold imports kept outgoes on this account in check. Non-oil non-gold imports also contracted, pulled down by electronics, coal and pearls and precious stones. Reflecting these developments, the trade deficit narrowed in September- October. On the financing side, net foreign direct investment rose to US$ 20.9 billion in H1:2019-20 from US$ 17.0 billion a year ago. Net foreign portfolio investment was of the order of US$ 8.8 billion in April-November 2019 as against net outflows of US$ 14.9 billion in the same period of last year. In addition, net investment by FPIs under the voluntary retention route have amounted to US$ 6.3 billion since March 11, 2019. Net disbursals of external commercial borrowings rose to US$ 11.5 billion during April- October 2019 as against US$ 1.2 billion during the same period a year ago. India's foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 451.7 billion on December 3, 2019  an increase of US$ 38.8 billion over end-March 2019. Outlook 20. In the fourth bi-monthly resolution of October 2019. CPI inflation was projected at 3.4 per cent for Q2:2019-20, 3.5-3.7 per cent for H2:2019-20 and 3.6 per cent for Q1:2020-21 with risks evenly balanced. The actual inflation outcome for Q2 evolved broadly in line with projections  averaging 3.5 per cent. The inflation print for October, however, was much higher than expected. Going forward, the inflation outlook is likely to be influenced by several factors. First, the upsurge in prices of vegetables is likely to continue in immediate months; however, a pick-up in arrivals from the late kharif season along with measures taken by the Government to augment supply through imports should help soften vegetables prices by early February 2020. Second, incipient price pressures seen in other food items such as milk, pulses, and sugar are likely to be sustained, with implications for the trajectory of food inflation. Third, both the 3-month and 1-year ahead inflation expectations of households polled by the Reserve Bank have risen and these latent sentiment upsides are being reflected in other surveys as well. Fourth, domestic financial markets have exhibited volatility. Fifth, domestic demand has slowed down, which is being reflected in the softening of inflation excluding food and fuel. Sixth, crude oil prices are expected to remain range bound, barring any supply disruptions due to geo-political tensions. Taking6 into consideration these factors, the CPI inflation projection is revised upwards to 5.1-4.7 per cent for H2:2019-20 and 4.0-3.8 per cent for H1:2020-21, with risks broadly balanced (Chart 1). Turning to the growth outlook, real GDP growth for 2019-20 in the October policy was projected at 6.1 per cent  5.3 per cent in Q2:2019-20 and in the range of 6.6-7.2 per cent for H2:2019-20  with risks evenly balanced; and 7.2 per cent for Q1:2020-21. GDP growth for Q2:2019-20 turned out to be significantly lower than projected. Various high frequency indicators suggest that domestic and external demand conditions have remained weak. Based on the early results, the business expectations index of the Reserve Bank's industrial outlook survey indicates a marginal pickup in business sentiments in Q4. On the positive side, however, monetary policy easing since February 2019 and the measures initiated by the Government over the last few months are expected to revive sentiment and spur domestic demand. Taking into consideration these factors, real GDP growth for 2019-20 is revised downwards from 6.1 per cent in the October policy to 5.0 per cent  4.9-5.5 per cent in H2 and 5.9-6.3 per cent for H1:2020-21 (Chart 2). While improved monetary transmission and a quick resolution of global trade tensions are possible upsides to growth projections, a delay in revival of domestic demand, a further slowdown in global economic activity and geo-political tensions are downside risks. The MPC notes that economic activity has weakened further and the output gap remains negative. However, several measures already initiated by the Government and the monetary easing undertaken by the Reserve Bank since February 2019 are gradually expected to further feed into the real economy. Data on corporate finance and on projects sanctioned by banks and financial institutions suggest some early signs of recovery in investment activity, though its sustainability needs to be watched closely. The need at this juncture is to address impediments, which are holding back investments. The introduction of external benchmarks is expected to strengthen monetary transmission. In this context, there is also a need for greater flexibility in the adjustment in interest rates on small saving schemes. In the judgement of the MPC, inflation is rising in the near-term, but it is likely to moderate below target by Q2:2020-21. It is, therefore, prudent to carefully monitor incoming data to gain clarity on the inflation outlook. Similarly, the forthcoming union7 budget will provide better insight into further measures to be undertaken by the Government and their impact on growth. The MPC recognises that there is monetary policy space for future action. However, given the evolving growth-inflation dynamics, the MPC felt it appropriate to take a pause at this juncture. Accordingly, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged and continue with the accommodative stance as long as it is necessary to revive growth, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target. All members of the MPC  Dr.Chetan Ghate. Dr.Pami Dua. Dr.Ravindra H. Dholakia. Dr.Michael Debabrata Patra. Shri Bibhu Prasad Kanungo and Shri Shaktikanta Das  voted in favour of the decision. The minutes of the MPC's meeting will be published by December 19, 2019. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during February 4-6, 2020.

Kazakhstan,2019-12-09,"–43 The base rate remains unchanged at 9.25% December 9, 2019 Almaty The National Bank of Kazakhstan has made a decision to maintain the base rate at 9.25% per annum with the corridor of +/-1 percentage points. The annual inflation is formed below the expectations of the National Bank. The real GDP growth is picking up gradually. In light of the current decision on the base rate, inflation is to develop within the target corridor of 4-6% in 2019-2020. Further decisions on the base rate will be made based on the balance of domestic and external risks, which in turn will determine the level of actual inflation and its alignment with the target. In November 2019 the annual inflation amounted to 5.4% (5.5% in October 2019) and between May and November this year has been stable in a narrow corridor of 5.3  5.5%. Food prices that stabilized at October level and amounted to 9.7% continue to make the largest contribution to the headline inflation. The price increase of meat, bakery products and cereals, which grew up by 13.4% and 15.5% this year, respectively, remains the main cause of food inflation. The ongoing slowdown in the growth of prices for non-food items to 4.8% and paid services to 0.6% has a restraining effect on inflation. Household inflation expectations in November this year rose marginally to 5.8% (5.6% in October 2019) amidst the higher growth in food prices. According to the latest survey, the proportion of respondents expecting persisting or higher consumer price increase over the next 12 months was 54.7% (56.4% in October 2019). Expanding consumer demand and accelerating growth of economic activity remain the main inflation drivers. A growth of household real disposable income reached 6.4% between January and September 2019. Real wages accelerated to 12% in the 3rd quarter of 2019. Meanwhile the growth observed in all major sectors of the economy. Compared to the previous year, the household consumption is propped up by increased budget spending on social transfers and wages, as well as high growth rate of consumer lending (23.8% in annual terms in October 2019). From January to October this year, the short-term economic indicator increased by 4.7% in annual terms. A positive contribution was made by the growth in construction by 12.7%, trade  by 7.5%, transport - by 5.6%, mining and manufacturing- by 3.7% and 3.3%, 1 respectively. The expansion of investments between January and October 2019 amounted to 8.2%. In 2019 the economic growth is estimated by the National Bank at 4.2%, in 2020  3.8%. The growth of consumer demand amid the increase in household real disposable income, an increase in investment demand as a result of the of infrastructure and investment projects implementation, an increase in exports due to the increase in oil and gas condensate production are anticipated to be the major drivers of the economic growth. The impact of external sector factors is relatively neutral. The price of Brent crude oil remains relatively higher than the level used in the base scenario. This year the 11 months average price amounted to 64.1 US dollars per barrel (72.9 US dollars per barrel as of 11 months of 2018). In 2020, the price of oil will be forming close to current levels amid a weak growth of the global economy. The FAO food price index increased by 9.5% in November 2019, driven by higher prices for dairy products, meat, and vegetable oils. A moderate uptick in world grain prices is expected amidst an increase in consumption as a consequence of the reduction in stocks. The external monetary conditions contribute to the easing of the inflationary background. The central banks' policies of reducing interest rates and expanding various stimulus measures proceed. Inflation in the countries - trading partners amidst a slowing inflation in Russia and an ongoing moderate consumer price growth rate in the EU countries has a disinflationary impact on domestic prices in Kazakhstan. The annual inflation is projected within the target range of 4-6% at 5.5-5.7% at the end of 2019 with a slowdown by the end of 2020 to 5.0-5.5%. In the 1st quarter of 2020, the short- term inflationary risks realization and the acceleration of inflation to the upper bound of the target range are considered possible. This is due to the increase in regulated tariffs for paid services for the general public, as well as increase in prices for certain types of food items. In the medium term, the extension of the fiscal stimulus and the output gap, which is estimated by the National Bank as positive, will remain the main drivers, determining the dynamics of inflation in 2020. Current monetary conditions are assessed as weakly restraining due to the need of proactive measures to limit the impact of the widening current account deficit on inflation and exchange rate expectations. The next decision on the base rate will be announced on February 3, 2019, at 15:00 Nur- Sultan time."
Brazil,2019-12-11,"In its 227th meeting, the Copom unanimously decided to lower the Selic rate to 4.50% p.a. The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario:. Data on economic activity since the second quarter indicate that the process of economic recovery picked up relative to the first quarter of 2019. Copom's baseline scenario assumes that this recovery will occur at a gradual pace. Regarding the global outlook, the provision of monetary stimulus in major economies, in a context of economic slowdown and below-target inflation, has been able to generate a relatively favorable environment for emerging economies. The Committee judges that various measures of underlying inflation are running at comfortable levels, including the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy. The Copom's inflation projections in the scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the Focus survey stand around 4.0% for 2019, 3.5% for 2020, and 3.4% for 2021. This scenario assumes a path for the Selic rate that ends 2019 at 4.50% p.a., falls to 4.25% p.a. at the beginning of 2020, ends that year at 4.50% p.a., and rises to 6.25% p.a. in 2021. It also assumes a path for the exchange rate that ends 2019 at R$4.15/US$, 2020 at R$4.10/US$ and 2021 at R$4.00/US$; and. The hybrid scenario with a constant exchange rate at R$4.20/US$*, and the interest rate path from the Focus survey yields inflation projections around 4.0% for 2019, 3.7% for 2020, and 3.7% for 2021. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to lower the Selic rate to 4.50% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation and the associated balance of risks, and it is consistent with convergence of inflation to its target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, which includes 2020 and, to a lesser extent, 2021. The Copom reiterates that economic conditions prescribe stimulative monetary policy, i.e., interest rates below the structural level. The Copom sees progress in the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy. The Committee emphasizes that persevering in this process is essential to allow for the consolidation of the reduction of the structural interest rate and for a sustainable economic recovery. The Copom stresses that the perception of the continuation of the reform agenda affects current expectations and macroeconomic projections. The Copom judges that the current stage of the business cycle recommends caution in the conduct of monetary policy. The Committee emphasizes that its next steps will continue to depend on the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, and inflation projections and expectations. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Roberto Oliveira Campos Neto (Governor). Bruno Serra Fernandes. Carolina de Assis Barros. Fabio Kanczuk. Fernanda Feitosa Nechio. Joao Manoel Pinho de Mello. Mauricio Costa de Moura. Otavio Ribeiro Damaso, and Paulo Srgio Neves de Souza. *Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average R$/US$ exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the Friday prior to the Copom meeting."
Philippines,2019-12-11,"At its meeting on monetary policy today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) facility at 4.0 percent. Accordingly, the interest rates on the overnight deposit and lending facilities were kept unchanged at 3.5 percent and 4.5 percent, respectively.The Monetary Board's decision is based on its assessment of a benign inflation environment. Latest baseline forecasts indicate that the future inflation path remains within the target range of 3.0 Â± 1.0 percentage point in 2020-2021, with well-anchored inflation expectations. Meanwhile, the balance of risks to the inflation outlook continue to lean slightly toward the upside in 2020 and toward the downside in 2021. Upside risks to inflation over the near term emanate mainly from potential volatility in international oil prices amid geopolitical tensions in the Middle East as well as from the potential impact of the African Swine Fever outbreak and recent weather disturbances on domestic food prices. However, uncertainty over trade policies in major economies continue to weigh down on global economic activity and demand and could thus mitigate upward pressures on commodity prices. Notwithstanding the weak global growth outlook, prospects for the Philippine economy continue to be robust on the back of firm domestic demand. Sustained policy support from increased fiscal spending, as well as improved domestic liquidity conditions owing to recent monetary adjustments, is also expected to support growth in the coming months.Given these considerations, the Monetary Board is of the view that the within-target inflation outlook and solid prospects for domestic growth support keeping monetary policy settings steady. Going forward, the BSP will continue to monitor developments affecting the inflation outlook and demand conditions to ensure that the monetary policy stance remains consistent with its price and financial stability objectives."
United States,2019-12-11,"EST December 11, 2019 Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in October indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate. Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Although household spending has been rising at a strong pace, business fixed investment and exports remain weak. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. The Committee judges that the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate to support sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective. The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including global developments and muted inflation pressures, as it assesses the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.

Euroarea,2019-12-12,"Today is the first time that I have had the privilege and pleasure of chairing the monetary policy meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. I am delighted to proceed now with reporting on the outcome of our meeting, together with the Vice-President. The Governing Council meeting was also attended by the Commission Executive Vice-President. Mr Dombrovskis. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We expect them to remain at their present or lower levels until we have seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within our projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics. On 1 November we restarted net purchases under our asset purchase programme (APP) at a monthly pace of â‚¬20 billion. We expect them to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of our policy rates, and to end shortly before we start raising the key ECB interest rates. We also intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. The incoming data since the last Governing Council meeting in late October point to continued muted inflation pressures and weak euro area growth dynamics, although there are some initial signs of stabilisation in the growth slowdown and of a mild increase in underlying inflation in line with previous expectations. Ongoing employment growth and increasing wages continue to underpin the resilience of the euro area economy. The comprehensive package of policy measures that the Governing Council decided in September provides substantial monetary stimulus, which ensures favourable financing conditions for all sectors of the economy. In particular, easier borrowing conditions for firms and households are underpinning consumer spending and business investment. This will support the euro area expansion, the ongoing build-up of domestic price pressures and, thus, the robust convergence of inflation to our medium-term aim. In the light of the subdued inflation outlook, the Governing Council reiterated the need for monetary policy to remain highly accommodative for a prolonged period of time to support underlying inflation pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term. We will, therefore, closely monitor inflation developments and the impact of the unfolding monetary policy measures on the economy. Our forward guidance will ensure that financial conditions adjust in accordance with changes to the inflation outlook. In any case, the Governing Council continues to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro area real GDP growth was confirmed at 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2019, unchanged from the previous quarter. The ongoing weakness of international trade in an environment of persistent global uncertainties continues to weigh on the euro area manufacturing sector and is dampening investment growth. At the same time, incoming economic data and survey information, while remaining weak overall, point to some stabilisation in the slowdown of economic growth in the euro area. The services and construction sectors remain resilient, despite some moderation in the latter half of 2019. Looking ahead, the euro area expansion will continue to be supported by favourable financing conditions, further employment gains in conjunction with rising wages, the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance and the ongoing  albeit somewhat slower  growth in global activity. This assessment is broadly reflected in the December 2019 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. Compared with the September 2019 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real GDP growth has been revised down slightly for 2020. The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook, related to geopolitical factors, rising protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets, remain tilted to the downside, but have become somewhat less pronounced. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation increased from 0.7% in October 2019 to 1.0% in November, reflecting mainly higher services and food price inflation. On the basis of current futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to rise somewhat in the coming months. Measures of underlying inflation have remained generally muted, although there are some indications of a mild increase in line with previous expectations. While labour cost pressures have strengthened amid tighter labour markets, the weaker growth momentum is delaying their pass-through to inflation. Over the medium term, inflation is expected to increase, supported by our monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion and solid wage growth. This assessment is also broadly reflected in the December 2019 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation at 1.2% in 2019, 1.1% in 2020, 1.4% in 2021 and 1.6% in 2022. Compared with the September 2019 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for HICP inflation has been revised up slightly for 2020 and down slightly for 2021, mainly driven by the expected future path of energy prices. Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth stood at 5.6% in October 2019, unchanged from the previous month. Sustained rates of broad money growth reflect ongoing bank credit creation for the private sector and low opportunity costs of holding M3 relative to other financial instruments. The narrow monetary aggregate M1 continues to be the main contributor to broad money growth on the components side. The growth of loans to firms and households remained solid, benefiting from the continued pass-through of our accommodative monetary policy stance to bank lending rates. The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations increased to 3.8% in October, up from 3.6% in September, while the annual growth rate of loans to households continued on its gradual upward path, reaching 3.5% in October. Our accommodative monetary policy stance will help to safeguard very favourable bank lending conditions and will continue to support access to financing, across all economic sectors and in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is still necessary for the continued robust convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute more decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential, supporting aggregate demand at the current juncture and reducing vulnerabilities. The implementation of structural policies in euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up to boost euro area productivity and growth potential, reduce structural unemployment and increase resilience. The 2019 country-specific recommendations should serve as the relevant signpost. Regarding fiscal policies, the euro area fiscal stance is expected to remain mildly expansionary in 2020, thus providing support to economic activity. In view of the weakened economic outlook, the Governing Council welcomes the Eurogroup's call for differentiated fiscal responses and its readiness to coordinate. Governments with fiscal space should be ready to act in an effective and timely manner. In countries where public debt is high, governments need to pursue prudent policies and meet structural balance targets, which will create the conditions for automatic stabilisers to operate freely. All countries should intensify their efforts to achieve a more growth-friendly composition of public finances. Likewise, the transparent and consistent implementation of the European Union's fiscal and economic governance framework over time and across countries remains essential to bolster the resilience of the euro area economy. Improving the functioning of Economic and Monetary Union remains a priority. The Governing Council welcomes the ongoing work and urges further specific and decisive steps to complete the banking union and the capital markets union."
Peru,2019-12-12,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT DECEMBER 2019 BCRP MAINTAINED REFERENCE RATE AT 2.25% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to maintain the reference rate at 2.25 percent, in light of the following developments: Year-on-year inflation is expected to be around 2.0 percent over the forecast horizon, with a moderate downside bias due to the possibility of a lower-than-expected increase in domestic demand. Monthly inflation was 0.11 percent in November, bringing year-on-year inflation down to 1.87 percent, from 1.88 percent in October. With monthly inflation excluding food and energy at 0.04 percent in November, the year-on-year figure decreased to 2.31 percent, from 2.34 percent in October. One-year ahead expected inflation as of November was 2.2 percent. The weak performance of primary industries and General Government investment in January- October was offset by a recovery in non-primary industries. Business conditions expectations improved slightly in November; and economic activity indicators point to a gradual closure of the output gap. Global growth risks from trade tensions have attenuated. The BCRP Board pays close attention to new information on inflation and its determinants in assessing future changes in the monetary policy stance. The Board also decided to maintain the interest rates on BCRP off-auction credit and deposit operations in domestic currency with financial entities. Overnight deposits: 1.00 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 2.80 percent per year for financial entities' first 10 operations over the last 12 months; and the rate fixed by the BCRP Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations Committee for operations other than financial entities' first 10 operations over the last 12 months. Dollar swaps: a fee equal to a minimum annual effective cost of 2.80 percent. The schedule of monetary policy meetings for the next twelve months is the following: January 9 February 13 March 12 April 16 May 7 June 11 July 9 August 13 September 10 October 7 November 12 December 10."
Turkiye,2019-12-12,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to reduce the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) from 14 percent to 12 percent. Recent data indicate that recovery in economic activity continues. Sectoral diffusion of economic activity continues to improve. However, investment demand remains weak. While favorable effects of improved competitiveness prevail, weakening global economic outlook tempers external demand. As the contribution of net exports to economic growth declines, economic recovery is expected to be sustained with the help of the ongoing disinflation process and improvement in financial conditions. Current account balance, which has recently recorded significant improvement, is expected to maintain a moderate course with the contribution of supportive policy measures. Weakness in global economic activity and low levels of global inflation strengthen expectations regarding the continuation of expansionary monetary policies in advanced economies. While current global financial conditions support the demand for emerging market assets and the risk appetite, rising protectionism and uncertainty regarding global economic policies are closely monitored in terms of their impact on both capital flows and international trade. Inflation outlook continued to improve while inflation expectations displayed a wide-spread decline. Thanks to the stable course of the Turkish lira as well as the developments in domestic demand conditions and producer prices, core inflation indicators have displayed a mild trend. The improvement in macroeconomic indicators, inflation in particular, supports the fall in country risk premium and contributes to a benign outlook in cost factors. Underlying trend indicators, supply side factors and import prices lead to an improvement in the inflation outlook. In light of these developments, recent forecasts suggest that inflation is likely to materialize close to the lower bound of the October Inflation Report projections for the end of the year, with risks around the disinflation path for 2020 being balanced. Accordingly, considering all the factors affecting inflation outlook, the Committee decided to reduce the policy rate by 200 basis points. At this point, the current monetary policy stance is considered to be consistent with the projected disinflation path. The Committee assesses that maintaining a sustained disinflation process is the key for achieving lower sovereign risk, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery. Keeping the disinflation process in track with the targeted path requires the continuation of a cautious monetary stance. In this respect, the extent of the monetary tightness will be determined by considering the indicators of the underlying inflation trend to ensure the continuation of the disinflation process. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability and financial stability objectives. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Ukraine,2019-12-12,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to cut the key policy rate to 13.5% per annum effective 13 December 2019. The NBU speeds up the monetary policy easing, as the rapid appreciation of the hryvnia makes inflationary pressures decline faster than expected. In November 2019, consumer inflation decreased sharply, reaching 5.1% yoy, which was below the NBU's latest forecast. In such a way, inflation reached the medium-term target of 5%, set by the NBU in 2015. The steady disinflation has been driven by a gradual easing of underlying pressures on prices, reflected in a slowdown of core inflation, and by lower energy prices. Inflation slowed markedly due to both the strengthening of the hryvnia and an improvement in inflation expectations. The above factors neutralized the pressure on prices from robust consumer demand and worse harvest of some vegetables. The hryvnia strengthened due to several reasons. In OctoberNovember, the excess supply of foreign currency was mainly driven by proceeds from Ukrainian exports, in particular thanks to a record harvest of grain and oil crops, and selling foreign currency coming from borrowings of state-owned companies. Foreigners continued to invest in hryvnia government bonds, but it did not have major influence on the foreign exchange market, unlike in the past months. At the same time, the NBU actively purchased excess foreign currency to replenish international reserves. Net foreign exchange interventions have totaled over USD 5.5 billion since the start of 2019. The inflation forecast will be revised taking into account the FX market conditions. The stronger hryvnia made inflation decline towards the 5% target faster than envisaged in the latest macroeconomic forecast. The NBU will publish the updated macroeconomic forecast, including the inflation forecast, at the end of January. Reaching the staff-level agreement on the new cooperation program with the International Monetary Fund is an important milestone in the progress of structural reforms in Ukraine as well as in maintaining macrofinancial stability and steady economic growth. At the same time, other risks that the NBU took into consideration when making its previous monetary policy decision remain in place. In particular, the risk of rising threats to macrofinancial stability persists because of court rulings and pressure on the NBU. If materialized, these risks could worsen exchange rate and inflation expectations, and make it harder for Ukraine to access the international capital markets at a time when debt repayments are peaking. The following external risks remain relevant:. a complete halt of the transit of Russian gas through Ukraineintensified trade tensions and more turbulent global financial marketsan escalation of the military conflict and new trade restrictions introduced by Russia.Therefore, macroeconomic conditions that are more conducive lower inflation, continued cooperation with the IMF, and the practically unchanged balance of risks have enabled the NBU to ease monetary policy more quickly. The NBU Board believes that more active cuts in the key policy rate will not prevent it from maintaining inflation close to its 5% target, while at the same time promoting economic growth. The macroeconomic forecast that the NBU published in October envisages that the key policy rate will be cut further, to 8%. A revised macroeconomic forecast will be made public in January 2020. Among other things, the forecast will take into account the impact of consumer demand and FX market conditions on future inflation. In addition, the NBU will continue to monitor what progress is achieved in implementing key domestic reforms. These reforms are those that are envisaged in the memorandum of understanding signed by the Ukrainian government and the NBU, and the judicial reform required to establish the rule of law in Ukraine. The decision to cut the key policy rate to 13.5% was approved by NBU Board Decision No. 925-D On the Key Policy Rate, dated 12 December 2019. A summary of the discussion by Monetary Policy Committee members that preceded this decision will be published on 23 December 2019. The next meeting of the NBU Board on monetary policy issues will be held on 30 January 2020 as scheduled."
Russia,2019-12-13,"On 13 December 2019, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to cut the key rate by 25 bp to 6.25% per annum. Inflation slowdown is overshooting the forecast. Households' inflation expectations continue to decrease. Price expectations of businesses remain overall unchanged. The growth rate of the Russian economy increased in Q3; however, its stability has yet to be assessed. Risks of a substantial global economic slowdown persist. Disinflationary risks still exceed pro-inflationary risks over the short-term horizon. Given the monetary policy stance, annual inflation will come in at 3.54.0% in 2020 and will remain close to 4% further on. If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia will consider the necessity of further key rate reduction in the first half of 2020. In its key rate decision-making, the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic developments over the forecast horizon, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. Inflation dynamics. Inflation slowdown is overshooting the forecast. The annual consumer price growth rate declined to 3.5% in November (from 3.8% in October 2019) and was close to 3.4% according to the estimates as of 9 December. November results show that annual core inflation also decreased to 3.5% as compared to 3.7% in October. According to the Bank of Russia's estimates, inflation indicators reflecting the most sustainable price movements are close to or below 4%. The Bank of Russia forecasts that inflation will range between 2.93.2% at the end of 2019. In November, disinflationary factors continued to exert considerable influence on inflation. Annual growth in prices of food products and non-food goods continued to decline. Such one-off factors as a good harvest and expanded supply in individual food market segments help maintain low growth rates of food prices, seasonally adjusted. The ruble appreciation since the beginning of the year alongside with inflation slowdown in Russia's trading partners limits growth of import prices. Subdued demand continues to influence inflation, including external demand. However, inflation acceleration registered in November in the services sector where prices are determined by the market may point to a revival in consumer demand. In November, households' inflation expectations continued to decrease, while remaining elevated. Business price expectations remain overall unchanged. Annual inflation slowdown paves the way for a future decline in inflation expectations of households and businesses. In accordance with the Bank of Russia forecast, given the monetary policy stance, annual inflation will come in at 3.54.0% in 2020 and will remain close to 4% further on. Meanwhile, annual inflation will be below 3% in 2020 Q1 when the effect of the VAT rate hike is factored out from its calculation. Monetary conditions. Monetary conditions have continued to ease since the last Board meeting. OFZ yields and deposit and lending rates have been down. The Bank of Russia's decisions to cut the key rate and the decline in OFZ yields create conditions for a further reduction in deposit and lending rates; this will support the expansion of corporate and mortgage lending. The Bank of Russia will assess the effect of the adopted key rate decisions on monetary conditions and inflation movements. Economic activity. In 2019, the GDP growth rate may be close to the upper bound of the Bank of Russia forecast of 0.81.3%. This is primarily associated with a higher-than-expected GDP growth rate in Q3. However, the stability of such economic growth rates has yet to be assessed. Domestic demand dynamics improved somewhat in Q3â€”Q4. A slight increase was registered in investment activity, among other things, on the back of a rise in budget capital expenditure. In October, the annual growth rate of retail trade turnover increased. Industrial production continued to grow in annual terms. However, leading indicators point to a still weak business sentiment in industrial sector, which is mostly specific of export orders. Economic activity continues to be constrained by weakening external demand for Russian exports on the back of a global economic slowdown. The labour market creates no additional inflationary pressure. The fact that unemployment remains near historic lows is not driven by expanding labour demand but rather by a simultaneously contracting number of employees and the labour force. In the second half of 2019, fiscal policy started to encourage economic growth on the back of, among other things, the implementation of national projects planned by the Government. Going forward, the rise in government expenditures, including investment ones, will contribute to economic growth. The Bank of Russia has left the 20202022 GDP growth forecast unchanged. The GDP growth rate will gradually increase from 0.81.3% in 2019 to 23% in 2022. This will be possible should the Government's measures for overcoming structural constraints, including the implementation of national projects, be realised. However, reduced global economic growth expected over the forecast horizon will continue to exert a constraining impact on growth of the Russian economy. Inflation risks. Disinflationary risks still exceed pro-inflationary risks over the short-term horizon. This is primarily related to the state of domestic and external demand. Disinflationary risks associated with movements in prices of certain food products persist, including on the back of a rise in supply of farm produce. Meanwhile, pro-inflationary factors should be taken into consideration. Risks that food market trends may reverse cannot be ruled out, given that the ratio of temporary and permanent factors for this market is hard to estimate. At the same time, the monetary policy easing that has already been undertaken may have a stronger upward effect on inflation than the Bank of Russia estimates. Should the global economic slowdown be more pronounced, including due to tightening international trade restrictions and on the back of other geopolitical factors, this might lead to strengthened volatility in global commodity and financial markets, affecting exchange rate and inflation expectations. That said, pro-inflationary risks posed by budget expenditure growth in 2020 hold low because the rise in expenditures is likely to be distributed over time. A number of internal conditions continue to pose pro-inflationary risks over a longer-term horizon. Significant risks are posed by elevated and unanchored inflation expectations. The mid-term inflation dynamics may also be affected by fiscal policy parameters, including decisions on the investment of the liquid part of the National Wealth Fund in excess of the threshold level set at 7% of GDP. The Bank of Russia leaves mostly unchanged its estimates of risks associated with wage movements and possible changes in consumer behaviour. These risks remain moderate. If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia will consider the necessity of further key rate reduction in the first half of 2020. In its key rate decision-making, the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic developments over the forecast horizon, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. In the follow-up to the Board of Directors' meeting of 13 December 2019 the Bank of Russia released its medium-term forecast. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next key rate review meeting on 7 February 2020. The press release on the Bank of Russia Board decision and the medium-term forecast are to be published at 13:30 Moscow time. The reference to the Press Service is mandatory if you intend to use this material."
Hungary,2019-12-17,"At its meeting on 17 December 2019, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 18 December 2019:. The Magyar Nemzeti Bank's (MNB) single anchor is inflation, its primary objective is to achieve and maintain price stability. Therefore, in assessing the outlook, the Monetary Council pays more attention to the measures of underlying inflation capturing persistent trends. In November 2019, inflation, core inflation and core inflation excluding indirect tax effects stood at 3.4 percent, 4.0 percent and 3.6 percent, respectively. The increase in inflation mainly reflected the base effect in fuel prices and a rise in food prices. A dichotomy still remains between the factors determining likely developments in inflation. Buoyant domestic demand is boosting, while persistently muted external activity is restraining the pace of inflation. In the past quarter, fears of recession subsided in the euro area. As a result, risks to the outlook for domestic inflation became balanced again. The consumer price index is expected to rise further temporarily until January 2020, mainly reflecting the base effect of fuel prices and the increase in food prices. Following a gradual decline, inflation is likely to stabilise at the 3 percent inflation target in the second half of the forecast horizon. In the coming months, core inflation excluding indirect tax effects is expected to remain around its current level and is likely to decrease from the first quarter of 2020. In the third quarter of 2019, broad-based economic growth continued. Labour demand remained strong and the unemployment rate was close to its historically low level. With dynamic export growth, the trade surplus in the third quarter exceeded significantly its value a year earlier. In the coming years, the Hungarian GDP is expected to grow at a slightly higher rate than earlier projected. In the private sector, strong wage growth is expected to continue and may remain double-digit in 2020, as well. The rate of consumption growth is likely to slow somewhat. The household savings rate is expected to be persistently high. In line with the favourable financing environment, companies' investment activity is expected to remain buoyant. Strong investment activity is likely to increase imports over the short term, but the creation of new production capacities is expected to support Hungary's exports and potential output growth over the longer term. Net exports made an almost neutral contribution to economic growth in 2019 and are expected to make a positive contribution again between 2020 and 2022. Hungary's GDP is likely to grow by 3.7 percent in 2020 and by 3.5 percent in 2021 and 2022, respectively. Economic convergence with the euro area economy is likely to continue with the maintenance of the at least 2 percentage point growth surpluses. In addition to monetary policy, both the Hungarian Government Security Plus (MÃP+) and counter-cyclical fiscal policy strengthen Hungary's macroeconomic stability and reduce external vulnerability. The MÃP+ contributes to the maintenance of high savings rate. Fiscal policy will make counter-cyclical reserves in the coming years, as well. The gradual improvement in economic competitiveness contributes to the maintenance of economic growth on a sustainable path. World economy grew at a more restrained pace in the third quarter of 2019, while global inflation continued to decrease. The euro-area's leading economies avoided a recession; however, the outlook for growth remained persistently muted. The deterioration in business survey indicators stopped, which may indicate further moderation of recession risks, looking ahead. Sentiment in international financial markets has remained broadly unchanged since the Council's previous policy decision. Risk appetite was influenced by developments in international trade policies, decisions of the world's leading central banks and the events related to Brexit. Oil prices have risen over the past month. The external monetary policy environment has become looser in the last quarter. As a result of the three interest rate cuts this year, in the assessment of the Federal Reserve's decision-makers, monetary policy stance is appropriate to achieve the central bank targets. The European Central Bank (ECB) left its base rate unchanged in December. In November. ECB restarted asset purchases in line with its September decision. The communication of the world's leading central banks does not indicate further loosening measures, while loose monetary policy environment is expected to be maintained persistently. The Monetary Council left the base rate, the overnight collateralised lending rate and the one-week collateralised lending rate at 0.9 percent and the overnight deposit rate at -0.05 percent unchanged. In addition, in December the Council left the average amount of liquidity to be crowded out for the first quarter of 2020 unchanged at a minimum of HUF 300-500 billion and will take this into account in setting the stock of central bank swap instruments. The MNB changes the stock of the FX swap instrument in a flexible manner to ensure that the interest rate transmission changes in line with the decisions by the Monetary Council. To improve the effectiveness of monetary policy, the Monetary Council launched its Bond Funding for Growth Scheme on 1 July 2019. Under the Scheme, the MNB started bond purchases in September. Due to the great interest, central bank purchases are likely to exceed two-thirds of the total amount available under the Scheme until the end of 2019, with the remaining part likely to be used early next year. Taking into account the high utilization of the Scheme, the Monetary Council will raise the original total amount of HUF 300 billion to HUF 450 billion from 1 January 2020 with all other conditions left unchanged. The MNB will neutralise excess liquidity arising from bond purchases by using the preferential deposit facility bearing interest at the central bank base rate. The programme complements the Funding for Growth Scheme Fix launched at the beginning of 2019 to build a healthier lending structure. Under the scheme, participating credit institutions concluded loan contracts with domestic SMEs totalling more than HUF 340 billion until the end of November. In its decisions, the Monetary Council focuses on the maintenance of price stability. The monetary policy stance will continue to be accommodative, economic agents' financing costs will be favourable. A dichotomy remains between the factors determining likely developments in inflation. Buoyant domestic demand is boosting, while persistently muted external activity is restraining the pace of inflation. Following a temporary rise, the consumer price index is likely to decline gradually and is expected to return to close to the 3 percent inflation target in the second half of the forecast horizon. In the Monetary Council's assessment, risks to inflation has become symmetric again. In the coming years. Hungary's GDP growth is likely to be slightly higher than earlier projected, while the outlook for growth in the euro area is likely to be persistently muted. Consistent with this, the external monetary policy environment is expected to remain persistently loose; however, forward guidance of the world's leading central banks does not indicate further loosening measures. The Monetary Council will assess the effects of these factors on the maintenance of price stability over the 5-8 quarter horizon of monetary policy. In its monetary policy decisions, the Monetary Council applies a cautious approach, relying mainly on the incoming data and the projections in the quarterly published Inflation Report. Future developments in the outlook for inflation will be a decisive factor in the necessity of further measures."
Czech Republic,2019-12-18,"At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank decided to keep interest rates unchanged. The two-week repo rate thus remains at 2%, the discount rate at 1% and the Lombard rate at 3%. Five members voted in favour of this decision, and two members voted for increasing rates by 25 basis points. . This decision is underpinned by the November macroeconomic forecast and by an assessment of information obtained it was prepared. Inflation will be close to the upper boundary of the tolerance band around the inflation target in the quarters ahead and will converge towards the 2% target over the monetary policy horizon. Consistent with the forecast is a rise in domestic market interest rates in this quarter and the next, followed by a decline from mid-2020. At its meeting today, however, the Bank Board assessed the risks as being tilted towards lower-than-forecasted interest rates in the coming quarters. As regards the external assumptions of the forecast, expected economic growth in the euro area has been lowered marginally for next year, whereas the outlook for producer and consumer prices has risen very slightly. The 3M EURIBOR outlook for the two years ahead has also been revised slightly upwards. The market outlook for the Brent crude oil price has been shifted upwards over the entire forecast horizon, and more markedly so for next year. Compared with the assumptions of the current forecast, the outlook for the euro-dollar exchange rate is unchanged. Domestic inflation was close to the upper boundary of the tolerance band around the target during Q4 and rose slightly above the forecast and the tolerance band boundary in November. The deviation from the forecast was small and due mainly to faster-than-expected growth in food prices. Core inflation and fuel prices were also slightly above the forecast. On the other hand, administered price inflation accelerated rather more slowly than expected. The growth of the Czech economy slowed slightly in Q3 and was just below the forecast. The slower-than-expected GDP growth was due to somewhat more moderate growth in household consumption and a lower contribution of net exports. The latter was due to a higher-than-expected increase in goods and services imports, whereas exports were in line with the forecast. By contrast, the contributions of government consumption and gross capital formation to GDP growth were bigger than forecasted. Within the latter, fixed investment remained broadly stable in line with the forecast, so the higher contribution to growth was due to change in inventories. Industrial production declined year on year in Q3 and was broadly flat in October. Construction output followed a similar pattern. Retail sales continued to rise swiftly in October, signalling solid household consumption growth for the end of this year. Total employment growth remained subdued, in line with the forecast. As expected, the unemployment rate stayed close to its historical low. The number of job vacancies was meanwhile still high. Wage growth slowed slightly in Q3, lagging somewhat behind the forecast owing to lower-than-expected wage growth in market sectors. So far in Q4, the koruna-euro exchange rate has appreciated slightly and has been marginally stronger than forecasted on average. Domestic money market interest rates were almost unchanged from the previous meeting and are thus slightly below the forecast. To sum up the important facts about recent developments in the Czech economy, prices are increasing slightly faster than forecasted, whereas GDP and wages are rising rather more slowly. The unemployment rate is in line with the forecast."
Thailand,2019-12-18,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 8/2019 Mr. Titanun Mallikamas. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 18 December 2019 as follows. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 125 percent. In deliberating their policy decision, the Committee assessed that the Thai economy would expand at a lower rate than the previous forecast and below its potential due to a decline in exports which affected employment and domestic demand. Headline inflation was projected to be below the lower bound of the inflation target. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative due to the previous two policy rate cuts. Financial stability risks had already been addressed to some extent, although there remained pockets of risks that warranted monitoring. The Committee viewed that more accommodative monetary policy in the recent period would contribute to economic growth and support the rise of headline inflation toward the target. The Committee thus voted to maintain the policy rate at this meeting and would assess risks to the economic outlook in deliberating appropriate monetary policy going forward. The Committee viewed that the global economic outlook started to stabilize, resulting in an improving outlook for Thai exports and economic growth next year. Nevertheless the economy would expand below its potential and below the previous forecast. Merchandise exports had contracted more than previously assessed and were projected to recover more slowly than expected. This would be due to the slowdown of global trade volume affected by trade tensions and the impact of structural changes in the manufacturing sector on export competitiveness. Tourism would continue to grow. Regarding domestic demand, public expenditure and private investment would expand more slowly than the previous forecast owing partly to delays in some state-owned enterprise investment projects and some public-private partnership infrastructure investment projects. Private consumption would decelerate due to lower household income and employment, particularly in export-related manufacturing sectors. Elevated household debt would also weigh on private consumption in the period ahead. Furthermore the Committee would continue to monitor ongoing uncertainties pertaining to the risks from trade tensions and geopolitics. The Committee would also monitor the impact of fiscal stimulus measures and public expenditure, the progress of major infrastructure investment and its knock-on effects on private investment, together with structural changes in the labor market which would impact employment in the period ahead. The annual averages of headline inflation in 2019 and 2020 were projected to be below the lower bound of the inflation target due to lower-than-expected energy prices in tandem with subdued global economic growth and increasing energy supply. Core inflation would gradually increase in line with the improving economic outlook. The Committee viewed that structural changes contributed to more persistent inflation than in the past. Such changes included the expansion of e-commerce, rising price competition, and technological development which reduced costs of production. Financial conditions over the previous period had been accommodative. Real interest rates and government bond yields remained low. Liquidity in the financial system remained ample. These allowed financing by the private sector to continue expanding. However loans extended to both businesses and consumers would exhibit slower growth. With regard to exchange rates, despite the baht being largely stable relative to the previous meeting, its movements in the previous period were two-way and more in line with regional currencies. The Committee expressed concerns over baht appreciation against trading partner currencies, and thus saw a need to continue to closely monitor exchange rates and capital flows amid elevated external uncertainties. Moreover the Committee would monitor the effectiveness of the relaxation of foreign exchange regulations to encourage capital outflows, as well as consider the necessity of implementing additional measures. Financial stability remained sound overall, but there remained a need to monitor risks that might pose vulnerabilities to financial stability in the future, especially the deterioration in the quality of SME loans. The Committee viewed that the implemented macroprudential measures had, to some extent, curbed accumulation of vulnerabilities in the financial system. However there remained a need to monitor search-for-yield behavior in the prolonged low interest rate environment, debt accumulation and debt servicing capability of households and SMEs, growth in assets held by saving cooperatives and the interconnectedness among saving cooperatives, and leverage by large corporates that might underprice risks. The Committee viewed that microprudential and macroprudential measures should be appropriately combined to ensure financial stability. Looking ahead, the Committee would monitor developments of economic growth, inflation, and financial stability, together with associated risks, in deliberating monetary policy going forward. The Committee would stand ready to use policy tools as appropriate. In addition, the Committee would monitor structural problems that affect competitiveness and economic growth outlook, which should be firmly addressed by all related parties."
Mexico,2019-12-19,"Although domestic financial markets in Mexico underwent episodes of volatility associated with social developments in certain Latin American countries, financial assets in Mexico and the peso exchange rate have recently exhibited positive results. The agreement to approve the USMCA together with the monetary policy stance have contributed to such results. As for the risks that could affect the performance of domestic financial assets, there is still uncertainty over the credit rating outlook for Pemex and Mexico's sovereign debt as well as a possible contagion from emerging economies, mainly from Latin America. The current environment continues to pose risks that could affect the country's macroeconomic conditions, its ability to grow, and the economy's price formation process. In this regard, it is particularly important that, in addition to a prudent and firm monetary policy, measures to foster an environment of confidence and certainty for investment and higher productivity are adopted, and that public finances are consolidated in a sustainable way. In this context, strengthening the credit rating outlook for the sovereign and Pemex's debt, as well as achieving the fiscal targets for 2019 and the goals set in the 2020 Economic Package are necessary. Strengthening the rule of law, tackling corruption, and fighting insecurity are equally imperative. Although available information for the fourth quarter of 2019 is limited, the weakness that economic activity has been exhibiting for several quarters is expected to persist. This implies that negative slack conditions have widened with respect to those observed in the previous quarter. The growth outlook is in line with the one published in Banco de Mexico's Quarterly Report July-September 2019. In an environment of significant uncertainty, the balance of risks for growth remains biased to the downside. In November, headline inflation was 2.97%. The annual change of the non-core component was particularly low, reaching 0.98%, while that of the core component has remained persistent, albeit decreasing slightly at 3.65%. Short-term inflation expectations have moderated, while those for longer terms remain above 3%. Expectations for headline inflation for the end of 2019 could be below the forecasts of the Quarterly Report July-September 2019. For 2020, core and headline inflation will reflect 1 both the greater amount of slack in the economy and the cost-related pressures resulting from the recent minimum wage revisions, which could locate them moderately above the levels anticipated in the last quarterly report. Regarding inflation risks, those to the upside are: core inflation's persistence; that the recent minimum wage increase leads to wage revisions that exceed productivity gains in different segments of the employed population and that this generates cost-related pressures, thus affecting formal employment and prices; that the peso exchange rate comes under pressure from external or domestic factors, although the easing of certain external tensions and progress in ratifying the UMSCA have reduced such risk; possible tariff and compensatory measures, although this risk has diminished; increases in agricultural, livestock or energy prices greater than expected; and, that public finances deteriorate. As for downside risks: a greater appreciation of the peso exchange rate, which could be associated with a context of greater risk appetite in international financial markets or with the final steps towards ratifying the trade agreement with the United States and Canada; a widening of slack conditions or its impact on core inflation greater than foreseen; and, that the prices of certain goods included in the non-core subindex register lower rates of change. In this context, uncertainty still persists regarding the risks that could make inflation deviate from the described trajectory. To guide its monetary policy actions. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board follows closely the development of inflation vis-Ã -vis its forecasts, taking into account the monetary policy stance and the time frame in which monetary policy operates. In this process, it uses available information on all inflation determinants as well as on medium- and long-term inflation expectations, including the balance of risks for such factors. Monetary policy must also act prudently if for any reason the uncertainty faced by the economy increases significantly. In this context, considering the lower levels registered by headline inflation, its outlook within the time frame in which monetary policy operates, the more ample slack in the economy, as well as the recent behavior of external and domestic yield curves. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board decided by majority to lower the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to 7.25%. One member voted for lowering the target to 7.00%. In order to consolidate a low and stable inflation, in an environment in which price formation and slack conditions in the economy are subject to risks, the Governing Board will continue to follow closely all factors and elements of uncertainty that have an impact on inflation and its outlook, and will take the required actions based on incoming information so that the policy rate is consistent with the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to Banco de Mexico's target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board will maintain a prudent monetary policy stance and, under the current environment of uncertainty, will follow closely the potential pass-through of exchange rate fluctuations to prices. Mexico's relative monetary policy stance in an external environment that it is still subject to risks, and the behavior of slack conditions and cost-related pressures in the economy. In the presence and possible persistence of factors that, by their nature, involve risks to both inflation and its expectations, monetary policy will be adjusted in a timely and firm manner to achieve an orderly and sustained convergence of inflation to its 3% target and to strengthen the anchoring of medium- and long- term inflation expectations so that they attain such target."
Colombia,2019-12-20,"Learn about the considerations of the Board for its decision. Visit our photo gallery on Flickr. For this decision, the Board considered primarily the following information. In November, annual inflation reduced slightly (3.84%). The supply shocks that have affected inflation are expected to begin fading, and that at the beginning of 2020 inflation will resume its convergence to the target, as reflected by market expectations. Core inflation indicators are close to 3.0%. With the new information on economic activity, the Central Bank's technical staff kept the projection for economic growth in 2019 at 3.2%. The prospects for global growth continue to moderate, and in the United States the Fed maintained its benchmark interest rate. The projection of the current account deficit for 2019 continues above 4.0% of GDP, and is still funded largely by foreign direct investment. Based on this information, the Board considered the following factors for its decision. The temporary deviations of inflation from the target; uncertainty about the persistence of the depreciation of the peso; and the degree of its pass-through to domestic prices. The size of the spare capacity and the speed at which it may reduce. The effects of changing external conditions on the Colombian economy. In this environment, upon assessing the situation of the economy and the risk balance, the Board unanimously decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate unaltered at 4.25%. The Board will continue to carefully monitor inflation and the forecasts for economic activity and inflation in the country, as well as the developments of the balance of payments and the global context. Finally, the Board reiterates that monetary policy will depend on the new information available. Press Conference.

Mongolia,2019-12-20,"MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Keeping the policy rate unchanged and setting the reserve requirements Number: 2019/04 Date: 20 December 2019 The Monetary Policy Committee meeting was held on 20 December 2019. The Committee decided to keep the Policy rate unchanged at 11 percent and the reserve requirement on banks' liabilities in togrog at 10.5 percent, while increasing the requirement on liabilities in foreign currency by 3 percentage points to 15 percent. Annual headline inflation reached 5.2 percent nationwide as of November 2019. Inflation fluctuations are mainly attributed to price swings of few items related to supply changes, while the demand induced core inflation remains stable and inflation is expected to be consistent with the Central bank's target. Although, relatively favorable level of export prices, expansion of fiscal spending, and sustained investments in mega projects are supporting the economic growth, it is expected to decelerate due to uncertainties in the external environment. In the upcoming year, fiscal expenditure and rising wages are likely to support the domestic demand. Nevertheless, on account of weaker growth in the mining sector and deceleration in investments, economic activities are expected to be limited. In relation to weakening economic growth and bank lending the Monetary Policy Committee discussed the option of reducing the policy rate. However, considering the performance of fiscal spending and uncertainties in the external environment the Committee decided to keep the policy rate unchanged, this time. Furthermore, the Committee decided to increase the reserve requirement on banks' liabilities in foreign currency by 3 percentage points, with the purpose of sustaining relative yield of togrog and consequently to minimize exchange rate fluctuations. Extracts of the meeting minutes will be released in two weeks on the Bank of Mongolia's website. MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE."
Thailand,2019-12-23,"Outcome of the Joint Meeting between the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) and the Financial Institutions Policy Committee (FIPC) on 16 December 2019 The Bank of Thailand announced the outcome of the joint meeting between the MPC and the FIPC on 16 December 2019 to assess risks to Thailand's financial stability. Key discussion points were as follows. The committees concluded that Thailand's financial system remained sound, with commercial banks and insurance companies holding ample capital buffers. However there remained some pockets where risks could continue to build up, especially given the subdued growth outlook both at home and abroad and the prolonged low interest rate environment. The committees highlighted four key issues as follows. 1) New residential mortgages posted a positive growth for the first nine months of 2019. Following the implementation of the loan-to-value (LTV) measure, mortgages granted to first-time homebuyers (servicing one mortgage loan) stood unaffected and the LTV ratio of these loans stayed high. Meanwhile speculation and imbalances in the real estate market showed signs of abating in line with the measure's intended objectives. Financial institutions tightened their underwriting standards, as reflected by the decline in the average LTV ratio for second and subsequent mortgages. Speculative demand showed signs of cooling down, as seen from the decline in the number of commercial banks' new mortgage accounts given as second or subsequent mortgages, with the decline in Q3 softening from that in Q2. Developers also delayed project launches, which would help facilitate a reduction in oversupply and allow the housing market to return to a balanced condition going forward. Nonetheless oversupply in certain locations appeared poised to decline at a pace slower than market's average, as these locations either faced a drag from foreign demand or had a high level of unsold units even before the LTV measure took effect. Another concern was the pace of adjustments among small local developers, which lagged behind that of large developers. In light of these assessments, the committees would continue to monitor adjustments in the housing market, especially oversupply in the condominium segment, where supply took longer to adjust compared to the low-rise segment. 2) The debt situations for households and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) continued to raise a concern. The household debt to GDP ratio stayed at a high level and was poised to rise further amid the subdued growth outlook. Part of this was driven by commercial banks and non-banks' continued expansion in retail lending, notably credit cards and personal loans. Special attention should be given to households whose financial positions became more fragile, especially those sensitive to income shocks (eg. those subjected to lay-offs or reduced working hours). On the corporate front, the credit quality of SMEs continued to deteriorate. There were also signs that the credit quality issue began to spread from small enterprises, which had been in vulnerable positions for quite some time, to larger enterprises. In the environment where economic growth would remain subdued and businesses continued to face structural changes, the committees stressed that the task of resolving household and SME debt situations would require integrated efforts from all parties. Both preventive and corrective measures would need to be employed, with priority given to restructuring of troubled loans. The Bank of Thailand (BOT) had urged financial institutions to lend to retail customers with due consideration of debtors' affordability and living expenses; and engage borrowers proactively as soon as signs of weakening credit quality were detected and expedite the debt restructuring process for SMEs that still had business potential but faced temporary liquidity shortage. The BOT had also collaborated with Sukhumvit Asset Management (SAM) to expand the scope of the Debt Clinic Project to cover debtors with a single creditor and those currently facing prosecution. Further study would be needed to identify additional measures that could help debtors at a wider scale. 3) In the prolonged low interest rate environment, there continued to be a build-up of risks from corporate funding activities and the search-for-yield behavior. Corporates issued high-yield bonds in a growing amount as a means of financing, as banks had become more cautious in lending to corporates. In addition, foreign investment term funds (FIF term funds) still concentrated their investment abroad in a small number of countries and issuers. These instruments, namely high-yield bonds and FIF term funds, were held largely by retail investors, who might not be fully aware of all the risks involved. In response to this, the Office of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had enhanced its supervision of bond issuances and mutual funds and continued to monitor the situations closely. The requirements on sales processes and risk disclosures had been strengthened, so that investors received adequate information and advice that were suitable to their risk tolerance. Meanwhile, large conglomerates ramped up their financing especially via bond issuances, which contributed to a higher degree of concentration risks in the corporate bond market. Furthermore these conglomerates' complex organizational and financial structures made it difficult to assess their risks in a comprehensive manner. Monitoring their risks would thus require close collaboration among related regulators. The low interest rate environment also exerted a pressure on insurance companies' profitability. Recently insurance companies had been making adjustments both in terms of investment assets and product offerings, with a shift away from products with guaranteed yields toward those providing protection. To help facilitate adjustments, the Office of Insurance Commission (OIC) had relaxed the regulations to allow for investment outside the ASEAN region, as well as to require more complete information disclosures to prepare for the ongoing shift toward protection products. 4) Interconnectedness within the savings cooperatives system increased along with growth in mutual lending and deposit-taking among savings cooperatives, which could serve as an important channel of shock propagation. Meanwhile the search-for-yield behavior continued to persist, as reflected in the rising share of investment in corporate bonds. The committees urged all relevant parties to expedite the enactment of the ministerial regulations accompanying the Cooperatives Act, especially the parts related to investment, management of credit and liquidity risks, as well as indebtedness of cooperatives' members. Looking ahead, there continued to be a need to monitor savings cooperatives particularly those with liquidity shortage, which could face additional pressures given the subdued economic outlook. While the committees assessed the Thai financial system to be sound overall, financial stability risks would likely remain elevated going forward. The synchronized economic slowdown both at home and abroad, coupled with the prolonged low interest rate environment, would still provide a backdrop conducive to a build-up of fragilities in the financial system. The committees would continue to monitor developments in the four key issues discussed above, assess the effectiveness of the implemented measures, and explore further policy options to prevent a potential build-up of systemic risks in the future. The BOT, the SEC, and the OIC would continue to collaborate closely in assessing and monitoring risks to financial stability. The three regulators would improve and enforce regulations as warranted by circumstances to prevent the build-up of vulnerabilities that could undermine national financial stability."
