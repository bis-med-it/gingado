Romania,2008-01-07,"In its meeting of January 7, 2008, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided the following:. The analysis of the most recent statistical data reveals a continued high dynamics of domestic demand as investments picked up and consumption remained at an unsustainable level in the context of a rapid expansion of credit to the private sector, especially foreign currency loans. The rise of aggregate demand, boosted mainly by higher incomes and non-government credit dynamics, has been faster than the aggregate supply advance, causing exogenous shocks to feed through into prices and making the external deficit widen further. Wage growth stayed above labor productivity dynamics, and, besides the pressures exerted on the aggregate price level, has also emphasized the risks of deteriorating external competitiveness. Year-on-year inflation was 6.67 percent in November 2007, remaining above the upper limit of the target band, due to a steep increase in food prices and in the tariffs of services indexed to the leu's exchange rate. The short-term inflation outlook has worsened in the context of heightened macroeconomic risks, especially those related to the income policy and higher public spending in the run-up to forthcoming elections as well as uncertainties over investors' appetite for emerging market risk. Given this context, it is essential that a temporary inflation deviation outside the target band should not trigger relaxed wage and fiscal policies. The restrictiveness of the entire macroeconomic policy mix will help attain the inflation objectives agreed upon with the government, thus resuming the downward trend in inflation as well as ensuring sustainable economic growth in the medium term. The NBR Board believes that the persistence of demand-side pressures, along with prospects for prolonged effects of supply-side shocks, as well as the risks related to a possibly significant deterioration of inflation expectations require a tighter monetary policy stance. In light of available data, the NBR Board has decided to raise the monetary policy rate to 8.0 percent per annum from 7.5 percent. The NBR Board has also decided to continue to pursue a firm management of money market liquidity via open-market operations and to leave unchanged the existing minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. These measures will ensure restrictiveness of broad monetary conditions in line with the aim of attaining medium-term disinflation objectives. Maintaining the already announced inflation targets, which were also agreed upon with the government, i.e. 3.8 percent for 2008 and 3.5 percent for 2009 plus/minus one percentage point, and implementing a restrictive economic policy mix will lead to an efficient anchoring of inflation expectations of both corporates and households in the context of uncertainties that plague the world economy. The NBR will vigilantly monitor developments in macroeconomic indicators and their outlook, both domestically and internationally, standing ready to adjust its instrument settings to counteract inflationary pressures in order to resume the assumed disinflation trajectory and achieve medium-term disinflation objectives in a sustainable manner. The next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy is scheduled for February 4, 2008, when a new quarterly Inflation Report."
Chile,2008-01-10,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 10 January 2008 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points, to 6.25% (annual). This decision is consistent with prospects of higher inflation due to recent surprises, and allows annual inflation to converge to 3% over the policy horizon. Internationally, although the markets' liquidity problems are now milder, the risk of further deceleration of the US economy has increased, with potential implications on other developed economies. Meanwhile, the prices of oil, copper and several foodstuffs remain high and above projections. Inflation in various economies has continued to rise. This configures an external scenario relevant to the Chilean economy with more adverse risks going forward. In the internal scene, recent output information does not modify the second semester scenario that was considered in the last meeting. On the domestic demand side, indicators of both consumption and investment remain dynamic. Salaried employment continues to grow, albeit at smaller rates. December's monthly CPI inflation was surprisingly high, taking annual inflation to nearly 8%. This was influenced by a slower seasonal reversal of prices of perishable foods and significant increases in a varied range of products. The various measures of trend inflation, including CPIX1 variation (which excludes fuels, perishable foods and some regulated utilities), continued to increase. Although inflation expectations for coming quarters have increased, for the long run they remain anchored around 3% per annum. The Board considers that it is appropriate to indicate that, although the future path of monetary policy will depend on incoming information and its implications for the inflation forecast, additional adjustments to the monetary policy rate may be necessary in order to ensure convergence of inflation to the target. Particularly important for this will be the unfolding of the international scenario, the evolution of the output gap and the potential propagation of recent inflationary shocks to other prices. * The Spanish original prevails."
Euroarea,2008-01-10,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our first press conference of 2008. I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome Cyprus and Malta as countries which have adopted the euro as their currency. With Cyprus and Malta, the euro area now comprises 15 EU Member States. Accordingly. Mr Orphanides, the Governor of the Central Bank of Cyprus, and Mr Bonello, the Governor of the Central Bank of Malta, became members of the Governing Council on 1 January 2008. Let me now report on the outcome of our meeting, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today's meeting to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. According to the latest information, strong short-term upward pressure on inflation has continued, with HICP inflation remaining at 3.1% in December. As regards the medium term, and in a context of very vigorous money and credit growth, our assessment of upside risks to price stability has been fully confirmed. The Governing Council remains prepared to act pre-emptively so that second-round effects and upside risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise and, consequently, medium and long-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability. Reflecting its mandate, such anchoring is of the highest priority to the Governing Council. However, the ongoing reappraisal of risk in financial markets is still accompanied by uncertainty about its potential impact on the real economy and the risks surrounding the outlook for economic activity are on the downside. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the coming weeks. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. The latest information on economic activity suggests that quarterly growth at the turn of the year was at a more moderate pace than the quarter-on-quarter rate of 0.8% observed in the third quarter of 2007 (revised upwards from 0.7%). This assessment is in line with indicators for business and consumer confidence which, while declining over the past few months, generally remain at levels that continue to point to ongoing growth. Our main scenario remains that of real GDP growth broadly in line with trend potential. The fundamentals of the euro area economy are sound, profitability has been sustained, employment growth has been robust and unemployment rates have fallen to levels not seen for 25 years. Consumption growth should therefore continue to contribute to economic expansion, in line with real disposable income, and investment growth should provide ongoing support. On the expectation that the global economy will, on balance, remain resilient  with the slowdown in economic growth in the United States being mitigated by the continued strength of emerging market economies  external demand should support euro area exports. That said, uncertainty about the prospects for economic growth remains high and the risks surrounding the outlook for economic activity lie on the downside. The latter relate mainly to a potentially broader than currently expected impact of the ongoing reappraisal of risk in financial markets on financing conditions and economic sentiment, with a negative impact on world and euro area growth. Further downside risks stem from the scope for additional oil and other commodity price rises, concerns about protectionist pressures and the possibility of disorderly developments due to global imbalances. With regard to price developments, according to Eurostat's flash estimate the annual HICP inflation rate was 3.1% in December 2007, unchanged from November. This confirms the strong upward pressure on inflation in the short term, stemming mainly from strong increases in oil and food prices in recent months. Looking ahead, the annual HICP inflation rate is expected to remain significantly above 2% in the coming months and is likely to moderate only gradually in the course of 2008. Hence, the period of temporarily high rates of inflation would be somewhat more protracted than previously expected. Moreover, it is important to stress that the expectation of a moderation in the rate of inflation  which is embedded in the December 2007 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections  assumes some reversal of the recent rises in commodity prices  in line with what is currently captured by futures prices  and, more fundamentally, that recent oil and food price dynamics and their impact on HICP inflation do not have broadly-based second-round effects on wage and price-setting behaviour. Risks to this medium-term outlook for price developments are fully confirmed to lie on the upside. These risks include the possibility that stronger than currently expected wage growth may emerge, taking into account capacity constraints and the positive developments in labour markets. Furthermore, the pricing power of firms  notably in market segments with low competition  could be stronger than expected. At this juncture, it is imperative that all parties concerned meet their responsibilities and that second-round effects on wage and price-setting stemming from current inflation rates be avoided. In the view of the Governing Council, this is absolutely essential in order to preserve price stability in the medium run and thereby the purchasing power of all euro area citizens. The Governing Council is monitoring wage negotiations in the euro area countries with particular attention. Any indexation scheme of nominal wages to prices should be eliminated. Finally, further rises in oil and agricultural prices, continuing the strong upward trend observed in recent months, as well as increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those foreseen thus far, could materialise. The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. Money and credit have both continued to grow vigorously in recent months. The annual growth rate of M3 in November, unchanged at 12.3%, is likely to have been influenced by a number of temporary factors, such as the flattening of the yield curve, the financial market turmoil and specific transactions associated with the restructuring of certain banking groups. Nonetheless, even taking these special factors into account, the underlying rate of monetary expansion remains strong. Moreover, the sustained expansion of loans to the domestic private sector, which grew at an annual rate of 11.0% in November, points to the continued vigour of underlying monetary dynamics. Monetary developments continue to require very careful monitoring, both to detect underlying trends associated with inflationary pressures at longer horizons and to form a better understanding of shorter-term monetary dynamics. Such monitoring will also provide a more complete picture of the response of the private sector to the increased volatility in financial markets. A broad assessment of underlying trends in money and credit growth is particularly important at present given recent financial market developments. Heightened financial volatility may influence the short-term behaviour of money-holders and thereby complicate the extraction of the underlying trend monetary developments. At the same time, monetary and credit data can also offer an important insight into how financial institutions, households and firms have responded to the financial market turmoil. For the time being, however, there is little evidence that the financial market turbulence since early August 2007 has strongly influenced the dynamics of broad money and credit aggregates. Indeed, the growth of bank loans to the domestic private sector has remained robust in recent months, which may suggest that the supply of credit has not been impaired thus far. The growth of M1 and household borrowing have moderated further over the past few quarters, reflecting the impact of higher key ECB interest rates since December 2005 rather than the influence of the financial turmoil. Further data and analysis will be required in order to obtain a more complete picture of the impact of the financial market developments on banks' balance sheets, financing conditions and money and credit growth. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis fully confirms the assessment that there are upside risks to price stability over the medium term, in a context of very vigorous money and credit growth and sound economic fundamentals in the euro area. At the same time, the potential impact on the real economy of the ongoing reappraisal of risk in financial markets remains uncertain. The Governing Council remains prepared to act pre-emptively so that second-round effects and upside risks to price stability do not materialise and, consequently, medium and long-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability. Reflecting its mandate, such anchoring is of the highest priority to the Governing Council. Turning to fiscal policy, most euro area countries have submitted their updated stability programmes. On this basis, after a reduction in the euro area aggregate deficit ratio in 2007, an increase in the ratio is projected for 2008 despite many countries not having achieved sound fiscal positions. There is a clear risk that some countries will fail to comply with the provisions of the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact, thereby undermining the credibility of the Pact. In 2008 some countries with fiscal imbalances will consolidate by less than the required minimum of 0.5% of GDP in structural terms. In these countries, much more ambitious policies will be necessary to ensure that they achieve their medium-term objectives by 2010 at the latest, in accordance with their commitment of April 2007. With regard to structural reforms, the new three-year cycle of the Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs has started. While the achievements made over the last three years of the relaunched Strategy are encouraging, it is important that governments step up their reform efforts to deliver enhanced knowledge and innovation, competitiveness and labour market flexibility. Such reforms are crucial to raising productivity and fostering employment opportunities in the euro area."
South Korea,2008-01-10,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the call rate target (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (5.00%) for the intermeeting period. (The following is an English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the call rate target (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (5.00%) for the intermeeting period. The domestic economy seems likely to maintain its upward trend. While investment growth continues at a low level, exports maintain robust growth and private consumption shows a steady increase. There remains, however, a high degree of uncertainty surrounding future economic developments, largely due to the run-up in international oil prices and the possibility of international financial market unrest. Consumer price inflation has picked up its pace, mainly influenced by high oil prices. The upward trend of real estate prices has flattened out. In the financial markets, there is ample liquidity. Meanwhile, long-term and short-term market interest rates exhibit upward trends, mainly due to changes in fund flows."
Peru,2008-01-15,"- MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JANUARY 2008 BCRP RAISED REFERENCE INTEREST RATE FROM 5.0% TO 5.25% The Board of the Central Bank approved to raise the monetary policy reference rate from 5.0 to 5.25 percent. This measure has been adopted to maintain inflation expectations within the inflation target range, given the increase seen in the international prices of food products in a context of strong growth of domestic demand. As pointed out in previous communiques, inflation's temporary rate above the target is mainly explained by imported inflation, which posted 10.5 percent in 2007. The supply and demand imbalances in the international markets of grains and fuel have implied a generalized increase of inflation worldwide. The Board continues to oversee the evolution of inflation and its determinants, both domestic and external, distinguishing the factors with temporary impacts from those with permanent effects. As in previous occasions, the Board will adopt any necessary adjustment required to ensure that inflation converges to the target range. The Board made this decision considering the following macroeconomic information: The Consumer Price Index for Metropolitan Lima (CPI) increased 0.45 percent in December, with seasonal rises in the price of chicken and domestic transportation accounting for nearly fifty percent of this increase. Inflation over the last twelve months was 3.93 percent, above the inflation target range (2 percent, plus or minus one percentage point). Moreover, imported inflation was 0.23 percent and showed a last 12-month rate of 10.46 percent. Core inflation was 0.34 percent and accumulated 3.1 percent over the last twelve months. Factors contributing to this evolution also included the higher prices of imported inputs used for the production of food products, as reflected in the price rise of evaporated milk and “eating out” meals. The expectations of economic agents regarding inflation were revised upwards between November and December, but remain within the inflation target range. According to the surveys carried out by the BCRP, inflation expectations range between 2.2 and 3.0 percent for 2008 and between 2.2 and 2.7 percent for 2009. Economic activity continues to show a robust growth: GDP grew 8.4 percent and domestic demand grew 11.3 percent during the first ten months of 2007. Furthermore, the drive of private consumption has been coupled by a high growth of consumer loans. The nuevo sol appreciated 0.67 percent against the dollar in December, accumulating an appreciation of 7.0 percent in 2007. On the other hand, the nuevo sol appreciated 0.68 percent against the currency basket of our trading partners in December and 2.3 percent in 2007. The average monthly interest rate for the interbank market was 4.99 percent in December, close to the reference interest rate. During the session, the Board approved the annual interest rates on the following active and passive operations in soles between the BCRP and the financial system: Direct repo and rediscount operations: 6.0 percent. Overnight deposits: 4.5 percent. Likewise, the Board of Directors approved the interest rates on the following operations in dollars between the BCRP and the financial system: Rediscount operations: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point. Overnight deposits: overnight LIBOR minus 3/8 of one percentage point. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 6.0 percent. Reserve requirements in foreign currency corresponding to additional reserve requirements, provided that they are deposited in this Central Bank, will accrue interests at a rate equivalent to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) minus 7/8 of one percentage point. The LIBOR rate will refer to the average rate for 1- month credits in US dollars in the London interbank market at 11:00 hours (London time) and according to the information provided by the British Bankers Association through Reuters. In addition, the Board approved to initiate the procedures to raise from 16 to 17 percent the maximum amount that Private Administrators of Pension Funds are allowed to invest abroad. The Board of Directors will approve the Monetary Program for the next month on February The BCRP will publish its Inflation Reports on the following dates: February 8 June 13 October 10 2."
Thailand,2008-01-16,"No 1 /2008 Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 16 January 2008 Ms. Duangmanee Vongpradhip. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand, announces that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance. The main issues discussed were as follows. Domestic demand showed signs of continued recovery, both in consumption and investment, while export growth continued to be robust. However the trend of oil prices and the likelihood of a slowdown in US economic growth could affect Thailand's economic growth going forward. Headline inflation was expected to accelerate for some time due to higher world oil and commodity prices. Core inflation was likely to rise in line with the recovery in domestic demand and the pass-through from higher costs. However the MPC assessed that core inflation should remain within the target range throughout the next 8 quarters. The MPC deemed that the overall growth momentum had improved from the previous meeting from domestic demand. But the uncertainty surrounding the risks to growth and inflation has risen, which should be monitored closely going forward. The MPC therefore decided to keep the policy interest rate (the 1-day repurchase rate) at 325 per cent per annum."
Turkiye,2008-01-17,"The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) decided to lower the policy rates as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate from 15.75 to 15.50 percent, and lending rate from 20 to 19.50 percent, b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate applied between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m. from 11.75 to 11.50 percent, lending rate from 23 to 22.50 percent, c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions from 19 to 18.50 percent. Readings on the last quarter of 2007 suggest that the economy continued to grow at a moderate pace. The lagged effects of monetary tightening and the weakened global credit conditions restrain domestic demand. Moreover, the expected slowdown in global economic activity may lead to a reduction in the contribution of external demand to the economic growth. Accordingly, aggregate demand conditions should continue to support disinflation. In this context, inflation is expected to decelerate despite the risks from food and energy prices. Drought and energy related supply shocks not only increased inflation temporarily but also had short-term adverse effects on the growth rate. The Committee underlined that the primary goal of the Central Bank is to achieve price stability, and noted that monetary policy remains restrictive even after the recent rate cuts. Yet, the lagged impacts of the recent rate cuts are to be seen. Besides, the Committee will closely monitor the second round effects of elevated food and energy prices as well as developments in incomes policy, on the wage and price setting behavior. The timing of further easing will depend on incoming information regarding global liquidity conditions, external demand, fiscal policy implementation and other factors affecting the medium term inflation outlook. It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight working days."
Hungary,2008-01-21,"1 At its meeting on 21 January 2008, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at 7.50%. 2 The Council maintains its view that, as a consequence of the fiscal measures and the cost shocks of the recent past, inflation may be above target and economic growth below potential in 2008. With the unwinding of the first-round effects of these shocks, the inflation rate may slow to close to the 3% target in 2009; however, a potential rise in inflation expectations continues to represent an upside risk. Consumption demand continued to be weak, according to recent retail sales data. Industrial production appears to have slowed, with the slowdown in the rate of export growth being a contributory factor, in addition to the weakening in domestic demand. Downside risks to growth may increase, due to uncertainties about the outlook for global economic activity. CPI and core inflation both rose relative to November. This increase largely reflected rises in food and vehicle fuel prices, continuing the trends seen earlier in the year. However, inflation of other product prices over which monetary policy has most control has not accelerated. Two factors are of key importance for the future prospects for inflation: the way in which one-off shocks will influence economic agents' price and wage setting decisions and the extent to which policy will be able prevent a rise in inflation expectations. Inflationary developments in the world economy, coupled with further increases in administered prices in Hungary, constitute further risks to inflation. Private sector wage growth slowed somewhat in November, mainly on account of lower-than-usual bonus payments. The recommendation of the Interest Reconciliation Council foreshadows a further moderation in wage growth. In contrast, the increase in the minimum wage for skilled workers represents an upside risk. Price and wage decisions, consistent with subdued domestic demand, would contribute to a fall in inflation and, indirectly, they would provide a boost to growth. There remains considerable uncertainty in international financial markets. The re-pricing of credit risk is likely to continue in the coming months. International investors' willingness to take risk in emerging markets has moderated recently. The Monetary Council's decision to leave the policy rate unchanged reflects its assessment of the risks associated with inflation expectations and international capital markets. The future path of interest rates depends on the degree to which expectations will feed through to inflation and on the direction future developments in international money and capital markets will take. 4 The Monetary Council's assessment of inflation performance in 2007. Consumer price inflation remained above the 3% medium-term target throughout 2007 and even exceeded the ±1% tolerance band. Monetary policy actions affect inflation only with a lag. Generally, the strongest effect is felt after about 58 quarters. Consequently, 2007 inflation developments were influenced mainly by the decisions the Council took in the period between 2005 H2 and 2006. The period end-20052006 H1 was characterised by a benign inflation environment, which, however, was achieved in combination with unsustainable fiscal policy over the long term. Although the Monetary Council emphasised the need for fiscal adjustment on several occasions, the structure of such an adjustment programme remained unknown for most of the period. International experience has shown that there are significant differences in fiscal adjustments in respect of the degree to which monetary policy should react to such measures. For this reason, monetary policy adopted a wait-and-see approach. Factors such as increases in VAT and certain administered prices as well as reductions in price subsidies, played an important role in the fiscal adjustment programme launched in the summer of 2006. These in turn led to a sharp rise in inflation in 2007. The Bank decided not to neutralise the one-off, direct upward effects on prices of the measures, as it would have led to excessive growth sacrifice. The Council, therefore, chose to allow inflation to rise temporarily above the target in 2007. However, it could not disregard the fact that the price increases might cause a sustained rise in expectations, which threatened to lead to an indirect, persistent rise in inflation. Partly to prevent such a situation, and partly because of the rise in risk premia, the Monetary Council raised the base rate in small steps, by a total of two percentage points. Other, unforeseen shocks also contributed to inflation rising above target, in addition to the fiscal measures. An example is the increase in food prices, explained, among other things, by adverse weather conditions in 2007 and a rapid expansion in the global demand for food. Rises in international energy prices also had inflationary effects, particularly as they also fed through to administered prices. Without the increases in administered prices as well as in energy and food prices above expectations, inflation would have exceeded the target by a much smaller margin. Although in 2006 the Bank decided not to offset the upward effect on prices of the one-off and unforeseen shocks, it subsequently pursued a course of policy which aimed to ensure that inflation expectations did not reflect the 2007 price rises over the medium term. For this reason, in 2007 the central bank base rate consistently exceeded earlier market expectations. In the future, monetary policy will monitor carefully changes in inflation expectations, and will make every effort to deliver price stability in the medium term. By achieving and maintaining price stability, the Bank can best contribute to long-term economic growth and a predictable macroeconomic environment."
United States,2008-01-22,"The Federal Open Market Committee has decided to lower its target for the federal funds rate 75 basis points to 3-1/2 percent. The Committee took this action in view of a weakening of the economic outlook and increasing downside risks to growth. While strains in short-term funding markets have eased somewhat, broader financial market conditions have continued to deteriorate and credit has tightened further for some businesses and households. Moreover, incoming information indicates a deepening of the housing contraction as well as some softening in labor markets. The Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters, but it will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully. Appreciable downside risks to growth remain. The Committee will continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects and will act in a timely manner as needed to address those risks. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; Timothy F Geithner. Vice Chairman; Charles L Evans; Thomas M Hoenig; Donald L Kohn; Randall S Kroszner; Eric S Rosengren; and Kevin M Warsh. Voting against was William Poole, who did not believe that current conditions justified policy action before the regularly scheduled meeting next week. Absent and not voting was Frederic S Mishkin. In a related action, the Board of Governors approved a 75-basis-point decrease in the discount rate to 4 percent. In taking this action, the Board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago and Minneapolis."
Georgia,2008-01-23,"Tbilisi. 01.23.2008 The Decision of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia on January 23, 2008 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met today and decided to raise its main policy rate, the one-week Certificate of Deposit (CD) rate, by 100 basis points, to annual 10 percent. The latest information on economic activity suggests that GDP is continuing to grow in double digits reaching record level (annualized 12.6 percent) in the third quarter, 2007. Both public and private expenditures, the latter supported by large foreign capital inflows have contributed to the acceleration in economic activity. Moreover, the pick-up in export growth rates in the second quarter continued in the third quarter as well contributing to the growing aggregate demand pressure. At the backdrop of political turmoil in November, 2007 the growth in 2008 is expected to slow down. Annual inflation after starting to increase rapidly from August, 2007 fell in December producing end-of- period inflation of 11 percent and period average inflation of 9.2 percent. As in many other countries this acceleration in the inflation rate was largely driven by strong growth in food and energy prices and the subsequent political tensions in Georgia intensifying further the inflationary expectations. Moreover, the growth in monetary aggregates and lending fuelled by increased government spending and foreign capital and financial inflows have further exacerbated inflation dynamics. Monetary aggregates have been growing rigorously driven inter alia by rapidly expanding money multipliers and re-monetization of the economy but even after taking these special factors into account, the underlying rate of monetary expansion remains strong. In the near-term risks to price stability remain on the upside. The current monetary overhang, increased public spending and the shift from capital to social expenditure, the forthcoming parliamentary elections, uncertainty arising from the global financial turbulence and the public's entrenched inflationary expectations, have worsened the inflation outlook in the near-term. Therefore, a tighter monetary policy stance is required to mitigate the abovementioned risks. On the other hand, the expected decline in oil prices due to speculations about the global economic slowdown is a downside risk to price stability. In the medium-term in the environment of large foreign capital inflows to curb inflationary pressures the macro policy mix needs to be changed to make both monetary and fiscal policies contractionary. In general, countries with large foreign inflows have responded with fiscal consolidation, therefore the government's announced commitment to the fiscal surplus is vital. The MPC discussed the possible changes in the reserve requirement rules and norms and decided to leave them unchanged at this stage. 1 The reproduction without citing the source is not allowed.

Israel,2008-01-28,"28.1.2008</td> The Bank of Israel leaves the interest rate for February 2008 unchanged at 4.25 percent The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for February 2008 will remain unchanged at 4.25 percent. This is consistent with the policy of maintaining price stability, as expressed by the inflation target of 1-3 percent a year. Background conditions Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.6 percent in December, the second consecutive month in which the index rose steeply, relative both to the seasonal path and to earlier estimates. In the wholeof 2007 the index rose by 3.4 percent, above the upper limit of the targetrange. Excluding the energy and food components, prices of which rose steeply throughout the world in the second half of the year, the index rose by 1.6 percent in 2007. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Israeli forecasters expect, on average, that inflation will return to within the target range in the second half of 2008, and over the whole of 2008 it will be 2.5 percent. Their expectations regarding the Bank of Israel interest rate at the end of 2008 range from a 25-basis-point reduction from the current level, to a rise of 1.25 percentage points above the current level. Inflation expectations for the next twelve months derived from the capital market have continued torise, and have reached 2.5 percent. At the same time, average interest-rate expectations in January derived from the capital market are for a rise of 0.5 percentage points by the end of 2008. The Bank of Israel assesses thatinflation will return to within the target range around the middle of the year and at the end of the year will be close to its midpoint. Since the Bank's different econometric models indicate differing scenarios, they received less than their usual weight in the discussions prior to this interest rate decision. Real economic activity: National Accounts estimates for 2007 and other economic indicators show that GDP continued to grow rapidly, with no signs of a slowdown. The composite state-of-the-economy index rose by 1.2 percent in December, and the indices for the previous two months were revised upwards. Foreign trade data for 2007:Q 4 show that goods exports expanded at a fast pace. The expected slowdown in global growth may, however, affectIsrael's economy, and dampen growth somewhat in 2008 compared withthe rate in 2007. The labor market and wages: Employment continued to increase. The number of employee posts increased in August-October 2007 by 4.1 percent compared with the number in the equivalent period in 2006. This reflects a large increase in the business sector, with a more modest rise in the public services. The nominal wage per employee post rose by 2.7 percent in August-October 2007 compared to that in August-October 2006. Following the reduction in income tax and wage agreements in the publicsector, from January 2008 the net wage of a large proportion of wage-earners is expected to increase by up to 4 percent. Budget policy: The government's overall budget deficit, excluding credit, totaled NIS 100 million in 2007, close to balance, mainly due to a sharp rise in government revenues, which exceeded the original budget estimate by about NIS 15 billion. The government's budget proposal for 2008 was passed by the Knesset in accordance with its original targets for the deficit and the growth in expenditure. The forex market: In the period between the previous interest rate decision on December 23 and January 26, the shekel strengthened by 5.2 percent against the dollar, and by 2.8 percent against the euro. At the same time the dollar weakened against most currencies, and by more than average against the shekel. The dollar-shekel exchange rate became more volatile. The level of activity in the forex market rose. The capital and money markets: Since the previous interest rate decision (on December 23) till January 27, the leading international indicesrecorded sharp falls of up to 16 percent. On the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, the Tel Aviv 25 and Tel Aviv 100 share price indices fell by about 13 percent. Whereas last month yields on 10-year unindexed government bonds rose, in this period the yields declined from 6.19 percent to 5.92 percent. Concurrently, yields on US government bonds also fell, by between 0.5 percentage points and 1 percentage point. Hence, the yield gap between unindexed Israel government bonds and comparable US government bonds widened again this month and reached 2.4 percentage points (from 2 percentage points last month). Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS premium rose sharply to 0.55 percent from 0.32 percent prior to the previous interest rate decision. The CDS spread widened markedly also in the other emerging markets, and surpassed their levels at the start of the crisis. The world economy: Data on the US economy published this month indicated that it is suffering a slowdown in its rate of growth, and increased the number of assessments that it was likely to enter a recession as early as the first quarter of 2008. This concern, together with concern over a significant slowdown in global growth, caused further turbulence in the financial markets and led to sharp price falls, which accelerated in the last few days. Against this background, the Federal Reserve cut the interest rate by 0.75 percentage points, earlier than the scheduled date. The market in the US expects the Fed to cut the interest rate again at its next meeting on 30 January. Market expectations regarding the ECB interest rate in the next few months range between a reduction in the rate and no change. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to leave the interest rate unchanged is intended to bring inflation, measured over the previous twelve months, to within the target range by the middle of 2008--even if it is expected to be above the target in the first half of the year--and to bring it close to the midpoint of the range by the end of the year. It is also intended to continue to support financial stability, particularly at the present time--this, as part of the infrastructure essential for sustained economic growth. The decision takes into account both the inflationary forces acting at present in the economy, and the influence, current and expected, of forces operating in the opposite direction. The economy is subject to inflationary pressures, deriving both from persistent rapid growth and the closure of the output gap, and from the rise in import prices, particularly energy and food prices, in the second half of 2007. On the other hand: 1) The expected slowdown in US economic growth and in world trade should serve to reduce inflationary pressures in Israel. It will do so via its effects on Israel's exports and by reducing domestic demand, as well as by moderating the rise in import prices, including energy and food prices. 2) The assessments in the financial market are that the Fed will reduce the interest rateagain on 30 January--the second reduction this month. 3) The weakening of the dollar against the shekel is expected to moderate upward pressureon prices in the next few months, although to a lesser extent than in the past, in light of the slackening of the link between the shekel/$ exchange rate and the rate of inflation in Israel. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor economic developments closely with the intention of achieving the price-stability target. Subject to this, the Bank will continue to support the attainment of a range of objectives of macroeconomic policy, in particular the encouragement of employment and growth. In addition, the Bank will continue to support the stability of the financial system. for your information: The minutesof the discussions prior to the above interest rate decision will be published on 11 February 2008.

India,2008-01-29,"RBI Governor presents Third Quarter Review of Annual Statement on Monetary Policy for 2007-08 Dr.Y Venugopal Reddy. Governor. Reserve Bank of India today presented the Third Quarter Review of Annual Statement on Monetary Policy for the Year 2007-08. Highlights Bank Rate. Reverse Repo Rate. Repo Rate and Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) kept unchanged. The flexibility to conduct overnight or longer term repo including the right to accept or reject tenders under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF), wholly or partially, is retained. Overall real GDP growth projection for 2007-08 at around 8.5 per cent is retained. The policy endeavour would be to contain inflation close to 5.0 per cent in 2007-08 while conditioning expectations in the range of 4.0-4.5 per cent. While non-food credit has decelerated, growth in money supply and aggregate deposits of scheduled commercial banks continue to expand well above indicative projections. High growth in reserve money is driven by large accretion to RBI's net foreign exchange assets. Liquidity management will assume priority in the conduct of monetary policy through appropriate and timely action. Barring the emergence of any adverse and unexpected developments in various sectors of the economy and keeping in view the current assessment of the economy including the outlook for growth and inflation, the overall stance of monetary policy in the period ahead will broadly continue to be:  To reinforce the emphasis on price stability and well-anchored inflation expectations while ensuring a monetary and interest rate environment conducive to continuation of the growth momentum and orderly conditions in financial markets.  To emphasise credit quality as well as credit delivery, in particular, for employment-intensive sectors, while pursuing financial inclusion.  To monitor the evolving heightened global uncertainties and domestic situation impinging on inflation expectations, financial stability and growth momentum in order to respond swiftly with both conventional and unconventional measures, as appropriate. The Review consists of three sections: I. Assessment of Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments; II. Stance of Monetary Policy; and III. Monetary Measures. Domestic Developments Real GDP growth moderated to 9.1 per cent in the first half of 2007-08 from 9.9 per in the first half of 2006-07. Inflation, based on variations in the wholesale price index (WPI) on a year-on-year basis, eased to 3.8 per cent as on January 12, 2008 from its peak of 6.4 per cent at the beginning of the financial year and from 6.2 per cent a year ago. Prices of primary articles registered a year-on-year increase of 3.9 per cent as on January 12, 2008 as compared with 9.5 per cent a year ago. Manufacturing inflation eased to 3.9 per cent as on January 12, 2008 from 5.8 per cent a year ago. The price of the Indian basket of international crude has registered a sustained increase during 2007-08 from US $ 66.4 in April-June. US $ 72.7 in July-September. US $ 85.7 in October-December 2007 to US $ 88.9 per barrel as on January 25, 2008. Inflation based on the consumer price index (CPI) for industrial workers (IW) declined to 5.5 per cent on a year-on-year basis in November 2007 from 6.3 per cent a year ago. The CPI for urban non-manual employees (UNME), agricultural labourers (AL) and rural labourers (RL) also declined to 5.1 per cent, 5.9 per cent and 5.6 per cent, respectively, in December 2007 as compared with 6.9 per cent, 8.9 per cent and 8.3 per cent a year ago. As on January 4, 2008 money supply (M 3) increased by 22.4 per cent on a year-on-year basis which was higher than 20.8 per cent a year ago and well above the projected trajectory of 17.0-17.5 per cent indicated in the Annual Policy Statement for 2007-08. Reserve money increased by 30.6 per cent on a year-on-year basis as on January 18, 2008 as compared with 20.0 per cent a year ago. In the current financial year, the growth in aggregate deposits of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs), on a year-on-year basis, at Rs.6,00,761 crore (25.2 per cent) was higher than that of Rs.4,44,241 crore (22.9 per cent) a year ago. On a year-on-year basis, non-food credit of SCBs expanded by Rs.3,82,155 crore (22.2 per cent) as on January 4, 2008 on top of the increase of Rs.4,16,418 crore (31.9 per cent) a year ago. The year-on-year growth in total resource flow from SCBs to the commercial sector decelerated to 21.7 per cent from 30.1 per cent a year ago. Banks' holdings of Government and other approved securities at 29.1 per cent of their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) as on January 4, 2008 was marginally higher than 28.6 per cent a year ago. The overhang of liquidity as reflected in the sum of LAF. MSS and the Central Government's cash balances increased from Rs.85,770 crore at end-March 2007 to Rs.2,58,187 crore on January 17, 2008 before declining to Rs.2,32,809 crore on January 24, 2008. The BSE Sensex increased from 13,072 at end-March 2007 to 18,362 on January 25, 2008 registering an increase of 40.5 per cent over end-March 2007. The gross market borrowings of the Central Government through dated securities at Rs.1,47,000 crore (Rs.1,30,000 crore a year ago) during 2007-08 so far (up to January 25, 2008) constituted 94.6 per cent of the budget estimates (BE) while net market borrowings at Rs.1,03,092 crore (Rs.91,432 crore a year ago) constituted 94.1 per cent of the BE. External Developments During April-November 2007, merchandise exports rose by 21.9 per cent in US dollar terms as compared with 26.2 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year. Import growth was also lower at 26.9 per cent as compared with 27.4 per cent in the previous year. The merchandise trade deficit widened to US $ 52.8 billion from US $ 38.5 billion in the previous year. While oil imports recorded a lower growth of 9.8 per cent as compared with 42.0 per cent a year ago, non-oil imports increased by 35.3 per cent as compared with 21.3 per cent a year ago. Foreign exchange reserves increased by US $ 85.7 billion during the current financial year so far and stood at US $ 284.9 billion on January 18, 2008. Over the end-March 2007 level, the rupee appreciated by 9.61 per cent against the US dollar, by 8.85 per cent against the pound sterling and by 0.95 per cent against the Japanese yen, but remained unchanged against the euro as on January 25, 2008. Global Developments According to the World Economic Outlook (WEO) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) released in October 2007, the forecast for global real GDP growth on a purchasing power parity basis is placed at 5.2 per cent for 2007 as compared with 5.4 per cent in 2006 and is expected to decelerate further to 4.8 per cent in 2008. In the US, real GDP growth is expected to slow down from the fourth quarter of 2007 onwards as the deepening housing market correction and ongoing financial market turmoil are expected to curb growth more severely, although exports could play a mitigating role. Globally, inflationary pressures have re-emerged as a key risk to global growth. Inflation pressures have raised concerns in the US. UK, the euro area and in some of the emerging market economies (EMEs) such as China. Malaysia. Indonesia and Chile. 345 per cent for policy purposes, assuming no further escalation in international crude prices and barring domestic or external shocks. The policy endeavour would be to contain inflation close to 5.0 per cent in 2007-08 while conditioning expectations in the range of 4.0-4.5 per cent so that an inflation rate of around 3.0 per cent becomes a medium-term objective. The rate of money supply has picked up coincident with a jump in the growth of reserve money, driven by the accretion to the Reserve Bank's foreign exchange assets. Moderating money supply in alignment with the indicative projections of 17.0-17.5 per cent set out in the Annual Policy Statement of April 2007 may warrant appropriate responses, given the considerations for ensuring macroeconomic and financial stability going forward. In view of the risks associated with international financial developments impacting balance sheets of corporates with sizeable external liabilities, banks are urged to review large foreign currency exposures and to put in place a system for monitoring such unhedged exposures on a regular basis so as to minimise risks of instability in the financial system under the current 567.75 per cent, respectively. The Reserve Bank retains the option to conduct overnight or longer term repo/reverse repo under the LAF depending on market conditions and other relevant factors. The Reserve Bank will continue to use this flexibility including the right to accept or reject tender(s) under the LAF, wholly or partially, if deemed fit, so as to make efficient use of the LAF in daily liquidity management. CRR kept unchanged at 7.5 per cent. The Annual Policy Statement for the year 2008-09 will be announced on April 29, 2008. Alpana Killawala Chief General Manager Press Release : 2007-2008/993 7."
Malaysia,2008-01-29,"At its meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia's Monetary Policy Committee decided to leave the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) unchanged at 3.50 percent. The Malaysian economy had performed well in 2007 and continues to maintain a steady momentum. However, developments in the global financial markets have increased the level of uncertainty over global growth. Economic indicators in the large industrial countries are increasingly indicating heightened downside risks to the prospects for global growth. The impact of these external developments on the Malaysian economy will depend on the relative strength of the domestic economy and the degree of moderation in the trade sector. Meanwhile, global price pressures have been increasing, due largely to high global energy, food and commodity prices. Consequently, inflation in Malaysia has also been on an increasing trend since the second half of 2007. In the near term, the risks to inflation are mainly on the upside. However, the slower global growth may have a moderating effect on global prices and thereby reduce the cost pressures being felt by the domestic economy. The interaction between the downside risks to growth and the upward risks to domestic prices will be monitored carefully and pre-emptive measures would be taken if necessary. The future thrust of monetary policy would depend on new information and our assessment of the change in the balance of risks to the medium term outlook for inflation and growth. Bank Negara Malaysia 29 January 2008."
Philippines,2008-01-30,"The Monetary Board decided today to reduce by 25 basis points the BSP's key policy interest rates to 5 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 7 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs, and special deposit accounts were also reduced accordingly. This is the fourth consecutive reduction in policy rates since October 2007. In its assessment of macroeconomic conditions, the Monetary Board noted that the latest inflation forecasts indicate that inflation would fall within the 4.0 percent + 1 percentage point target range in 2008 and the 3.5 + 1 percentage point target range in 2009. Demand indicators continue to show some strengthening, indicating manageable price pressures going forward. Inflation expectations remain well anchored and liquidity growth has been decelerating on account of liquidity management measures adopted earlier in 2007. Core inflation, a measure of the underlying trend in consumer prices, remained lower than headline inflation in December.The Monetary Board noted that the volatility in world oil prices and higher commodity prices remain the key risks to the inflation outlook. The firm peso, however, is expected to temper the impact of higher import costs on domestic prices. Slower economic activity in the US as well as globally could also moderate price pressures coming from imported oil and food. In addition, the reduction of the oil import tariff effective February is expected to reduce pump prices of petroleum products. The monetary authorities remain committed to maintaining price stability and will continue to closely monitor evolving monetary and financial conditions, particularly the risks associated with the inflation outlook."
Poland,2008-01-30,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 30 January 2008 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 29-30 January 2008 The Council decided to increase the NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage point to the level: (cid:131) reference rate 5.25% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate 6.75% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate 3.75% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate 5.50% on an annual basis. The Polish economy is still in the period of strong growth encompassing all its sectors. Macroeconomic data released since the last meeting of the Council indicate that economic growth in 2007 Q4 was higher than expected in the October projection and close to that observed in 2007 Q3. It may, however, be expected that GDP growth in 2008 will be lower than in 2007. Since the last meeting of the Council the risk of a substantial slowdown in the world economy increased, though it is currently difficult to assess this risk or its impact on economic growth in Poland. An additional factor increasing the uncertainty as to the prospects of the global and consequently Polish economy growth is the increased volatility in the financial markets that has been observed over the recent period. In December, in line with expectations, the annual growth of consumer prices in Poland reached 4.0% thus remaining above the NBP's inflation target of 2.5% and also above the upper limit for deviations from the target set at 3.5%. As in many other countries, increased inflation has been largely sustained by strong annual growth in food and fuel prices. In the Council's assessment, in the near future inflation will remain above the upper limit for deviations from the inflation target, which may also, to a large extent, be the result of the expected increased growth of regulated prices. In the Council's assessment, in the coming quarters economic growth will most probably continue to exceed the growth of potential GDP. The information on labour market developments in December 2007 points to a decline in the strong wage growth and an improvement in unfavourable relation between wage and labour productivity growth. However, a further build-up in wage pressure, particularly in the public finance sector and, consequently, inflationary pressure is quite probable. The risk of continuing high inflation is also raised by the food price growth observed in the world economy and affecting the Polish market and also by prices of oil being higher than assumed in the October projection. Moreover, in line with the 2008 Budget Act passed by the Parliament, a procyclical impact of fiscal policy on the economy can be expected this year. ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51. In the mid-term inflation may be curbed by the continuing very good financial results of enterprises and high investment growth conducive to productivity growth. Inflation may also be constrained by globalisation and the ensuing increased competition in the market of internationally traded goods and services as well as to the relative stability of the zloty exchange rate. The inflationary pressure may also be reduced by a slowdown of the global economy. Nevertheless, the Council assessed that the impact of those factors may prove insufficient to keep inflation at the target over the monetary policy transmission horizon. Considering the above factors and the risk of second-round effects of the increase in current inflation, the Council assessed the probability of inflation overshooting the inflation target in the medium term to be higher than the probability of inflation running below the target and decided to raise the NBP's interest rates. The Council will strive to bring inflation down to the level consistent with the inflation target in the medium term. The Council will be closely monitoring the growth and structure of domestic demand, including the degree of the expansionary fiscal policy stance, the relation between wage and labour productivity growth in the enterprise sector and wage growth in the public finance sector, zloty exchange rate, developments of the current account balance and the impact of globalisation on the economy and on food prices. The Council will also analyse the direct and indirect implications of turbulences in international financial markets for the Polish economy."
United States,2008-01-30,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 50 basis points to 3 percent. Financial markets remain under considerable stress, and credit has tightened further for some businesses and households. Moreover, recent information indicates a deepening of the housing contraction as well as some softening in labor markets. The Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters, but it will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully. Today's policy action, combined with those taken earlier, should help to promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate the risks to economic activity. However, downside risks to growth remain. The Committee will continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects and will act in a timely manner as needed to address those risks. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; Timothy F Geithner. Vice Chairman; Donald L Kohn; Randall S Kroszner; Frederic S Mishkin; Sandra Pianalto; Charles I Plosser; Gary H Stern; and Kevin M Warsh. Voting against was Richard W Fisher, who preferred no change in the target for the federal funds rate at this meeting. In a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 50-basis-point decrease in the discount rate to 3-1/2 percent. In taking this action, the Board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston. New York. Philadelphia. Cleveland. Atlanta. Chicago. St. Louis. Kansas City, and San Francisco."
South Africa,2008-01-31,"Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee in December 2007, the international environment has become increasingly uncertain and volatile. It appears that the continued fall-out from the United States sub-prime crisis has not been confined to financial markets only and there has been a general downward revision to forecasts of global growth. The slowdown in global growth could have spillover effects on the South African economy which is also being affected adversely by electricity supply constraints. The economy has continued to respond to the tighter monetary policy stance and inflation is expected to peak in the first quarter of 2008. Nevertheless there are still significant risks to the inflation outlook. CPIX inflation has continued its upward trend, measuring 8,6 per cent in December 2007. The main drivers were again petrol and food. Petrol prices increased at a year-on-year rate of 23,8 per cent in December, while food prices increased at a rate of 13,9 per cent. Excluding food and petrol. CPIX inflation would have measured 5,0 per cent. Prices of clothing and footwear declined significantly, while modest declines were measured in recreation and entertainment and textiles. Production price inflation measured 10,3 per cent in December compared to 9,1 per cent in November. Prices of imported goods increased at a year-on-year rate of 11,3 per cent compared to 7,3 per cent the previous month. Manufactured food inflation increased to 18,7 per cent from 18,3 per cent in November while agricultural products inflation declined to 24,0 per cent from 26,8 per cent. The most recent central forecast of the Bank indicates a further deterioration in the inflation outlook in the short term when compared to the previous forecast. CPIX inflation is still expected to peak in the first quarter of 2008 but at an average of around 8,5 per cent. In line with the previous forecast. CPIX inflation is then expected to decline to below the upper end of the target range by the final quarter of 2008 and to remain around the 5,6 per cent level for most of 2009. The higher near-term projections are a result of slightly higher inflation outcomes, and further revisions to assumptions about administered prices. This central forecast of the Bank is broadly consistent with market expectations. The Reuters consensus forecast also expects inflation to peak during the first quarter and to fall below the upper level of the target range in the fourth quarter of 2008. CPIX inflation is expected to average 6,8 per cent and 5,3 per cent in 2008 and 2009 respectively. The longer term inflation expectations, as reflected in the break-even inflation rates, are relatively unchanged since the previous MPC meeting and have remained below the 6 per cent level. The main upside risks to the inflation outlook remain food and energy price prospects, although the extent of the upside risk may have moderated somewhat. The price of North Sea Brent crude oil, which peaked at around US100 per barrel in December, is currently trading at around US$92 per barrel. Domestic petrol prices remained unchanged in January and the current average under-recovery for January is approximately 15 cents per litre. Oil prices remain vulnerable to supply disruptions, although the adverse global growth outlook may restrain the degree of upside price risk. Food prices remain one of the main short-term risks to inflation. Production prices continue to indicate that sustained food price pressure can be expected in the coming months. However the more favourable weather conditions and lower futures prices for maize have reinforced a general expectation of some moderation of food price inflation during the course of this year. However future trends will be dominated by global supply and demand conditions. The threat posed to the inflation outlook by higher electricity prices remains. Eskom has been granted an average tariff increase of 14,2 per cent from July. The precise increase that will be faced by households may be higher, and will only be known during the coming months. Furthermore, there is a risk that the increases granted to Eskom over the forecast period could be higher than currently anticipated. The rand exchange rate has depreciated in recent weeks following a period of relative stability. The currency has been affected by movements in the dollar, and more recently by increased risk aversion towards emerging markets. The currency has been given some support from commodity prices which have remained firm, and in the case of gold and platinum, have reached new highs. On a trade-weighted basis, the rand has depreciated by around 7 per cent since the beginning of 2008. Despite these pressures and risks to the outlook, there have been a number of developments which are likely to have a restraining impact on the inflation trend. The moderation of household consumption expenditure highlighted at the previous meeting appears to have continued. Real retail sales have trended down since the middle of 2007 and in November sales decreased by 0,7 per cent compared to October. Sales of household furniture, appliances and equipment have contracted the most. Motor vehicle sales also continued their downward trend. Sales of passenger vehicles declined by almost 10 per cent in 2007 compared to 2006 although commercial vehicle sales remained relatively strong. Growth in household consumption expenditure is also expected to be dampened by negative wealth effects. The global financial market turbulence has been reflected in the volatility on the JSE Limited. Since its peak in October 2007, the All-share index has fallen by approximately 16 per cent. House price increases have also moderated somewhat. According to the ABSA house price index, house price increases declined to 11,2 per cent in December 2007, while the month-on-month increase in December was 0,3 per cent. The Standard Bank median house price index was unchanged on a year-on-year basis in December. Credit extension to the private sector has moderated further. Growth over twelve months in loans and advances extended to the private sector declined from 25,2 per cent in September to 22,2 per cent in December 2007. The quarterly growth declined from 23,5 per cent in the third quarter to 18,1 per cent in the fourth quarter. Growth in all of the subcategories, namely mortgage advances, instalment sales and leasing, and other loans and advances, has displayed a persistent downward trend. The growth in loans and advances to households declined to 18,9 per cent in December, down from 20,1 per cent in November 2007. According to the Wage Settlement Survey of Andrew Levy Employment Publications, the average wage settlement for 2007 was 7,3 per cent compared to 6,5 per cent in 2006. This appears to be consistent with the 7,7 per cent year-on-year increase in average nominal remuneration per worker measured in the third quarter of 2007. Once productivity increases are adjusted for, year-on-year growth in nominal unit labour costs in the formal non-agricultural sector measured 4,8 per cent in the third quarter of 2007 compared to 5,0 per cent the previous quarter. These unit labour cost developments are consistent with the inflation target range. The risks to output growth appear to be on the downside and this is likely to be reinforced by the electricity supply disruptions. Growth in the construction sector also appears to be moderating with a decline in residential and non-residential plans approved. In November the real value of building plans passed decreased by 16,5 per cent on a year-on-year basis. The volume of cement sales has also shown a significant decline in recent months. The turbulence in international financial markets has not subsided, and losses suffered by financial institutions with exposure to the USA sub-prime market continue to be reported. Fears of a slowdown in some of the advanced economies, and in the USA in particular, have also been weighing on the markets. Although the emerging market economies are expected to sustain relatively strong growth, there are indications of some moderation in growth in China, albeit still at high levels. Global inflation appears to be under control. There are still considerable risks to the inflation outlook. In the light, inter alia, of heightened economic uncertainties, both domestically and globally, and some evidence of moderation in domestic consumption expenditure, the Monetary Policy Committee has decided that it is appropriate at this time to leave the repo rate unchanged at 11 per cent per annum. The MPC remains committed to bringing inflation back to within the inflation target range."
Romania,2008-02-04,"In its meeting of February 4, 2008, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided the following:. The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled for February 7, 2008, along with a 12-month calendar of NBR Board meetings dedicated to monetary policy issues. The annual inflation rate stood at 6.57 percent at the end of last year against 4.87 percent in December 2006, overshooting the 3-5 percent target band around the 4.0 percent target. The overshooting was triggered mainly by supply-side exogenous shocks: an unfavourable performance of the farming sector due to severe drought as well as rising global food and fuel prices. Inflationary pressures have been amplified by persistent excess demand as a consequence of strong wage increases and fast growth of credit to the private sector. Statistical data show continued robust investment dynamics and an unsustainable pace of consumption growth which led to a widening of the external deficit. In the context of the changing risk appetite by financial investors amid persistent turbulences on international financial markets, these unfavourable trends have also been associated with the significant correction of the leu exchange rate in recent months. In the monetary area, it is worth noting the fast growth of foreign currency loans, which, in the context of increased and persistent exchange rate volatility, underlines the issue of potential risks to financial stability. The monetary policy stance, assessed through broad monetary conditions, saw its restrictiveness adjusted by the raise in the key monetary policy rate, by a firmer control of money market liquidity and the maintenance of tight minimum reserve requirements. The short-term inflation outlook has worsened in the context of heightened macroeconomic risks, especially those related to the effects of rising household incomes and higher public spending in the run-up to forthcoming elections as well as uncertainties over the leu exchange rate trend amid persistent tensions affecting the world economic environment. Therefore, the NBR is restating that it is ready to adjust its instrument-settings to reenter as fast as possible the announced disinflation trajectory in a sustainable manner. As the NBR's main concern remains the efficient anchoring of inflation expectations of both businesses and households at low levels of inflation, it is essential that the temporary forecast deviation of inflation outside the target band should not trigger any relaxation of wage and fiscal policies. A return of inflation to a downward trajectory compatible with achieving the medium-term disinflation objectives and the progress in the nominal and real convergence process requires tighter monetary policy and increased consistency of the entire economic policy mix. Under such circumstances and in light of available data, the NBR Board has decided to adopt a set of measures to tighten monetary policy. Given the need to pro-actively adapt broad monetary conditions to an anticipated rise in inflation in the following period, the NBR Board has decided to raise the monetary policy rate to 9.0 percent per annum from 8.0 percent and continue to pursue a firm management of money market liquidity via open-market operations. Moreover, given the rapid expansion of all components of non-government credit and especially of the foreign currency component, the NBR Board has also decided to leave unchanged the existing minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions and to adopt additional prudential measures, including higher provisioning for foreign exchange-denominated credits extended to unhedged borrowers (Regulation No 5/2002, as subsequently amended) and broadening their scope to non-bank financial institutions. The transposition of the new prudential measures into the internal regulations of credit institutions and non-bank financial institutions should be done within 30 days from their publication in the Official Gazette. The NBR Board believes tighter monetary policy measures, along with the implementation of moves to tighten fiscal and income policies and foster structural reforms, especially those concerning the labour market, are essential to ensure an efficient anchoring of inflation expectations of both corporates and households and the achievement of the medium-term disinflation objectives in a sustainable manner. Such a stance of all components of the macroeconomic policy mix is all the more necessary given that the external deficit registers levels difficult to sustain in the context of heightened uncertainties affecting the world economy, while a boost in savings represents a longer-term fundamental measure aimed at correcting the external deficit, through a gradual reduction of the savings/investment imbalance. The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which assesses the recent macroeconomic context and the inflation outlook, as well as the main challenges and risks to monetary policy in the coming period. The present forecast reveals risks similar to those underlined in the previous forecasting exercise. However, it is worth mentioning that in the event of such risks materializing they could have more severe consequences given the current international context. Under these circumstances, the NBR reaffirms that it will vigilantly monitor developments in macroeconomic indicators and their outlook, standing ready to adjust its instrument settings to counteract inflationary pressures in order to resume as fast as possible the announced medium-term disinflation trajectory in a sustainable manner. The NBR Board is reiterating that it will carefully monitor global economic developments and analyze the effects of persistent international financial market turbulences on the Romanian economy. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled for February 7, 2008, along with a 12-month calendar of NBR Board meetings dedicated to monetary policy issues."
Nigeria,2008-02-05,"CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO. 54 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE. FEBRUARY 5th , 2008 The Monetary Policy Committee of the CBN met on 5th February 2008 and decided to leave the MPR unchanged at 95 per cent. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on 5th February, 2008. The Committee reviewed the major domestic and international macroeconomic developments. It also focused attention on the implementation of fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies in 2007, as well as the challenges for the first quarter of 2008. The MPC noted that the domestic macroeconomic environment was stable in 2007 despite tight conditions in the global financial markets engendered by major adverse financial developments like the US sub-prime market crisis. The Committee observed with satisfaction the sustained singledigit inflation rate throughout the year and the orderly functioning of the foreign exchange and domestic financial markets. The Committee recognized that the naira appreciation has been on account of the sustained foreign exchange inflows engendered by the favorable macroeconomic environment and the investment climate as well as high rates of return in domestic financial markets. It therefore, restated its commitment to ensuring continued monetary and price stability through the pursuit of appropriate monetary and exchange rate policies. Key Macroeconomic Developments 3. Inflation The Committee noted with satisfaction the improvement in inflation outcomes in 2007 compared with the previous year. From 85 percent at end-December 2006, the year- on-year (headline) inflation closed at 66 percent in 2007, approximately 2 percentage points lower. The decline in inflation in 2007 was attributable to the restrictive stance of monetary policy, complemented by considerable fiscal restraint and favorable climatic conditions for food production in some parts of the country. Inflation in December 2007, however, was in contrast to inflation rates in the months of December 2005 and December 2006. The Committee, therefore, expressed its concern that given the rise in food prices in December 2007 and the overall global and domestic outlook, it will be necessary to ensure that inflation in 2008 is within single digit. Exchange Rate: The MPC noted the steady appreciation in the Naira exchange rate, particularly in the second half of 2007. In January, 2008 the Naira exchange rate appreciated further and the WDAS rate stood at N11681/US$1 as at end-January. The appreciation of the Naira exchange rate was driven largely by 2 rising private foreign exchange inflows. The Committee recognized that inflows could continue as they were in December and January. However it felt that the exchange rate would settle down at a reasonable level once the uncertainties in the global economy are reduced as a result of the monetary and fiscal actions being taken by industrialized economies. External Reserves: The Committee observed that the gross official reserves as at 31st January, 2008 stood at US$5422 billion. This level of reserves would support about 28 months of current foreign exchange disbursements. Monetary Aggregates: Over the end- December 2006 level, provisional figures indicate that broad money (M2) grew by 3068 per cent in 2007. The growth in M2 was driven by the increase in foreign assets (net) of the banking system as well as the rise in credit to the private sector. While the Committee expressed concern about the rapid growth of M2, it noted with relief that this did not translate to higher inflation during the year, partly on account of improved supply conditions. Credit: The Committee noted that credit to the private sector maintained an upward trend in the last quarter of 2007. Credit to the private sector grew by 96% which is unprecedented in 3 Nigeria's history. The MPC, however, noted that credit to government remained negative all through the year. Interest Rates: The MPC observed that the inter-bank call money market rate increased slightly in December 2007, and January 2008, following the upward review of the MPR at the 201 meeting of the MPC which held on 4th December, 2007. As a result the yield curve has become steep at the shorter end. The Committee noted that the real interest rate however continue to be positive. Fiscal Stance: The Committee noted the salutary effects of sharing the Paris Club debt refund to the states in dollars. The Federal budget for 2008 has projected significant increases in expenditure on account of government focus on infrastructure development, environmental protection and social safety nets. As these expenditures take time to yield results, the initial impact would be on aggregate demand. The private sector's own investments in partnership with those of the public sector would also have lagged effects on output. The Committee welcomes the recent decision of the National Economic Council (NEC) to phase the distribution of the proceeds of the Excess Crude Account to be paid in US dollars. THE OUTLOOK: In the light of the above, the outlook for 2008 while being positive has many elements of uncertainty. The Committee, therefore, decided: 1. To leave the MPR unchanged at 95 per cent 2. To continue the use of Open Market Operations (OMO) for liquidity management and appropriate exchange rate policies. Professor Chukwuma C Soludo CFR Governor. Central Bank of Nigeria. Abuja."
Chile,2008-02-07,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 7 February 2008 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 6.25% (annual). Internationally, the outlook for the U.S. economy has deteriorated significantly, creating high volatility in global financial markets. The Federal funds rate was reduced by 125 bp in the last month and external long-term rates have declined. Although the price of copper has remained high and the oil price has decreased, the external scenario relevant for the Chilean economy presents higher adverse risks. Domestically, economic activity has been less dynamic than projected earlier, because of reduced growth in some specific sectors. Investment indicators remain strong, consumption is showing some signs of deceleration, and salaried employment continues to grow. Annual inflation is still significantly above the tolerance range. The moderate inflation figure of January reflected the drop in domestic fuel prices and a rapid normalization of the high prices of perishable goods. Core inflation measures, including CPIX1 (which excludes fuels, perishables and some regulated utilities), though still high, have ceased to increase. Wages have evolved as expected, while the exchange rate has appreciated substantially. Annual CPI inflation will continue to rise in coming months. Long-term inflation expectations remain anchored around 3% per annum. The Board considers that, although the future path of the monetary policy rate will depend on incoming information and its implications for the inflation forecast, further adjustments of the MPR to ensure convergence of inflation to the target cannot be ruled out. Particularly important for this assessment will be the unfolding of the international scenario, the persistence of the recent exchange rate appreciation, and the potential propagation of last year's inflationary shocks to other prices. * The Spanish original prevails."

Euroarea,2008-02-07,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. Let me report on the outcome of our meeting, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today's meeting to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. This decision reflects our assessment that risks to price stability over the medium term are on the upside, in a context of very vigorous money and credit growth. The current short-term upward pressure on inflation must not spill over to the medium term. The firm anchoring of inflation expectations over the medium and long term is of the highest priority to the Governing Council, reflecting its mandate. Against this background, the Governing Council remains committed to preventing second-round effects and the materialisation of upside risks to price stability over the medium term. As the reappraisal of risk in financial markets continues, there remains unusually high uncertainty about its overall impact on the real economy. While the economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound, incoming data have confirmed that the risks surrounding the outlook for economic activity lie on the downside. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the coming weeks. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. The latest information on economic activity around the turn of the year points to a more moderate pace of growth in the euro area than the quarter-on-quarter rate of 0.8% observed in the third quarter of 2007. This assessment is in line with indicators for business and consumer confidence which, while having declined over the past few months, overall remain consistent with ongoing growth. Looking ahead, while the slowdown in the economies of some of the euro area's major trading partners is likely to have an impact on euro area real GDP growth in 2008, both domestic and foreign demand are expected to support ongoing growth. This assessment is broadly in line with available forecasts from private and public-sector sources. The euro area economy does not have major imbalances Profitability has been sustained and unemployment rates have fallen to levels not seen for 25 years. As a result of the improved economic conditions and wage moderation, the number of people employed and labour force participation have increased significantly. Consumption growth should therefore continue to contribute to economic expansion, in line with real disposable income, and investment growth should provide ongoing support. That said, uncertainty about the prospects for economic growth is unusually high and the risks surrounding the outlook for economic activity have been confirmed to lie on the downside. Risks relate mainly to a potentially broader than currently expected impact of financial market developments on financing conditions and economic sentiment, with negative effects on world and euro area growth. Further downside risks stem from the scope for additional oil and other commodity price rises, concerns about protectionist pressures and the possibility of disorderly developments due to global imbalances. With regard to price developments, according to Eurostat's flash estimate the annual HICP inflation rate was 3.2% in January 2008, compared with 3.1% in December 2007. This confirms the continued strong upward pressure on inflation in the short term, stemming mainly from strong increases in commodity prices, in particular oil and food prices, in recent months. Looking ahead, the annual HICP inflation rate will most likely remain significantly above 2% in the coming months and moderate only gradually in the further course of 2008. This confirms our expectation of a protracted period of temporarily high rates of inflation. Moreover, it is important to stress that the moderation in the rate of inflation which is embedded in the December 2007 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections is based on the assumption that the recent rises in commodity prices will be partly reversed, in line with futures prices. More fundamentally, the projections assume that recent oil and food price dynamics and their impact on HICP inflation do not have broadly-based second-round effects on wage and price-setting behaviour. Risks to this medium-term outlook for price developments are confirmed to lie on the upside. These risks include the possibility that stronger than currently expected wage growth may emerge, taking into account high capacity utilisation and tight labour market conditions. Furthermore, the pricing power of firms, notably in market segments with low competition, could be stronger than expected. At this juncture, it is therefore imperative that all parties concerned meet their responsibilities and that second-round effects on wage and price-setting stemming from current inflation rates be avoided. In the view of the Governing Council, this is of key importance in order to preserve price stability in the medium run and thereby the purchasing power of all euro area citizens. The Governing Council is monitoring wage negotiations in the euro area with particular attention. Indexation of nominal wages to the consumer price index should be avoided. Finally, further rises in oil and agricultural prices, continuing the strong upward trend observed in recent months, as well as increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those foreseen thus far pose upside risks to the inflation outlook. The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. Annual M3 growth, although declining somewhat in December, remained very vigorous at 11.5%, whereas M1 growth continues to moderate, reflecting the dampening impact of higher interest rates. Broad money dynamics in recent quarters are likely to have been influenced by a number of temporary factors, notably the flattening of the yield curve, which may have supported some substitution into monetary assets. Overall, taking these special factors into account, a broad-based assessment of the latest data confirms that the underlying rate of monetary expansion remains strong. This conclusion is supported by the sustained expansion of loans to the domestic private sector, which grew at an annual rate of 11.1% in December. Although the growth of household borrowing has moderated further over the past few quarters, reflecting the impact of higher key ECB interest rates since December 2005 and cooling housing markets in several parts of the euro area, the growth of loans to non-financial corporations has remained very robust. Bank borrowing by euro area non-financial corporations was 14.4% higher at the end of December 2007 than a year earlier. For the time being, there is little evidence that the financial market turbulence since early August 2007 has strongly influenced the dynamics of broad money and credit aggregates. In particular, according to the available data, increased financial market volatility has not led to substantial portfolio shifts into monetary assets, as was the case between 2001 and 2003. Notwithstanding the tightening of credit standards reported in the bank lending survey for the euro area, continued strong loan growth suggests that the supply of bank credit in the euro area has not been significantly impaired by the financial turmoil thus far. Further data and analysis will be required in order to obtain a more complete picture of the impact of the financial market developments on banks' balance sheets, financing conditions and money and credit growth. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment that there are upside risks to price stability over the medium term, in a context of very vigorous money and credit growth and sound economic fundamentals in the euro area. The impact of the ongoing reappraisal of risk in financial markets on the real economy is still surrounded by unusually high uncertainty. Incoming data have confirmed that the risks surrounding the outlook for economic activity lie on the downside. The Governing Council remains committed to preventing second-round effects and the materialisation of upside risks to price stability over the medium term. It is paramount that medium and long-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability. Reflecting its mandate, such anchoring is of the highest priority to the Governing Council. With respect to fiscal policies, a discretionary fiscal loosening in EU countries should be avoided. There is ample evidence that activist fiscal policies were not effective in stabilising European economies but rather led to sustained increases in the ratios of government expenditure and debt to GDP. Allowing the free operation of automatic stabilisers in countries with strong fiscal positions and safeguarding the long-term sustainability of public finances are the best contributions that fiscal policy can make to macroeconomic stability. Countries with fiscal imbalances are urged to make further progress with consolidation, in line with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact. There is a clear risk that some countries will fail to comply with the provisions of the preventive arm of the Pact, thereby undermining its credibility. Structural reforms help economies to adjust to adverse shocks, foster productivity growth and increase employment and competition, thereby also helping to reduce inflationary pressures. In particular, enhancing competition in the services sectors and network industries, as well as applying adequate measures in the EU agricultural market, would be conducive to price stability in the euro area."
Egypt,2008-02-07,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release February 7, 2008 The Central Bank of Egypt decided to raise its overnight deposit rate by 25 bps to 9 percent per annu. In its meeting held on February 7, 2008, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise the overnight deposit and lending rates by 25 bps to 9 percent and 11 percent, respectivel. This decision has been induced by the persistent increase in food inflation and expected upward pressure over the coming perio. Elevated international food prices have led to the acceleration in domestic food inflation, which in turn have been propagated on non- food inflatio. Furthermore the MPC has noticed that in addition to manufacturing and construction, other sectors have started to record higher growth rates that may precipitate more inflationary pressure. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments, especially the factors underlying inflation, and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter.

South Korea,2008-02-13,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the call rate target (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (5.00%) for the intermeeting period. (The following is an English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the call rate target (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (5.00%) for the intermeeting period. Despite the slowdown in the expansion of private consumption, the domestic economy seems likely to maintain its upward trend driven by the robustness of exports. The uncertainty surrounding future economic developments, however, has increased, largely due to the international financial market turmoil and the US economic slowdown. Consumer price inflation has picked up its pace, mainly influenced by high oil prices. The upward trend of real estate prices has flattened out. Liquidity remains ample in the financial markets. Both long-term and short-term market interest rates have been exhibiting downward movements. Meanwhile, certain financial market price variables have been increasingly volatile, mainly in response to the international financial market unrest."
Turkiye,2008-02-14,"The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) decided to lower the policy rates as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate from 15.50 to 15.25 percent, and lending rate from 19.50 to 19.25 percent, b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate applied between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m. from 11.50 to 11.25 percent, lending rate from 22.50 to 22.25 percent, c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions from 18.50 to 18.25 percent. Recent readings on economic activity suggest that the economy continues to grow at a moderate pace. Weakened global credit conditions restrain domestic demand. Moreover, the expected slowdown in global economic activity may lead to a reduction in the contribution of external demand to the economic growth in the medium term. Accordingly, aggregate demand conditions will continue to support disinflation. In this context, inflation is expected to decelerate in the medium term despite risks from food and energy prices. The Committee underlined that the primary goal of the Central Bank of Turkey (CBT) is to achieve price stability, and noted that monetary policy remains restrictive even after the recent rate cuts. Although unprocessed food prices may display temporary fluctuations, inflation excluding energy and food items is expected to remain close to 4 percent. Yet, ongoing uncertainties in the global economy and the risks to the price setting behavior compel the CBT to be attentive to the incoming information. Accordingly, the Committee will closely monitor the lagged impacts of the recent rate cuts. Besides, the second round effects on the wage and price setting behavior of elevated food and energy prices and of the developments in incomes policy will be watched closely. The timing of further easing will depend on developments regarding global market conditions, external demand, fiscal policy implementation, and other factors affecting the medium term inflation outlook. It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight working days."
Peru,2008-02-15,"- MONETARY PROGRAM FOR FEBRUARY 2008 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 5.25% The Board of the Central Bank approved to maintain the monetary policy reference interest rate at 5.25 percent. However, the recent increase in the rates of reserve requirements in domestic currency implies a more restrictive monetary stance as this translates into higher active interest rates and, therefore, favors a more moderate growth of credit in the financial system. The impact of this increase in the rate of reserve requirements is estimated to be equivalent in the short-term to an increase of 25 basis points, although this effect should tend toward 50 basis points in the next months. It is worth noting that in addition to the reference interest rate, the Central Bank may resort occasionally to other instruments of monetary control, such as the rate of reserve requirements. Moreover, the increase in the rates of reserve requirements in domestic currency was complemented with other measures, such as an increase in the rates of reserve requirements in foreign currency and the launching of Certificates of Deposit Subject to Limited Negotiation, with the purpose of neutralizing the massive inflow of short-term capitals observed in the first half of January. As pointed out in previous communiques, the fact that inflation shows temporarily a rate above the target is basically explained by imported inflation, which posted 10.7 percent in the last 12 months. The supply and demand imbalances seen in the international markets of grains and fuel have implied a generalized increase of inflation worldwide. With the aforementioned measures and with the gradual normalization of the international financial turbulence, inflation should converge to the target range in the second half of 2008. The Board continues to oversee the evolution of inflation and its determinants, both domestic and external, distinguishing the factors with temporary impacts from those with permanent effects, and stands ready to take any necessary measure required to ensure that inflation converges to the target range. The Board made this decision considering the following macroeconomic information: The Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) increased 0.2 percent in January, showing a lower increase than in December 2007 (0.45 percent). Last 12-month inflation was 4.15 percent above the inflation target range (2 percent, plus or minus one percentage point), due to the impact of a higher imported inflation which showed an annual rate of 10.7 percent. Core inflation was 0.25 percent in January and 3.27 percent over the last twelve months. Another factor contributing to this evolution was the higher prices of foodstuffs. According to the surveys carried out, inflation is expected to range between 2.95 and 3.60 percent in 2008 and between 2.50 and 3.20 percent in 2009. The recent measures implemented and a decreasing trend in last 12-month inflation that would be seen as of the second quarter of this year should contribute to expectations' convergence toward the target. Economic activity and domestic demand continue to show a dynamic performance due to the optimistic outlook of consumers and business and to the higher growth of credit. Domestic demand is estimated to have grown 11 percent in 2007, while GDP is estimated to have grown 8.5 percent. The average exchange rate fell 1.0 percent compared to December and 7.6 percent over the last twelve months. The average monthly interbank interest rate in January was exceptionally below the reference interest rate (4.44 percent) due to the extraordinary measures implemented to deal with the massive inflow of speculative capitals. The interbank rate has been converging toward the reference rate in the last days, and operations have been made at said rate. During the session, the Board approved to maintain the annual interest rates on the active and passive operations between the BCRP and the financial system: The Board will approve the Monetary Program for the next month on March 13. 2."
Georgia,2008-02-20,"Tbilisi. 02.20.2008 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met today and decided to raise its main policy rate, the one-week Certificate of Deposit (CD) rate, by 100 basis points, to an annual 11 percent. Real GDP growth remains robust, and high capital inflows which showed signs of slight moderation during the last three months picked up again in February and will likely remain strong throughout the rest of the year. Although labor productivity increased year-to-year by 21 percent in the third quarter, according to the latest labor market data, nominal wages continued to grow on average by 39 percent thus creating additional inflationary pressure. Annual inflation continued to decrease in January reaching 10.7 percent and period average inflation of 9.3 percent. As in many other countries the inflation rate was largely driven by strong growth in food and energy prices and subsequent political tensions in Georgia intensifying further inflationary expectations. As of January, the annual inflation rate remains high in the neighboring countries (which are the major trading partners of Georgia) (Russia 12.6 percent. Ukraine 19.4 percent. Azerbaijan 16.3 percent. Armenia 6.6 percent and Turkey 8.2 percent). Moreover, the growth in monetary aggregates and lending fuelled by increased government spending and foreign capital and financial inflows have further exacerbated inflation dynamics. Despite the fact that growth in the monetary base is moderate compared to previous years, due to a rapid expansion of the money multiplier monetary aggregates continue to grow rigorously. Although annual inflation dropped from 11 percent to 10.7 percent in January, there are still upside risks to price stability. Current monetary overhang, increased and more social nature of public spending and strong public inflationary expectations are worsening inflation outlook in the near-term. Moreover, with the oil prices yesterday overshooting US$100 per barrel threshold and soft commodity prices (especially wheat) still increasing rapidly inflationary pressures are likely to grow. Therefore, a tighter monetary policy stance is required to mitigate the abovementioned risks. The NBG will closely monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets with the objective of achieving the forecast inflation rate and will in due course act acc ordingly. 1 The reproduction without citing the source is not allowed.

Hungary,2008-02-25,"1 At its meeting on 25 February 2008, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at 7.50%. 3 At its meeting, the Monetary Council also discussed the February 2008 issue of the Quarterly Report on Inflation. In the Council's view, while Hungarian economic growth continues to be weak, the fall in inflation may be slower than previously expected, consistent with the projection presented in the Report. Although the inflationary effects of the fiscal adjustment measures implemented since 2006 have been wearing off, the disinflation process has more recently been held back by cost shocks of both international and domestic origins. The sharp rises in food and energy prices, as well as the increases in domestic producers' energy prices and administered prices at rates above inflation have been particularly relevant in this respect. The Council has on several occasions expressed that it does not intend to offset the direct effects of cost shocks, due to their temporary nature. However, were potential second-round effects to arise which could lead to a sustained rise in inflation expectations, monetary policy tightening could not be avoided. The recent rise in producer prices has forced domestic firms to make marked adjustments in order to ensure that operations remain profitable. That in turn is acting as a brake on economic growth over the short term. For the time being, only a smaller part of the adjustment has occurred through prices; and the Council expects it to be fully implemented basically through restraining labour costs and improving productivity. This view is reinforced by the subdued rise in wage costs in the final quarter of 2007. However, the prospects for economic activity have deteriorated in recent months. The contribution of net exports to economic growth is expected to be lower in 2009, due to the slowdown in the global economy. Moderate real wage growth and the fall in employment are likely to hold back household consumption growth. Deteriorating external domestic economic activity, as well as rises in credit spreads are expected to be constraining investment. Evidence from business and household surveys, suggesting that economic agents expect the economic recovery to be increasingly sluggish over the period ahead, is consistent with this view. These factors may contribute to a fall in inflation from the demand side. The deterioration in the international investment climate has had an adverse impact on the premium required on forint-denominated assets. If the recent rise in exchange rate risk perceived by investors persists, it may put additional upward pressure on inflation. In the Council's judgement, the adjustment which has been underway in the private sector is a positive development; however, the new cost shocks are putting its sustainability at risk. A prolonged period of disinflation carries the risk that expectations may become stuck at a relatively high level. If the emergence of second-round inflationary effects cannot be ruled out with certainty in the near term, then monetary policy may have to be tightened."
Israel,2008-02-25,"25.2.2008</td> The Bank of Israel cuts the interest rate for March 2008 by 0.5 percentage points to 3.75 percent The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for March 2008 will be reduced by 0.5 percentage points, to 3.75 percent. This step is takenin the context of the policy of maintaining price stability, in accordancewith the inflation target of 1-3 percent a year. Background conditions Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) remained unchangedin January, in line with earlier estimates, but above the seasonal path consistent with the midpoint of the inflation range. In the last twelve months the index has risen by 3.5 percent, above the upper limit of the inflation target. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Israeli forecasters expect, on average, that inflation in the next twelve months will be 2.3 percent.Most forecasters do not expect the interest rate to change in the next fewmonths, and they assess that at the end of 2008 it will be 4.25 percent. Inflation expectations for the next twelve months derived from the capital market declined for the first time in four months, and are currently at 2.4 percent. At the same time, average interest rate expectations in January derived from the capital market are for a rise of about 0.5 percentage pointsby the end of 2008. Real economic activity: Most of the economic indicators publishedduring the last month show that economic activity continued to expand. According to National Accounts data, in the fourth quarter of 2007 GDP rose atan annual rate of 6.4 percent. Imports of investment goods and exports rose in November-January by 12 percent. In contrast, the composite state-of-the-economy index rose by 0.3 percent in January, a relatively low rate. In addition, the anticipated slowdown in the growth of the global economy is expected to affect Israel's economy, and growth in 2008 is expected to be lower than the rates in the last few years. The labor market and wages: The nominal wage per employee post fell by 0.1 percent in November 2007; in the last twelve months the nominal wage rose by 2 percent. Budget policy: In January the government's total activityexcluding credit resulted in a surplus of NIS 4.9 billion. This level of surplus is normal for January, and has not changed during the last three years. The foreign exchange market: The strengthening of the shekel thatstarted in mid-December continued, and in the period between the previous interest rate decision on January 28 and February 24 the shekel appreciatedby 3.2 percent against the dollar, and by 2.4 percent against the euro. The volatility of the shekel/dollar exchange rate continued its trend increase during the last month, a trend evident in most currency markets. The level of activity in the forex market was lower than in the previous month, butremained high. Since the period 2005-06, in which the real effective exchange rate of the shekel (the real exchange rate against the currencies of Israel's trading partners weighted by their share of trade) was at its most depreciated level, the shekel has appreciated by about 10 percent. The capital and money markets: In contrast to last month, when share prices fell sharply, between the previous interest rate decision (on January 28) and February 24, the leading international indices recorded mixedtrends, and the Tel Aviv 25 share price index rose by 4 percent. Followingthe drop in yields on 10-year unindexed government bonds last month, the yields declined this month too, from 5.92 percent to 5.77 percent. The yieldgap between unindexed Israel government bonds and comparable US governmentbonds contracted this month and reached 1.9 percentage points (compared with 2.4 percentage points last month). Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS premium continued to rise, and reached 0.8 percent, up from 0.55 percent prior to the previous interest rate decision. TheCDS spread widened markedly also in the other emerging markets, and surpassed the levels prevailing at the start of the crisis. The world economy: In the last quarter of 2007 the growth of the world economy slowed, reflecting the effects of the crisis in the US housing market and its consequences in the financial markets. Recently inflationary pressures have risen, against the background of the increase in commodity prices, mainly oil and food prices. Forecasters and the markets are increasingly pessimistic about the global economy in 2008. Updated forecasts regarding growth in the US are for an intensification of the growth slowdown, with some forecasting a recession. Forecasts for other advanced economies, including the European Union and Japan, indicate a more severe slowdown than previously expected. Against this background, the markets expect a reduction in the world interest rate environment following interest cuts by the central banks in the leading economies. Analysts and the markets expect the Fed to reduce its rate by 0.5 percentage points on 18 March. Expectations of a rise in the ECB interest rate have turned into expectations of no change or even a reduction this year. The Bank of England is also expected to continue to reduce its interest rate during this year. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to cut the interest rate for March by 0.5 percentage pointsis consistent with a return of inflation to within the target range of 1-3 percent inflation before the end of the year. In the last few weeks the forces acting to moderate inflation--mainly the increased chances of a significant slowdown in the global economy--have grown stronger, in contrast to the situation a month ago when the forces acting in opposite directions were balanced.This was reflected among other things by the January CPI, which rose more modestly than in the previous two months, and in the expected reductions in the CPI in the next two months. Underlying this are assessments that inflation measured over the previous twelve months will return to within the target range during the second half of the year, and will be close to its midpoint towards the end of the year. The reduction of inflationary pressures this month derived from the following developments: 1) The more severe slowdown in growth in the US. Europe and Japan, and hence also in world trade, that is now expected is likely to impact the Israeli economy, andto lower inflation in the coming months. 2) The strengthening of the shekel against other currencies since mid-December 2007 in itself acts to lower the pressures for price increases in the next few months, even if to a lesser degree than in the past. 3) In light ofthe expectation of a lower global interest rate environment, a reduction in the Bank of Israel interest rate is required due to the moderating effecton price rises in Israel of the interest rate differentials between Israeland abroad, via the strengthening of the shekel. Subject to the reduction in inflationary pressures, as described above, the 0.5 percentage point cut in the interest rate is likely to support continued economic growth, while being consistent with inflation returning to within the target range this year. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor domestic and world economic developments closely with the intention of achieving the price-stability target. Subject to this, the Bank will continue to support the attainment of a range of objectives of macroeconomic policy, in particular the encouragement of employment and growth. In addition, the Bank will continue to support the stability of the financial system. 25.2.2008</td> The Bank of Israel cuts the interest rate for March 2008 by 0.5 percentage points to 3.75 percent.

Malaysia,2008-02-25,"At the Monetary Policy Committee meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to leave the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) unchanged at 3.50 percent. The latest indicators show strong domestic demand will provide the support for the Malaysian economy to perform well in the coming months. The demand for financing by businesses and consumers remains strong, with robust investment activity as corporations expand capacity, and steady consumption growth also being supported by a stable employment environment and growth in incomes. The risks to the Malaysian economy are primarily from the external sector. The heightened downside risks to global growth have been affirmed by the latest data released by the large industrial countries. Commodity and food prices have continued their upward trend, and this is contributing to higher global inflation. Consequently, the impact of these developments on inflation in Malaysia is expected to be felt in the first half of 2008. However, as global growth slows, this would be expected to ease some of the inflationary pressures. Overall, there continues to be a high degree of uncertainty regarding the macroeconomic environment over the policy horizon. The current assessment of the balance of risks to the growth and inflation prospects does not prompt a change to the present stance of monetary policy, which remains supportive of growth.

Poland,2008-02-27,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 27 February 2008 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 26-27 February 2008 The Council decided to increase the NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage point to the level: (cid:131) reference rate 5.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate 7.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate 4.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate 5.75% on an annual basis. The Polish economy is still in the period of strong growth encompassing all its sectors. Preliminary data on national accounts indicate that economic growth in 2007 was consistent with the expectations of the October Inflation Report. Macroeconomic data released since the last meeting of the Council point at the continuation of strong economic growth in Poland at the beginning of 2008. Uncertainty persists as to the prospects of growth of the global and consequently Polish economy. According to GUS preliminary data, in January the annual growth of consumer prices in Poland reached 4.3%, thus remaining above the NBP's inflation target of 2.5% and also above the upper limit for deviations from the target set at 3.5%. This rise in inflation was largely driven by growing prices of services connected with house maintenance and energy. As in many other countries, increased inflation has been largely sustained by strong annual growth of food and fuel prices. Another factor increasing inflation was the growth in the prices of some services. In the Council's assessment, in the near future inflation will remain above the upper limit for deviations from the inflation target, which may also, to a large extent, be the result of the expected further rise of regulated prices. The Council got acquainted with the projection of inflation and GDP based on the ECMOD model, which has been prepared by the Economic Institute of the NBP. The projection is one of the inputs into the Council's decision-making on the NBP interest rates. The annual growth of consumer prices forecast in the February projection is significantly higher than expected in the October projection till mid-2009, while in the second half of 2009 it is close to that forecast in the October projection. Under constant interest rates, there is a 50-percent probability that projected inflation will remain within the range of 3.6-4.7% in 2008 (compared to 2.2-3.5% in the October projection), 2.6-4.9% in 2009 (compared to 2.5-4.6%) and 2.1-4.8% in 2010 (the October projection did not cover the year 2010). According to the February ECMOD-based projection, the annual GDP growth will remain, with 50-percent probability, within the range of 4.4-5.8% in 2008 (compared to 4.4-6.2% in the October projection), 3.5-6.1% in 2009 (compared to 3.8-6.7%) and 3.6-6.9% in 2010. ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51. The Council also got acquainted with other forecasts conducted at the NBP. In the Council's assessment, in the coming quarters economic growth will most probably continue to exceed the growth of potential GDP. The latest information on labour market developments points to persistently high growth in wages and deteriorating relation between wage and labour productivity growth. It is quite probable that the wage pressure and, consequently, inflationary pressure will persist. The period of temporarily increased inflation results from the expected increased growth of regulated prices and the food and fuel price growth observed in the world economy and also affecting the Polish market. This creates a risk of inflation expectations staying high and, consequently, feeds the risk of the so-called second-round effects. Moreover, based on preliminary information on 2007 central budget implementation and the 2008 Budget Act adopted by the Parliament, the budget deficit can be expected to be higher this year than in 2007. In the medium term inflation may be curbed by the continuing very good financial results of enterprises and high investment growth conducive to productivity growth. Inflation may also be constrained by globalisation and the ensuing increased competition in the market of internationally traded goods and services as well as the relative stability of zloty exchange rate. The inflationary pressure may also be reduced by a slowdown of the global economy. Nevertheless, the Council assessed that the impact of those factors may prove insufficient to bring inflation down to the target over the monetary policy transmission horizon. Considering the above factors and taking into consideration the results of the February inflation projection, the Council assessed the probability of inflation overshooting the inflation target in the medium term to be higher than the probability of inflation running below the target and decided to raise the NBP's interest rates. The Council will strive to bring inflation down to the level consistent with the inflation target in the medium term. The Council will be closely monitoring the growth and structure of domestic demand, including the degree of the expansionary fiscal policy stance, the relation between wage and labour productivity growth in the enterprise sector and wage growth in the public finance sector, zloty exchange rate, developments of the current account balance and the impact of globalisation on the economy and on food prices. The Council will also analyse changes in the external factors affecting the Polish economy and their impact on the outlook for economic growth and inflation in Poland. The Council has adopted the February 2008 Inflation Report."
Thailand,2008-02-27,"No 7 /2008 Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 27 February 2008 Ms. Duangmanee Vongpradhip. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand, announces that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance. The main issues discussed were as follows. Domestic demand accelerated, both in consumption and investment, while exports expanded robustly. In addition, the improvement in private sector confidence and the government's plan for additional fiscal stimulus would support a continued recovery in domestic demand, which going forward, would help cushion the impact from the risk of a slowdown in export growth, given the signs of a US recession. Headline inflation adjusted upwards and could continue to accelerate in the near future as a result of higher world oil and commodity prices. However the recent appreciation of the Thai baht would help reduce inflationary pressures from world commodity prices somewhat. The MPC deemed that the overall growth momentum of the Thai economy improved due to the pickup in domestic demand, partly as a result of accommodative monetary policy in earlier periods. Headline inflation remained at a high level, but was expected to moderate going forward. At the same time, core inflation was expected to remain within the target range throughout the next 8 quarters. However risks remained that global economic growth could turn out weaker than expected, affecting the Thai economy and inflation expectations going forward. The situation would therefore need to be monitored closely. In the meantime, the MPC decided to keep the policy interest rate at 325 per cent per annum."
Euroarea,2008-03-06,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. Let me report on the outcome of our meeting, which was also attended by Mr Bajuk. President of the ECOFIN Council, and Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today's meeting to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The latest information has confirmed the existence of strong short-term upward pressure on inflation. It has also confirmed the assessment that there are upside risks to price stability over the medium term, in a context of very vigorous money and credit growth. Incoming macroeconomic data point to moderating but ongoing real GDP growth. Yet the level of uncertainty resulting from the turmoil in financial markets remains high. Against this background, we emphasise that maintaining price stability in the medium term is our primary objective in accordance with our mandate. Indeed, the firm anchoring of medium to longer-term inflation expectations is of the highest priority to the Governing Council. We believe that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving this objective. The Governing Council remains strongly committed to preventing second-round effects and the materialisation of upside risks to price stability over the medium term. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the coming weeks. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. The latest information on economic activity confirms the picture of moderating growth around the turn of the year. According to Eurostat's first estimate, the quarter-on-quarter growth rate of euro area real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2007 was 0.4%, following 0.8% in the previous quarter. Surveys of business and consumer confidence, which have followed a downward trend since the summer of 2007, overall remain consistent with ongoing growth. Looking ahead, in 2008 both domestic and foreign demand are expected to support ongoing real GDP growth in the euro area, albeit at lower rates than during 2007. The fundamentals of the euro area economy remain sound and the euro area economy does not suffer from major imbalances. While being dampened by the global slowdown, investment growth should provide ongoing support, as capacity utilisation is high and profitability has been sustained. At the same time, as a result of the improved economic conditions and wage moderation, employment and labour force participation have increased significantly and unemployment rates have fallen to levels not seen for 25 years. While being dampened by higher commodity prices, consumption growth should continue to contribute to economic expansion, in line with rising employment. These factors are also reflected in the March 2008 ECB staff macroeconomic projections. Annual real GDP growth is projected to lie in the range of 1.3% to 2.1% in 2008, and to be between 1.3% and 2.3% in 2009. In comparison with the December 2007 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the ranges projected for real GDP growth in 2008 and 2009 have been revised downwards, reflecting weaker global demand, stronger pressure from commodity prices and less favourable financing conditions than were foreseen in December. Available forecasts from international organisations broadly confirm this outlook. In the view of the Governing Council, uncertainty about the prospects for economic growth remains unusually high. Downside risks to the outlook for economic activity continue to exist. They relate mainly to a potentially broader than currently expected impact of financial market developments. Further downside risks stem from the scope for additional commodity price rises, protectionist pressures and the possibility of disorderly developments owing to global imbalances. With regard to price developments, according to Eurostat's first estimate, the annual HICP inflation rate was 3.2% in February 2008, unchanged from January. This confirms the strong upward pressure on inflation in the short term, stemming mainly from the increases in energy and food prices in recent months. Looking ahead, we expect a more protracted period of relatively high rates of inflation than we did a few months ago. The annual HICP inflation rate will most likely remain significantly above 2% in the coming months and moderate only gradually later in the year. The March 2008 ECB staff macroeconomic projections foresee annual HICP inflation of between 2.6% and 3.2% in 2008, and between 1.5% and 2.7% in 2009. Compared with the December 2007 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the projected ranges for HICP inflation have shifted upwards, mainly reflecting significant additional increases in food and energy prices. It is important to recall that these staff projections are based on a number of assumptions which are of a purely technical nature and unrelated to policy intentions. In particular, the technical assumptions for short-term interest rates are taken from market expectations as at mid-February. Moreover, it should be noted that the projections are based on the assumptions that the recent dynamism in commodity prices will diminish over the projection horizon, in line with futures prices, and that pressure from labour costs and profit margins will be limited. In the view of the Governing Council, the risks to the outlook for inflation over the medium term are on the upside. These risks include further rises in oil and agricultural prices, continuing the strong upward trend observed in recent months. Furthermore, they include the possibility that stronger than currently expected wage growth may emerge, taking into account high capacity utilisation and tight labour market conditions. Moreover, the pricing power of firms, notably in market segments with low competition, could be stronger than expected. Increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those foreseen thus far also pose upside risks to the inflation outlook. At this juncture, it is imperative that all parties concerned meet their responsibilities and that second-round effects on price-setting, on the one hand, and on wages, on the other hand, stemming from current inflation rates be avoided. In the view of the Governing Council, this is of key importance in order to preserve price stability in the medium term and thereby the purchasing power of all euro area citizens. The Governing Council is monitoring wage negotiations in the euro area with particular attention. In this context, the Governing Council is concerned about the existence of schemes in which nominal wages are indexed to consumer prices. Such schemes involve the risk of upward shocks in inflation leading to a wage-price spiral, which would be detrimental to employment and competitiveness in the countries concerned. The Governing Council therefore calls for such schemes to be avoided. The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. Annual M3 growth remained very vigorous at 11.5% in January, supported by the continued strong growth of MFI loans to the private sector. A number of temporary factors suggest that M3 growth currently overstates the pace of the underlying monetary expansion. The relatively flat yield curve in particular has made holding monetary assets more attractive. However, even after taking such effects into account, a broad-based assessment of the latest data confirms that the underlying rate of money and credit growth remains strong. The growth of household borrowing has moderated over recent months, reflecting the impact of higher key ECB interest rates since December 2005 and cooling housing markets in several parts of the euro area. However, the growth of loans to non-financial corporations has remained very robust. Bank borrowing by euro area non-financial corporations grew at an annual rate of 14.6% in the year to January 2008. Overall, bank loans to the domestic private sector have grown at around 11% on an annual basis for the past two years. For the time being, there is little evidence that the financial market turbulence since early August 2007 strongly influenced the overall dynamics of broad money and credit aggregates up to January 2008. In addition, according to the available data, the turmoil has not led to substantial portfolio shifts into monetary assets, as were observed between 2001 and 2003. Notwithstanding the tightening of credit standards reported in the bank lending survey for the euro area, continued strong loan growth to non-financial corporations suggests that the supply of bank credit to firms in the euro area has not been significantly impaired by the financial turmoil thus far. Further data and analysis will be required in order to obtain a more complete picture of the impact of the financial market developments on banks' balance sheets, financing conditions and money and credit growth. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis fully confirms the assessment that there are upside risks to price stability over the medium term, in a context of very vigorous money and credit growth. Incoming macroeconomic data point to moderating but ongoing real GDP growth. Yet the level of uncertainty resulting from the turmoil in financial markets remains high. We emphasise that the firm anchoring of medium to longer-term inflation expectations is of the highest priority to the Governing Council. We believe that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving this objective. The Governing Council remains strongly committed to preventing second-round effects and the materialisation of upside risks to price stability over the medium term. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the coming weeks. Regarding fiscal policies, the Governing Council welcomes the fact that the Berlin Eurogroup agreement of April 2007, including the consolidation targets, was confirmed in the ECOFIN Council's opinions on the latest stability programme updates. There is no justification for delaying structural fiscal consolidation in countries with remaining fiscal imbalances. On the contrary, the challenges ahead call for particularly prudent and stability-oriented fiscal policies to support private sector confidence. Achieving and maintaining sound fiscal positions will also allow the free operation of automatic stabilisers and contribute to the smooth functioning of Economic and Monetary Union. Structural reforms would not only be beneficial for employment and potential growth, but would also help to reduce inflationary pressures. Enhancing competition, especially in services and network industries, is essential at this juncture to support price stability and enhance productivity growth. Similarly, administered prices, indirect taxes, minimum wage legislation and public sector wage-setting should not add to inflationary pressures in the economy."
South Korea,2008-03-07,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to set the Base Rate at 5.00% for the intermeeting period, the same level as the current call rate target. * <Attachment> Introduction of New Policy Rate by the Bank of Korea (The following is an English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to set the Base Rate at 5.00% for the intermeeting period, the same level as the current call rate target. The domestic economy seems likely to maintain its upward trend. While private consumption's pace of expansion has slackened, exports continue to post robust growth. There is, however, a high degree of uncertainty surrounding future economic developments largely due to the international financial market turmoil and the US economic slowdown. Consumer price inflation continues to show a rapid rise, mainly influenced by high oil prices. The upward trend of real estate prices remains blunted. Liquidity is still ample in the financial markets. Both long-term and short-term market interest rates have maintained downward trends. Meanwhile, certain financial market price variables have been increasingly volatile, largely in response to the international financial market unrest. < Attachment > Introduction of New Policy Rate by the Bank of Korea From today, the policy rate that the Monetary Policy Committee sets and announces, has been changed from 'the call rate target' (uncollateralized overnight rate) to 'the Bank of Korea Base Rate' (termed 'the Base Rate' in future). The Base Rate is the reference rate applied to transactions between the Bank and financial institutions. Specifically, the Base Rate will be used as the fixed bid rate for 7-day RPs and the minimum bid rate for 7-day reverse RPs in open market operations. Further, the interest rates on standing facilities, which consist of Liquidity Adjustment Loans and * Deposits, will be set by applying spreads fitted around the Base Rate. * Currently, in normal circumstances, the interest rates applied on Liquidity Adjustment Loans are 100 basis points above the Base Rate and those on Liquidity Adjustment Deposits 100 basis points below it. These rates are reduced to 50 basis points either way on the final day of a reserve maintenance period. Meanwhile, taking into consideration the characteristics of secured 7-day RPs and uncollateralized overnight call transactions, it is the Monetary Policy Committee's opinion that the Base Rate and the call rate target represent equivalents. Therefore the setting of the Base Rate at the same level as the previous call rate target means that the monetary policy stance remains unchanged. While the term premium implies that the Base Rate applied to 7-day RPs may be somewhat higher than the overnight call rate, the opposite is in fact the case when the provision of collateral is taken into account."
United States,2008-03-11,"Since the coordinated actions taken in December 2007, the G-10 central banks have continued to work together closely and to consult regularly on liquidity pressures in funding markets. Pressures in some of these markets have recently increased again. We all continue to work together and will take appropriate steps to address those liquidity pressures. To that end, today the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve, and the Swiss National Bank are announcing specific measures. Federal Reserve ActionsThe Federal Reserve announced today an expansion of its securities lending program. Under this new Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF), the Federal Reserve will lend up to $200 billion of Treasury securities to primary dealers secured for a term of 28 days (rather than overnight, as in the existing program) by a pledge of other securities, including federal agency debt, federal agency residential-mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and non-agency AAA/Aaa-rated private-label residential MBS. The TSLF is intended to promote liquidity in the financing markets for Treasury and other collateral and thus to foster the functioning of financial markets more generally. As is the case with the current securities lending program, securities will be made available through an auction process. Auctions will be held on a weekly basis, beginning on March 27, 2008. The Federal Reserve will consult with primary dealers on technical design features of the TSLF. In addition, the Federal Open Market Committee has authorized increases in its existing temporary reciprocal currency arrangements (swap lines) with the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Swiss National Bank (SNB). These arrangements will now provide dollars in amounts of up to $30 billion and $6 billion to the ECB and the SNB, respectively, representing increases of $10 billion and $2 billion. The FOMC extended the term of these swap lines through September 30, 2008. The actions announced today supplement the measures announced by the Federal Reserve on Friday to boost the size of the Term Auction Facility to $100 billion and to undertake a series of term repurchase transactions that will cumulate to $100 billion.

Philippines,2008-03-12,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to keep the BSP's key policy interest rates at 5 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 7 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs and RPs were also left unchanged. In its assessment, the Monetary Board observed that the outlook for inflation in 2008 is influenced by elevated prices of global food and energy products, which could be largely transitory. Since the key risks to the outlook for the remainder of the year are linked to imported oil and non-oil commodity prices, the Monetary Board concluded that these risks cannot be effectively addressed by monetary policy. The supply-side developments are best addressed by non-monetary measures, including by keeping a close watch on the trends in the global commodities market, by coordinating closely with concerned government agencies involved in monitoring prices and ensuring the adequate supply of commodities, and by careful communication of the inflation outlook. In deciding to keep the BSP's key policy rates steady, the Monetary Board noted that the emerging inflation outlook for 2009 is consistent with the 3.5 percent( + 1 percentage point) target for that year, even as external supply shocks pose risks to the 4 percent ( + 1 percentage point) target in 2008. Given the lag in the impact of monetary policy, any policy move at this time is expected to affect the inflation outcome for 2009. The Monetary Board also decided to implement immediately the following refinements in the Special Deposit Account (SDA) facility: the closure of existing windows for the two-, three-, and six-month tenors; and the reduction of the interest rates on the remaining tenors. This will ensure that banks' loanable funds remain adequate to meet the requirements of the expanding economy. Encouraging banks to lend more will help sustain the strengthening of most demand indicators and will be consistent with the forecast for continued strong economic activity. The outlook for inflation, which is seen to be manageable over the BSP's two-year policy horizon, supports the need for caution in monetary policy. The BSP will continue to be attentive to possible second-round effects from supply shocks and to ensure that inflation expectations are well-anchored in order to achieve the Government's inflation targets."
Chile,2008-03-13,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 13 March 2008 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 6.25% (annual). Internationally, the U.S. scenario has deteriorated further, generating high volatility and increased risk in global financial markets. The central banks of the main developed economies have adopted additional measures to face liquidity problems. So far, emerging economies have not been severely affected, although the risk of adverse scenarios has increased. The prices of commodities have recorded significant increases. Domestically, the latest information confirms that first-quarter output growth has been somewhat below than forecasted in the Monetary Policy Report. Investment indicators remain strong, while consumption shows signs of some slowdown. Unemployment has remained stable within a context of significant increases in employment. Annual inflation is still substantially above the target. Core inflation measures, including the CPIX1 (which excludes fuels, perishables and some regulated utilities) remain high but have ceased to rise. Wages have increased in line with their normal dynamics, while the peso showed a significant appreciation in real terms. Annual CPI inflation will increase in the coming months, to then descend over the course of the second half, within a context of high market uncertainty about expected monthly figures. This greater uncertainty has pushed upward the risk premium contained in breakeven inflation measures implicit in financial asset prices, even for longer maturities. Long-term inflation expectations remain well- anchored around 3% annually. The Board considers that, although the future path of the monetary policy rate will depend on incoming information and its implications for the inflation forecast, further adjustments of the MPR to ensure convergence of inflation to the target cannot be ruled out. Particularly important for this assessment will be the inflationary implications of the unfolding of the international scenario, of the persistence of the recent real exchange rate appreciation, and of the potential propagation of recent months' inflationary shocks to other prices. * The Spanish original prevails."
Peru,2008-03-15,"- MONETARY PROGRAM FOR MARCH 2008 BCRP MAINTAINS REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 5.25% AND RAISES THE RATES OF RESERVE REQUIREMENTS The Board of Directors of the Banco Central de Reserva del Perú approved to raise legal reserve requirements from 7 to 8 percent and to increase marginal reserve requirements from 15 to 20 percent as of April 2008. The Board also approved to increase the rate of marginal reserve requirements for non-resident financial entities' short-term deposits and liabilities in any currency to 40 percent. The Board decided to maintain the monetary policy reference interest rate at 5.25 percent considering that the impact of the increase of the rate of reserve requirements, effective as of April, would be equivalent to raising said rate by 50 basis points. These additional raises of the reserve requirement ratio add onto the measures being implemented by the BCRP since July 2007 in order to lead inflation to converge to the target range as soon as possible. Between July 2007 and January 2008 the reference interest rate was raised on three occasions, as a result of which this rate increased from 4.5 to 5.25 percent. Moreover, in February the BCRP raised the rates of reserve requirements in domestic currency and foreign currency. The raise of the rate of reserve requirements in domestic currency implemented in February is estimated to have an impact equivalent to raising the interest rate by 59 basis points. All these measures imply an additional adjustment in the monetary policy to prevent that the rises seen in international prices translate into inflation expectations in a context of strong growth of domestic demand. As pointed out in previous communiques, inflation is temporarily above the target mainly due to imported inflation, which affects the main food inputs. In February, inflation showed a monthly rate of 0.91 percent, while core inflation was 0.36 percent. These results were also influenced by adverse weather conditions which affected the supply of foodstuffs. Thus, in February the rate of inflation excluding foodstuffs was 0.04 percent. Accumulated inflation over the last 12 months up to February was 4.82 percent. Core inflation was 3.4 percent, but it should be taken into account that this includes some food products such as milk, beef, and eating out-related prices. Accumulated inflation excluding foodstuffs was 2.1 percent. This evolution of inflation has influenced higher inflationary expectations over the last few months. However, the recently adopted measures and the downward trend that inflation should follow after supply problems subside should contribute to expectations' convergence towards the target. The Board of Directors continues to oversee the evolution of inflation and its determinants, both domestic and external, distinguishing the factors with temporary effects from those with permanent impacts in order to adopt any necessary measure required to lead inflation back to the target range. During the session, the Board approved to maintain the interest rates on active and passive operations with the financial system. Furthermore, the Board also approved to initiate the procedures required to raise the limit of the investments that Private Pension Fund Administrators can make abroad from 17 to 20 percent. The Board of Directors will approve the Monetary Program for April on its session of April 2."
United States,2008-03-18,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 75 basis points to 2-1/4 percent. Recent information indicates that the outlook for economic activity has weakened further. Growth in consumer spending has slowed and labor markets have softened. Financial markets remain under considerable stress, and the tightening of credit conditions and the deepening of the housing contraction are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters. Inflation has been elevated, and some indicators of inflation expectations have risen. The Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters, reflecting a projected leveling-out of energy and other commodity prices and an easing of pressures on resource utilization. Still, uncertainty about the inflation outlook has increased. It will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully. Today's policy action, combined with those taken earlier, including measures to foster market liquidity, should help to promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate the risks to economic activity. However, downside risks to growth remain. The Committee will act in a timely manner as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; Timothy F Geithner. Vice Chairman; Donald L Kohn; Randall S Kroszner; Frederic S Mishkin; Sandra Pianalto; Gary H Stern; and Kevin M Warsh. Voting against were Richard W Fisher and Charles I Plosser, who preferred less aggressive action at this meeting. In a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 75-basis-point decrease in the discount rate to 2-1/2 percent. In taking this action, the Board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston. New York, and San Francisco."
Georgia,2008-03-19,"PRESS RELEASE Date: Tbilisi. 19 March, 2008 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met today and decided to leave its main policy rate unchanged at 11 percent. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met today and decided to leave its main policy rate unchanged at 11 percent. Economic activity and the level of capital inflows remain strong and will likely remain at a high level for the remainder of the year. In March, the inflow of foreign capital intensified in particular, which was marked by an increase in NBG interventions in the foreign exchange market. The annual inflation rate in February made up 10.9 percent, while the average annual inflation was 9.3 percent. The inflation rate still remains quite high in the major trading partner countries of Georgia, which is mainly due to increases in the prices of energy and food products. As of February, the inflation rate was 12.7% in Russia, 21.9% in the Ukraine, 17.1% in Azerbaijan, 7.4% in Armenia, 9.1% in Turkey, 3.1% in the Eurozone and 4.0% in the U.S. The tensions in international markets, particularly in the U.S., continued to intensify, leading to a sharp depreciation of the US Dollar against other foreign currencies, causing prices of major commodities to increase. Despite the fact that growth in the monetary base is moderate compared to previous years, due to a rapid expansion of the money multipliers monetary aggregates continue to grow rigorously. The short-term interest rates in the interbank market increased and surpassed 11 percent, which is a result of a tighter monetary policy of the previous period. Taking into consideration that significant increases in administrative prices will not be observed and commodity prices will be in line with the existing forecasts, the current interest rates will insure that an inflation rate of 8 percent will be achieved by the end of the year. In addition, the inflation risks mentioned in the previous Monetary Policy Committee statement have not changed. The NBG will closely monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets with the objective of achieving the forecast inflation rate and will in due course act accordingly. The schedule of the MPC meetings is posted on the website of the NBG. The next meeting will take place on April 16, 2008. Contact: Giorgi Kalandadze.

Turkiye,2008-03-19,"The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) has decided to keep policy rates unchanged as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 15.25 percent, and lending rate at 19.25 percent, b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m. at 11.25 percent, lending rate at 22.25 percent, c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 18.25 percent. The Committee assesses that rising global uncertainty and the adverse developments in food and energy prices may lead to some delay in reaching the inflation target. On the other hand, deepening problems in international credit markets have increased the downside risks on economic growth, indicating that aggregate demand conditions will continue to support disinflation. Monetary policy remains restrictive even after the recent rate cuts. Yet, ongoing uncertainties in the global economy and the risks to the price setting behavior have increased the need for the monetary policy to be more cautious. The Committee will continue to closely monitor the second round effects of the elevated food and energy prices. Future rate cuts will depend on developments regarding global market conditions, external demand, fiscal policy implementation, and other factors affecting the medium term inflation outlook. It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight working days."
Egypt,2008-03-23,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release March 23, 2008 The Central Bank of Egypt decided to raise its overnight deposit by 50 bps to 950 percent per annu. In its meeting held on March 23, 2008, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise the overnight deposit and lending rates by 50 bps to 95 percent and 115 percent, respectivel. The headline CPI jumped to 105 percent in January and accelerated further to 121 in February, 2008, exceeding the central bank's comfort zon. While dominated by the persistent increase in food inflation, latest inflation developments have been intensified by the widely spread propagation to non-food price. High international food prices are likely to continue exerting upward pressure on domestic food inflation, in turn, triggering further spillovers to non-food inflatio. Moreover despite downward revisions to the global economic growth outlook, domestic growth is expected to maintain momentum, precipitating inflationary pressure. Having considered the above, the MPC assesses that the balance of risks to the inflation outlook continue to be on the upside and today's decision aims at containing inflation expectation. MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments, especially the factors underlying inflation, and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter.

Israel,2008-03-24,"24.3.2008</td> The Bank of Israel cuts the interest rate for April 2008 by 0.5 percentage points to 3.25 percent The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for April 2008 will be reduced by 0.5 percentage points, to 3.25 percent. This step is taken in the context of the policy of maintaining price stability, in accordance with the inflation target of 1-3 percent a year. Background conditions Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) fell by 0.2 percent in February, in line with earlier estimates, and rose by 3.6 percent in the last twelve months. The easing of energy prices in January and the appreciation of the shekel in the last few weeks acted to lower the February CPI, while the rise in food prices had the reverse effect. In the last twelve months the CPI excluding the energy and food components rose by only 0.9 percent. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Israeli forecasters expect, on average, that inflation in the next twelve months will be 2.7 percent,and that the interest rate for April will be cut by between a quarter of a percentage point and one percentage point; on average they expect a reduction of 0.5 percentage points in the interest rate. Inflation expectations for the next twelve months derived from the capital market rose from 2.4 percent in February to 2.7 percent in March. At the same time, expectations regarding the interest rate, derived from the capital market, are for a reduction in the next few months. Since the Bank's different econometricmodels indicate differing scenarios, they received less than their usual weight in the discussions prior to this interest rate decision. Real economic activity: The rapid rate of growth in Israel's economy in the last few years continued and even strengthened in the last quarter of 2007, when GDP and business sector product increased by 6.1 percent and 7.7 percent respectively, in annual terms. Spearheading the growth in that quarter was the acceleration in exports and in investment. The composite state-of-the-economy index for February rose by 0.4 percent, indicating continued expansion, albeit at a lower rate than in 2007. Global economic developments, on the other hand, increase the probability of a lower rate of growth--less than 3.5 percent--in contrast to the rate of more than 5 percent recorded since the middle of 2003. The expected slowdown in Israel's growth reflects the decline inexports and in private consumption expected to result from the slowdown in the global economy. The labor market and wages: In the last quarter of 2007, unemployment fell to 6.7 percent in the last quarter of 2007, and the real wage andunit labor costs remained unchanged. The nominal wage rose by 2.9 percent in that quarter relative to the same quarter in 2006. Budget policy: In February the domestic deficit totaled NIS 0.5 billion. Based on the seasonal path, the level hitherto is consistent with meeting the deficit target of up to 1.6 percent of GDP. Direct tax revenues fell by 12.1 percent compared with the corresponding period in 2007. The drop in direct tax revenues resulted mainly from unusually high non-recurringtax receipts at the beginning of 2007, and from the cuts in tax rates. Excluding the effect of these factors, tax revenues in the first two months of 2007 are higher than those expected in the budget forecast. The upward trend in revenue from indirect taxes continued. The foreign exchange market: The strengthening of the shekel thatstarted in mid-December 2007 continued, and in the period between the previous interest rate decision on 25 February and 23 March the shekel appreciated by 5.4 percent against the dollar, and by 1.5 percent against the euro.In the days immediately following the cut in the Bank of Israel interest rate for March 2008, the shekel weakened against those two currencies, but then strengthened again. Between March 10 and 12 it strengthened to an abnormal extent until the Bank's intervention in the foreign exchange market on 13 and 14 March. Following that intervention, the shekel weakened against both the dollar and the euro. In that period most of the major currencies strengthened against the dollar, by up to 5 percent. Unlike in the previous month, the volatility of the shekel/dollar exchange rate declined this month. Trading in the foreign currency market stayed at about the same level as in the previous month--about $2.1 billion a day. On 20 March the Bank of Israel announced its intention to increase its foreign exchange reserves by about $10 billion by purchases of about $25 million a day on the market over the next two years. The capital and money markets: Between the previous interest ratediscussion on 25 February, and 23 March, the indices of the leading stock exchanges abroad recorded declines of up to 9 percent; the Tel Aviv 100 share price index fell by 8.6 percent. Yields on 10-year unindexed government bonds dropped again this month, to 5.63 percent, compared with 5.77 percentlast month. The yield gap between these bonds and comparable US governmentbonds widened this month to 2.3 percentage points (compared with 1.9 percentage points last month). Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS premium continued to rise, and reached 0.9 percent, up from 0.8 percent prior to the previous interest rate decision. The CDS spread widened markedly also in the other emerging markets, and surpassed the levels prevailing at the start of the crisis. The world economy: Macroeconomic data relating to the US economy indicate a significant deterioration, and expectations are for growth ratesof less than one percent in both 2008 and 2009. At the same time commodityand energy prices continued rising steeply. The assessment by the Federal Reserve, however, is that the expected slowdown in the US will lead to a decline in inflation, so that its policy is essentially directed towards counteracting the economic slowdown and the liquidity crisis. At their last meeting, on 18 March, the Fed cut the interest rate by 0.75 percentage points to 2.25 percent, and the markets expect a further cut of about 0.5 percentage points in the next few months. The ECB, on the other hand, continues to regard inflation as the major risk, and it is therefore not expected to cutits interest rate. It should be noted that in contrast to the recent trend, most commodity and energy prices fell sharply in the last few days, and at the same time inflation expectations based on these prices also dropped. Since the beginning of March, the credit markets have deteriorated further. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to cut the interest rate for April by 0.5 percentage pointsis consistent with a return of inflation to within the target range of 1-3 percent inflation in the second half of the year. The forces that served to moderate price increases last month--mainly the higher probability of a slowdown in the global economy and the strengthening of the shekel--continued to do so this month even more strongly. The increased intensity of these forces derives from the following: 1) In light of the latest forecasts of a more severe slowdown in growth in the US and in the global economy, and hence of a slower expansion of world trade, the assessments of a slowdown in Israel's growth rate--and its effect in moderating inflationary pressures, among other things by reducing both the demand for exports, mainly to the US, and domestic demand--have firmed. 2) The degree of the strengthening of the shekel against other currencies since mid-December 2007 in itself acts to lower the pressures for price increases in the next few months, despite the weakening of the link between changes in the dollar exchange rate and the CPI. 3) The global interest rate environment has fallen and is expected to continue to fall further. Thus a reduction in the Bank of Israel interest rate is required this month too due to the moderating effect on price rises in Israel of the interest rate differentials between Israel and abroad, via the strengthening of the shekel. Subject tothe reduction in inflationary pressures, as described above, and taking into consideration the Bank of Israel's assessments that inflation will return to within the target range this year, the 0.5 percentage point cut in the interest rate is likely to support continued economic growth and employment. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor domestic and world economic developments closely with the intention of achieving the price stability target. Subject to this, the Bank will continue to support the attainment of a range of objectives of macroeconomic policy, in particular the encouragement of employment and growth. In addition, the Bank will continue to support the stability of the financial system. 24.3.2008</td> The Bank of Israel cuts the interest rate for April 2008 by 0.5 percentage points to 3.25 percent.

Poland,2008-03-26,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 26 March 2008 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 25-26 March 2008 The Council decided to increase the NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage points to the level: (cid:131) reference rate 5.75% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate 7.25 % on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate 4.25% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate 6.00% on an annual basis. The Polish economy is still in the period of strong growth encompassing all its sectors. Data on national accounts for 2007 Q4 and macroeconomic data for the first two months of 2008 indicate that strong economic growth has continued, which is consistent with the expectations of the February Inflation Report. In the euro area economic growth forecasts have been revised downwards. At the same time, signals of considerable economic slowdown in the United States have intensified. Uncertainty persists as to the future growth of the global economy and its impact on the Polish economy. In February the annual growth of consumer prices in Poland reached 4.2% (as compared to 4.0% in January after a downward revision), thus remaining above the NBP's inflation target of 2.5% and also above the upper limit for deviations from the target set at 3.5%. A factor that increased inflation was further rise in prices of services connected with house maintenance and of energy. Increased year-on-year inflation was largely sustained due to the still strong annual growth of food and fuel prices. The Council maintains its assessment that in the near future inflation will remain above the upper limit for deviations from the inflation target, which will be, to a large extent, the result of a considerable rise of regulated prices. In the Council's assessment the latest macroeconomic data signal that in the first half of 2008 economic growth will most probably continue to exceed the growth of potential GDP. The latest information on labour market developments points to a sustained very high growth of employment and wages and to an unfavourable relation between wage and labour productivity growth. It is quite probable that the wage pressure and, consequently, inflationary pressure will persist. Increased inflation in the months to come will, to a large extent, result from increased growth of regulated prices and may also be a result of the food and fuel price growth observed in the world economy and affecting the Polish market. This creates a risk of inflation expectations staying high and, consequently, feeds the risk of the so-called second-round effects. In the medium term inflationary pressure may be curbed by still good financial results of enterprises and high investment growth conducive to productivity growth. Inflationary pressure may also be constrained by globalisation and the ensuing increased competition in the market of internationally traded goods and services, amidst the relative stability of zloty exchange rate. Inflationary pressure may also be reduced by a slowdown of the global economy. The previous ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51, increases of the NBP's interest rates should also be conducive to lowering inflation. Nevertheless, the Council assessed that the impact of those factors may prove insufficient to bring inflation down to the target over the monetary policy transmission horizon. Considering the above factors, the Council assessed the probability of inflation overshooting the inflation target in the medium term to be higher than the probability of inflation running below the target and decided to raise the NBP's interest rates. The Council will strive to bring inflation down to the level consistent with the inflation target in the medium term. The Council will be closely monitoring the growth and structure of domestic demand, the relation between wage and labour productivity growth in the enterprise sector and wage growth in the public finance sector, the degree of the expansionary fiscal policy stance, zloty exchange rate, developments of the current account balance and the impact of globalisation on the economy and on food prices. The Council will also analyse changes in the external factors affecting the Polish economy and their impact on the outlook for economic growth and inflation in Poland."
Romania,2008-03-26,"In its meeting of March 26, 2008, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided the following:. The NBR is restating that it will continue to closely monitor developments in macroeconomic indicators and to assess their outlook, standing ready to adjust its instrument settings to counteract inflationary pressures in order to re-enter as fast as possible the announced medium-term disinflation trajectory in a sustainable manner. The analysis of the most recent statistical data reveals a higher-than-expected economic growth along with the persistence of a high dynamics of domestic demand, given the rising incomes and the persistent rapid expansion of credit to the private sector. The annual inflation rate climbed to 7.97 percent in February 2008 from 7.26 percent in the previous month, mainly due to the upward adjustment of natural gas prices and the persistent impact of the drop in the 2007 agricultural output on food prices. Core inflation, calculated by excluding the impact of administered and volatile (vegetables, fruit, eggs and fuel) prices as well as the effect of vice tax, rose to 6.17 percent in February 2008 from 5.92 percent in the previous month. The continued risk aversion of financial investors amid persistent turbulences on international financial markets has weighed on developments in the leu's exchange rate. In this context, the monetary policy stance, assessed through broad monetary conditions, saw its restrictiveness further adjusted through the raise in the key monetary policy rate, through a firmer control of money market liquidity and the maintenance of the existing levels for minimum reserve requirement ratios. The analyses reconfirm the outlook that annual inflation would remain in the following months above the upper limit of the variation band around the target due to continued excess demand-related pressures as well as prolonged effects of supply-side shocks (mainly fuel and food prices). This outlook, combined with the risks related to a potentially significant deterioration of inflation expectations and uncertainties related to the investors' attitude vis-á-vis emerging markets, requires a tighter monetary policy, with an appropriate dosage. The adjusted monetary policy stance should ensure a firm and sustainable anchoring of inflation expectations at low levels, in order to limit the temporary rise of aggregate prices and bring annual price growth as fast as possible within the medium-term disinflation trajectory agreed with the government. In light of available data, the NBR Board has decided to raise the monetary policy rate to 9.5 percent per annum from 9.0 percent. The NBR Board has also decided to continue to pursue a firm management of money market liquidity via open-market operations and to leave unchanged the existing minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board is restating that, apart from tighter monetary policy, the implementation of a restrictive economic policy mix, focusing on the fiscal and income components, and stepped-up structural reforms are essential to ensure the return to a durable downward trend in inflation, thus contributing to the achievement of sustainable economic growth in the longer term. Such a stance of all components of the macroeconomic policy mix is all the more necessary given that the external deficit registers levels difficult to sustain in the longer term in the context of heightened uncertainties affecting the world economy, while a boost in savings represents a longer-term fundamental measure aimed at correcting the external deficit, through a gradual reduction of the savings/investment imbalance. The NBR Board is reiterating that it will carefully monitor global economic developments and will analyze the effects of persistent international financial market turbulences on the Romanian economy, including from the perspective of maintaining financial stability as a complementary dimension of ensuring price stability. The next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy is scheduled for May 6, 2008, when a new quarterly Inflation Report is to be examined and approved."
Hungary,2008-03-31,"1 At its meeting on 31 March 2008, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to raise the central bank base rate by 50 basis points, from 7.50% to 8.00%, with effect from 1 April 2008. 2 The Council maintains its view that Hungarian economic growth is likely to be below potential and inflation to fall only slowly this year and in 2009. Upward pressures on inflation of the fiscal adjustment measures are wearing off; however, the further reduction in inflation has more recently been held back by domestic and international cost shocks. The Council has on several occasions expressed that it does not intend to offset the temporary effects of cost pressures; rather, it monitors closely any potential second-round effects that may occur. Although inflation shocks have so far been concentrated on the prices of a specific range of products, new pressures  particularly those from rises in producers' energy prices and wage costs  may have more persistent and broader inflationary effects. According to January 2008 wage data, the introduction of the guaranteed minimum wage and the increase in the national minimum wage both led to a stronger-than-expected rise in private sector average earnings. This has added to cost-push inflationary pressure, despite an easing in labour market conditions on the back of the fall in employment. The slow disinflation process has amplified the second-round effects on prices of the cost shocks, the reason being that, as a result, expectations may become stuck at a high level. Hungarian government securities yields have increased markedly across the maturity spectrum in the past month. Closely related to the financial shock emanating from the US mortgage market, the re-pricing of risks has continued, leading to sharp rises in yields on more risky financial assets. Although non-fundamental factors may have also played a role in the rise in domestic government securities yields, there is clear evidence of a increase in the risk premium on forint assets recently. In the Council's judgement, the risk of inflation remaining persistently above 3 per cent and the rise in the risk premium on forint assets have both pointed to the need to raise the central bank base rate. And the Council will stand ready to take further actions in order to met the 2009 inflation target."
Nigeria,2008-04-01,"Central Bank of Nigeria's Communique No 55 of the Monetary Policy Committee. April 1, 2008 The Monetary Policy Committee of the CBN met on 1st April 2008 and decided to raise the MPR by 50 basis points 1. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on 1st April, 2008. The Committee discussed the international economic and financial situation along with a detailed review of the domestic macroeconomic developments including the implementation of the fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies in the first quarter of 2008 and the outlook for the next two quarters. It considered the implications of the credit conditions in the global financial markets, the recent policy initiatives of the fiscal and monetary authorities in the major industrial countries, and the likely spill-over effects of the expected economic downturn in the world's largest economy, for the Nigerian economy. The MPC noted that while the domestic macroeconomic environment was generally stable in the first three months of 2008, there are many uncertainties. The Committee observed that the current rate of inflation is a matter of concern. It expressed satisfaction over the overall stability in the government securities, money and foreign exchange markets, the buoyancy of the equity market and the accretion to foreign exchange reserves. It restated its commitment to sustaining monetary and price stability through the pursuit of appropriate monetary and exchange rate policies. Key Macroeconomic Developments 3. Inflation The Committee noted that the year-on-year (headline) inflation rose from 66 per cent at end-December 2007 to 86 per cent in January but fell to 80 per cent in February 2008. The higher levels of the headline inflation in January and February relative to that of December 2007, were mainly attributable to the increase in food prices. The recent release of grains from the strategic grains reserve and the prospects of 1 favourable weather would, however, help reduce the risks of price acceleration in the months ahead. The Committee noted that the expected huge fiscal injections in the months ahead and the sustained rise in asset prices would constitute potential downside risks that need to be addressed by strengthening the current restrictive monetary policy. Exchange Rate: The MPC noted that the naira has appreciated in the first quarter of 2008, driven mainly by rising foreign exchange inflows reflecting the continued investor confidence in the economy. The foreign exchange market, however, continued to function in a stable manner. External Reserves: The Committee noted with satisfaction that the gross official reserves amounted to US$5970 billion as at March 31, 2008. This level of reserves would support 38 months of current foreign exchange disbursements. Monetary Aggregates: Broad money (M2) at end-December 2007 grew by 309 per cent compared with 305 per cent in the corresponding period of the preceding year. Provisional figures indicate that the M2 grew by 2059 per cent in the first two months of 2008. The growth in M2 was driven mainly by the increase in foreign assets (net) of the banking system as well as credit to the private sector. Credit: The Committee noted that credit to the private sector maintained an upward trend during the first quarter of 2008. Credit to the private sector grew substantially by 96 per cent in fiscal 2007 and by 86 per cent during the first two months of 2008 which on an annualized basis translated to 516 per cent. The MPC noted, however, that the Federal Government has continued to be a net creditor to the banking system. Interest Rates: The MPC observed that the inter-bank call rate rose in January but moderated in the subsequent two months. Market conditions exhibited stability as evidenced from the data on the volume and deals in the inter-bank market. The spread 2 between the inter-bank call rate and the tenored NIBOR rates, however, showed that the counterparty credit risks continue to exist. The Committee urged that money market conditions be continuously monitored for purposes of effective liquidity management. Fiscal Stance: The Committee noted the actual and potential impact on liquidity of the recent distribution of the Naira equivalent of US $ 2008 billion excess crude oil revenue and the second round distribution of same amount scheduled for June 2008. In addition, it noted that the federal budget as proposed contained significant increases in expenditure which would lead to projected budget deficits in the next two quarters of the year. The Outlook for the Second and Third Quarters of 2008: 10. The MPC noted that the staff estimates indicate that inflation could remain within single-digit through the third quarter of the year if necessary actions are taken. In this regard, the Committee emphasized that the release of grains from the strategic grains reserve together with restrictive monetary policy would be important elements in keeping inflation under control in the months ahead. Decisions In the light of the uncertainties mentioned above, the Committee decided to: 1. raise the MPR by 50 basis points from 95 per cent to 100 per cent; 2. issue treasury bills for liquidity management; and 3. Increase the sale of foreign exchange as the need arises. Professor Chukwuma C Soludo CFR Governor Central Bank of Nigeria Abuja April 01, 2008 3."
Thailand,2008-04-09,"No 12 /2008 Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 9 April 2008 Ms. Duangmanee Vongpradhip. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand, announces that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance. The main issues discussed were as follows. In the first two months of this year, domestic demand continued to expand, from both private consumption and private investment. At the same time, the government's budget disbursement met its target. Exports continued to expand well, but the slowdown in the global economy could affect export growth going forward. Risks to inflation increased from the previous meeting. Headline inflation accelerated in the first quarter due to the prices of oil and commodities in world markets, as well as greater pass-through of costs to domestic prices. However the MPC assessed that these pressures were likely to moderate in the latter part of the year in tandem with the slowdown of the global economy. The MPC deemed that the overall growth momentum of the Thai economy continued to be sustained from domestic demand, which was supported by accommodative monetary policy in previous periods and additional fiscal stimulus. Nevertheless risks to inflation and growth going forward increased, making it necessary for the MPC to monitor both issues closely. The MPC decided to keep the policy interest rate at 325 per cent per annum."
Chile,2008-04-10,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 10 April 2008 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 6.25% (annual). Internationally, prospects for the U.S. have weakened further, and there is a high probability that this economy is or will soon be in a recession. In addition, strong tension persists in world financial markets while global credit conditions have deteriorated. Growth forecasts for emerging economies have been adjusted downward, in spite of high commodity prices. Domestically, the latest information confirms that first quarter economic activity was somewhat less dynamic than predicted in the last Monetary Policy Report. Investment indicators remain strong, while consumer indicators continue to show some signs of slowdown. Unemployment has remained stable. Although March's inflation was somewhat less than expected, annualized figures are still high. Food prices have risen again but inflationary propagation appears limited and in line with projections. Core inflation measures, including the CPIX1 (which excludes fuels, perishables and some regulated utilities) remain high but have not increased further. Wages have increased according to its usual trend, while the peso has remained appreciated in real terms. The latest data reaffirms prospects that annual CPI inflation will begin descending over the course of the next few months, although uncertainty about expected monthly figures continue to affect inflation risk premiums in the valuation of financial assets. Long-term inflation expectations remain well- anchored around 3% annually. The Board reaffirms its commitment of conducting monetary policy to ensure that projected inflation will be at 3% over the policy horizon. Future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on incoming information. Particularly important for this will be the implications on inflation of the evolution of the complex present international scenario, of the persistence of the real exchange rate appreciation and on the potential propagation of recent months' inflationary shocks to other prices. * The Spanish original prevails."
Euroarea,2008-04-10,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. Let me report on the outcome of our meeting, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today's meeting to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The latest information has confirmed the existence of strong short-term upward pressure on inflation. In fact, we are experiencing a rather protracted period of temporarily high annual rates of inflation, resulting mainly from increases in energy and food prices. The latest information also clearly confirms our assessment of prevailing upside risks to price stability over the medium term, in a context of continuing very vigorous money and credit growth. Incoming macroeconomic data continue to point to moderate but ongoing real GDP growth. However, the level of uncertainty resulting from the turmoil in financial markets remains unusually high and tensions may last longer than initially expected. Against this background, we emphasise that maintaining price stability in the medium term is our primary objective in accordance with our mandate. The firm anchoring of medium to longer-term inflation expectations is of the highest priority to the Governing Council and there is certainly no room for complacency in this regard. We believe that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our objective. The Governing Council remains strongly committed to preventing second-round effects and the materialisation of upside risks to price stability over the medium term. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the coming weeks. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. According to Eurostat's second estimate, quarter-on-quarter real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2007 was 0.4%, following 0.7% in the previous quarter. The latest information on economic activity also underpins previous expectations of moderate but ongoing growth in the first quarter of 2008. Overall, the euro area economy has sound fundamentals and does not suffer from major imbalances. Looking ahead, both domestic and foreign demand are expected to support ongoing real GDP growth in the euro area in 2008, albeit to a lesser extent than during 2007. While moderating, growth in the world economy is expected to remain resilient, benefiting in particular from strong growth in emerging economies. Meanwhile, investment growth in the euro area should provide ongoing support to economic activity, as capacity utilisation is high, profitability has been sustained and there are no significant signs of supply constraints on bank loans. At the same time, as a result of the improved economic conditions and wage moderation, employment and labour force participation have increased significantly and unemployment rates have fallen to levels not seen for 25 years. While being dampened by the impact of higher energy and food prices on purchasing power, consumption growth should continue to contribute to economic expansion, in line with real disposable income growth. The uncertainty surrounding this outlook for economic growth remains high, and downside risks prevail. The risks relate mainly to the financial market turbulence, which could last longer than initially thought and could have a broader than currently expected impact on the real economy. Moreover, downside risks also stem from the dampening impact on consumption and investment of further unanticipated increases in energy and food prices, as well as from protectionist pressures and the possibility of disorderly developments owing to global imbalances. With regard to price developments, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, the annual HICP inflation rate was 3.5% in March 2008, after 3.3% in February. This outturn confirms the ongoing strong and lately further increasing short-term upward pressure on inflation, resulting largely from sharp increases in energy and food prices in recent months. Looking ahead, the annual HICP inflation rate is likely to remain significantly above 2% in the coming months, moderating only gradually over the course of 2008. Accordingly, we are currently experiencing a rather protracted period of temporarily high annual rates of inflation. The risks to the outlook for inflation over the medium term remain clearly on the upside. These risks include the possibility of further rises in energy and food prices, as well as of increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those foreseen thus far. Most importantly, there is a risk that price and wage-setting behaviour could add to inflationary pressures. In particular, the pricing power of firms, notably in market segments with low competition, may prove stronger than currently expected, and stronger than expected wage growth may emerge, taking into account high capacity utilisation and tight labour market conditions. Against this background, it is imperative that all the parties concerned meet their responsibilities. Second-round effects stemming from the impact of higher energy and food prices on wage and price-setting behaviour must be avoided. In the view of the Governing Council, this is of key importance in order to preserve price stability in the medium term and thereby the purchasing power of all euro area citizens. The Governing Council is monitoring wage negotiations in the euro area with particular attention. In this context, the Governing Council is concerned about the existence of schemes in which nominal wages are indexed to consumer prices. Such schemes involve the risk of upward shocks in inflation leading to a wage-price spiral, which would be detrimental to employment and competitiveness in the countries concerned. The Governing Council therefore calls for such schemes to be avoided. The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. Annual M3 growth remained very vigorous at 11.3% in February, supported by the continued strong growth of MFI loans to the private sector. While annual M1 growth has moderated further in recent months, as higher short-term interest rates have increased the opportunity cost of holding the most liquid components of M3, the growth of time deposits remains extremely strong. This reflects the relatively flat yield curve, which has made it more attractive to hold monetary assets remunerated at close to market rates than to hold riskier, longer-maturity instruments. Overall, the impact of the flat yield curve and a number of other temporary factors suggest that annual M3 growth currently overstates the pace of the underlying monetary expansion. However, even after taking such effects into account, a broad-based assessment of the latest data confirms that the underlying rate of money and credit growth remains strong. The growth of household borrowing has moderated over recent months, reflecting the impact of higher key ECB interest rates since December 2005 and cooling housing markets in several parts of the euro area. However, the growth of loans to non-financial corporations has remained very robust. Bank borrowing by euro area non-financial corporations grew at an annual rate of 14.8% in the year to February 2008. Overall, bank loans to the domestic private sector have grown at around 11% on an annual basis for the past two years. For the time being, there is little evidence that the financial market turbulence seen since early August 2007 has strongly influenced the overall dynamics of broad money and credit aggregates. Notwithstanding the tightening of credit standards reported in the bank lending survey for the euro area, continued strong loan growth to non-financial corporations suggests that the supply of bank credit to firms in the euro area has not been significantly impaired by the financial turmoil thus far. Further data and analysis will be required in order to obtain a more complete picture of the impact of the financial market developments on banks' balance sheets, financing conditions and money and credit growth. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis clearly confirms the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium term, in a context of very vigorous money and credit growth and with no significant signs of supply constraints on bank loans to households and non-financial corporations. Incoming macroeconomic data continue to point to moderate but ongoing real GDP growth. However, the level of uncertainty resulting from the turmoil in financial markets remains unusually high and tensions may last longer than initially expected. Against this background, we emphasise that the firm anchoring of medium to longer-term inflation expectations is of the highest priority to the Governing Council. We believe that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving this objective. The Governing Council remains strongly committed to preventing second-round effects and the materialisation of upside risks to price stability over the medium term. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the coming weeks. Regarding fiscal policies, the intentions reflected in the latest round of stability programmes imply a rise in the euro area general government deficit ratio in 2008. Further fiscal pressures are likely to arise as overly optimistic macroeconomic assumptions are already being revised downwards and political demands for fiscal loosening are increasing. In this situation, countries with fiscal imbalances are urged to make further progress with structural consolidation, in line with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact. At the current juncture, particularly prudent and stability-oriented fiscal policies would also contribute to containing inflationary pressures. Turning to structural reforms, we welcome the launch of the 2008-10 cycle of the renewed Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs by the European Council. The favourable labour market trends in the euro area suggest that economic reforms are paying off. However, many challenges remain as overall employment is still below the Lisbon target of 70% and unemployment is still unacceptably high. Moreover, productivity growth remains weak, constraining general income growth. Therefore, we strongly encourage euro area countries to increase reform efforts, in particular to foster market integration and to reduce rigidities in product and labour markets that restrict competition, employment flexibility and wage differentiation, and we support them in these efforts. They would not only promote employment and support potential growth, but would also contribute to moderating price pressures."
South Korea,2008-04-10,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (5.00%) for the intermeeting period. (The following is an English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (5.00%) for the intermeeting period. Domestic economy is exhibiting some signs of adjustment in its pace of expansion. While exports continue to post robust growth, domestic demand has moderated somewhat. There still remains a high degree of uncertainty surrounding future economic developments, largely due to the international financial market turmoil and the US economic slowdown. Consumer price inflation continues to show a rapid rise, mainly influenced by high oil prices. Real estate prices have shown a rebound in certain areas. Liquidity is still ample in the financial markets and financial institutions' lending continues to show a steady increase. Meanwhile, financial market price variables have been increasingly volatile, largely in response to the international financial market unrest."
South Africa,2008-04-10,"Issued by Mr T T Mboweni. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank. The South African economy continues to respond to the less accommodative monetary policy stance. Domestic expenditure is responding to our current policy settings. Various high frequency and survey data point to the economy growing at a rate below potential, but nevertheless underpinned to some extent by strong investment expenditure by the private sector and public corporations. The inflation outlook is being influenced by a series of supply-side shocks emanating from the international oil and food prices which are posing challenges for inflation-targeting countries in general. Domestically, there is evidence of generalised price pressures and the prospect of further substantial electricity price increases will also delay the return to within the inflation target range. In the light of these developments, inflation expectations have deteriorated. CPIX inflation has maintained its upward trend, reaching 9,4 per cent in February 2008. Petrol and food prices were again the main drivers of inflation and increased at year-on-year rates of 29,5 per cent and 14,3 per cent respectively. If food and energy prices were excluded. CPIX inflation would have measured 5,6 per cent. Further impetus to inflation came from the change in methodology for calculating clothing and footwear prices. Whereas clothing and footwear prices were previously shown to have declined persistently since October 2003, these prices increased at year-on-year rates of 7,9 per cent and 8,4 per cent in January and February 2008 respectively. Year-on-year producer price inflation measured 11,3 per cent in February compared to 10,4 per cent in January. Agricultural food prices increased at a year-on-year rate of 23,5 per cent in February, while manufactured food prices increased by 20,9 per cent. The most recent central forecast of the Bank indicates a further deterioration in the inflation outlook when compared to the previous forecast. Inflation is now expected to peak at an average of around 9,3 per cent in the first quarter of this year, and thereafter to follow a downward trajectory. However. CPIX inflation is now expected to return to within the inflation target range by the fourth quarter of 2009. The deterioration in the outlook is a result of higher-than-expected recent quarterly inflation outcomes, and further upward revisions of oil and administered price assumptions for 2008 and 2009. The possibility of an electricity price increase in excess of that recently granted to Eskom has not been factored into the central forecast, although the MPC has considered various alternative scenarios. Most private sector forecasts have also been revised upwards in recent weeks, although the majority predict inflation will return to within the target range before the final quarter of next year. The Reuters consensus forecast also expects inflation to peak in first quarter of this year, and to return to within the target range during the second quarter of 2009. The current inflation trends are having a significant impact on inflation expectations, particularly those of business executives and trade union officials. According to the inflation expectations survey conducted on behalf of the Bank by the Bureau for Economic Research (BER) at the University of Stellenbosch, average CPIX inflation expectations for 2008 have increased from 5,9 per cent at the time of the previous survey to 7,8 per cent, and for 2009 from 5,6 per cent to 7,0 per cent. CPIX inflation is expected to average 6,7 per cent in 2010. Whereas financial analysts expect inflation to moderate to 5,9 per cent in 2009 and 5,4 per cent in 2010, business executives and trade union officials expect inflation to average 7,5 per cent and 7,4 per cent in those years respectively. Break-even inflation rates, measured as the yield differential between conventional government bonds and inflation-linked bonds, also indicate a deterioration of inflation expectations. The trend of wage settlements is a critical variable in determining whether inflation expectations do in fact translate into higher inflation. There is evidence that nominal wage settlements have been trending higher. According to Andrew Levy Employment Publications, wage settlements in the first quarter of 2008 averaged 7,8 per cent compared to 7,3 per cent in 2007 and 6,5 per cent in 2006. A number of factors continue to pose an upside risk to the inflation outlook. The most serious risk emanates from the possibility of additional electricity price increases. If granted, the electricity price will have doubled by the middle of 2009. A final determination will be made by the National Energy Regulator of South Africa in June. International oil prices have remained at elevated levels. The price of North Sea Brent crude oil was US$92 per barrel at the time of the previous MPC meeting and is currently trading at around US$107 per barrel. The impact on CPIX has been aggravated by the depreciation of the rand against the dollar, and in the past 2 months, the rand price of 95 octane petrol has increased by a total of R1,27 per litre. Of this increase, 43 cents was due to international product price increases and 69 cents was due to exchange rate changes. The remainder was accounted for by tax and other levy adjustments. Despite the slowdown in the global economy, international oil price developments continue to pose an upside risk to the inflation outlook. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand exchange rate has depreciated further. On a trade-weighted basis the rand has now depreciated by around 16 per cent since the beginning of 2008. In March the rand depreciated to almost R8,26 against the US dollar, but is currently trading at around R7,90. The currency has been affected by various factors including movements in the dollar, perceptions that the current account deficit on the balance of payments could widen, and increased risk aversion in global financial markets since the previous MPC meeting. Firm international commodity prices, however, continue to provide some support to the currency. Food price inflation has shown few signs of moderating and trends at the producer level indicate further pipeline pressures. International food price developments are particularly worrisome with a number of food-producing countries restricting exports in recent weeks. International wheat prices have also reached new highs. Domestic spot prices of maize have been volatile around an upward trend, partly as a result of the depreciated exchange rate. Futures prices suggest that maize prices are expected to remain high in the coming months despite the improved crop forecast for this year. There are a number of factors that are expected to have a moderating effect on the inflation outlook. Household consumption expenditure has continued to respond to the tighter monetary policy stance. Real final consumption expenditure growth declined consistently during 2007, and grew at an annualised rate of 3,8 per cent in the fourth quarter. This softer trend appears to have continued in the first quarter of 2008 as evidenced by the negative retail sales trends in the past few months. Motor vehicle sales have declined further, with new passenger vehicle sales being particularly affected. When comparing the first three months of 2008 with the same period last year, a decrease of 19,1 per cent was recorded. The latest FNB/BER Consumer Confidence Index shows a distinct break with recent trends. Although still at relatively high levels, the index declined to its lowest level in 3,5 years in the first quarter of this year. This slower household consumption expenditure growth is reflected to some extent in the declining trend of bank credit extension to the private sector. Twelve-month growth in banks' total loans and advances extended to the private sector, which has exhibited a downward trend, slowed to 21,8 per cent in February. Growth in all categories of credit extension declined in February. The ratio of household debt to disposable income increased marginally to 77,6 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2007. The cost of servicing this debt has increased significantly, in line with higher interest rates. The domestic economy has shown signs of moderation following a robust annual growth rate of 5,1 per cent in 2007. A number of indicators suggest that output growth will be below potential in the coming quarters, although infrastructural investment programmes are likely to underpin the overall growth rate. At this stage it is still unclear what the impact of electricity supply disruptions will be on output growth. The composite leading business cycle indicator has been declining significantly since November 2007, while in the first quarter of this year, the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index declined to its lowest level in 7 years. The significant decline in the Investec/BER Purchasing Managers Index in March may be pointing to a marked slowdown in the manufacturing sector despite the improved performance in February when real output increased at a month-on-month rate of 2,4 per cent. Mining output declined by 5,2 per cent during the 3 months ended February 2008. Asset prices have also been subdued since the previous meeting of the MPC. The ABSA house price index shows that year-on-year growth in prices of residential property in the middle segment of the market declined to 8,7 per cent in February 2007, while the median house price, as measured by Standard Bank, declined by 5,2 per cent in March. The All-share index on the JSE Limited increased by about 15 per cent since the end of January, driven primarily by the impact of strong commodity prices on the resources sector. The international economic and financial environment remains uncertain and volatile. The sustained weakness in the US housing market has resulted in downward revisions of US growth forecasts, while the IMF has revised down its forecast for global growth in 2008 to 3,7 per cent from 4,1 per cent forecast in January. Global inflation forecasts have been revised upwards in the wake of higher food and energy prices. Nevertheless global inflation appears to be relatively contained. The turmoil in financial markets is expected to persist for some time as banks keep writing down more financial assets and experience losses. As a consequence, global foreign exchange and financial markets are likely to remain volatile. In view of the deteriorating inflation outlook and especially evidence of more generalised inflation pressures, the MPC has decided to increase the repo rate by 50 basis points to 11,5 per cent per annum with effect from 11 April 2008. The MPC remains committed to bringing CPIX inflation back to within the inflation target range."
Peru,2008-04-15,"- MONETARY PROGRAM FOR APRIL 2008 BCRP RAISES REFERENCE INTEREST RATE FROM 5.25% TO 5.50% AND RAISES RESERVE REQUIREMENT RATES The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to raise the monetary policy reference interest rate from 5.25 to 5.50 percent. Moreover, the Board also approved to raise the requirements of reserves for financial entities in both domestic and foreign currencies as of May. These measures are in line with the increases of reserve requirements approved in January and March, as well as with having raised the reference interest rate from 4.5 to 5.25 percent between July 2007 and January 2008. The reserve requirement measures to be applied as of May will be the following: The minimum reserve requirements will be raised from 8 to 8.5 percent. The marginal reserve requirements in domestic currency will be raised from 20 to 25 percent and the marginal reserve requirements in foreign currency will be raised from 40 to 45 percent. The marginal reserve requirements for obligations in domestic currency with non- resident financial entities, which will not be remunerated, will be raised from 40 to 120 percent. Long-term external obligations in foreign currency will not be subject to reserve requirements as long as they do not exceed 200 percent of the capital and reserves of the financial entity. This increase in the rates of reserve requirements is estimated to be equivalent to increasing the reference rate by 50 basis points. These monetary measures are adopted in order to offset the pace of growth of credit and thus prevent that the price rises originated by food supply shocks translate in a lasting manner into inflation expectations. The Board reiterated the monetary policy commitment of gradually reaching the inflation target of 2 percent, plus or minus one percentage point, in a context in which the rises in consumer prices are mainly explained by events that are beyond the control of monetary policies. During the session, the Board approved the following annual interest rates for active and passive operations between the BCRP and the financial system: Direct repo and rediscount operations: 6.25 percent. Overnight deposits: 4.75 percent. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 6.25 percent. The Board will approve the following Monetary Program on its session of May 8."
Georgia,2008-04-16,"Tbilisi. 16 April The Decision of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia on April 16, 2008 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met today and decided to raise its main policy rate by 100 basis points, to 12 percent. The annual inflation rate reached 12.3 percent, while the average annual rate of inflation was 9.5 percent as of March. The main contributing factor to the increase in the CPI was a general rise in prices of energy products and other commodities in the global markets which resulted in elevated prices within the trade partners of Georgia and other economies of the region. As of March, the annual rate of inflation was 13.3 percent in Russia, 26.2 percent in Ukraine, 17.1 percent in Azerbaijan, 9.6 percent in Armenia, 9.2 percent in Turkey, 3.5 percent in the Eurozone, 16.8 percent in Latvia, 11.3 percent in Lithuania, 10.9 percent in Estonia, 14.2 percent in Bulgaria and 18.7 percent in Kazakhstan. Along with other factors, more flexible exchange rate policy contributed to the relatively lower inflation in Georgia compared to the abovementioned economies. Economic activity and the level of capital inflows remain high and will likely remain at an elevated level for the remainder of the year. Moreover, broad money continues to grow rapidly due to the accelerated growth of the money multiplier and lending to the economy. Financial instability has increased in global markets, causing the central banks of the United States. United Kingdom and other developed nations to soften their monetary policy in order to alleviate adverse effects to economic growth. This will likely put upward pressure on the prices of main commodity products in the near future. However, due to the fact that the Georgian financial sector is less integrated into the global financial system, the current financial turmoil on the international markets has not materially affected financial stability within Georgia. Although, on the one hand, the economic slowdown in developed nations should lead to price decreases for energy and commodity goods  a downside risk to inflation, however on the other hand, according to expert estimates, economic growth in developing countries will remain robust, largely compensating for the expected slowdown in developed economies - an upside risk to inflation. 1 The reproduction without citing the source is not allowed. Tbilisi. 16 April The Monetary Policy Committee also discussed the reserve requirements for commercial banks and decided to prepare the corresponding amendments to the rules for the calculation and maintenance of minimum reserve requirements. According to the proposed amendments, foreign liabilities will be incorporated into the reserve base for minimum reserve requirements from the beginning of 2009. The existing inflation risk has increased somewhat since the last Monetary Policy Committee meeting. Taking into consideration that significant increases in administrative prices will not be observed and commodity prices will be in line with the current forecasts, the increased interest rates will insure that an inflation rate of 8 percent will be achieved by the end of the year. The NBG will closely monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets with the objective of achieving the forecast inflation rate and will in due course act accordingly. The schedule of the MPC meetings is posted on the website of the NBG. The next meeting will take place on May 14, 2008. 2 The reproduction without citing the source is not allowed."
Turkiye,2008-04-17,"The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) has decided to keep policy rates unchanged as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 15.25 percent, and lending rate at 19.25 percent, b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m. at 11.25 percent, lending rate at 22.25 percent, c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 18.25 percent. Deepening problems in international credit markets continue to restrain the domestic demand, while external demand remains strong. Overall, aggregate demand conditions will continue to support disinflation. However, rising food and energy prices and ongoing uncertainties in the global economy have worsened inflation expectations and increased the upside risk on inflation. The Central Bank of Turkey is strongly committed to prevent the potential second- round effects of the recent deterioration in inflation expectations. In this regard, the Committee will be more responsive to bad news than good news and will consider a measured tightening when needed. Future monetary policy decisions will depend on developments regarding global market conditions, external demand, fiscal policy implementation, and other factors affecting the medium term inflation outlook. It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight working days."
Philippines,2008-04-23,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to keep the BSP's key policy interest rates at 5 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 7 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs and RPs were also left unchanged. In deciding to keep the BSP's key policy rates steady, the Monetary Board noted that prevailing price and output conditions suggest that the stance of monetary policy continues to be appropriate for the present. Depending on the movements in oil and non-oil commodity prices, inflation could settle above the 2008 inflation target range but will be within the 3.5 percent ± 1.0 percentage point target range for 2009. The factors driving inflation have come mostly from the supply side, and the use of monetary instruments against such influences has limited effect compared with direct supply-side intervention measures. In its assessment, the Monetary Board observed that the balance of risks to the inflation outlook is tilted to the upside. Core inflation has drifted upward, with the March 2008 reading at its highest level since November 2006. The pending requests for wage and transport fare adjustments could raise the upside risks to inflation coming from demand-side pressures. On the other hand, the consensus view of a prolonged slowdown in the US economy, and the resulting weaker outlook for global economic growth, could reduce demand pressures and moderate price increases in global oil and non-oil commodities. Containing inflation is the BSP's predominant policy objective. It will act decisively and adjust monetary policy settings accordingly as and when second-round effects of supply shocks become evident. The Board noted that the economy's underlying growth momentum provides ample room for a decisive policy response by monetary authorities."
Israel,2008-04-28,"28.4.2008</td> The Bank of Israel leaves the interest rate unchanged for May 2008 at 3.25 percent The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate will remain unchanged for May 2008, at 3.25 percent. This step is taken in the context of the policy of maintaining price stability, in accordance with the inflation target of 1-3 percent a year. Background conditions Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.3 percent in March, exceeding expectations, whitch had ranged from no change to a reduction of 0.4 percent. The surprise was essentially the result of the rise of 0.4 percent in the housing index in March, in contrast to expectationsof a decline of 1.5 percent. In the last twelve months the CPI has risen by 3.7 percent, and the CPI excluding the energy and food components by 1.8 percent. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Following the publication of the March CPI. Israeli forecasters revised their predictions upwards. They expect on average that inflation over the next twelve months will be 3 percent, and that the interest rate for May will remain unchanged. Inflationexpectations for the next twelve months calculated from the capital marketalso rose to 3 percent. Interest rate expectations derived from the capital markets indicate a cumulative rise of 0.75 percentage points over the next twelve months. Real economic activity: The most recently published data indicatethat economic growth is continuing, but at less than the rate of about 5 percent of the last few years. The composite state-of-the-economy index for March rose by 0.5 percent, and the average monthly rise in the first quarter of 2008 was 0.4 percent, compared with 0.7 percent in the first quarter of 2007. The Companies Survey indicates a slowdown in the rate of growth of economic activity in the first quarter, with a similar outlook for the second quarter. Exports of the low-tech industries and imports of machinery, equipment and raw material remained steady in the first quarter, but high-tech exports continued to expand. The labor market and wages: National Insurance Institute data show that the rapid increase in the number of employee posts persisted, and in the months from November 2007 to January 2008 the number rose by 4.7 percent compared with the equivalent period a year earlier. The data also show arise of 3.7 percent in the nominal wage over the same period. Budget policy: The execution of the budget since the beginning of 2008 suggests that the annual deficit will be consistent with the ceiling set by the government. The foreign exchange market: In the period between the previous interest rate discussion on 23 March, and 27 April, the shekel weakened by 2.6 percent against the dollar and by 3.7 percent against the euro. This contrasted with the trend of most of the major currencies, which strengthened against the dollar by between 1 percent and 4 percent. Unlike in the previous month, when the volatility of the shekel/dollar exchange rate declined, this month it rose. Trading volume in the foreign exchange market stayed atthe same high level as in the previous month, about $2.1 billion a day. Looking ahead, the shekel exchange rate is expected to be affected by continued capital inflows--by Israelis among others--which tend to strengthen the shekel. However, the expected change in thecurrent account, the surplus in which is expected to decline to close to balance, or even to show a relatively small deficit, and the start of the implementation of the Bank's planned purchases of foreign currency intended to increase the foreign exchange reserves by $10 billion in the nexttwo years, will tend to weaken the shekel. The capital and money markets: Against the background of rises in the leading stock exchange indices around the world, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange also recorded rises. Between the previous interest rate discussion on 23 March, and 27 April, the Tel Aviv 100 share price index rose by 6.5 percent. Yields on 10-year unindexed government bonds went up to 5.89 percent, compared with 5.63 percent last month. The yield gap between these bonds and comparable US government bonds contracted this month to 2.02 percentagepoints, compared with 2.3 percentage points last month. Israel's sovereignrisk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS premium, declined this month and reached 0.6 percent, down from 0.9 percent prior to the previous interest rate decision, a decline similar to those in the CDS spreads in the emerging markets. The world economy: Against the background of the continuing crisis in the financial markets and the severe slowdown in the US, global growthis expected to slow this year. The risks of global inflation have risen recently due to increases in commodity prices, in particular oil and food prices. Thus, inflation in the previous twelve months in the US is 4 percent, and in Europe, 3.6 percent, due mainly to the continued rapid rise of energy and food prices. In light of the financial crisis, the markets expect theFed to cut the interest rate on 30 April by 0.25 percentage points, to 2 percent. The ECB is expected to leave its interest rate unchanged at 4 percent almost to the end of the year. The Bank of England is expected to continue cutting the interest rate. Tensions in the financial markets calmed to some extent during the last month. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to leave the interest rate unchanged for May is consistent with a return of inflation to within the target range of 1-3 percent inflation in the next twelve months. The decision was based on an analysis of expected inflation developments, which at this time are affected by opposing forces: Inflation in the last twelve months is above the target, at 3.7 percent, similar to the rate in the advanced economies, particularly the US and Europe. This is due to the continued rises in energy and food prices, rises that are higher than expected. Hence, and following the publication of the surprising rise in the CPI in March, one-year-forward inflation expectations in Israel roseto 3 percent. C 398 The slowdown in global growth is expected to moderate the rises in world food and energy prices and to slow the expansion of economic activity in Israel, and thereby also moderate domestic inflation. First indications of a slowdown in Israel's economic growth are already apparent in the Bank of Israel Companies Survey for the first quarter of 2008. C 398 In light ofthe slower growth in the advanced economies, interest rates abroad are expected to continue falling, albeit more slowly than previous assessments. The decision to keep the interest rate unchanged for May is consistent with support for growth and employment, subject to inflation returning to the price stability range. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor economic developments and their effect on inflation in Israel closely, and will stand ready to raise the interest rate as necessary to preserve price stability. Price stability is the central pillar supporting financial stability and the economy's ability to achieve sustainable growth and to create jobs over the course of time. 28.4.2008</td> The Bank of Israel leaves the interest rate unchanged for May 2008 at 3.25 percent.

Malaysia,2008-04-29,"At the Monetary Policy Committee meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to leave the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) unchanged at 3.50 percent. The latest available data from the major industrial economies indicate a moderation of economic activity in these countries. This is likely to lead to slower global growth in the months ahead. While the slower external demand will have some moderating impact on the Malaysian economy, growth continues to be supported by an expansion in domestic demand. The strong imports of capital goods, manufacturing investment approvals and foreign direct investment inflows are indicators of sustained investment activity. Despite the global financial turmoil, domestic credit conditions have remained favourable as demand for financing continues to be supported by the ample liquidity in the financial system. Global energy and food prices have risen sharply since the beginning of the year from their already high levels. A major uncertainty at this stage is the extent of the moderation in global economic activity and the impact it will have in reducing global price pressures. Domestic food prices have risen in response to the increase in global prices. The increase in food prices reflect a structural phenomenon requiring measures that ensure the adequacy of supply, create appropriate incentive structures that promote higher food production, and enhance the efficiency of the production and distribution chain. In order to ensure a smooth transition to market prices, adjustments to administered prices need to be gradual. The Bank's forecast of 2.5-3% average inflation in 2008 has built in some administered price adjustments. The upside risks to this projection would be dependent on the degree to which the increase in global prices have an impact on domestic prices and the extent to which administered prices are adjusted. There have been increased uncertainties surrounding global economic and financial conditions. After evaluating the evidence on the downside risks to growth and the upside risks to inflation, the Bank has decided to maintain the current stance of monetary policy.

Poland,2008-04-30,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 30 April 2008 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 29-30 April 2008 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e.: (cid:131) reference rate 5.75% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate 7.25% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate 4.25% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate 6.00% on an annual basis. The Polish economy is still in the period of strong growth encompassing all its sectors. However, the data released since the last meeting of the Council point to the risk of a weakening economic growth in Poland, though yet it is difficult to assess whether the decrease of some macroeconomic indicators observed in March will prove permanent. The latest information on the US economy confirms earlier signals of a substantial economic slowdown in this country. Uncertainty also persists as to the scale of the deceleration of euro-area economic growth and of its impact on the Polish economy. In March the annual growth of consumer prices in Poland decreased to 4.1%, still remaining above the NBP's inflation target of 2.5% and also above the upper limit for deviations from the target set at 3.5%. The increased year-on-year inflation was largely sustained due to still strong annual growth of food and fuel prices in the world markets as well as the prices of services connected with home maintenance and of energy in Poland. The Council maintains its assessment that in the near future inflation will remain above the upper limit for deviations from the inflation target, which will be, to a large extent, the result of a significant rise of regulated prices. In the Council's assessment the latest macroeconomic data signal that in the first half of 2008 economic growth will most probably continue to exceed the growth of potential GDP. The latest information on labour market developments points to a sustained high growth of employment and wages and to an unfavourable relation between wage and labour productivity growth. It is quite probable that the wage pressure and, consequently, inflationary pressure will persist. Increased inflation in the months to come will, to a large extent, result from the growth of administered prices and may also be driven by the food and fuel price growth observed in the world economy and affecting the Polish market. This creates a risk of inflation expectations remaining at a high level and, consequently, feeds the risk of the so-called second-round effects. In the medium term inflationary pressure may be curbed by still good financial results of enterprises and high investment growth conducive to productivity growth. Inflationary pressure may also be constrained by globalisation and the ensuing increased competition in the market of internationally traded goods and services, as well as the slowdown in the global and, consequently, also in the Polish economy. The previous increases of the NBP's interest rates and the zloty appreciation observed over the past few quarters should also be conducive to lowering inflation. ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51. The Council assessed the probability of inflation overshooting the inflation target in the medium term to be higher than the probability of inflation running below the target. The Council does not rule out that bringing inflation down to the target in the medium term would require further monetary policy tightening. In view of the increased uncertainty as to the global growth outlook and the prospects of the Polish economy, the Council assessed that a more comprehensive assessment of inflation outlook will be possible after analysing the data released in the near future. The Council will strive to bring inflation down to the target in the medium term. The Council will be closely monitoring the growth and structure of domestic demand, the relation between wage and labour productivity growth in the enterprise sector and wage growth in the public finance sector, the degree of the expansionary fiscal policy stance, zloty exchange rate, developments of the current account balance and the impact of globalisation on the economy and on food prices. The Council will also analyse changes in the external factors affecting the Polish economy and their impact on the outlook for economic growth and inflation in Poland. The Council approved The Balance of Payments of the Republic of Poland in 2007 Q4."
United States,2008-04-30,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points to 2 percent. Recent information indicates that economic activity remains weak. Household and business spending has been subdued and labor markets have softened further. Financial markets remain under considerable stress, and tight credit conditions and the deepening housing contraction are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters. Although readings on core inflation have improved somewhat, energy and other commodity prices have increased, and some indicators of inflation expectations have risen in recent months. The Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters, reflecting a projected leveling-out of energy and other commodity prices and an easing of pressures on resource utilization. Still, uncertainty about the inflation outlook remains high. It will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully. The substantial easing of monetary policy to date, combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity, should help to promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate risks to economic activity. The Committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; Timothy F Geithner. Vice Chairman; Donald L Kohn; Randall S Kroszner; Frederic S Mishkin; Sandra Pianalto; Gary H Stern; and Kevin M Warsh. Voting against were Richard W Fisher and Charles I Plosser, who preferred no change in the target for the federal funds rate at this meeting. In a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 25-basis-point decrease in the discount rate to 2-1/4 percent. In taking this action, the Board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York. Cleveland. Atlanta, and San Francisco."
Romania,2008-05-06,"In its meeting of May 6, 2008, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided the following:. The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled for May 8, 2008. The annual inflation rate climbed to 8.63 percent in March 2008 from 6.57 percent in December 2007. The increase was mainly due to the cumulative effects of: the persistence and amplitude of supply-side shocks, increasing pressures arising from excess demand, depreciation of the national currency and worsening inflation expectations. The inflationary impact of supply-side factors was heightened by the persistent pressures related to a substantial increase of incomes and the continued acceleration of the expansion of credit to the private sector, and is also reflected by the rapid growth of adjusted CORE2 inflation. The adjusted CORE2 inflation rate - calculated by excluding the impact of administered and volatile prices (vegetables, fruit, eggs and fuel) as well as the effect of vice tax - rose to an annual 6.81 percent in March 2008 from 5.45 percent in December 2007. Given the recent macroeconomic trends and their outlook as well as the need to ensure a firm anchoring of inflation expectations in order to bring annual price growth as fast as possible, in a sustainable manner, within the medium-term disinflation trajectory agreed with the government, the NBR Board has decided to raise the monetary policy rate to 9.75 percent per annum from 9.5 percent and to adjust some features of the monetary policy operational framework as follows:. These adjustments of the monetary policy operational framework, part of a gradual alignment to European Central Bank practice, are aimed at consolidating the signalling role of the monetary policy rate, at increasing the efficiency of open-market operations and reducing the volatility of interbank money market rates. The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which assesses the recent macroeconomic context and inflation outlook, as well as the main challenges and risks to monetary policy in the coming period. The present forecast shows that annual inflation is likely to temporarily remain above the upper limit of the variation band around the target in the following months and reveals risks similar to those underlined in the previous forecasting exercise, while it is worth mentioning that these risks could be exacerbated by the growing uncertainties that affect the global economic environment. In the current macroeconomic context, the NBR Board is restating that the implementation of a coherent mix of restrictive monetary, fiscal and income policies and stepped-up structural reforms are essential to bring inflation during 2009 towards the trajectory compatible with attaining the announced target. The NBR Board will continue to closely monitor developments in macroeconomic indicators and to assess their outlook, in a bid to permanently ensure the broad monetary conditions needed to counteract inflationary pressures and attain the medium-term disinflation objectives in a sustainable manner. The next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy is scheduled for June 26, 2008."
Chile,2008-05-08,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 8 May 2008 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 6.25% (annual). Internationally, prospects for the US are still weak and financial markets continue to show signs of stress. However, markets do not expect further reductions in the interest rate and the US dollar has stopped falling vis a vis other currencies. Commodity prices remain high, while oil prices have kept on rising. Domestically, the latest information shows that first-quarter growth was below forecasts. Private consumption indicators point to a slowdown, while investment continues to grow fast. Unemployment has remained stable. April's inflation was in line with expectations, while the annual figure, although significantly above target, showed some decline. As expected, a limited propagation of inflation is still being observed. Nonetheless, food prices rose again, affecting core inflation measures, which remain high. Wages have increased in line with usual dynamics, while the peso has depreciated substantially since the last monetary policy meeting. The latest data confirms prospects that annual CPI inflation will continue to fall over the course of the next few months, although the uncertainty regarding expected monthly figures continues to affect inflation risks premiums. Long-term inflation expectations remain well-anchored around 3% annually. The Board reaffirms its commitment to conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that projected inflation will be at 3% in the policy horizon. Future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on new information. Particularly important for this will be the implications on inflation of the evolution of the complex international scenario, the degree of propagation of recent months' inflationary shocks to other prices, and the emergence of new inflationary pressures. * The Spanish original prevails."
Euroarea,2008-05-08,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to today's press conference here in Athens. I would like to thank Governor Garganas for his kind hospitality and to express our special gratitude to his staff for the excellent organisation of the meeting of the Governing Council. Let me report on the outcome of our meeting, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today's meeting to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Inflation rates have risen significantly since the autumn, owing mainly to increases in energy and food prices. As we have said on previous occasions, inflation rates are expected to remain high for a rather protracted period of time, before gradually declining again. The latest information confirms our assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium term, in a context of continuing very vigorous money and credit growth. At the same time, the economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound, and incoming macroeconomic data continue to point to moderate but ongoing real GDP growth. However, the level of uncertainty resulting from the turmoil in financial markets remains unusually high and tensions still persist. Against this background, we emphasise that maintaining price stability in the medium term is our primary objective in accordance with our mandate. The firm anchoring of medium to longer-term inflation expectations is of the highest priority. The Governing Council remains strongly committed to preventing second-round effects and the materialisation of upside risks to price stability over the medium term. We believe that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our objective. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the coming weeks. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. The latest data and survey information on economic activity confirm previous expectations of moderate but ongoing growth in the first half of 2008. In particular, industrial production data for the first months of the year showed resilience, while economic sentiment generally continued to soften. Overall, the euro area economy has sound fundamentals and does not suffer from major imbalances. In line with available forecasts, both domestic and foreign demand are expected to support ongoing real GDP growth in the euro area in 2008, albeit to a lesser extent than during 2007. While moderating, growth in the world economy is expected to remain resilient, benefiting in particular from strong growth in emerging economies. Meanwhile, investment growth in the euro area should provide ongoing support to economic activity, as capacity utilisation remains solid and profitability in the non-financial corporate sector has been sustained. At the same time, employment and labour force participation have increased significantly and unemployment rates have fallen to levels not seen for 25 years. This supports real disposable income and thus consumption growth, although purchasing power is being dampened by the impact of higher energy and food prices. The uncertainty surrounding this outlook for economic growth remains high, and downside risks prevail. In particular, risks relate to the potential for the financial market turbulence to have a more negative impact on the real economy than previously anticipated. Moreover, downside risks stem from the dampening impact on consumption and investment of further unanticipated increases in energy and food prices. Risks also arise from protectionist pressures and the possibility of disorderly developments owing to global imbalances. With regard to price developments, annual HICP inflation has remained above 3% for the past six months. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, it was 3.3% in April 2008. This outturn confirms the ongoing strong short-term upward pressure on inflation, resulting largely from sharp increases in energy and food prices at the global level in recent months. Looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for these commodities, the annual HICP inflation rate is likely to remain significantly above 2% in the coming months, moderating only gradually over the course of 2008. Accordingly, we are currently experiencing a rather protracted period of high annual rates of inflation. In order to ensure that current high inflation rates remain temporary, it is imperative that they do not become entrenched in longer-term expectations or lead to broadly based second-round effects in wage and price-setting. The risks to the outlook for inflation over the medium term remain clearly on the upside. These risks include the possibility of further rises in energy and food prices, as well as of increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those foreseen thus far. Most importantly, there is a risk that price and wage-setting behaviour could add to inflationary pressures. In particular, the pricing power of firms, notably in market segments with low competition, may prove stronger than currently expected. Moreover, higher than expected wage growth may emerge, taking into account high capacity utilisation, tight labour market conditions and the risk of second-round effects owing to the high level of current inflation rates. Against this background, it is imperative that all the parties concerned, in both the private and the public sector, meet their responsibilities. Wage-setting needs to take into account productivity developments, the still high level of unemployment in many economies, and price competitiveness positions. Moderate labour cost increases are particularly necessary in countries which have lost price competitiveness in recent years. Second-round effects stemming from the impact of higher energy and food prices on price and wage-setting behaviour must be avoided. In this context, the Governing Council is concerned about the existence of schemes in which nominal wages are indexed to consumer prices. Such schemes involve the risk of upward shocks in inflation leading to a wage-price spiral, which would be detrimental to employment and competitiveness in the countries concerned. The Governing Council therefore calls for such schemes to be avoided. The Governing Council is monitoring wage negotiations in the euro area with particular attention. In the view of the Governing Council, continued responsible wage agreements are of key importance in order to preserve price stability in the medium term and thereby the purchasing power of all euro area citizens. The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. Annual M3 growth remained very vigorous at 10.3% in March, supported by the continued strong growth of MFI loans to the private sector. At the same time, annual M1 growth continued to moderate in March, reflecting higher short-term interest rates which encouraged further shifts from overnight into time deposits. While the impact of the flat yield curve and other temporary factors suggest that annual M3 growth currently overstates the underlying pace of monetary expansion, nonetheless, even after taking such effects into account, a broad-based assessment of the latest data confirms that the underlying rate of money and credit growth remains strong. The growth of household borrowing has moderated over recent months, reflecting the impact of higher short-term interest rates and cooling housing markets in several parts of the euro area. However, the growth of loans to non-financial corporations has remained very robust. While some future moderation can be expected in the light of tightening financing conditions and slower economic growth, bank borrowing by euro area non-financial corporations grew at an annual rate of 15.0% in the year to March 2008, and the flow of loans in recent months has been strong. For the time being, there is little evidence that the financial market turbulence seen since early August 2007 has strongly influenced the development of broad money and loans. Continued strong loan growth to non-financial corporations suggests that the availability of bank credit to euro area firms has not been significantly impaired by the financial turmoil thus far. Further data and analysis will be required in order to obtain a more complete picture of the impact of the financial market developments on banks' balance sheets, financing conditions and money and credit growth. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis clearly confirms the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium term, in a context of very vigorous money and credit growth and with no significant signs of supply constraints on bank loans. The economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound, and incoming macroeconomic data continue to point to moderate but ongoing real GDP growth. However, the level of uncertainty resulting from the turmoil in financial markets remains high. Against this background, we emphasise that the firm anchoring of medium to longer-term inflation expectations is of the highest priority to the Governing Council. We believe that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving this objective. The Governing Council remains strongly committed to preventing second-round effects and the materialisation of upside risks to price stability over the medium term. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the coming weeks. Regarding fiscal policies, the latest forecast by the European Commission points to a rise in the euro area general government deficit ratio in 2008, followed by a further small increase in 2009. This deterioration in part reflects a less favourable economic environment and a likely reversal of windfall revenues accrued in past years. However, it also reflects a standstill in fiscal consolidation and new deficit-increasing measures in a number of countries with fiscal imbalances, including some with high deficits. For several countries, the attainment of the country-specific medium-term objectives by 2010 at the latest, which is the commitment made by euro area governments in Berlin in April 2007, is clearly at risk. In these countries, much more ambitious policies are imperative. For all countries, prudent fiscal policies would also help to counteract current inflationary pressures. At the current juncture, it is also important to reinforce the structural reform agenda, in particular with a view to fostering market integration and to reducing rigidities in product and labour markets. Policy initiatives aimed at enhancing competition in market segments with low competition, such as services and energy, would allow pricing behaviour to adjust and thus contribute to lower inflation pressures. Furthermore, policies to increase trend productivity growth would contribute to smaller unit labour cost increases and ultimately also to higher employment."
Egypt,2008-05-08,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release May 8, 2008 The Central Bank of Egypt decided to raise its overnight deposit by 50 bps to 10 percent per annu. In its meeting held on May 8, 2008, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise the overnight deposit and lending rates by 50 bps to 10 percent and 12 percent, respectivel. The headline CPI inflation has maintained its upward trend reaching 164% in April as domestic food inflation perpetuated to 22% driven mainly by the elevated international food price. Moreover further spillover to non-food prices contributed to the latest inflation outtur. Despite tentative signs of moderation in international wheat prices, the domestic inflation outlook is affected by the latest regulated price adjustment. While the immediate one-off effect would be reflected in the next inflation reading, the consequent second round effects of these price adjustments pose an upside risk to the inflation prospect. This could be intensified by a potential worsening of inflation expectation. These unfolding developments will likely keep annual inflation rates high until the combined effects of price increases related to the international food price shock and the current regulated price adjustments taper of. Given the clear evidence of underlying inflationary pressures, the MPC judges that the balance of risks to the inflation outlook continue to be on the upside and today's decision is aimed at containing inflation expectation. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments, especially the factors underlying inflation, and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter.

South Korea,2008-05-08,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (5.00%) for the intermeeting period. (The following is an English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (5.00%) for the intermeeting period. The domestic economy is exhibiting some signs of a slowdown in its pace of expansion. While exports continue to post robust growth, domestic demand has moderated. There still remains a high degree of uncertainty surrounding future economic developments, largely due to the international financial market unrest and the US economic slowdown. Consumer price inflation continues to show a rapid rise, mainly influenced by high oil prices. The recent rebound in real estate prices has continued centering on certain areas. Liquidity is still ample in the financial markets and financial institutions' lending continues to show a steady increase. Meanwhile, long-term market interest rates have declined sharply."
Georgia,2008-05-14,"Tbilisi. 14 May The Decision of the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Georgia on May 14, 2008 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met today and decided to leave its main policy rate, the one-week Certificate of Deposit (CD) rate, unchanged at 12 percent. The capital inflows have slowed down somewhat in the pre-election period, however it is expected that inflows will return to pre-election levels and will likely remain high for the remainder of the year. The growth of reserve money rate has slowed somewhat along with the broad money aggregates as of late; however growth rates these indicators still remain above the comfort levels. The high rate of growth in lending to the private sector compared to growth in deposits has reduced the existing excess liquidity within the Georgian banking system to a minimum. In response to the abovementioned events, commercial banks increased interest rates. Even though these recent steps by commercial banks occurred with a certain delay, they should help in restoring equilibrium at the money market. Current expert estimates remain optimistic regarding the prices of main commodities, a notable increase in the price of crude oil is not expected in the short-term and wheat prices are expected to decrease during the course of the year. Moreover, prices of precious metals are expected to decrease. Existing risks to inflation have not changed since the last Monetary Policy Committee meeting. Assuming that significant increases in administrative prices will not be observed and commodity prices will be in line with the existing forecasts, current interest rates will insure that an inflation rate of 8 percent is achieved by the end of the year. The NBG will closely monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets with the objective of achieving the forecast inflation rate and will in due course act accordingly. The 2008 schedule of the MPC meetings is posted on the website of the NBG. The next meeting will take place on June 25, 2008. 1 The reproduction without citing the source is not allowed."

The Board reiterates that the necessary adjustments will be implemented to ensure inflation's gradual convergence to the target range in a context in which price rises are mainly explained by food supply shocks. The Board also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on the following active and passive operations between the BCRP and the financial system: Direct repo and rediscount operations: 6.25 percent. Overnight deposits: 4.75 percent. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 6.25 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for June on its session of June 12. Moreover, the following Inflation Report will be published on June 13."
Turkiye,2008-05-15,"The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) has decided to increase the policy rates as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate from 15.25 percent to 15.75 percent, and lending rate from 19.25 percent to 19.75 percent, b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m. from 11.25 percent to 11.75 percent, lending rate from 22.25 percent to 22.75 percent, c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions from 18.25 percent to 18.75 percent. Recent readings confirm the outlook presented in the April Inflation Report. Lagged pass-through impact of the exchange rate movements and rising energy and processed food prices may lead to a temporary rise in inflation in the short term. Difficulties in international credit markets continue to restrain the domestic demand, while external demand remains strong. Overall, aggregate demand conditions will continue to support disinflation. The Committee expects inflation to start decelerating in the last quarter of the year, ending 2009 at around 6.7 percent, as forecasted in the April Inflation Report. In the forthcoming period, monetary policy decisions will be geared towards keeping inflation close to these forecasts. Therefore, it is important that economic agents align their expectations with the Central Bank forecasts. The Central Bank will continue to take the necessary measures to prevent the potential second-round effects of the adverse developments in food and energy prices. Accordingly, the Committee will consider the possibility of a further measured rate hike in the next meeting. The extent and timing of possible future rate hike will depend on developments in global markets, external demand, fiscal policy implementation, and other factors affecting the medium term inflation outlook. It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight working days."
Thailand,2008-05-21,"No 18 /2008 Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 21 May 2008 Ms. Duangmanee Vongpradhip. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand, announces that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance. The main issues discussed were as follows. During the first quarter of this year, the Thai economy continued to expand from both private consumption and private investment, in line with the robust growth in imports of consumer and capital goods. However exports began to show signs of moderation consistent with the slowdown in the global economy. In addition, rising costs of production and higher inflation could affect confidence and private spending going forward. Risks to inflation increased markedly from the previous meeting. Headline inflation accelerated as a result of the significant increase in energy and raw food prices. Meanwhile core inflation rose by more than expected, mainly as a result of higher pass- through of production costs, which could result in higher core inflation going forward. The MPC deemed that the risks to economic growth and inflationary pressures had risen, and both would have to be monitored closely. At the moment, the MPC decided to keep the policy interest rate at 325 per cent per annum. However should inflation continue to accelerate, the MPC would stand ready to adjust the monetary policy stance accordingly."
Hungary,2008-05-26,"1 At its meeting on 26 May 2008, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to raise the central bank base rate by 25 basis points, from 8.25% to 8.50%, with effect from 27 May 2008. 2 The Council discussed the May 2008 issue of the Bank's Quarterly Report on Inflation. In the Council's view, consistent with the projection presented in the Report. Hungarian economic growth continues to be subdued and the fall in inflation has been less rapid than expected. The Council decided to raise official interest rates at its meetings in March and April in response to the deterioration in the outlook for inflation. Inflation has been falling less fast than expected, due to cost shocks of domestic and international origin: inflation may be significantly above target in 2009 assuming unchanged monetary conditions; however, it may reach the target in 2010, if the significant upside risks do not materialise. The output gap is likely to remain negative over the entire forecast period, due in part to the dampening effects on demand of fiscal policy, which will help to reduce inflation through its disciplinary effect on domestic firms' price and wage setting decisions. Improvements in external and domestic balance is expected to reduce the vulnerability of the economy. However, there are significant upside risks on the horizon relevant for monetary policy. Despite the pressing need to adjust, the reduction in the rate of wage growth may be slower than expected as a consequence of the recent cost shocks. If economic agents pass more of the cost increases through to higher prices, or if they rely more heavily on past inflation in their price and wage-setting decisions than assumed in the central projection, it will add to inflation pressures. And if the recent deterioration in the global inflation environment continued, it would also increase the risk of higher domestic inflation. In the Council's judgement, the policy tightening that has taken place so far will contribute to the further reduction in inflation, despite the strong cost shocks affecting the economy. The Council remains committed to achieving the 3 per cent target, while striving to prevent second-round effects. It has taken its decision to raise the base rate in view of the significant risk that the inflation target would not be met on the horizon relevant for policy. The Monetary Council believes that maintaining tight monetary policy is necessary and it will stand ready to take actions, if there is a threat to the inflation target."
Israel,2008-05-26,"26.5.2008</td> The Bank of Israel raises the interest rate for June 2008 by 25 basis points to 3.5 percent The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for June will rise by 25 basis points, to 3.5 percent. This step is taken in the context of the policy of maintaining price stability, in accordance with the inflation target of 1-3 percent a year. Background conditions Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 1.5 percent in April, above the expected increase of 0.9 percent. In the last twelve months the CPI has risen by 4.7 percent, and the CPI excluding the energy, food, and fruit and vegetables components by 2 percent, 0.9 percentage points more than the level inMarch. Although much of the rise in prices is the result of the global increase in food and oil prices, even after adjusting for the effect of those prices, the inflation environment has worsened significantly. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Israeli forecasters revised their predictions upwards again this month, andexpect, on average, that inflation over the next twelve months will be 3.3 percent, i.e., above the upper limit of the target range. They have also raised their forecasts for the next few months significantly. They also expect that the Bank of Israel will raise the interest rate for June by between 25 basis points and 50 basis points, and again by a similar amount for July. Inflation expectations for the next twelve months calculated from the capital market currently stand at 2.8 percent, close to the upper limit of the target range. Interest rate expectations derived from the capital marketsindicate a cumulative rise of one percentage point over the next twelve months. Real economic activity: National Accounts data relating to the first quarter of 2008 indicate that economic growth is continuing, but at a slightly slower rate than in the previous four quarters. In 2008:Q 4 GDP increased at annual rate of 5.4 percent, and business sector product at an annual rate of 6.1 percent. However, deducting the effect of import taxes, the growth rate was a more moderate 4.2 percent. In the first quarter imports and exports increased considerably. The composite state-of-the-economy index for April edged up by 0.1 percent, and the indices for February and March were revised upwards. The labor market and wages: Employment continued to rise during the last few months. At the same time the rise in nominal labor costs accelerated. According to National InsuranceInstitute data, the number of employee posts kept rising, albeit a little more slowly. In the three months December 2007 to February 2008 the number rose by 4 percent compared with the number in the same months a year earlier. According to trend data of the Manpower Survey, the unemployment rate was 6.5 percent in February. The nominal wage accelerated: in the public sector it rose by 8.9 percent in the three months December 2007 to February 2008 compared with that in the same months a year earlier, partly due to the payment of various non-recurring wage components following the new wage agreement; in the business sector the nominal wage rose over the same period by 3.6 percent. Budget policy: Budget data for the first four months of the year are consistent with the full implementation of the budget. On the revenues side the rise in direct tax revenues slowed, while import taxes and non-tax revenues rose. In this period total government revenues were higher than budgeted. The foreign exchange market: In the period between the previous interest rate discussion on 27 April, and 25 March, the shekel strengthened by 3.8 percent against the dollar and by 3.4 percent against the euro. Most of the major currencies tended to strengthen against the dollar this month. During the last month the volatility of the shekel/dollar exchange rate declined. The trend emerging in the goods ands services account suggests that a turnaround in the current account is under way, and that it will move from a surplus of about $5 billion in 2007 to a small deficit in 2008. Such a change would tend to weaken the forces acting to strengthen the shekel. The capital and money markets: The leading stock exchange indices around the world showed mixed trends this month. From 27 April (the date of the previous interest rate discussion) to 25 May, the Tel Aviv 100 share price index showed no significant change.Yields on 10-year unindexed government bonds rose again, slightly, and reached 5.94 percent, compared with 5.89 percent last month. The yield gap between Israeli and comparable US government bonds remained steady at 2.1 percentage points. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS premium, continued to decline this month and reached 0.52 percent, down from 0.6 percent last month. A similar decline occurred in the CDS spreads in the emerging markets. The world economy: The global economy is currently in a state of uncertainty on three fronts: the situation in the financial sector, the expected slowdown in the growth of economic activity, and the surge in inflation. Following a period of upheaval in the financial sector, a measure of calm has returned, but uncertainty regarding the financial markets is still evident. The most recently published economic data indicate a slowdown in world growth, and especially ingrowth in the US. The rate of growth in Europe and Japan showed a surprising increase in the first quarter of 2008, but it is expected to moderate. Global inflation continues to accelerate, in light of the marked rises in commodity and oil prices. Prices of many commodities reached record levels this year. However, some commodity prices did drop in the last month, but oilprices, which reached an unprecedented $135 a barrel, continue to rise. Market assessments, and those of the IMF, are that food and commodity prices will remain at their present high levels. If these assessments turn out to be correct, inflation would be expected to slow. Against the background of the increase in inflation, expectations of changes in central banks' interest rates also rose. Financial market prices imply no change in the Fed interest rate at its next meeting (with a probability of more than 90 percent) and a rise of 25 basis points (with a high degree of probability) in the ECB and Bank of Japan interest rates by the end of the year. The main considerations behind the decision This increase in the interest rate is required due to the worsening of the inflation environment. Thus, inflation in the last twelve months was 4.7 percent, compared with the target range of 1-3 percent, and one-year-forward inflation expectations derived from the capital market are at the upper limit of the target range. In addition, the average of Israeli forecasters' twelve-month inflation predictions is above the upper limit of the target range. The decision to raise the interest rate by 25 basis points was based mainlyon the assessment that despite the relatively rapid growth in the first quarter, a slowdown in growth is still expected this year due to the slowdownexpected in the global economy. The Bank of Israel also considers that the appreciation of the shekel has amoderating effect on prices, but to a lesser extent than hitherto. The stronger shekel also tends to have a moderating effect on real activity. This increase in the interest rate is required to return inflation to the price stability target range of 1-3 percent inflation a year, and thereby toprovide the basis that is essential for sustained growth. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor economic developments worldwideand will raise the interest rate as necessary to achieve price stability. Subject to this, the Bank will continue to support the attainment of a range of objectives of macroeconomic policy, in particular the encouragement ofemployment and growth. In addition, the Bank will continue to support the stability of the financial system. The minutes of the discussions prior to the above interest rate decision will be published on 10 June 2008. The decision regarding the interest rate for July 2008 will be published at 18:30 on 23 June 2008. 26.5.2008</td> The Bank of Israel raises the interest rate for June 2008 by 25 basis points to 3.5 percent.

Malaysia,2008-05-26,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to leave the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) unchanged at 3.50 percent. The Malaysian economy has continued to perform well during the first quarter of 2008, driven by strong domestic demand. Furthermore, while exports of electrical and electronic products have contracted, net exports have remained firm, supported by stronger exports of commodities and resource-based manufactured goods. However, there is now clearer evidence of the slowing growth in the major economies. This moderation in growth is expected to be felt by the regional economies, including Malaysia, during the second half of the year. Despite the signs of slowing global growth, commodity and food prices have continued to increase. In particular, oil prices have spiralled up in recent weeks. Domestic consumer price inflation in Malaysia increased to 3 percent in April 2008 and is primarily being driven by higher food prices. There are strong upside risks to global inflation due to sustained high food and energy prices. While such pressures are likely to ease should global growth moderate, in the more immediate term, domestic price pressures are likely to be sustained. The MPC views the latest data on key international and domestic economic variables as being supportive of its assessment that going forward, the risks to inflation are on the upside, while the risks to growth are on the downside. Should the balance of risks shift towards higher inflation, the Bank will undertake the appropriate monetary policy measures. At this stage the risks are assessed to be about balanced, and consequently, the Bank has decided to maintain the current stance of monetary policy. The future thrust of monetary policy will depend on further information on the relative dominance of either risk going forward. Bank Negara Malaysia 26 May 2008."
Poland,2008-05-28,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 28 May 2008 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 27-28 May 2008 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e. (cid:131) reference rate 5.75% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate 7.25% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate 4.25% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate 6.00% on an annual basis. The Polish economy is still in the period of strong growth encompassing all its sectors. Macroeconomic data released since the last meeting of the Council indicate that economic growth has continued at a high level, though it may slow down somewhat in the next quarters. The latest information on the US economy confirms earlier signals of a substantial economic slowdown in this country. Uncertainty also persists as to the scale of the deceleration of euro-area economic growth and of its impact on the Polish economy. In April the annual growth of consumer prices in Poland decreased to 4.0%, yet remaining above the NBP's inflation target of 2.5% and also above the upper limit for deviations from the target set at 3.5%. The heightened inflation results, to a large extent, from factors that are beyond the influence of domestic monetary policy, particularly from strong increases in food and fuel prices in the world markets and from increases of administered prices. The Council maintains its assessment that these factors will contribute to inflation remaining above the upper limit for deviations from the inflation target in the nearest future. In the Council's assessment the latest macroeconomic data signal that in the first half of 2008 economic growth will most probably continue to exceed the growth of potential GDP. The latest information on labour market developments points to a sustained high growth of employment and wages and to an unfavourable relation between wage and labour productivity growth. It is quite probable that the wage pressure and, consequently, inflationary pressure will persist. Increased inflation in the months to come will, to a large extent, result from the growth of administered prices and also from the food and fuel price growth observed in the world economy and affecting the Polish market. This creates a risk of inflation expectations remaining at a elevated level and, consequently, feeds the risk of the so-called second-round effects. Moreover, the rise in prices of energy and food may be gradually passing through to other prices, particularly to prices of some services. In the medium term inflationary pressure may be curbed by still good financial results of enterprises and high investment growth conducive to productivity growth. Inflationary pressure may also be constrained by globalisation and the ensuing increased competition in the market of internationally traded goods and services, as well as the slowdown in the global and, consequently, also in the Polish economy. The previous increases of the NBP's interest rates and the zloty appreciation observed over the past few quarters should also be conducive to lowering inflation. ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51. The Council assessed the probability of inflation overshooting the inflation target in the medium term to be higher than the probability of inflation running below the target. The Council does not rule out that bringing inflation down to the target in the medium term would require further monetary policy tightening. In view of the persisting uncertainty as to the global growth outlook and the prospects of the Polish economy, the Council assessed that a more comprehensive assessment of inflation outlook will be possible after analysing the data released in the near future and after considering the June inflation projection. The Council will strive to bring inflation down to the target in the medium term. The Council will be closely monitoring the growth and structure of domestic demand, the relation between wage and labour productivity growth in the enterprise sector and wage growth in the public finance sector, the degree of the expansionary fiscal policy stance, zloty exchange rate, developments of the current account balance and the impact of globalisation on the economy and on food prices. The Council will also analyse changes in the external factors affecting the Polish economy and their impact on the outlook for economic growth and inflation in Poland. The Council approved the Report on the Operations of the National Bank of Poland in 2007. At its meeting on 21 May 2008, the Council adopted the Report on Monetary Policy Implementation in 2007."
Nigeria,2008-06-02,"CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA'S COMMUNIQUE No 56 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE. JUNE 2, 2008 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today. June 2, 2008. The Committee reviewed the international economic and financial developments alongside the domestic macroeconomic conditions in the first five months of 2008 as well as the outlook for the near term. It also considered the implications of the current macroeconomic situation in Nigeria and the uncertainties in the global economy, especially the rising global prices. The MPC noted that the domestic macroeconomic environment has been so far relatively stable. However the path ahead is strewn with many uncertainties, among which the major ones are the upward oil and food price movements, the fiscal expansion, and the international financial market conditions. These uncertainties posed severe challenges to the Committee in its deliberations on the formulation of optimal monetary policy. At the outset, the Committee observed that the current rate of inflation is a matter of serious concern since inflation affects adversely the economic well being of the country. It however expressed satisfaction over the stability of the foreign exchange market and the accretion to foreign exchange reserves. It restated its commitment to fostering monetary and price stability in order to support continued economic growth. Key Macroeconomic Developments Inflation: The Committee noted that at 82 per cent, inflationary pressures as measured by the movements in the year-on-year (y-o-y) Consumer Price Index, intensified in April 2008 from a lower 78 per cent in March 2008 and 66 per cent in December 2007. The elevated inflation rate could be attributed mainly to the increase of 131 per cent in food prices which have a large weight of 6376 per cent in the overall index. The downside risks to inflation would arise if demand pressure is exerted by large fiscal injections and private expenditures beyond what the supply can accommodate. 2 Growth: The growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) is projected at 64 per cent for the first quarter, and 66 per cent for the second quarter of 2008, driven principally by the growth in non-oil GDP. Money and Credit: Provisional data indicate that M2 grew by 348 per cent in the first three months of 2008. On a year-on-year basis. M2 has gone up by 622 per cent by end March 2008. The growth in M2 was driven by increases in net foreign assets of the banking system as well as credit to the private sector. The Committee envisions that liquidity surge would continue to be intense in the months ahead, requiring the need to take appropriate actions to align the demand for and supply of reserves. The Committee noted that credit to the private sector maintained an upward trend during the first quarter of 2008. Credit to the private sector grew substantially by 96 per cent in fiscal 2007 and by 124 per cent in the first three months of 2008 which on a year-on-year basis would amount to 965 per cent. The Federal Government, however, has continued to be a net creditor to the banking system. In the view of the Committee, the prospects of accelerated economic growth would further improve the demand for credit even as the abilities of the regulators as well as the banks to ensure that the quality of lending is secured by appropriate risk management mechanisms are tested. Exchange Rate: The MPC noted that the external value of the Naira is currently at N 11783 per US $1. The exchange rate has been relatively stable in the first five months of 2008. Net sales of foreign exchange by the CBN through auctions, to banks and their BDCs amounted to US $ 5248 million since the last MPC meeting on April 01, 2008. The staff's assessment is that there would be continued stability in the foreign exchange market in the months ahead. External Reserves: The Committee noted with satisfaction that the gross official reserves amounted to US $5916billion as at May 28, 2008. It would support 27 months of current foreign exchange disbursements. The accretion to reserves is expected to be sustained during the remainder of the year. Interest Rates: The MPC observed that the inter-bank call rates rose in April in response to policy and market conditions. The rates continued to be relatively stable in May at the elevated level of April. The spread between the average term deposit and the maximum lending rates narrowed by 008 percentage point to 744 per cent at the end of April 2008 from 752 per cent in March. With the 2 3 inflation rate at 82 per cent in April 2008, all the interest rates excepting the saving deposit rate were positive in real terms. Fiscal Stance: The Committee noted that the federal government budget as approved, and the distribution of part of excess crude oil proceeds, would lead to high liquidity injection in the next two quarters of the year. It also noted that the actual and potential impact on liquidity of recent fiscal disbursements from the excess crude oil account and other disbursements scheduled for June 2008 would be considerable. The Outlook and Policy Considerations The MPC observed that monetary policy has to be forward looking. The policy therefore has to ensure that concerns about price stability and real activity levels are recognized and actions taken to address them. In view of the sharp growth of credit to the private sector by 96 per cent and of M2 by 62 per cent on a year- on-year basis by March 2008, and as fiscal expansion is all time high, threats of resurgence of inflation are very high. In addition, there is the threat of imported inflation owing to global rise in prices. Decisions In the light of the foregoing, the Committee decided to: 1. continue and even strengthen the use of instruments such as open market operations (OMO) and special sale of foreign exchange; 2. signal the tightening of the stance of monetary policy by: a) raising the MPR by 25 basis points from 100 per cent to 1025 per cent, and b) increasing the CRR by 100 basis points from 30 per cent to 40 per cent with effect from June 09, 2008; and 3. set up a technical committee to work out other intervention securities that the CBN would issue to further strengthen the effectiveness of liquidity management.

Philippines,2008-06-04,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to increase by 25 basis points the BSP's key policy interest rates to 5.25 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 7.25 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs, and SDAs were also increased accordingly. In its assessment, the Monetary Board noted that emerging baseline forecasts, which reflect more recent data on inflation and output, indicate a likely breach of the inflation target for 2008. The BSP forecasts 2008 average inflation to reach 7.0-9.0 percent. For 2009, average inflation is expected to decline to 4.0-6.0 percent. The Monetary Board believes that there are already indications that supply-driven pressures are beginning to feed into demand. Core inflation as of May 2008 has reached its highest level since April 2006. Recent business and consumer confidence surveys also indicate an upward shift in inflation expectations, coinciding with increased term spreads on government securities and higher secondary market yields. Given the early evidence of second-round effects, the Monetary Board recognized the need to act promptly to rein in inflationary expectations. Since monetary policy affects economic variables with a time lag, policy measures undertaken now will help address risks to inflation in 2009. In addition, the buoyancy of domestic demand suggests some room for a measured policy response. Favorable conditions arising from a respectable and still solid domestic growth as well as a strong external payments situation imply that the economy can withstand a measured tightening. The Monetary Board stands ready to undertake further action as and when necessary in order to ensure the achievement of the BSP's price stability objective."
Euroarea,2008-06-05,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. This week we celebrated the tenth anniversary of the ECB, marking an important milestone in the development of this institution and of the single monetary policy. On that occasion I expressed my sincere thanks to all those who have helped to build a solid foundation for the euro. Let me also extend these thanks to you who play such an important role in transmitting our decisions and explanations to the financial markets and to the public at large. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup. Prime Minister Juncker. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today's meeting to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. At the same time, we noted that risks to price stability over the medium term have increased further. Inflation rates have risen significantly since the autumn of last year, owing mainly to strong increases in energy and food prices. HICP inflation is now expected to remain high for a more protracted period than previously thought. Upside risks to price stability over the medium term are also confirmed by the continuing very vigorous money and credit growth and the absence of significant constraints on bank loan supply up to now. At the same time, the economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound. Against this background, we emphasise that maintaining price stability in the medium term is our primary objective in accordance with our mandate. The Governing Council is monitoring very closely all developments. By acting in a firm and timely manner, we will prevent second-round effects and ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. It is our strong determination to secure a firm anchoring of medium and long-term inflation expectations in line with price stability. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. At a quarter-on-quarter rate of 0.8%, real GDP growth in the first quarter of 2008 was well above expectations. In part, this strength reflected temporary factors, notably the unusually mild winter in many parts of Europe, which appears to have boosted construction activity. However, the high growth rate in the first quarter might be partly offset in the second. It is therefore more appropriate, in order to avoid being misguided by highly volatile quarterly results, to evaluate the first two quarters of 2008 together. In line with available forecasts, both domestic and foreign demand are expected to support ongoing real GDP growth in the euro area in 2008, albeit to a lesser extent than during 2007. While moderating, growth in the world economy is expected to remain resilient, benefiting in particular from continued robust growth in emerging economies. The fundamentals of the euro area economy remain sound, and the euro area does not suffer from major imbalances. Against this background, we expect investment growth in the euro area to provide ongoing support to economic activity, as capacity utilisation remains solid and profitability in the non-financial corporate sector has been sustained. Moreover, employment and labour force participation have increased significantly, and unemployment rates have fallen to levels not seen for 25 years. These developments support disposable income, although purchasing power is being dampened by the impact of higher energy and food prices. This outlook is also reflected in the June 2008 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections. The projections foresee average annual real GDP growth in a range between 1.5% and 2.1% in 2008 and between 1.0% and 2.0% in 2009. In comparison with the March ECB staff projections, the current range projected for real GDP growth in 2008 is within the upper part of the range published in March 2008, mainly as a consequence of the better than expected outcome in the first quarter. For 2009, the range has been adjusted downwards, following the increase in commodity prices over recent months. The year-on-year growth rates which I have just mentioned need to be interpreted with particular caution on this occasion. While the annual rates suggest that growth may be weaker in 2009 than in 2008, they mask the fact that on a quarterly basis real GDP growth is projected to reach a trough in 2008, before gradually recovering thereafter. In order not to draw the wrong conclusions about the growth dynamics implied in the staff projections it is important to keep this distinction in mind. In the Governing Council's view, the uncertainty surrounding this outlook for economic growth remains high, and downside risks prevail. In particular, risks continue to relate to the potential for the financial market turbulence to have a more negative impact on the real economy than anticipated. Moreover, downside risks stem from the dampening impact on consumption and investment of further unanticipated increases in energy and food prices. Risks also arise from concerns about the emergence of protectionist pressures and the possibility of disorderly developments owing to global imbalances. With regard to price developments, annual HICP inflation has remained above 3% for the past seven months. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, it was 3.6% in May 2008. This confirms the more persistent current upward pressures on euro area inflation, resulting largely from sharp increases in energy and food prices at the global level in recent months. Looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for these commodities, the annual HICP inflation rate is likely to remain above 3% for some time to come, before moderating only gradually in 2009. We are thus currently experiencing a protracted period of high annual rates of inflation, which is likely to be more persistent than previously anticipated. Consistent with this view, the Eurosystem staff projections foresee average annual HICP inflation at between 3.2% and 3.6% in 2008 and between 1.8% and 3.0% in 2009. Compared with the March 2008 ECB staff projections, the ranges projected for inflation in 2008 and 2009 are markedly higher, reflecting mainly higher oil and food prices and increasingly inflationary pressures in the services sector. In this context, it is important to recall the conditional nature of the Eurosystem staff projections. They are based on a number of assumptions which are of a purely technical nature and unrelated to policy intentions. In particular, the technical assumptions for short-term interest rates are taken from market expectations as at mid-May. Moreover, it should be noted that the projections are based on the assumption that the recent dynamism in oil and non-oil commodity prices will diminish over the projection horizon, in line with futures prices. A further crucial assumption is that there will be no broad-based second-round effects on wages. In the Governing Council's view, at the policy-relevant medium-term horizon risks to the outlook for prices remain clearly on the upside and have increased further These risks include notably the possibility of further increases in energy and food prices, as well as of increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those foreseen thus far. It is also a strong concern that price and wage-setting behaviour could add to inflationary pressures. The pricing power of firms, particularly in market segments with low competition, such as parts of the services sector, may prove stronger than currently expected. Moreover, higher than expected wage growth may emerge, taking into account high capacity utilisation, tight labour market conditions and the risk of second-round effects. The Governing Council is monitoring wage negotiations and price-setting behaviour in the euro area with particular attention. Against this background, it is imperative to secure that medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability. All parties concerned, in both the private and the public sector, must meet their responsibilities. Wage-setting needs to take into account productivity developments, the still high level of unemployment in many economies, and price competitiveness positions. Moderate labour cost increases are particularly necessary in countries which have lost price competitiveness in recent years. Broadly based second-round effects stemming from the impact of higher energy and food prices on price and wage-setting behaviour must be avoided. In this context, the Governing Council is concerned about the existence of schemes in which nominal wages are indexed to consumer prices. Such schemes involve the risk of upward shocks in inflation leading to a wage-price spiral, which would be detrimental to employment and competitiveness in the countries concerned. The Governing Council therefore calls for such schemes to be avoided. The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. Annual M3 growth remained very vigorous in April, supported by the continued strong growth of MFI loans to the private sector. While the impact of the flat yield curve and other temporary factors suggest that annual M3 growth continues to overstate the underlying pace of monetary expansion, nonetheless, even after taking such effects into account, a broad-based assessment of the latest data confirms that the underlying rate of money and credit growth remains strong. Annual M1 growth has continued to moderate in recent months, reflecting higher short-term interest rates which have encouraged further shifts from overnight into time deposits. The moderation in the growth of household borrowing also reflects the dampening impact of higher short-term interest rates, as well as cooling housing markets in several parts of the euro area. However, the growth of loans to non-financial corporations has remained very robust. While some moderation can be expected in the future in the light of tightening financing conditions and slower economic growth, bank borrowing by euro area non-financial corporations grew at an annual rate of 14.9% in April 2008, and the flow of loans in recent months has been strong. The monetary analysis has helped to support the necessary medium-term orientation of monetary policy in the face of the ongoing financial turmoil. From this perspective, the monetary analysis points to upside risks to price stability at longer horizons. Moreover, a thorough assessment of the monetary counterparts suggests that, as yet, the availability of bank credit to households and non-financial corporations has not been significantly affected by the turmoil. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis clearly confirms the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium term, in a context of very vigorous money and credit growth and the absence of significant constraints on bank loan supply up to now. In fact, we noted that risks to price stability over the medium term have increased further. The economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound, and incoming macroeconomic data continue to point to moderate but ongoing real GDP growth. Against this background, the Governing Council is monitoring very closely all developments. By acting in a firm and timely manner, we will prevent second-round effects and ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. Securing a firm anchoring of medium and long-term inflation expectations in line with price stability is of the essence. Regarding fiscal policy, the Governing Council welcomes the spring 2008 orientations for euro area fiscal policies agreed by the Eurogroup ministers on 13 May 2008. Many euro area governments still need to implement much more ambitious policies to ensure that their country-specific medium-term budgetary objectives are attained by 2010 at the latest, as agreed in Berlin in April 2007. Achieving and maintaining sound structural fiscal positions is imperative to create scope for the free working of automatic stabilisers in all euro area countries and will help to prepare for the budgetary costs of population ageing. The steady pursuit of prudent and efficient fiscal policies would also help to limit current inflationary pressures and would increase potential growth and employment. As regards structural reforms, the Governing Council reiterates its full support for all efforts to enhance competition, increase productivity and foster market flexibility. Against the background of a marked increase in international food commodity prices, removing impediments to competition at the various stages of the food supply chain in the retail and distribution sectors would benefit European consumers through lower prices. The ongoing “health check” of the EU common agricultural policy is welcomed, as are the efforts to limit upward pressure on agricultural prices through biofuels policies. A successful conclusion of the Doha round of world trade negotiations should also help to improve the functioning of global trade in general and of agricultural markets in Europe and worldwide in particular. Tax policies are not an appropriate means to counter commodity price increases, be it oil or non-oil commodities, as this would send wrong signals to producers and consumers alike and would distort markets."
Chile,2008-06-10,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 10 June 2008 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 50 basis points, to 6.75% (annual). Given the deteriorated inflationary outlook, this increase in the monetary policy rate is necessary to avoid an undesired postponement of the convergence of inflation to 3%. Internationally, growth prospects for developed economies remain weak and financial markets are still under stress. The oil price has risen significantly, most commodity prices remain high and inflationary pressures around the world have increased. Domestically, the latest information shows that expected second-quarter economic growth is consistent with the growth prospects contained in the last Monetary Policy Report. Domestic demand continues to grow strongly, particularly its imported component, while unemployment has remained stable. May's inflation exceeded expectations substantially, due to new price increases for energy, and especially foodstuffs. Core inflation indicators and various measures for inflation expectations are up. Wage dynamics remain in line with historical patterns. The Board reaffirms its commitment to conduct monetary policy so as to reduce the current high inflation rates to 3% over the policy horizon. It thus contributes to keeping private expectations anchored to the inflation target. Particularly important for future changes in the policy rate will be the implications on inflation of the evolution of the complex international scenario, the degree of propagation of recent months' inflationary shocks to other prices and wages, and the emergence of new inflationary pressures. * The Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2008-06-12,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (5.00%) for the intermeeting period. (The following is an English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (5.00%) for the intermeeting period. The domestic economy exhibits signs of a slowdown in its pace of expansion. While exports continue to post robust growth, domestic demand has slackened. There still remains a high degree of uncertainty surrounding future economic developments, largely due to the run-up in international oil prices, the international financial market unrest and the US economic slowdown. Consumer price inflation has picked up its pace, mainly influenced by high oil prices. The upward trend of real estate prices has slowed down somewhat. Liquidity is still ample in the financial markets and financial institutions' lending continues to show a steady increase. Meanwhile, long-term market interest rates have shown a sharp rise."
South Africa,2008-06-12,"Issued by Mr T T Mboweni. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank. The outlook for inflation remains bleak in an environment of sustained increases in international oil and food prices. An increasing number of countries are experiencing intensified inflation pressures and the risk to both global and domestic inflation is seen to be firmly on the upside against the backdrop of a slowing international and domestic economy. Domestically, price increases have become more broad-based, and inflation expectations have deteriorated further. Adding to the inflation uncertainty is the impending announcement of the electricity price increases to be granted to Eskom. CPIX inflation measured 10,4 per cent in April 2008, compared to 10,1 per cent the previous month. Sustained food and petrol price pressures were primarily- but not only- responsible for this trend. Petrol prices increased at a year-on-year rate of 30,5 per cent while food prices increased by 15,9 per cent. Together these two categories accounted for over half of the increase in CPIX. If food and energy were excluded. CPIX inflation would have measured 6,1 per cent. The stronger underlying inflation trend has been driven by price increases in a range of categories, notably clothing and footwear, water, household consumables and fuel and power. Year-on-year producer price inflation measured 12,4 per cent in April, compared to 11,9 per cent in March. Agricultural food output price increases declined to a year-on-year rate of 6 per cent in April, compared to a recent peak of 27 per cent in October 2007. Manufactured food price increases remained elevated at around recent highs of around 20 per cent. The most recent central forecast of the South African Reserve Bank (Bank) indicates a further deterioration in the inflation outlook when compared to the previous forecast. CPIX inflation is now expected to peak at around 12 per cent in the third quarter of 2008 and to return to within the inflation target range by the third quarter of 2010. The previous forecast was for a peak of 9,3 per cent in the first quarter. The deterioration in the forecast is a result of higher-than-expected inflation outcomes, a more depreciated exchange rate of the rand as well as further upward revisions in international oil price projections over the forecast period. As with the previous forecast, the possibility of an electricity price increase in excess of that granted to Eskom in December 2007 has not been factored into the central forecast. The forecasts made by private sector analysts have also deteriorated since the previous MPC meeting. According to the May 2008 Reuters consensus forecast. CPIX inflation is expected to peak at 11,3 per cent in the third quarter of 2008. Most respondents see inflation back within the target range during 2010. Break-even inflation rates, measured as the yield differential between conventional government bonds and inflation-linked bonds, also indicate a deterioration of inflation expectations and are now firmly above the upper end of the target range. Deteriorating inflation expectations are also evident in the survey conducted on behalf of the Bank by the Bureau for Economic Research (BER) at the University of Stellenbosch. During the second quarter of 2008. CPIX inflation expectations in respect of all forecast years increased further. CPIX inflation is now expected to average 8,9 per cent in 2008, up from 7,8 per cent in the previous survey. Some moderation is then forecast for 2009 and 2010 when CPIX inflation is expected to average 7,9 per cent and 7,2 per cent respectively. The main risks to the inflation outlook emanate from the possibility of further electricity price increases which will be announced next week by the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa); petrol and food price increases; and the exchange rate. There has been no respite from the acceleration in the international oil prices which has continued to surprise on the upside. In recent days North Sea Brent crude oil prices reached levels of almost US$140 per barrel, compared to US$107 per barrel at the time of the previous MPC meeting. Domestic petrol prices increased by 55 cents and 50 cents per litre in May and June respectively, bringing the cumulative increase in the petrol price since January 2008 to about R2,50 per litre. A further increase is possible in July. Food prices still pose an upside risk to the inflation outlook although some positive domestic developments may partially offset the global trends. Despite higher international maize prices, the domestic spot price of maize declined in response to the release of the domestic crop estimates. Nevertheless the depreciation of the rand exchange rate in recent weeks limited this decline. International wheat and rice prices are still high, but wheat prices have declined from their recent record levels. As noted earlier, agricultural producer price inflation declined significantly in April, but it is still too early to know if this trend will be sustained. The exchange rate of the rand against the US dollar is little changed from the levels prevailing at the time of the previous MPC meeting, when it was trading at around R7,90 to the US dollar. However, the rand has been relatively volatile and the related uncertainty poses a risk to the inflation outlook. In May the rand appreciated to around R7,50 to the US dollar, to a large extent as a result of speculation relating to a sizeable FDI transaction which did not subsequently materialise. The volatility of the rand is also explained by fluctuations of the US dollar against other major currencies, commodity price movements, domestic growth concerns and expectations regarding any further monetary policy actions in South Africa. The rand also remains vulnerable to possible negative perceptions related to the further widening of the current account deficit of the balance of payments in the first quarter of 2008. This development was a result of higher crude oil prices and strong demand for capital goods imports related to infrastructural investment projects. The volume of mining exports declined as a result of electricity load-shedding to the mines. To date the current account deficit, including that in the first quarter, has been adequately financed. Despite these upside risks, there are a number of offsetting effects which confirm the responsiveness of the economy to the less accommodative monetary policy stance of the Bank. Growth in household consumption expenditure has continued to decline in response to higher interest rates and slower growth in households' real disposable income. Real final consumption expenditure by households grew at an annualised rate of 3,3 per cent in the first quarter of 2008 compared to 3,8 per cent in the previous quarter, having peaked at around 9 per cent in the final quarter of 2006. The recent quarter-on-quarter moderation was due to an 8,1 per cent contraction in spending on durable goods. The total number of new vehicles sold in May 2008 was 24,6 per cent lower than in May 2007. Both commercial and passenger vehicle sales registered significant declines. Retail sales growth has also continued to moderate. On a year-on-year basis, real retail sales declined by 1,7 per cent in March, while growth in the first quarter of 2008 compared with the same quarter in 2007 measured 0,6 per cent. Reflecting these expenditure trends, growth in credit extension to the private sector also showed some signs of moderation, although still at relatively high levels. Twelve-month growth in banks' total loans and advances extended to the private sector declined to 21,5 per cent in April 2008, compared to 23,6 per cent in March. Year-on-year growth in mortgage advances declined to 21,9 per cent in April, while growth over the same period in instalment sale credit and leasing finance declined to 11,8 per cent, reflecting the downward trend in motor vehicle and other durable goods consumption. Household debt as a ratio of disposable income increased to 78,2 per cent from 77,6 per cent, while the ratio of debt service cost to disposable income increased from 10,9 per cent to 11,3 per cent. The economy has shown signs of slowing down following a number of years of growth above the estimated potential growth rate. In the first quarter of 2008, growth in real gross domestic product was an annualised rate of 2,1 per cent compared to 5,3 per cent in the previous quarter. Despite a strong performance by the agricultural sub-sector, the primary sector contracted by 13,0 per cent, mainly as a result of electricity supply constraints. The slowdown was fairly broad-based, with growth in the secondary sector declining to one per cent. The utilisation of production capacity in manufacturing declined in the first quarter of 2008 while the Investec/BER Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) shows that the manufacturing sector continues to face low growth in new sales orders and strong pressure on input costs, despite an improvement in manufacturing output growth in April. Overall business confidence, as measured by the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index declined further in the second quarter of 2008. Gross fixed capital formation, however, has remained relatively robust. The all-share index on JSE Limited reached new highs in recent weeks but has moderated since then. However, while the all-share index has increased by about 6 per cent since the beginning of 2008, this has been due primarily to the resources sector which has increased by about 26 per cent as a result of high commodity prices. The industrial index is almost unchanged while the financial index has declined by over 23 per cent over the same period. There is evidence that house prices are beginning to decline. According to the Absa house price index, house prices in the middle segment of the market have been declining marginally in nominal terms on a month-on-month basis since February 2008. The Standard Bank index shows that the median house price declined by 13,3 per cent in May on a year-on-year basis. The outlook for the global economy remains uncertain although there is some tentative evidence that the worst of the banking and credit crisis may be over. Global growth is also expected to remain subdued, but there is uncertainty regarding the extent and duration of the slowdown. Many countries are experiencing increasing inflationary pressures and are facing the challenge of dealing with higher inflation and slowing growth. As the inflation pressures have intensified, monetary policy is becoming more focused on this threat, and an increasing number of central banks have adopted a tighter monetary policy stance. In the light of the further deterioration in the inflation outlook, but mindful that the economy is responding to a less accommodative monetary policy stance, the Monetary Policy Committee has decided that at this stage further tightening of monetary policy is warranted. Accordingly the repurchase rate will be increased by 50 basis points to 12 per cent per annum with effect from 13 June 2008. The MPC remains committed to bringing inflation back to within the target range over a reasonable time period."
Peru,2008-06-15,"- MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JUNE 2008 BCRP RAISES REFERENCE INTEREST RATE FROM 5.50% TO 5.75% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to raise the monetary policy reference interest rate from 5.5 to 5.75 percent. Together with the series of monetary adjustments implemented so far this year, this increase in the reference interest rate is aimed at preventing that the rises observed in the international prices of food and fuels will translate into higher inflation expectations in a context of a high pace of growth of both public and private expenditure. In this way, inflation is expected to gradually return to the target range in a context of high and sustained economic growth. The Board will continue to oversee the evolution of inflation and its determinants, particularly in terms of indicators of pressures on demand and inflation expectations. The Board also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on the following active and passive operations between the BCRP and the financial system: Direct repo and rediscount operations: 6.5 percent. Overnight deposits: 5 percent. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 6.5 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for July on its session of July 10."
Turkiye,2008-06-16,"The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) has decided to increase the policy rates as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate from 15.75 percent to 16.25 percent, and lending rate from 19.75 percent to 20.25 percent, b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m. from 11.75 percent to 12.25 percent, lending rate from 22.75 percent to 23.25 percent, c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions from 18.75 percent to 19.25 percent. Recent readings on the supply and demand conditions are largely in line with the predictions of the April Inflation Report. Difficulties in international credit markets continue to restrain the domestic demand, while external demand displays a relatively strong course. Overall, aggregate demand conditions will support disinflation. The Committee notes that recently there have been favorable developments in unprocessed food prices, while oil prices have followed a significantly higher course than the prices assumed in the baseline scenario in the April Inflation Report. Consequently, inflation is expected to decelerate starting from the last quarter of the year, ending 2009 close to the 7.5 percent inflation target. Adverse impacts of the supply side shocks on the economy will be more limited should the economic agents align their expectations for the next three years with the target rates of 7,5 percent, 6.5 percent and 5.5 percent, respectively. Ongoing uncertainties and supply side shocks continue to pose risks on inflation. The Central Bank will consider a further measured rate hike when needed, so as to prevent the potential second-round effects of such risk factors. The extent and timing of a possible future rate hike will depend on developments in global markets, external demand, fiscal policy implementation, and other factors affecting the medium term inflation outlook. It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight working days."
Hungary,2008-06-23,"1 At its meeting on 23 June 2008, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and left the central bank base rate unchanged at 8.50%. 2 The Council maintains its view that Hungarian economic growth continues to be subdued and inflation has been falling slowly over recently. The negative output gap may help to reduce inflation on the horizon relevant for monetary policy, while inflation expectations potentially becoming stuck at a high level, as well as the global rises in food, commodity and energy prices are contributing to upside risks to inflation. Faced with the deteriorating outlook for inflation, the Monetary Council decided to tighten policy at its previous three policy meetings. The latest information has confirmed that there continue to be risks to meeting the inflation target. But, also taking into account the tightening in monetary conditions, the latest data have not altered the central inflation projection in the May issue of the Quarterly Report on Inflation. Based on recent private sector wage developments, it is too early to draw a firm conclusion about the disciplinary effect of the fall in demand.The Council remains clearly committed to achieving the 3 per cent inflation target. It is making efforts to prevent a rise in longer-term inflation expectations and believes that tight monetary policy should be maintained to reach this goal. However, the Council will stand ready to tighten policy further, if meeting the target warrants it."
Israel,2008-06-23,"23.6.2008</td> The Bank of Israel raises the interest rate for July 2008 by 25 basis points to 3.75 percent The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for July will rise by 25 basis points, to 3.75 percent. This step is taken in the context ofthe policy of maintaining price stability, in accordance with the inflation target of 1-3 percent a year. Background conditions Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.7 percent in May, in line with the forecasts, but higher than the upper limit of the seasonal path consistent with meeting the inflation target. In the last twelve months the CPI has risen by 5.4 percent, and the CPI excluding the energy, food, and fruit and vegetables components, by 2.6 percent. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Israeli forecasters expect, on average, that inflation over the next twelve months will be 3.1 percent, above the upper limit of the target range. They also expect, on average,that the CPI will rise by 0.4 percent in each of June and July. The forecasters expect, on average, that the Bank of Israel interest rate for July will rise by 0.3 percentage points. Inflation expectations for the next twelve months calculated from the capital market currently stand at 3 percent, the upper limit of the target range. Interest rate expectations derived fromthe capital markets indicate a cumulative rise of one percentage point over the next twelve months. The Bank of Israel's econometric models indicate that an increase in the interest rate is required in order to return inflation to the target range within the next twelve months. Real economic activity: Recently published data indicate that economic growth is continuing, but at a slower rate than previously. Followingthe high rate of growth in the first quarter of 2008, the Bank's forecast of growth in 2008 was adjusted upwards to 4.2 percent. This forecast takes into account a significantly slower rate of growth as the year progresses, compared with that in the first quarter. The forecast of growth in 2009 was revised downwards to 3.1 percent, on the basis of the assessment that the slowdown in growth would start later than originally expected. The composite state-of-the-economy index for May was unchanged, the result of arise in the index of manufacturing production that was offset by the declines in the indices of foreign trade, goods imports and exports, services exports, and trade and services revenue. The labor market and wages: The data in the Manpower Survey for 2008:Q 1 are in line with those of the National Accounts, indicating continued growth in that quarter. At the same time, the unemployment rate continuedto fall, and reached 6.3 percent, compared with 6.7 percent in the previous quarter. The nominal wage rose by 4.7 percent in 2008:Q 1, year on year. The rise in the public sector wage was partly due to the payment of various one-time wage components following the new wage agreement. Budget policy: Budget data since the beginning of the year suggest a deficit path that will result in a deficit of about one percent of GDP,below the ceiling of 1.6 percent of GDP. Tax revenues in January-May, after deducting the effects of a change in the law and non-recurring receipts, rose in real terms by 2.7 percent, year on year. The foreign exchange market: In the period between 25 May (the date of the previous interest rate discussion) and 22 June, the shekel weakened against the dollar by 0.6 percent and strengthened against the euro by 0.5 percent, with an increase in the volatility of the shekel/dollar exchange rate. In the last month the average daily forex trading volume was $2.2 billion. The capital and money markets: From 25 May (the date of the previous interest rate discussion) to 22 June, the Tel Aviv 100 share price index rose by 1.4 percent, in contrast to the reductions in most leading share indices abroad. Yields on 10-year unindexed government remained unchanged at 6 percent. As a result of an increase of between 0.3 percentage points and 0.6 percentage points in yields on US government bonds, the yield gap between the above Israeli bonds and comparable US government bonds declined from 2.1 percentage points prior to the previous interest rate decision to 1.9 percentage points. Similar to the development in the emerging markets. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, went up this month from 0.52 percent before the last interest rate decision to 0.7 percent. The world economy: During the last month, following the continuedsharp rise in global energy prices, concerns over inflation increased. Meanwhile, it appears that the global economic slowdown may be less severe than had been expected hitherto. Higher than expected growth figures for the first quarter were published in Japan. Europe, and the emerging markets. Data on US growth were also revised upwards. Current data for the second quarter show a mixed picture, and the general assessment is that the probabilityof a US recession has declined. Forecasts of the Fed interest rate reversed recently, and currently the expectation is that the next change will be upward. The markets reflect expectations that the ECB will raise the interest rate by half a percentage point by the end of the year, and that the Bankof Japan will leave its rate unchanged. The financial markets, on average,are showing signs of greater calm. However, the possibility of disappointing news from the financial sector together with concern over the effect of a surge in global inflation constitute elements of uncertainty regarding developments in the financial markets. The main considerations behind the decision This current increase in the interest rate is required in light of the inflation environment that continues to be above the price stability target. Inflation over the previous twelve months was 5.4 percent, compared with the target range of 1-3 percent a year. One-year-forward inflation expectations derived from the capital market and the average of Israeli forecasters' twelve-month inflation predictions are around the upper limit of the target range. The increase in the interest rate has an important task to fulfil in returning inflation to the target, because although most of the inflation in Israel is caused by the rise in global prices, it seems that some of the price rises in the last few months have been due to the high level of domestic demand. There are several reasons for the decision to raise the interest rate by 25 basis points: the high level of uncertainty regarding the future developments of energy and food prices abroad; the expected moderating influence on prices of the slower rate of growth predicted for the remainder of 2008 and for 2009; and the curb on prices due to the strengthening of the shekel, despite the weakening of the pass-through between them. This increase in the interest rate is required to return inflation to the price stability target range of 1-3 percent inflation a year, andthereby to provide the basis that is essential to ensure that growth is sustained. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor economic developments worldwide closely, and will raise the interest rate as necessary to achieve pricestability. Subject to this, the Bank will continue to support the attainment of a range of objectives of macroeconomic policy, in particular the encouragement of employment and growth. In addition, the Bank will continue to support the stability of the financial system. 23.6.2008</td> The Bank of Israel raises the interest rate for July 2008 by 25 basis points to 3.75 percent.

Georgia,2008-06-25,"Tbilisi. 25 June The Decision of the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Georgia on June 25, 2008 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met today and decided to leave its main policy rate, the one-week Certificate of Deposit (CD) rate, unchanged at 12 percent. According to the Statistics Department of the Ministry of Economic Development, the annual inflation rate for the month of May decreased as expected and stood at 11.2 percent. Although the current rate of inflation in Georgia is above the comfort zone, it is lower than the inflation rates in several neighboring countries. For reference, the annual rate of inflation for the month of May was 15.1 percent in Russia, 31.1 percent in Ukraine, 25.7 percent in Azerbaijan, 9.8 percent in Armenia, 10.7 percent in Turkey, 2.8 percent in the Eurozone, 17.9 percent in Latvia, 12.0 percent in Lithuania, 11.3 percent in Estonia, 13.6 percent in Bulgaria, 27.9 percent in Kirgizstan and 19.5 in Kazakhstan. The relatively low level of inflation in Georgia was the result of a tighter monetary policy stance and a more flexible exchange rate policy. As evidenced by the domestic foreign exchange market, the high rates of foreign capital inflows still remain noteworthy. While the growth rate of the reserve money has decreased slightly along with the broad money aggregates, which aided in the reduction of the money multiplier compared to recent months, the growth rates of the abovementioned indicators still remain above preferred levels. The high rate of lending to the private sector relative to growth in loanable funds resulted in a liquidity shortage in the banking system during the second half of May. The liquidity shortage was mitigated partially through the use of NBG's standing facilities. In response to the liquidity shortage, commercial banks sharply increased interest rates. The increase in interest rates has not yet influenced, or caused a decline in the growth of private sector lending. The upcoming monetary policy decisions will, among other things, depend on the dynamics of the abovementioned indicator. Following the last monetary policy committee meeting, the existing risks to inflation have on balance, remained the unchanged. Assuming that significant increases in administrative prices will not be observed and commodity prices will be in line with the existing forecasts, the high interest rates will insure that an inflation rate close to 8 percent is achieved by the end of the year. 1 The reproduction without citing the source is not allowed. Tbilisi. 25 June The NBG will closely monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets with the objective of achieving the forecast inflation rate and will in due course act accordingly. In order to increase the transparency and predictability of monetary policy, the MPC decided to provide commercial banks with a six-month CD issue calendar in advance, instead of the existing three-month calendar. The 2008 schedule of the MPC meetings is posted on the website of the NBG. The next meeting will take place on July 23, 2008. 2 The reproduction without citing the source is not allowed."
Poland,2008-06-25,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 25 June 2008 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 24-25 June 2008 The Council decided to increase the NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage points to the level: (cid:131) reference rate 6.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate 7.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate 4.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate 6.25% on an annual basis. The Polish economy is still in the period of strong growth encompassing all its sectors. However, data released recently indicate that the economic growth is gradually slowing down, which is consistent with previous expectations. At the same time, information on labour market developments points to a sustained high growth of employment and wages and to an unfavourable relation between wage and labour productivity growth. The latest information on the US economy signal that the slowdown of activity in this economy may be less deep than previously expected, though it may last longer. Uncertainty also persists as to the scale of the decrease of euro-area economic growth and of its impact on the Polish economy. In the past few months oil prices in the world markets have strongly increased. At the same time, many countries have recorded a rise in both the current and the forecast inflation. In May the annual growth of consumer prices in Poland rose to 4.4%, remaining above the NBP's inflation target of 2.5% and also above the upper limit for deviations from the target set at 3.5%. The increase in inflation primarily resulted from a strong rise in administered prices (prices of gas and electricity) and from food and fuel price growth. The Council maintains its assessment that in the coming months inflation will remain above the upper limit for deviations from the inflation target, which, to a large extent, will be driven by increases of administered prices and high annual growth of food and fuel prices. The Council got acquainted with the projection of inflation and GDP based on the new version of the ECMOD model (NECMOD), which has been prepared by the Economic Institute of the NBP. The projection is one of the inputs into the Council's decision-making on the NBP interest rates. The annual growth of consumer prices forecast in the June projection is higher than expected in the February projection till the end of 2009, while in 2010 it is lower than forecast in the February projection. Under constant interest rates, there is a 50-percent probability that projected inflation will remain within the range of 3.8-4.7% in 2008 (compared to 3.6-4.7% in the February projection), 2.5-5.8% in 2009 (compared to 2.6-4.9%) and 0.1-5.7% in 2010 (compared to 2.1- 4.8%). According to the June NECMOD-based projection, the annual GDP growth will remain, with a 50-percent probability, within the range of 4.3-5.5% in 2008 (compared to 4.4-5.8% in the February projection), 3.4-6.2% in 2009 (compared to 3.5-6.1%) and 3.8-6.8% in 2010 (compared to 3.6-6.9%). ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51. In the Council's assessment in the coming quarters the wage pressure and, consequently, the inflationary pressure will probably persist despite the expected slowdown in the economic growth. Increased inflation will, to a large extent, result from the growth of administered prices and also from the food and fuel price growth observed in the world economy and affecting the Polish market. Persistently increased inflation creates a risk of inflation expectations remaining at an elevated level and, consequently, feeds the risk of the so-called second-round effects. Moreover, the rise in prices of energy and food may be gradually passing through to other prices, particularly to prices of some services. In the medium term inflationary pressure may be curbed by still good financial results of enterprises and continuously high investment growth conducive to productivity growth. Inflationary pressure may also be constrained by the slowdown in the global economy and, consequently, also in the Polish economy. The inflationary pressure may additionally be eased by globalisation, though its overall impact will probably be weaker than before. The previous increases of the NBP's interest rates and the zloty appreciation observed over the past few quarters will also be conducive to lowering inflation. Considering the above factors and taking into consideration the results of the June inflation projection, striving to bring inflation down to the inflation target in the medium term, the Council decided to raise the NBP's interest rates. The Council will be closely monitoring the growth and structure of domestic demand, the relation between wage and labour productivity growth in the enterprise sector and wage growth in the public finance sector, the degree of the expansionary fiscal policy stance, zloty exchange rate, developments of the current account balance and the impact of globalisation on the economy and on food prices. The Council will also analyse changes in the external factors affecting the Polish economy and their impact on the outlook for economic growth and inflation in Poland. The Council has adopted the June 2008 Inflation Report."
United States,2008-06-25,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 2 percent. Recent information indicates that overall economic activity continues to expand, partly reflecting some firming in household spending. However, labor markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress. Tight credit conditions, the ongoing housing contraction, and the rise in energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters. The Committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year. However, in light of the continued increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities and the elevated state of some indicators of inflation expectations, uncertainty about the inflation outlook remains high. The substantial easing of monetary policy to date, combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity, should help to promote moderate growth over time. Although downside risks to growth remain, they appear to have diminished somewhat, and the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations have increased. The Committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; Timothy F Geithner. Vice Chairman; Donald L Kohn; Randall S Kroszner; Frederic S Mishkin; Sandra Pianalto; Charles I Plosser; Gary H Stern; and Kevin M Warsh. Voting against was Richard W Fisher, who preferred an increase in the target for the federal funds rate at this meeting."
Egypt,2008-06-26,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release June 26, 2008 The Central Bank of Egypt decided to raise its overnight deposit by 50 bps to 105 percent per annu. The discount rate was also raised by 100 bps to 10 percent per annu. In its meeting held on June 26, 2008, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise the overnight deposit and lending rates by 50 bps to 105 percent and 125 percent, respectivel. The headline CPI inflation maintained its upward trend escalating to 197% in May as domestic food inflation accelerated sharply to 27% and intensified further by the broad- based regulated price adjustment. The spillover to non-food inflation continued to be stron. Concurrently there were additional price pressures from the ongoing strong economic growt. Despite the recent slight moderation in international food inflation, there are concerns relating to grain crops in light of adverse weather conditions which might prolong the international food price shoc. Moreover the impact of the second-round effects on inflation remains to unfold over the coming month. Given the clear evidence of underlying inflationary pressures, the MPC judges that the balance of risks to the inflation outlook continues to be on the upside and today's decision is aimed at containing inflation expectation. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments, especially the factors underlying inflation, and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter.

Romania,2008-06-26,"In its meeting of June 26, 2008, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided the following:. The NBR Board will vigilantly monitor developments in macroeconomic indicators, standing ready to use the central bank's entire array of instruments to counteract inflationary pressures and to ensure the resumption of disinflation at a pace consistent with the aim of achieving the announced medium-term inflation targets in a sustainable manner. The annual inflation rate eased to 8.46 percent in May 2008 from 8.62 percent in the previous month, but continued to stay significantly above the upper limit of the variation band around the target for this year. Moreover, the adjusted CORE2 annual inflation rate - calculated by excluding the impact of administered and volatile prices (vegetables, fruit, eggs and fuel) as well as the effect of vice tax - climbed further to an annual 7.6 percent in May from 7.1 percent in the previous month. The developments in core inflation reveal both the persistent excess demand and the ongoing effects of supply-side shocks. The analysis of the most recent statistical data illustrates that domestic demand has been the main driver of economic growth in 2008 Q1 as well. Both investment and final household consumption sped up, the latter being driven by significant rises in incomes and the persistently rapid increase of credit to the private sector, especially that of foreign currency-denominated loans. Increased government spending has additionally boosted aggregate demand. These developments are reflected in the persistence of the external deficit at levels difficult to sustain in the long term, as well as in still high inflation rates. Wage growth stayed above labour productivity dynamics, fuelling inflationary pressures as well as the risk of deteriorating external competitiveness. The annual rise of credit to the private sector has edged down marginally, but its level remains excessively high, especially in what concerns foreign currency lending to households. Household indebtedness has reached levels that require close monitoring. The short-term inflation outlook has worsened in the context of forthcoming increases in some administered prices (natural gas and electricity) and in tobacco excise duties. The need to effectively anchor inflation expectations by avoiding their additional worsening against the background of global market tensions requires the continuation of monetary policy restrictiveness with an appropriate dosage of its instruments, while also calling for stronger support from other components of the economic policy mix. In light of available data, the NBR Board has decided to raise the monetary policy rate to 10.0 percent per annum from 9.75 percent. In this context, starting from June 27, 2008 the interest rate on the NBR deposit facility is raised to an annual 6.0 percent from 5.75 percent while the rate on its lending facility (Lombard rate) will stand at an annual 14.0 percent versus 13.75 percent previously. Also, the penalty rate for deficits of leu-denominated minimum required reserves will rise to an annual 21.0 percent from 20.5 percent starting with the July 24-August 23, 2008 maintenance period. The NBR Board has also decided to continue to pursue a firm management of money market liquidity via open-market operations and to leave unchanged the existing minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board is restating that, apart from tighter monetary policy, the implementation of a restrictive economic policy mix, focusing on the fiscal and income components, and stepped-up structural reforms are essential to ensure the resumption of a durable downward trend in inflation, thus contributing to the achievement of sustainable economic growth in the longer term. The next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy is scheduled for July 31, 2008, when a new quarterly Inflation Report is to be examined."
Euroarea,2008-07-03,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to today's press conference. Let me report on the outcome of our meeting, which was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup. Prime Minister Juncker, and Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today's meeting to increase the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. This decision was taken to prevent broadly based second-round effects and to counteract the increasing upside risks to price stability over the medium term. HICP inflation rates have continued to rise significantly since the autumn of last year. They are expected to remain well above the level consistent with price stability for a more protracted period than previously thought. Moreover, continued very vigorous money and credit growth and the absence thus far of significant constraints on bank loan supply in a context of ongoing financial market tensions confirm our assessment of upside risks to price stability over the medium term. At the same time, while the latest data confirm the expected weakening of real GDP growth in mid-2008 after exceptionally strong growth in the first quarter, the economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound. Against this background and in full accordance with our mandate, we emphasise that maintaining price stability in the medium term is our primary objective and that it is our strong determination to keep medium and long-term inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with price stability. This will preserve purchasing power in the medium term and continue to support sustainable growth and employment in the euro area. On the basis of our current assessment, the monetary policy stance following today's decision will contribute to achieving our objective. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Information that has become available since the June press conference confirms our previous expectation of rather weak real GDP growth in the second quarter of 2008, in part as a technical counter-reaction to the strong quarter-on-quarter increase of 0.8% in the first quarter. As we have stressed previously, the quarterly growth rates for the first half of this year have been subject to strong temporary and compensatory factors, notably weather-related effects on the profile of construction activity. Therefore, in order to assess the underlying momentum of euro area economic activity and to avoid being misguided by highly volatile quarterly outturns, it is necessary to evaluate the first two quarters of 2008 together. Interpreted on this basis, the information available remains broadly in line with our expectation of moderate ongoing growth. Looking ahead, both domestic and foreign demand are expected to support real GDP growth in the euro area in 2008, albeit to a lesser extent than during 2007. While moderating, growth in the world economy is expected to remain resilient, benefiting in particular from continued robust growth in emerging economies. As regards domestic developments, the fundamentals of the euro area economy remain sound and the euro area does not suffer from major imbalances. In this context, investment growth in the euro area should continue to support economic activity, as rates of capacity utilisation remain elevated and profitability in the non-financial corporate sector has been sustained. Moreover, employment rates and labour force participation have increased significantly in recent years, and unemployment rates have fallen to levels not seen for 25 years. However, these developments, which support household disposable income and consumption, are unlikely to fully compensate the loss of purchasing power caused by higher energy and food prices. In the view of the Governing Council, the uncertainty surrounding this outlook for economic activity remains high, owing not least to the very high levels of commodity prices, and downside risks prevail. In particular, risks stem from the dampening impact on consumption and investment of further unanticipated increases in energy and food prices. Moreover, downside risks continue to relate to the potential for the ongoing financial market tensions to affect the real economy more adversely than anticipated. Concerns about the emergence of protectionist pressures and the possibility of disorderly developments owing to global imbalances also imply downside risks to the outlook for economic activity. With regard to price developments, annual HICP inflation has remained well above the level consistent with price stability since last autumn, reaching 3.7% in May 2008 and  according to Eurostat's flash estimate  4.0% in June. This worrying level of inflation rates results largely from sharp increases in energy and food prices at the global level in recent months. Looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for these commodities, the annual HICP inflation rate is likely to remain well above 2% for quite some time, moderating only gradually in 2009. We are thus currently experiencing a protracted period of high annual rates of inflation, which is likely to be more persistent than anticipated some months ago. Risks to price stability at the policy-relevant medium-term horizon remain clearly on the upside and have increased further over the past few months. These risks include notably the possibility of further increases in energy and food prices. There is also a very strong concern that price and wage-setting behaviour could add to inflationary pressures via broadly based second-round effects. The Governing Council is monitoring price-setting behaviour and wage negotiations in the euro area with particular attention. Furthermore, there are potential upside risks from unanticipated rises in indirect taxes and administered prices. Against this background, it is imperative to ensure that medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels in line with price stability. The shift in relative prices and the related transfer of income from commodity-importing countries to commodity-exporting countries have to be accepted. They require a change in the behaviour of companies and households. Therefore, broadly based second-round effects stemming from the impact of higher energy and food prices on price and wage-setting behaviour must be avoided. All parties concerned, in both the private and the public sector, must meet their responsibilities in this regard. In this context, the Governing Council is concerned about the existence of schemes in which nominal wages are indexed to consumer prices. Such schemes involve the risk of upward shocks in inflation leading to a wage-price spiral, which would be detrimental to employment and competitiveness in the countries concerned. The Governing Council therefore calls for such schemes to be avoided. The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. In line with our monetary policy strategy, we take the view that the sustained underlying strength of monetary and credit expansion in the euro area over the past few years has created upside risks to price stability. Over recent quarters, these risks appear to have become manifest as inflation has trended upwards. Against this background, the continued strength of monetary dynamics represents an important signal of the risks to price stability over the medium term that we have been addressing through our actions since end-2005, including today's move. More specifically, annual M3 growth has remained very vigorous in recent months, supported by the continued strong growth of MFI loans to the private sector. Although annual M3 growth of still above 10% overstates the underlying pace of monetary expansion, owing to the impact of the flat yield curve and other temporary factors, nonetheless, even after taking such effects into account, a broad-based assessment of the latest data confirms that the underlying rate of money and credit growth remains strong. The current structure of yields has triggered substitution both within and into the broad monetary aggregate M3, leading to a pronounced decline in annual M1 growth and very rapid increases in time deposits. At the same time, higher short-term interest rates have served to moderate the growth of household borrowing, although cooling housing markets in several parts of the euro area have also played a substantial role in this regard. However, the growth of bank loans to non-financial corporations has remained very robust despite the rises in short-term rates. While some moderation can be expected in the future in the light of tightening financing conditions and more moderate economic growth, bank borrowing by euro area non-financial corporations grew at an annual rate of 14.2% in May 2008, and the flow of loans in recent months has been strong. Not least in the face of the ongoing tensions in financial markets, the monetary analysis helps to support the necessary medium-term orientation of monetary policy by focusing attention on the upside risks to price stability prevailing at medium to longer horizons. Moreover, a thorough assessment of the money and credit data has provided an important insight into bank behaviour and financing conditions. In particular, the strength, maturity and sectoral composition of bank borrowing suggest that, at the level of the euro area as a whole, the availability of bank credit has, as yet, not been significantly affected by the tensions. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis clearly confirms the assessment of increasing upside risks to price stability over the medium term, in a context of very vigorous money and credit growth and the absence thus far of significant constraints on bank loan supply. At the same time, the economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound, and incoming macroeconomic data continue to point to moderate ongoing real GDP growth when the high volatility of growth rates in the first half of this year is taken properly into account. Against this background and in full accordance with our mandate, it is imperative that we prevent broadly based second-round effects and counteract the increasing risks to price stability. We emphasise that maintaining price stability in the medium term is our primary objective and that it is our strong determination to keep medium and long-term inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with price stability, thereby preserving purchasing power in the medium term and supporting sustainable growth and employment in the euro area. On the basis of our current assessment, the monetary policy stance following today's decision will contribute to achieving our objective. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Regarding fiscal policy, budgetary consolidation targets are at risk in a number of euro area countries. Moreover, the risk of countries' budget deficits coming close to or even exceeding the 3% of GDP reference value has increased. The Governing Council therefore reiterates its strong support for a rigorous implementation of euro area governments' 2008 budgets and a prudent design of fiscal policy plans for 2009, in line with the agreement in the Eurogroup in May 2008. Achieving and maintaining sound structural fiscal positions is essential to ensure the sustainability of public finances as well as to create scope for the free working of automatic stabilisers in all euro area countries and thereby contribute to the smoothing of cyclical fluctuations. As regards structural reforms, we reiterate our full support for all efforts to enhance competition, increase productivity and foster market flexibility. In view of the marked increase in international food commodity prices, removing impediments to competition at the various stages of the food supply chain in the retail and distribution sectors would benefit European consumers through lower prices. As regards labour markets, let me direct your attention to the ECB's 2008 Structural Issues Report, which was recently submitted to the European Parliament. It emphasises the generally favourable labour market developments in the euro area over the last decade but equally points out the urgent need to counter the ageing-related reduction in the labour force, in particular by increasing employment in all groups of society, by making labour markets more flexible and by enhancing investment in education and training."
Chile,2008-07-10,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 10 July 2008 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 50 basis points, to 7.25% (annual). Given the deteriorated inflationary outlook, this increase in the monetary policy rate is necessary to ensure convergence of inflation toward 3% over the policy horizon. Internationally, output prospects for developed economies remain weak and world financial markets are still under stress. The oil price has remained high, while the prices of most commodities have increased again. Inflationary pressures have intensified around the world. Domestically, available information on second-quarter economic activity is consistent with growth forecasts for the year contained in the last Monetary Policy Report. Domestic demand continues to grow at a fast pace, particularly its imported component, and unemployment has remained stable. June's inflation significantly exceeded forecasts, due to new price hikes for energy and foodstuffs. Core inflation measures and various indicators for inflation expectations have risen, suggesting greater than foreseen inflationary propagation. Wage dynamics remain in line with historical patterns. The Board reaffirms its commitment to conduct monetary policy so as to reduce the current high inflation rates to 3% over the policy horizon. This is essential to align inflationary dynamics with the price stability objective. The future path of the monetary policy rate will depend on incoming information and its implications on projected inflation, although, in the most likely scenario, further adjustments will be necessary in order to ensure convergence of inflation to the target. * The Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2008-07-10,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (5.00%) for the intermeeting period. (The following is an English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (5.00%) for the intermeeting period. The pace of domestic economic growth has slackened. While exports continue to post robust growth, domestic demand has weakened. There still remains a high degree of uncertainty surrounding future economic developments, largely due to the run- up in international oil prices, the international financial market unrest and the US economic slowdown. Consumer price inflation has picked up its pace, mainly influenced by high oil prices, and inflation seems likely to remain significantly high for quite some time. The upward trend of real estate prices has been blunted. Liquidity is still ample in the financial markets and financial institutions' lending continues to show a steady increase. Meanwhile, long-term market interest rates have shown a sharp rise largely prompted by concerns about rising inflation."
Peru,2008-07-15,"- MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JULY 2008 BCRP RAISES REFERENCE INTEREST RATE FROM 5.75% TO 6.0% AND RAISES RESERVE REQUIREMENTS The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to raise the monetary policy reference interest rate from 5.75 to 6.0 percent. Together with the series of monetary adjustments implemented so far this year, this increase in the reference interest rate is aimed at preventing that the rises observed in the international prices of food and fuels will translate into higher inflation expectations in a context of a high pace of growth of both public and private expenditure. The Board also approved to raise banks' reserve requirements in domestic currency and in foreign currency as from August. These measures are in line with the rises of reserve requirements implemented as from February. April, and May, as well as with having raised the reference interest rate from 4.5 to 6.0 percent between July 2007 and July 2008. Reserve requirement measures in force as from August include the following: Minimum reserve requirements, whose application extends to all obligations in domestic and foreign currency, are raised from 8.5 to 9.0 percent. Marginal reserve requirements for obligations in foreign currency are raised from 45 to 49 percent. The Board will continue to oversee the evolution of inflation and its determinants, particularly in terms of indicators of demand pressures and expectations of inflation. The Board also reiterates that any required adjustments will be implemented in order to ensure inflation's gradual convergence to the target range in a context of sustained economic growth. The Board also approved the following annual interest rates on active and passive operations between the BCRP and the financial system: Direct repo and rediscount operations: 6.75 percent. Overnight deposits: 5.25 percent. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 6.75 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for August on its session of August 7."
Philippines,2008-07-16,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to increase by 50 basis points the BSP's key policy interest rates to 5.75 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 7.75 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs, and SDAs were also raised accordingly. Inflation control is the foremost priority of the BSP, in accordance with its mandate. The Monetary Board, in its assessment of price conditions, noted that concurrent and interrelated shocks to the economy—such as the persistent surge in oil prices and spikes in commodity prices—have contributed to elevated inflation readings. Second-round effects have set in, as evident in the rise in core inflation. The BSP's baseline forecasts show the risk of inflation exceeding the inflation targets for 2008 and 2009. Price pressures have increased even as they are projected to ease starting late 2008. For this reason, authorities believe that more decisive monetary action is necessary. Sustained high inflation can unseat inflation expectations and potentially create a repeating cycle of lingering inflation and wage pressures that could prove costly to the economy. By responding promptly to inflation risks, the BSP intends to reduce the risks to inflation expectations and the long-term cost to output growth from prolonged high inflation. Authorities believe that the series of policy adjustments will help to steer inflation towards its desired path for the medium term. The Monetary Board is prepared to take all necessary actions to address the threat of high inflation and promote price stability."
Thailand,2008-07-16,"No 27 /2008 Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 16 July 2008 Ms. Duangmanee Vongpradhip. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand, announces that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance. The main issues discussed were as follows. During the first two months of 2008 Q2, the Thai economy continued to expand from both domestic spending and exports, resulting in high capacity utilization and a low unemployment rate. However there were indications that the rise in the cost of production and the acceleration in inflation have begun to affect business confidence, private consumption and investment spending, as well as price competitiveness of the export sector. Meanwhile increasing uncertainty in global economic conditions would require close monitoring by the MPC. Risks to inflation increased markedly in the previous quarter as a result of the continued rise in oil and raw food prices, as well as the rapid acceleration in pass-through from producer prices to the prices of other goods, which was facilitated by continued economic expansion. In addition, indicators of inflation expectations have risen, making it likely that inflation would remain elevated for a while. The MPC deemed that the risks to inflation have risen markedly, which would affect private sector confidence, make it increasingly difficult to ensure economic stability going forward, and impact potential growth as well as the competitiveness of the Thai economy in the long run. The MPC therefore decided to raise the policy interest rate by 025 per cent, from 325 per cent to 350 per cent per annum, effective immediately. The MPC would closely monitor the outlook for inflation and economic growth going forward and stands ready to adjust the monetary policy stance should inflationary risks continue to remain elevated."
Turkiye,2008-07-17,"The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) has decided to adjust the policy rates as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate is increased from 16.25 percent to 16.75 percent, while lending rate is left unchanged at 20.25 percent, b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m. is increased from 12.25 percent to 12.75 percent, while lending rate is left unchanged at 23.25, c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions is left unchanged at 19.25. Recent readings on the supply and demand conditions are largely in line with the predictions of the April Inflation Report. Difficulties in international credit markets continue to restrain the domestic demand, while external demand displays a relatively strong course. Overall, aggregate demand conditions support disinflation. The Committee also finds it worthwhile to mention that the hikes in electricity rates and the last year's low base will lead to a significant but temporary rise in annual inflation in July. The Committee notes that recently there have been favorable developments in unprocessed food prices, while oil prices have followed a significantly higher course than the prices assumed in the baseline scenario in the April Inflation Report. Consequently, inflation is expected to stay at elevated levels for a short period before gradually moderating towards the 7.5 percent target by the end of 2009. Adverse impacts of the supply side shocks on the economy will be more limited should the economic agents align their expectations for the next three years with the target rates of 7.5 percent, 6.5 percent and 5.5 percent, respectively. Given the monetary tightening since May, the Committee believes that the current level of the policy rate is supportive of disinflation. Yet, ongoing uncertainties and supply side shocks continue to pose risks on inflation. The Central Bank will consider a further measured rate hike when needed, so as to prevent the potential second-round effects of such risk factors. The timing of a possible future rate hike will depend on developments in global markets, external demand, fiscal policy implementation, and other factors affecting the medium term inflation outlook. Considering the changing liquidity conditions, the Committee has also decided to reduce the margin between the borrowing and the lending rates by 50 basis points. It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight working days."
Hungary,2008-07-21,"1 At its meeting on 21 July 2008, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and left the central bank base rate unchanged at 8.50%. 2 The Council maintains its view that Hungarian economic growth has remained subdued and inflation has been falling at a slow rate over recently. The negative output gap may help to reduce inflation on the horizon relevant for monetary policy. In contrast, inflation expectations potentially becoming stuck at a high level, as well as the global rises in food, commodity and energy prices are adding to the upside risks to inflation. Data received over the past two months reveal that inflationary pressures have increased due to rising oil prices and diminished due to the strengthening of the forint exchange rate. The Monetary Council does not seek to prevent the adjustment of the relative prices of energy consistent with shifts in global supply and demand; however, it seeks to prevent this process from resulting in persistent inflationary pressures. The latest inflation and wage data are consistent with the central path in the May issue of the Quarterly Report on Inflation. The Council remains committed to achieving the 3 per cent inflation target. Tight monetary conditions help to bring down inflation gradually and to reduce indirect potential inflationary pressures from expectations. The Monetary Council will stand ready to take the necessary steps, if meeting the inflation target warrants it."
Georgia,2008-07-23,"Tbilisi. 23 July The Decision of the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Georgia on July 23, 2008 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met today and decided to leave its main policy rate, the one-week Certificate of Deposit (CD) rate, unchanged at 12 percent. The Committee noted that despite the high level of inflation, core inflation has been decreasing. In addition, developments in the real economic and financial sectors are in line with the forecasts that were made during the Committee's last meeting. The Committee believes that further tightening of monetary policy is not necessary at this time, as the current Policy Rate should ensure that the rate of inflation will stay within the forecasted limits in the medium term. The banking sector has been experiencing a slight increase in interest rates. The committee notes that interest rates on loans have risen by approximately one percentage point since the beginning of the year. Additionally, the growth rate of lending has stabilized. The moderated rate of lending in domestic currency is especially noteworthy as it tends to reduce inflation risks considerably. Broad money aggregates growth rates have declined together with the money multiplier, as a result of the correction of the imbalance previously caused by the short-term liquidity deficit in the banking sector. Since the second half of June, this increased liquidity has strengthened the stability of the banking sector. The inflationary pressures in the main trading partner countries of Georgia points to the increasing necessity of a flexible exchange rate in order to reduce the risks associated with imported inflation. Despite the uneasiness and instability in global financial markets, capital inflows in Georgia still remain high. Although, interest rates on deposits have risen and this is evidenced in the domestic credit markets. Prices of the main commodity groups  oil, wheat and precious metals, have been decreasing in July. Since the last Monetary Policy Committee Meeting, the existing risks to inflation have on balance remained unchanged. Assuming that significant increases in administrative prices will not be observed and commodity prices will be in line with existing forecasts, the current policy rate should ensure that an inflation rate close to 8 percent is achieved by the end of the year. The NBG will closely monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets with the objective of achieving the forecast inflation rate and will in due course act accordingly. 1 The reproduction without citing the source is not allowed.

Malaysia,2008-07-25,"While the Malaysian economy has performed well in the first-half of the year, in the next twelve months, it is expected to experience a more challenging environment in which both the risks to higher inflation and slower growth have increased considerably. The assessment is for a slower global growth with a more protracted and significant slowdown in a number of the developed economies and some moderation in growth in the emerging economies. At the same time, commodity and energy prices are expected to remain at elevated levels, thus fuelling inflation in the global economy. The performance of the Malaysian economy in the first-half of 2008 has been driven by robust domestic demand and reinforced by favourable export performance. The recent major restructuring of domestic energy prices to bring prices closer to the substantially higher international prices is intended to reduce the fundamental distortions that it might create, and to ensure fiscal sustainability. These adjustments are expected to have a deflationary effect on the economy in the second half of this year and into the early part of 2009. The adjustments to the higher international energy and commodity prices have translated into higher domestic consumer prices. In June, consumer price inflation increased by 7.7%, of which about 41% of the increase in inflation was due to the increase in transportation costs while another 41% of the increase has been due to higher prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages. The Bank is projecting inflation to remain elevated in the second-half of this year and into early next year before moderating towards the middle of 2009. The average inflation for 2008 is projected to be in the range of 5.5-6.0%. The inflation rate is expected to moderate in the second half of 2009 in the context of a more moderate growth environment. Currently, much of the significant rise in inflation is due to the increase in fuel prices. At this stage, the concern is for broader price increases and second-round effects, which would result in inflation being persistent. In such circumstances, the appropriate monetary policy response will be taken in order to maintain medium term price stability and ensure that the high inflation does not undermine the longer term growth prospects of the Malaysian economy. In the next twelve months, while both the risks to higher inflation and the risks to slower growth have increased, the immediate concern is to avoid a fundamental economic slowdown that would involve higher unemployment. Slowing growth itself will contribute to containing the potential for second round effects on inflation, thereby containing further increases in prices in the second-half of 2009. Given the underlying fundamental strength of the economy, and the resilient banking sector, the Bank's assessment is that after this transitional period, the Malaysian economy has the potential to reestablish its medium term growth path. Based on this assessment, the Monetary Policy Committee has decided to keep the Overnight Policy Rate unchanged at 3.50%. Bank Negara Malaysia 25 July 2008."
Israel,2008-07-28,"28.7.2008</td> The Bank of Israel raises the interest rate for August 2008 by 25 basis points to 4 percent The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for August will riseby 25 basis points to 4 percent. This step is taken in the context of the policy of maintaining price stability, in accordance with the inflation target of 1-3 percent a year. Background conditions Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by a relatively moderate 0.1 percent in June, less than the forecasts had predicted. This increase is in line with the seasonal path consistent with meeting the inflation target. The housing, food, and fruit and vegetable components of the CPI contributed to the surprisingly low index. Since the beginning of 2008 the CPI has risen by 2.3 percent. In the last twelve months it has risen by 4.8 percent, and the CPI excluding the energy, food, and fruit and vegetables components has risen by 1.9 percent. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Israeli forecasters expect, on average, that inflation over the next twelve months will be 3.2 percent, above the upper limit of the target range. According to the Bank of Israel forecasts, inflation measured over the previous twelve months is expected to fall below its current level of 4.8 percent, to rise again towards theend of the year, and to return to the target range towards mid-2009. Israeli forecasters expect, on average, that the Bank of Israel interest rate for August will remain unchanged, and that within a year the rate will rise by about 0.4 percentage points. Inflation expectations for the next twelve months calculated from the capital market rose until mid-July, and reached approximately 3.5 percent. However, following the publication of the June CPI, those expectations fell sharply to about 2.8 percent, and expectations of a rise in the Bank of Israel interest rate moderated too. The current expectations derived from the capital market are for a rise of about 0.5 percentage points within a year. The Bank of Israel's econometric modelsindicate that a rise in the interest rate is needed to return inflation tothe target range in the next twelve months. Real economic activity: Some recent data support the assessment that economic growth has slowed. The Companies Survey also suggests that theslowdown in growth is expected to continue. The composite state-of-the-economy index fell by 0.3 percent in June, and the updated index for May showed a decline of 0.1 percent. These two consecutive drops are evidence of a slowdown in the rate of growth. On the other hand, foreign trade data for June and sales in the retail chain stores show continued increases. Imports and exports, in dollar terms, rose from the first quarter to the second by 17.6 percent and 9.6 percent respectively, at annual rates. Retail sales in the chain stores rose at a rate of 4.4 percent in June, after declining in April and May. The labor market and wages: Central Bureau of Statistics data show that the downward trend in the unemployment rate has continued, with unemployment declining from 6.2 percent in March-April to 6.1 percent in May. The average nominal wage rose in the months February-April by 4.8 percent, relative to the same period a year before. Budget policy: The overall surplus in government activity, excluding credit, in the first half of 2008 totaled NIS 2.7 billion relative to the seasonal path. This derived from non-tax revenues. The assessment is that in 2008 the budget will be spent in full, and that the deficit will be below the ceiling of 1.6 percent of GDP. The foreign exchange market: In the period between 22 June (the date of the previous interest rate discussion) and 27 July, the shekel weakened against the dollar by 3.9 percent and against the euro by 5.1 percent. The weakening of the shekel contrasted with the trend in the main currency markets, and it started with the announcement by the Bank of Israel that itwas increasing the rate of its foreign currency purchases from $25 milliona day to $ 100 million a day. The June CPI published on 15 July was lower than expected, and also contributed to the weakening of the shekel. The volatility of the shekel/dollar exchange rate remained high. The capital and money markets: From 22 June (the date of the previous interest rate discussion) to 27 July, the Tel Aviv 100 share price index fell by 7.6 percent, reversing the trend of the previous month, but in line with the reductions in most leading share indices abroad. Yields on 10-year unindexed government dropped by 0.1 percentage points to 5.9 percent. The yields on US government 10-year bonds also declined by 0.1 percentage points, so that the yield gap between the Israeli bonds and US government bonds remained unchanged at 1.9 percentage points. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, continued to rise this month from 0.63 percent before the last interest rate decision to 0.87 percent,similar to the development in the emerging markets. The world economy: The most recent economic data point to a slowdown in global growth. Growth is expected to slow in the second half of the year in the US. Europe, the UK, and Japan. Although growth in the emerging markets is still high, in those countries too a slowdown is expected. At the same time, global inflation is accelerating in light of high commodity and oil prices. Nonetheless, this month there were considerable reductions incommodity and oil prices. The crisis in the financial markets became even more severe in the last few weeks in light of concern over the financial situation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the US. Concern over inflation resulted in many central banks switching to a tighter monetary policy. However, the probability of a rise in the interest rates of the Fed, the ECB and the Bank of England in the next few months declined, against the background of the expected slowdown in growth and developments in financial markets. The main considerations behind the decision The factors relevant to the decision on the interest rate relate to inflation and growth, and in each of these areas a mixed picture emerges. Inflation C 398 On the one hand, in the last twelve months the CPI has risen by 4.8 percent, and forecasters' inflation expectations for the next twelve months and thosederived from the capital market are around 3 percent, the upper limit of the inflation target range. C 398 On the other hand, the index excluding energy, food, and fruit and vegetables rose by 1.9 percent, close to the midpoint of the target range. The surprisingly low CPI in June led to a marked fall in twelve-month inflation expectations as calculated from the capital market. There have been reductions recently in commodity and energy prices, which will serve to moderate inflationary pressures in Israel. The assessment is that the upward trend evident hithertoin commodity prices has halted, and may even have reversed. Growth C 398 On the one hand. Israel's GDP is close to its potential; import and export data for June indicate continued expansion, despite the fact that the strengthening of the shekel against the dollar since the beginning of the year is afactor tending to moderate exports and thus economic activity; and data onsales in retail chain stores show continued increases. C 398 On the other hand, the Bank of Israel's Companies Survey and the May and June composite state-of-the-economy indices point to a slowdown in the rate of growth. Given the above factors, the Bank of Israel decided to raise the interest rate by 25 basis points to 4 percent, to support the return of inflation and inflation expectations to around the middle of the target. The return of inflation to the target range is essential as a basis for sustainable growth. The Bank of Israel will continue to closely monitor developments in the Israeli economy and worldwide, and will act to achieve price stability. Subject to this, the Bank will continue to support the attainment of a range of macroeconomic objectives, in particular the encouragement of employment and growth. In addition, the Bank will continue to support the stability of the financial system. 28.7.2008</td> The Bank of Israel raises the interest rate for August 2008 by 25 basis points to 4 percent.

India,2008-07-29,"First Quarter Review of the Annual Statement on Monetary Policy for the Year 2008-09 RBI Governor presented the First Quarter Review of Annual Statement on Monetary Policy for the Year 2008-09 today. Highlights Bank Rate kept unchanged. Reverse Repo Rate under LAF kept unchanged. Repo Rate increased by 50 basis points from 8.5 per cent to 9.00 per cent. Cash Reserve Ratio to be increased by 25 basis points to 9.0 per cent with effect from the fortnight beginning August 30, 2008. GDP growth projection for 2008-09 revised from the range of 8.0-8.5 per cent to around 8.0 per cent, barring domestic or external shocks. While the policy actions would aim to bring down the current intolerable level of inflation to a tolerable level of below 5.0 per cent as soon as possible and around 3.0 per cent over the medium-term, at this juncture a realistic policy endeavour would be to bring down inflation from the current level of about 11.0-12.0 per cent to a level close to 7.0 per cent by March 31, 2009. While there are early signs of some moderation in money supply and deposit growth, they continue to expand above the indicative projections warranting continuous vigilance and appropriate and timely policy responses. In view of the evolving environment of heightened uncertainty in global markets and the dangers of potential spillovers to domestic markets, liquidity management will continue to receive priority in the hierarchy of policy objectives over the period ahead. Barring the emergence of any adverse and unexpected developments in various sectors of the economy, assuming that capital flows are effectively managed, and keeping in view the current assessment of the economy including the outlook for growth and inflation, the overall stance of monetary policy in 2008-09 will broadly continue to be: To ensure a monetary and interest rate environment that accords high priority to price stability, well-anchored inflation expectations and orderly conditions in financial markets while being conducive to continuation of the growth momentum. To respond swiftly on a continuing basis to the evolving constellation of adverse international developments and to the domestic situation impinging on inflation expectations, financial stability and growth momentum, with both conventional and unconventional measures, as appropriate. To emphasise credit quality as well as credit delivery, in particular, for employment-intensive sectors, while pursuing financial inclusion.2008-09. The Review consists of three sections: I. Assessment of Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments; II. Stance of Monetary Policy; and III. Monetary Measures. Domestic Developments Real GDP growth in 2007-08 was revised upwards to 9.0 per cent by the Central Statistical Organisation (CSO) in its end-May 2008 estimates from the advance estimates of 8.7 per cent released in February 2008. Inflation, measured by variations in the wholesale price index (WPI) on a year-on-year basis, increased to 11.89 per cent as on July 12, 2008 from 7.75 per cent as at end-March 2008 and 4.76 per cent a year ago. On a year-on-year basis, inflation based on the consumer price index (CPI) for agricultural labourers and rural labourers increased to 8.8 per cent and 8.7 per cent, respectively, in June 2008 from 7.8 per cent and 7.5 per cent a year ago. Year-on-year inflation based on CPI for industrial workers and urban non-manual employees stood at 7.8 per cent and 6.8 per cent, respectively, in May 2008 as compared with 6.6 per cent and 6.8 per cent a year ago. The CPI-based inflation measures have increased in the range of 2.0-3.2 percentage points over their levels in January 2008. The price of the Indian basket of crude oil increased from US $ 99.4 per barrel in March 2008 to US $ 129.8 in June 2008 and further to US $ 141.5 on July 3, 2008 before declining to US $ 121.9 on July 25, 2008. Money supply (M ) increased by 20.5 per cent on a year-on-year basis on July 4, 2008, 3 lower than 21.8 per cent a year ago. The year-on-year growth in aggregate deposits of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) at 21.7 per cent (Rs.5,89,646 crore) up to July 4, 2008 was lower than 24.6 per cent (Rs.5,36,617 crore) a year ago. Up to July 4, 2008 non-food credit of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) rose by 25.9 per cent (Rs.4,85,709 crore) on a year-on-year basis, higher than 24.6 per cent (Rs.3,69,109 crore) a year ago. Public sector oil marketing companies have been provided US $ 4.3 billion (Rs.19,325 crore) against oil bonds purchased under the Special Market Operation (SMO) scheme up to July 25, 2008. The total overhang of liquidity as reflected in the balances under the LAF, the MSS and the Central Government's cash balances taken together declined from an average of Rs.2,42,370 crore in April 2008 to Rs.2,12,201 crore in May 2008 and Rs.1,93,726 crore in June 2008 (with an intra-year peak of Rs.2,93,048 crore on April 8, 2008) before declining to Rs.1,45,200 crore on July 25, 2008. Financial markets reflected the changes in liquidity conditions during the first quarter of 2008-09. Yields in the Government securities market hardened substantially during the current financial year in both primary and secondary segments. Deposit rates of SCBs increased, particularly at the longer end of the maturity spectrum, during the first four months of 2008-09 (up to July 25). The equity markets witnessed a major downturn in both the primary and secondary segments during the current financial year so far, continuing the moderation that had set in by early January 2008.3,000 crore a year ago) during 2008-09 so far (up to July 25, 2008), constituted 41.0 per cent of the budget estimates (BE) whereas net market borrowings at Rs.47,982 crore (Rs.45,232 crore a year ago) constituted 48.5 per cent of the BE. External Developments Information released by the DGCI&S indicates that exports increased by 21.7 per cent in US dollar terms during the first two months of the current financial year, as compared with 24.2 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year. Imports rose by 31.8 per cent as compared with 37.9 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year. While non-POL imports moderated to 24.6 per cent from 43.8 per cent a year ago. POL imports increased by 48.6 per cent on account of the surge in crude oil prices as compared with 25.7 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year. As a result, the merchandise trade deficit widened to US $ 20.7 billion during April-May 2008 from US $ 13.9 billion in the corresponding period last year. Foreign exchange reserves declined marginally by US $ 2.6 billion during the current financial year so far and stood at US $ 307.1 billion on July 18, 2008. During the current financial year up to July 25, 2008 the rupee depreciated by 5.4 per cent against the US dollar, by 5.0 per cent against the euro, by 5.2 per cent against the pound sterling and by 1.3 per cent against the Japanese yen. Global Developments According to the update of World Economic Outlook (WEO) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) released in July 2008, global real GDP growth on a purchasing power parity basis is expected to decelerate from 5.0 per cent in 2007 to 4.1 per cent in 2008 (3.7 per cent in WEO. April 2008) and further to 3.9 per cent in 2009 (3.8 per cent in WEO. April 2008). Inflation has become a global phenomenon in recent months. Inflation pressures have raised serious concerns in emerging market economies (EMEs) across Asia. Latin America and Africa, mainly on account of supply-demand imbalances in food, fuel and commodity markets. Prices of crude oil, which have rebounded since July 2007, increased by 60.0 per cent up to July 25, 2008 from their level a year ago. World oil markets have been particularly tight during the first half of 2008, with year-on-year growth in world oil consumption outstripping growth in non-Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) production by over 1 million barrels per day. In the global financial markets, sentiment has been adversely affected by concerns relating to a deep and prolonged recession in the US, somewhat alleviated by recent data on consumer sentiment, durable goods orders, consumer spending and oil prices. In addition, losses to the financial sector continue to mount in addition to rising debt defaults. Central banks have continued to work together and to consult regularly on liquidity conditions in financial markets. The confluence of slowdown in growth and mounting inflation alongside financial vulnerabilities has complicated the task of monetary authorities across the world and rendered the future direction of policy setting highly uncertain.Some central banks that have tightened their policy rates in the recent months include the ECB; the Reserve Bank of Australia; Bank Indonesia; Bank of Thailand; the Banco Central de Chile; Banco Central do Brasil and Banco de Mexico. Overall Assessment Domestically, aggregate demand pressures appear to be strongly in evidence, exacerbated by the slack in supply response. The upsurge in inflation during the current financial year reflects a combination of forces at work: the pass-through of international crude prices to domestic administered prices effected on June 5, 2008; inflationary pressures in addition to crude oil prices; and movements in international prices of key commodities indicating elevated upside pressures for domestic prices of a number of commodities with implications for the evolving scenario. There are some signs of moderation in key monetary and banking aggregates in response to monetary measures, which have withdrawn liquidity from the system and tightened interest rates across the term structure. The rates of money supply and deposit growth have started to moderate in consonance since June, edging towards the trajectory set for 2008-09. The balancing of monetary and liquidity conditions has not, however, impacted the demand for bank credit which has accelerated on a year-on-year basis. Downside risks to global economic prospects appear to have intensified since the Annual Policy Statement of April 2008 with slowdown of growth spreading from the US to several other advanced economies with housing and labour markets weakening sharply. The deepening financial turbulence in major financial centres has worsened the macroeconomic outlook further by erosion of consumer and business sentiment and tightening of financing conditions with indications that a generalised credit squeeze may take hold. The impact of the slowdown in developed economies on EMEs cannot but be adverse, but it has so far been limited by the strength of domestic demand, particularly investment, and consumption spending has remained stable. The slowing of import demand from developed economies could, however, pose a risk to the growth outlook for these economies. Inflation has emerged as the biggest risk to the global outlook, having risen to very high levels across the world, levels that have not been generally seen for a couple of decades. Developed and emerging economies alike are reporting multi-year highs in inflation, driven mainly by escalating commodity prices, particularly of energy, food and metals amidst growing concerns across economies that rising food and energy prices are triggering a more generalised inflation spiral through second-round effects. In the global financial system, while a possible crisis in global finance seems to have been averted, several vulnerabilities persist in the leading financial centres heightening the uncertainty characterising the outlook. Central bank interventions in this context have also been extraordinary and on a scale not seen since the Great Depression, demonstrating a resolve to act decisively against threats to financial stability. In some developed countries, the policy response to inflation has been constrained by relatively overarching concerns for financial stability in the context of the ongoing financial turmoil.5 per cent as set out in the Annual Policy Statement of April 2008 may prove to be optimistic and hence for policy purposes, a projection of around 8.0 per cent appears a more realistic central scenario at this juncture, barring domestic or external shocks. It is necessary to moderate monetary expansion and plan for a rate of money supply growth in the range of around 17.0 per cent in 2008-09 in consonance with the outlook on growth and inflation so as to ensure macroeconomic and financial stability in the period ahead. Consistent with the projection of money supply, the growth in aggregate deposits in 2008- 09 is now placed at around 17.5 per cent or around Rs.6,00,000 crore. The growth of non-food credit including investments in bonds/debentures/shares of public sector undertakings and private corporate sector and CP is placed at around 20.0 per cent in 2008-09, as indicated in the Annual Policy Statement, consistent with the monetary projections. In view of the evolving environment of heightened uncertainty, volatility in global markets and the dangers of potential spillovers to domestic equity and currency markets, liquidity management will continue to receive priority in the hierarchy of policy objectives over the period ahead. There is headroom available with the Reserve Bank in terms of the flexibility in the deployment of instruments, complemented by prudential regulations and instruments for capital account management. In 2008-09 so far, some banks that have expanded credit rapidly in relation to the system level growth with attendant worsening of their credit-deposit ratios are urged to review their business strategies so that they are in a position to combine longer term viable financing with profitability in operations, recognising the reality of business cycles and countercyclical monetary policy responses. If necessary, the Reserve Bank would consider undertaking supervisory review of those select banks which are over extended in terms of their credit portfolios relative to their sources of funds. Banks should focus on stricter credit appraisals on a sectoral basis, monitor loan to value ratios and generally ensure the health of credit portfolios on a durable basis without encountering undue asset-liability mismatches. In view of growing off-budget liabilities and enhanced expenditures on subsidies, loan waivers and salaries in the rest of the year, fiscal developments warrant close and careful monitoring.6.0 per cent. Reverse Repo Rate under the LAF kept unchanged at 6.00 per cent. The fixed Repo Rate under the LAF increased by 50 basis points from 8.5 per cent to 9.0 per cent with immediate effect. The Reserve Bank retains the option to conduct overnight or longer term repo/reverse repo under the LAF depending on market conditions and other relevant factors. The Reserve Bank will continue to use this flexibility including the right to accept or reject tender(s) under the LAF, wholly or partially, if deemed fit, so as to make efficient use of the LAF in daily liquidity management. On a review of the current liquidity situation, it is considered desirable to increase the CRR by 25 basis points to 9.0 per cent with effect from the fortnight beginning August 30, 2008. The Mid-Term Review of the Annual Policy Statement for the year 2008-09 will be announced on October 24, 2008. Alpana Killawala Chief General Manager Press Release: 2008-2009/122."
Poland,2008-07-30,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 30 July 2008 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 29-30 July 2008 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e. (cid:131) reference rate 6.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate 7.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate 4.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate 6.25% on an annual basis. The Polish economy is still in the period of growth encompassing most of its sectors. However, data released recently confirm earlier signals suggesting that the economic growth is gradually slowing down. At the same time, information on labour market developments points to a sustained high growth of wages and to an unfavourable relation between wage and labour productivity growth. The latest data on the United States and the euro area point to further deterioration of the outlook for growth in these economies. At the same time, many countries have recorded a rise in both the current and the forecast inflation. In the past few months oil prices in the world markets have increased strongly, while displaying high volatility. Uncertainty persists as to the scale in which the decline in activity in the external environment may affect the Polish economy. In June the annual growth of consumer prices in Poland rose to 4.6%, remaining above the NBP's inflation target of 2.5% and also above the upper limit for deviations from the target set at 3.5%. The rise in inflation primarily resulted from increased annual growth of prices of food, transport (which was connected with strong growth of fuel prices) and some services. The Council maintains its assessment that in the coming months inflation will continue above the upper limit for deviations from the inflation target, which to a large extent will be the result of high annual growth of administered prices and also food and fuel prices. In the Council's assessment, in the coming quarters the pressure on wage increases will probably persist, though the gradually slowing economic growth should be easing the wage pressure and, consequently, also the inflationary pressure. Increased inflation in the coming quarters will, to a large extent, result from the growth of administered prices and also from the food and fuel price growth observed in the world economy and affecting the Polish market. Persistently increased inflation creates a risk of inflation expectations remaining at an elevated level and, consequently, feeds the risk of the second-round effects. Moreover, the rise in prices of energy may be gradually passing through to prices of other goods and services. In the medium term inflationary pressure may be curbed by still good financial results of enterprises and continuously high investment growth conducive to productivity growth. This pressure may also be constrained by the slowdown in the global economy and, consequently, also in the Polish economy. The inflationary pressure may still be eased by the import of goods from countries with low production costs. The previous increases of NBP's interest rates will also have ul.

Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51, the same effect, as well as the rapid zloty appreciation observed over the past quarters, which in the recent period has most probably outpaced the appreciation of the equilibrium exchange rate. The Council assessed the probability of inflation overshooting the inflation target in the medium term to be higher than the probability of inflation running below the target. Therefore, the Council does not rule out that bringing inflation down to the target in the medium term would require further monetary policy tightening. At the same time, due to the persistence of shocks observed in food and commodity markets, bringing inflation down to the target level may take somewhat longer time. In view of the persisting uncertainty as to the global growth outlook and the prospects of the Polish economy, the Council assessed that a more comprehensive assessment of inflation outlook will be possible after analysing the data released in the near future. The Council is striving to bring inflation down to the inflation target in the medium term. The Council will be closely monitoring the growth and structure of domestic demand, the relation between wage and labour productivity growth in the enterprise sector and wage growth in the public finance sector, the degree of the expansionary fiscal policy stance, zloty exchange rate, developments of the current account balance and the impact of globalisation on the economy and on food prices. The Council will also analyse changes in the external factors affecting the Polish economy and their impact on the outlook for economic growth and inflation in Poland. The Council approved The Balance of Payments of the Republic of Poland in 2008 Q1."
Romania,2008-07-31,"In its meeting of July 31, 2008, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided the following:. The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which assesses the recent macroeconomic environment and the inflation outlook, and identifies the main challenges and risks to monetary policy in the coming period. The Inflation Report will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled for August 4, 2008. The annual inflation rate stood at 8.61 percent in June, almost unchanged versus 8.63 percent in March 2008 but still significantly above the upper limit of the variation band around the target for this year. Moreover, the administered price increases will lead to a temporarily faster growth of annual inflation rate in July. The continued rise in incomes in excess of labour productivity gains as well as the persistently rapid pace of credit expansion have fuelled inflationary pressures, heightening also the risk of deteriorating external competitiveness. The adjusted annual CORE2 inflation rate - calculated by excluding the impact of administered and volatile prices (vegetables, fruit, eggs and fuel) as well as the effect of vice tax - climbed to an annual 7.9 percent in June from 7.6 percent in the previous month, due to the persistent impact of inflationary shocks over the past 12 months, reflected also by stronger inflation expectations. Under these circumstances, further consolidation of monetary policy restrictiveness through an appropriate dosage of its instruments is needed, as well as stronger support from other components of the economic policy mix. In light of available data and given the need to boost savings and alleviate fast credit growth, the NBR Board has decided to raise the monetary policy rate to 10.25 percent per annum from 10.0 percent. Therefore, starting from August 1, 2008 the interest rate on the NBR deposit facility is raised to an annual 6.25 percent from 6.0 percent while the rate on its lending facility (Lombard rate) will stand at an annual 14.25 percent versus 14.0 percent previously. Also, the penalty rate for deficits of leu-denominated minimum reserve requirements will rise to an annual 21.25 percent from 21 percent starting with the August 24-September 23, 2008 maintenance period. The NBR will continue to pursue a firm management of money market liquidity via open-market operations, leaving unchanged the existing minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled for August 4, 2008. The inflation outlook reveals a slowdown trend in the year-on-year inflation rate starting August as a result of a base effect as well as of the maintenance of restrictive monetary conditions. Nevertheless, macroeconomic risks, especially those related to income policy and increased budget spending in the electoral period, have picked up and might be heightened by rising uncertainties surrounding the global economic environment. In this context, the NBR Board believes it is essential that the temporary deviation of annual inflation outside the target band should not trigger any relaxation of wage and fiscal policies, considering the need to preserve the main macroeconomic equilibria. Under these circumstances, bringing inflation, in a sustainable manner, within the variation band around the target during 2009 requires the implementation of coherent and restrictive macroeconomic policies (monetary, fiscal and income) as well as stepped-up structural reforms. The NBR Board has also made a preliminary assessment of the main parameters for setting the 2010 inflation target, taking into account the need to continue disinflation in the medium term in line with the euro adoption calendar as well as the risks and uncertainties related to the inflation performance, especially those pertaining to factors beyond the central bank's control. The 2010 target will be set and announced after the completion of consultations with the Government. The NBR Board reaffirms that it will vigilantly monitor developments in macroeconomic indicators, standing ready to use the central bank's entire array of instruments to counteract inflationary pressures and to ensure that disinflation will resume at a pace consistent with the aim of achieving the announced medium-term inflation targets in a sustainable manner. The next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy is scheduled for September 25, 2008."
Nigeria,2008-08-05,"CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA'S COMMUNIQUE NO. 57 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE. AUGUST 5, 2008 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today August 5, 2008 and reviewed extensively the major macroeconomic developments in the domestic and global economy during the first seven months of 2008. In addition, it assessed the outlook for the rest of the year. The MPC noted that key domestic macroeconomic outcomes were mixed. The international financial markets deteriorated further while there was a marked slowdown in global economic activities and acceleration in inflation. The US dollar continued to fall against major currencies while the international crude oil prices remained high in the first seven months of 2008. Specifically on the domestic scene, inflation pressures have mounted and most key interest rates maintained an upward trend. The naira exchange rate, however, remained fairly stable. There has been strong liquidity upsurge mainly due to rise in fiscal expenditures. Overall the outlook for the rest of the year remains uncertain. These concerns posed serious challenges to the Committee in its consideration of the appropriate monetary policy actions to be taken. The Committee recognized that the current rate of inflation yearon-year requires urgent attention because of the adverse effects of inflation on the economic well being of the citizens. Aggregate demand has been at very high levels due to large public as well as private expenditures. Domestic liquidity management as a result has posed a major challenge. The MPC, therefore, restated its commitment to price stability through the pursuit of appropriate monetary policy to rein in the emerging inflationary pressures. KEY MACROECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS Inflation The Committee noted the sharp rise in the year-on-year inflation rate of 120 per cent compared with 78, 82 and 97 per cent recorded in March. April and May 2008, respectively. The increase in the inflation rate was traceable to the sharp rise in the prices of food and fuel, particularly diesel. Food inflation on a year-on-year basis was 181 per cent in June as against 147 per cent in May. Although the outlook for inflation based on current trajectory raised serious policy concerns for the MPC, the Committee noted that moderation in inflation could be expected by the end of the year if the projected good agricultural performance and rice import intervention scheme are sustained, coupled with a credible slowdown of both public and private expenditures. Output Aggregate output measured by real gross domestic product (GDP) at 1990 constant basic prices, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) was estimated to have grown by 665 per cent in the second quarter of 2008, compared with the provisional growth rate of 554 per cent in the first quarter of 2008 and 543 per cent in the second quarter of 2007. The growth in the second quarter of 2008 was largely driven by the non-oil sector, which grew by 882 per cent. The NBS projects a favourable outlook for output in 2008 on the assumption of projected strong growth in the non-oil sectors, particularly agriculture and services. Money and Credit Provisional data show that broad money (M2) growth over the end-December 2007 level continued to be excessive at 377, 343, 299 and 374 per cent in March. April. May and June 2008, respectively. The growth in M2 was driven 2 largely by the growth in credit to the core private sector, complemented by growth in net foreign assets. The threat of sustained rapid growth in money and credit aggregates for the remainder of the year remains strong against the backdrop of the prospect of further liquidity injections during the third and fourth quarters as governments intensify efforts to fully implement their annual budgets by the end of the year and as preparations are made for the end of year festivities. External Sector Developments The MPC noted with satisfaction the continued increase in international reserves. The gross external reserves amounted to US$6031 billion as at July 31, 2008 representing an increase of US$898 billion over the level in December 2007. The level of external reserves is likely to remain high in the remainder of the year partly owing to the expectations that oil prices would remain at elevated levels and partly to private capital inflows. The MPC noted that the exchange rate of the naira has generally been stable. The staff assessment is that there would be continued orderliness in the foreign exchange market in the remaining months of the year. Interest Rates The MPC noted the upward movement of most key interest rates in response to the prevailing market conditions. The average inter-bank call rate edged up by about 02 percentage point to 1040 per cent in June, 2008. Rates on time deposits of various maturities as well as the maximum lending rate also rose. Fiscal Operations The Committee noted that the total federally-collected revenue for the first half of 2008 was about 2171 per cent higher than the proportionate budget estimate for the period. The MPC noted with concern the huge liquidity injection from the fiscal arm which emanated from the sharing of part of the excess crude proceeds and the enhanced regular Federation account allocations. It noted the negative impact these have had on overall liquidity and the threat posed to macroeconomic stability from other disbursements scheduled for the remaining part of 2008. The MPC also noted that moderating the impact of fiscal operations on liquidity through innovative mechanisms involving monetization would be worthwhile for ensuring that macroeconomic stability is maintained. The Outlook and Policy Considerations The MPC noted that in the short term, the expected good harvest of agricultural products and the implementation of the rice import intervention scheme by the Federal Government are likely to exert a downward pressure on food prices and, hence, headline inflation. This notwithstanding, current projections indicate that inflation rate may remain in the double-digit zone, if the current trajectory is maintained till the end of the year. The Committee expects that, the sustenance of a restrictive monetary policy stance to counter balance the excessive expansionary fiscal stance, anchored on a more intense liquidity mop-up operations, could deliver a lower headline inflation outcome by the end of the year than current forecasts suggest. Decisions The Committee decided as follows: 1. The MPR will remain unchanged at 1025 per cent since the core inflation is expected to remain at a relatively moderate level. After reviewing developments in the financial market and the misplaced perceptions that the interest rate trends are linked to the requirement of a common year-end, the MPC decided that the common year-end for banks would no longer be a requirement and therefore left the decision to the discretion of the banks. In order to ensure a transparent pricing regime in the money market and thereby foster healthier competition, banks are required to fully disclose to the public their deposit rates as well as their base lending rates and other charges for all the sectors of the economy. These should be published on their respective websites and updated daily. The banks are required to report these rates to the CBN to enable the Bank to publish a summary of the rates for each deposit money bank every month. Professor Chukwuma C Soludo CFR Governor.

United States,2008-08-05,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 2 percent. Economic activity expanded in the second quarter, partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports. However, labor markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress. Tight credit conditions, the ongoing housing contraction, and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters. Over time, the substantial easing of monetary policy, combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity, should help to promote moderate economic growth. Inflation has been high, spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities, and some indicators of inflation expectations have been elevated. The Committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year, but the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain. Although downside risks to growth remain, the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the Committee. The Committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; Timothy F Geithner. Vice Chairman; Elizabeth A Duke; Donald L Kohn; Randall S Kroszner; Frederic S Mishkin; Sandra Pianalto; Charles I Plosser; Gary H Stern; and Kevin M Warsh. Voting against was Richard W Fisher, who preferred an increase in the target for the federal funds rate at this meeting."

Euroarea,2008-08-07,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today's meeting to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The information that has become available since our previous meeting has further underpinned the reasoning behind our decision to increase interest rates in July. It has confirmed that annual inflation rates are likely to remain well above levels consistent with price stability for a protracted period of time and that risks to price stability over the medium term remain on the upside. This assessment is underpinned by continued vigorous money growth, with so far no signs of significant constraints on bank loan supply. In such a context, it remains crucial to avoid broadly based second-round effects in wage and price-setting. The latest economic data point to a weakening of real GDP growth in mid-2008, which in part was expected after the exceptionally strong growth in the first quarter. Against this background and in full accordance with our mandate, we emphasise that maintaining price stability in the medium term is our primary objective and that it is our strong determination to keep medium and long-term inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with price stability. This will preserve purchasing power in the medium term and support sustainable growth and employment. On the basis of our assessment, the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our objective. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. The information on economic activity that has become available since the July press conference suggests that real GDP growth figures for mid-2008 will be substantially weaker than for the first quarter of the year. As indicated on previous occasions, this represents partly a technical reaction to the strong growth seen in the first months of the year. In addition, it also partly reflects a weakening in GDP growth due to factors such as slower expansion at the global level and dampening effects from high and volatile oil and food prices. In order to assess the underlying momentum of euro area economic activity and to avoid being misguided by highly volatile quarterly outturns, it is necessary to look through the volatility in quarter-on-quarter growth rates and monthly indicators. Taking this perspective, growth in the world economy, while moderating, is expected to remain relatively resilient, benefiting in particular from sustained growth in emerging economies. This should support external demand for euro area goods and services. As regards domestic developments, in a medium-term perspective the fundamentals of the euro area are sound and the euro area does not suffer from major imbalances. Investment growth in the euro area has provided ongoing, though moderating, support to economic activity. Moreover, employment and labour force participation have increased significantly, and unemployment rates remain low in historical terms. However, these developments, which support household disposable income and consumption, are unlikely to fully compensate the loss of purchasing power caused by higher energy and food prices. In the view of the Governing Council, the uncertainty surrounding this outlook for economic activity remains high, owing to, among other things, the very high and volatile levels of commodity prices and the ongoing tensions in financial markets. In particular, risks stem from the dampening impact on consumption and investment of further unanticipated increases in energy and food prices. Moreover, downside risks continue to relate to the potential for the financial market tensions to affect the real economy more adversely than currently anticipated. The possibility of disorderly developments owing to global imbalances also implies downside risks to the outlook for economic activity, as do concerns about the emergence of protectionist pressures. In this respect, the failure of the recent negotiations in the context of the World Trade Organization's Doha round on trade liberalisation is a major setback. With regard to price developments, annual HICP inflation has remained considerably above the level consistent with price stability since last autumn, reaching 4.0% in June 2008 and, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, 4.1% in July. This worrying level of inflation rates results largely from both direct and indirect effects of past sharp increases in energy and food prices at the global level. At the same time, while labour productivity growth has decelerated, there are some indications that labour cost growth has been rising in recent quarters. Looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for commodities, the annual HICP inflation rate is likely to remain well above a level consistent with price stability for quite some time, moderating only gradually in 2009. Risks to price stability at the policy-relevant medium-term horizon remain clearly on the upside and have increased over the past few months. These risks include notably the possibility of further increases in energy and food prices and of increasing indirect effects on consumer prices. There is a very strong concern that price and wage-setting behaviour could add to inflationary pressures via broadly based second-round effects. The Governing Council is monitoring price-setting behaviour and wage negotiations in the euro area with particular attention. Furthermore, there are potential upside risks from unanticipated rises in indirect taxes and administered prices. Against this background, it is imperative to ensure that medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels in line with price stability. The shift in relative prices and the related transfer of income from commodity-importing countries to commodity-exporting countries require a change in the behaviour of companies and households. Therefore, broadly based second-round effects stemming from the impact of higher energy and food prices on price and wage-setting behaviour must be avoided. All parties concerned, in both the private and the public sector, must meet their responsibilities in this regard. In this context, the Governing Council has repeatedly expressed its concern about the existence of schemes in which nominal wages are indexed to consumer prices. Such schemes involve the risk of upward shocks in inflation leading to a wage-price spiral, which would be detrimental to employment and competitiveness in the countries concerned. The Governing Council therefore calls for such schemes to be avoided. The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. In line with our monetary policy strategy, we take the view that the sustained underlying strength of monetary and credit expansion in the euro area over the past few years has created upside risks to price stability. Over recent quarters, these risks appear to have become manifest as inflation has trended upwards. Not least in the face of the ongoing tensions in financial markets, the monetary analysis helps to support the necessary medium-term orientation of monetary policy by focusing attention on the upside risks to price stability prevailing at medium to longer horizons. While the growth of broad money and credit aggregates is now showing some signs of moderation, also reflecting the policy measures taken since 2005 to address upside risks to price stability, the strong underlying pace of monetary expansion points to continued risks to price stability over the medium term. The current yield curve has led to very rapid increases in time deposits and to a substantial decline in annual M1 growth. Such effects and other temporary factors must be taken into account in assessing monetary developments. Overall, a broad-based analysis of the data, taking the appropriate medium-term perspective, confirms the underlying strength of money growth. One of the main factors leading to this conclusion is the still high growth of MFI loans to the private sector, which is underpinning the robust nature of monetary growth. The pace, maturity and sectoral composition of bank borrowing suggest that, at the level of the euro area as a whole, the availability of bank credit has, as yet, not been significantly affected by the ongoing financial tensions. Higher short-term interest rates and housing market weakness in several parts of the euro area have dampened the growth of household borrowing over the past few years. By contrast, and notwithstanding tighter financing conditions and moderating economic growth, the expansion of bank credit to non-financial corporations thus far remains very robust. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis clearly confirms the assessment of increasing upside risks to price stability over the medium term. Annual inflation rates are likely to remain well above levels consistent with price stability, and monetary aggregates continue to grow vigorously, with so far no signs of significant constraints on bank loan supply. The latest economic data point to a weakening of real GDP growth in mid-2008, which in part was expected after the exceptionally strong growth in the first quarter. Against this background, it remains crucial to avoid broadly based second-round effects in wage and price-setting. In full accordance with our mandate, we emphasise that maintaining price stability in the medium term is our primary objective and that it is our strong determination to keep medium and long-term inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with price stability, thereby preserving purchasing power in the medium term and supporting sustainable growth and employment in the euro area. On the basis of our assessment, the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our objective. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Regarding fiscal policy, there are risks that some countries will not achieve their fiscal targets this year. In this situation a rigorous implementation of budget plans and the avoidance of expenditure slippage are of crucial importance. Budget plans for 2009, which are currently being finalised in a number of countries, need to reflect European commitments. In particular, countries with still large deficits must provide ambitious and concrete deficit reduction plans, backed by clearly specified measures, preferably on the expenditure side. Where budgetary scope is available, automatic stabilisers can contribute to the smoothing of cyclical economic fluctuations. As regards structural policies, measures which reduce adjustment costs and promote moderate unit labour cost growth are of the utmost importance, particularly in the current climate of high inflation and slowing real GDP growth. These include the removal of impediments to competition in the services sector in general, and at the various stages of the food supply chain in the retail and distribution sectors, as well as in the energy sector, more specifically. Equally, making labour markets more flexible and enhancing investment in education and training would foster productivity, thereby increasing the scope for increases in real incomes."
Egypt,2008-08-07,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release August 7, 2008 The Central Bank of Egypt decided to raise its overnight deposit by 50 bps to 11 percent per annu. The discount rate was also raised by 100 bps to 11 percent per annu. In its meeting held on August 7, 2008, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise the overnight deposit and lending rates by 50 bps to 11 percent and 13 percent, respectivel. The headline CPI inflation showed a modest acceleration in June, reaching 202% as domestic food inflation was broadly unchange. However the MPC remains concerned about possible propagation of food inflation to non-food inflatio. International food prices are still high but have declined from their recent record levels over the past three months as evidenced in wheat price. These developments suggest that the international food price shock might be waning, notwithstanding the uncertainty surrounding the outlook of international commodity price. This in turn, remains to be a key upside risk to the domestic inflation outlook which is exacerbated by downward price rigidities in domestic market. Moreover the MPC is mindful of the underlying inflationary pressures which continue to tilt the balance of risks to the upsid. Having weighed both the international and domestic information available, today's decision is aimed at containing inflation expectation. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments, especially the factors underlying inflation, and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter.

South Korea,2008-08-07,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points from 5.00% to 5.25%. In a related action, the Committee also raised the interest rates on Aggregate Credit Ceiling Loans by 25 basis points from 3.25% to 3.50%. (The following is an English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points from 5.00% to 5.25%. Domestic economic activity has slackened. While exports continue to post robust growth, domestic demand remains sluggish. A high degree of uncertainty still surrounds future economic developments, largely due to the increased volatility of international oil prices, international financial market unrest and the US economic slowdown. Consumer price inflation has picked up its pace, due to the direct and knock-on effects of high oil prices, and inflation seems likely to remain significantly high for quite some time. The upward trend of real estate prices, however, has been blunted. Liquidity is still ample in the financial markets and financial institutions' lending continues to show a steady increase. The Committee judges that this action should contribute to containing inflation expectations which have gathered strength influenced by the recent sharp rise in headline inflation."
Chile,2008-08-14,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 14 August 2008 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 50 basis points, to 7.75% (annual). Given the deteriorated inflationary outlook, this increase in the monetary policy rate is necessary to ensure convergence of inflation toward 3% over the policy horizon. Internationally, output prospects for developed economies remain weak and world financial markets are still under stress. The oil price has fallen, as well as the prices of several other commodities. However, these prices are still high and inflationary pressures remain around the world. Domestically, available information on second-quarter economic activity is consistent with growth forecasts for the year contained in the last Monetary Policy Report. Domestic demand continues to grow at a fast pace, particularly its imported component, and unemployment has remained stable. July's inflation exceeded forecasts, reflecting increases in most items. The various measures of core inflation have risen, suggesting a greater-than- anticipated inflationary propagation. To date, wage dynamics remain in line with historical patterns. The Board reaffirms its commitment to conduct monetary policy so as to reduce the current high inflation rates to 3% over the policy horizon. This is essential to align the inflationary dynamic with the price stability objective. The future path of the monetary policy rate will depend on incoming information and its implications on projected inflation, although, in the most likely scenario, further adjustments will be necessary in order to ensure convergence of inflation to the target. * The Spanish original prevails."
Turkiye,2008-08-14,"The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) has decided to keep policy rates unchanged as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 16.75 percent, and lending rate at 20.25 percent, b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 12.75 percent, lending rate at 23.25 percent, c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 19.25 percent. Recent readings indicate that domestic economic activity has continued to moderate. Ongoing problems in international credit markets and global economy continue to restrain the aggregate demand, while easing domestic uncertainties will support domestic demand. Moreover, oil prices have followed a significantly lower course than the levels assumed in the baseline scenario in the July Inflation Report and other commodity prices also displayed a downward course, improving the near-term inflation outlook. Overall, inflation is expected to fall gradually in the forthcoming period. Considering the monetary tightening since May, the Committee believes that the current level of the policy rate is supportive of disinflation. Yet, prevailing risks regarding the price setting behavior and ongoing global uncertainties require monetary policy to remain cautious and to be more responsive to incoming data. Future decisions on policy rates will depend on developments in global markets, external demand, fiscal policy implementation, and other factors affecting the medium term inflation outlook. It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight working days."
South Africa,2008-08-14,"The outlook for inflation remains uncertain. Food and oil price increases continue to cloud the inflation outlook, but there are tentative signs that these pressures may be moderating. Domestic consumption expenditure also remains subdued. However, electricity price increases are set to have an impact on inflation going forward, and there is evidence that underlying inflation has maintained some of its upward momentum. Conflicting pressures are being felt from the global economy which is experiencing slower growth and higher inflation. While there are clear signs that the economy is responding to the less accommodative monetary policy stance, the MPC had to assess whether recent monetary policy actions are sufficient to bring inflation back to within the inflation target range over the medium term. CPIX inflation increased at a year-on-year rate of 11,6 per cent in June 2008 compared with 10,9 per cent in May. Food price inflation accelerated from 16,9 per cent in May to 18,2 per cent in June, mainly as a result of significant increases in the prices of grain products as well as fats and oils. Petrol prices increased by almost 36 per cent in June, and together with food prices accounted for about 56 percent of the increase in CPIX. However, if food and petrol were excluded. CPIX inflation would have measured 6,3 per cent. Services price inflation has been increasing consistently over the past few months and reached a level of 6,7 per cent in June. Producer price inflation increased at a year-on-year rate of 16,8 per cent in June, driven mainly by petroleum products and mining output prices. Food price increases at the producer price level continue to show some moderation. Agricultural food price increases measured 2,0 per cent in June, while manufactured food price increases, while still high, measured 19,4 per cent, compared with a peak of 20,4 per cent in March 2008. The central forecast of the Bank has been complicated by the impending rebasing and reweighting of the CPI basket, to be implemented by Statistics South Africa from January 2009. In trying to account for these changes, certain assumptions have to be made, and the central forecast is therefore subject to additional uncertainty. The central forecast generated on the above basis indicates a near-term deterioration of the inflation outlook when compared with the previous forecast. CPIX Inflation is expected to peak at an average rate of around 13 per cent in the third quarter of 2008, compared with 12 per cent. Thereafter, inflation is expected to decline significantly in the first quarter of 2009, partly as a result of the reweighting and rebasing effects. Inflation is then expected to decline gradually, and to fall below the upper end of the inflation target range in the second quarter of 2010. Inflation is expected to average about 7,2 per cent in 2009 and 5,9 per cent in 2010. The forecast takes account of the additional electricity price increases granted to Eskom in June. However there is some uncertainty about the timing of these increases, or the full extent of the increases that will be passed on to household consumers by the municipalities. Forecasts by private sector economists have also been influenced by the coming technical adjustments to the inflation basket. Between June and July, the Reuters consensus CPIX forecast for 2009 declined from 8,2 per cent to 7,5 per cent, while the forecast for 2010 declined from 6 per cent to 5,9 per cent. Since July, the break-even inflation rates, measured as the yield differential between conventional government bonds and inflation-linked bonds, have also reflected some improvement in medium-term inflation expectations. The yield curve moved down markedly, particularly at the long end of the curve, with the R157 having declined by about 100 basis points since the previous MPC meeting. The higher inflation outcomes and expectations have had an impact on wage settlements. According to the Wage Settlement Survey of Andrew Levy Employment Publications, the average level of wage settlements for the first half of 2008 was 8,3 per cent, compared with 6,8 per cent in the same period in 2007. Unit labour costs increased by 10,2 per cent in the first quarter of 2008 compared with the same quarter in the previous year, while unit labour cost increases in manufacturing measured 6,6 per cent. These trends, while not unexpected, were noted by the MPC. Significant risks to the inflation outlook remain, although there are tentative signs that some of the risk factors may have moderated somewhat. International oil prices are well below the levels reached in early July 2008 when the price of North Sea Brent crude oil was around US$145 per barrel. Currently oil is trading at around US$112 per barrel, compared to around US$140 per barrel at the time of the previous MPC meeting. These price developments were reflected in domestic petrol price adjustments. In July the price of 95 octane petrol in Gauteng increased by 74 cents per litre, but in August the price declined by 30 cents per litre. If current oil price and exchange rate levels are maintained, a further sizeable decline can be expected in September. It is still too early to tell if the lower international oil price is a temporary phenomenon. The risks to inflation posed by food price developments remain. Grain product prices in particular appear to have gained some momentum at both the producer price and consumer price levels. As noted earlier, however, manufactured food producer price inflation remains high, but agricultural food inflation has declined to low levels, indicating the possibility of some price relief in the future. The spot price of yellow maize declined in early August following the release of local crop estimates. Wheat prices have also declined on international markets but nevertheless remain high. The exchange rate of the rand has exhibited some volatility since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee when it was trading at around R8,00 per US dollar. In late July the rand began to appreciate, and reached a level of around R7,20 against the US dollar but has since depreciated to current levels of around R7,85 per US dollar. On a trade-weighted basis the rand has appreciated by about 4 per cent since the previous meeting. The outlook for most of the other determinants of inflation is relatively unchanged since the previous meeting. Growth in household consumption expenditure appears to have remained subdued. Real retail sales declined on a year-on-year basis in the four consecutive months to June 2008. In May and June retail sales declined by 3,4 per cent and 2,6 per cent respectively. Motor vehicle sales also remain under pressure with the total number of vehicles sold in July declining by over 20 per cent when compared with the same time last year. In the second quarter of 2008, the FNB/BER Consumer Confidence Index experienced its largest quarter-on-quarter decline in 24 years. Credit extension to the private sector exhibited further moderation, although it still remained at relatively high levels. Growth over twelve months in mortgage advances measured 19,9 per cent in June 2008 while growth in instalment sale credit and leasing finance grew by 14 per cent. Growth in credit extension to households remains on a downward trend. Real growth in gross domestic product also appears to be lower than the rates achieved in the last few years, although growth in the second quarter is expected to exceed the first quarter growth rate of 2,1 per cent. This improvement will be a result of base effects and improved performances of mining and manufacturing in the second quarter. The expected subdued trend in output growth is evident in a number of indicators. The South African Reserve Bank composite leading business cycle indicator, which has been declining since March 2007, continued its downward trend in May 2008, while the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index also declined significantly in the second quarter of 2008. The Investec/BER Purchasing Managers Index also points to continued slow growth in the manufacturing sector primarily due to sluggish new sales orders. The utilisation of production capacity in manufacturing declined in both of the first two quarters of 2008. The real value of building plans passed and approved also declined in the past three months. The lower growth trend has also been reflected in asset prices, and the associated negative wealth effects could moderate consumption expenditure growth further. Equity prices have declined in recent weeks as a result of a weaker economy and lower commodity prices. The all-share index on the JSE limited has declined by 7 per cent since the beginning of the year, and by about 13 per cent since the previous MPC meeting. All of the major sub-indices are lower than they were at the beginning of 2008. The housing market is also subdued with both the Absa and Standard Bank indices reflecting negative real house price growth. The global economy is characterised by slowing growth, particularly in the industrialised countries, and intensified inflation pressures. Growth prospects in the United States are being clouded by the persistent weakness in the local housing market and continued financial market uncertainty. Growth in emerging markets also shows some signs of moderation but nevertheless remains relatively strong. Most central banks have recently either adopted a tighter monetary policy stance or have kept their policy rates unchanged. The MPC also noted economic developments in Lesotho. Namibia and Swaziland - South Africa’s Common Monetary Area (CMA) partners. Food and energy price developments have also intensified in these countries, raising inflation to high levels. Recent developments in real sector indicators have been mixed. Government financial balances are supported by high import duty revenue, and government debt levels are well contained. While interest rates throughout the CMA increased significantly over the past two years, it was noted that most recently not all of the countries have tightened monetary policy. The MPC has considered recent economic developments and the outlook for inflation and has concluded that, notwithstanding certain risks to future inflation outcomes, the current monetary policy stance is appropriate. Consequently the repurchase rate will for now remain unchanged at 12 per cent per annum. The Monetary Policy Committee will continue to monitor developments closely and will not hesitate to act to deliver on its mandate."
Peru,2008-08-15,"- MONETARY PROGRAM FOR AUGUST 2008 BCRP RAISES THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE FROM 6.0% TO 6.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to raise the monetary policy interest rate from 6.0 to 6.25 percent, thus accumulating an increase of 175 basis points in this rate since July 2007. Together with the other monetary adjustments implemented since the beginning of this year, these measures are aimed at steering inflation to gradually return to the target range and at preventing that the rises in the international prices of food and fuels may translate into inflation expectations in a context of a higher growth of domestic demand than that of the potential output. Last twelve-month inflation in July was 5.79 percent, influenced mainly by supply factors, particularly the higher prices of food and fuels which together increased 9.2 percent, while the prices of the rest of goods and services showed an increase of 2.2 percent. A moderation in the pace of growth of food prices, a gradual deceleration in the growth of domestic demand to long-term sustainable levels, and lower inflation expectations are expected, and therefore should allow inflation's convergence to the target range. The Board will continue to oversee the evolution of inflation and its determinants, particularly in terms of indicators of demand pressures and expectations of inflation. The Board also reiterates that any required adjustments will be implemented in order to ensure inflation's gradual convergence to the target range. The Board also approved the following annual interest rates on active and passive operations between the BCRP and the financial system: Direct repo and rediscount operations: 7.0 percent. Overnight deposits: 5.50 percent. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 7.0 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for September on its session of September 11."
Georgia,2008-08-20,"Tbilisi. 20 August The Decision of the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Georgia on August 20, 2008 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met today and decided to lower its main policy rate, the one-week Certificate of Deposit (CD) rate, by 100 basis points to 11 percent. The Committee noted that some loosening of monetary policy is needed due to an increase in demand for liquid resources and the possible slowdown in economic activity that has resulted from the recent military operations within the nation. Herewith, the recent projections indicate a decreasing trend in the existing factors of inflation. However, as a result of the abovementioned events, uncertainty around the expected inflation dynamics has increased, since at this stage it is difficult to make projections about important political and economic trends. It must be mentioned that the banking system has demonstrated resilience and robustness towards the recent crisis. Additionally, general increase in risks will cause a decline in the growth of lending, which will reduce inflationary pressures. The worsening investment climate will likely lead to a certain slowdown in capital inflows for the remainder of the year. Also, growth rates in monetary aggregates will continue to slow down. As of August, prices of major commodities on the international markets continue to decline, including those of oil and wheat products. Core inflation has continued to decline as well. Assuming that significant escalation of the conflict will not occur and that commodity prices will be in line with the existing forecasts, the current policy rate will insure that an inflation rate close to 8 percent is achieved by the end of the year. The NBG will closely monitor current developments in the economy and financial markets with the objective of achieving the forecast inflation rate and will in due course act accordingly. The next meeting of the monetary policy committee will take place on September 17, 2008. 1 The reproduction without citing the source is not allowed."
Hungary,2008-08-25,"1 At its meeting on 25 August 2008, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and left the central bank base rate unchanged at 8.50%. The Council discussed the August 2008 issue of the Bank's Quarterly Report on Inflation. In the Council's view, consistent with the projection presented in the Report. Hungarian economic growth will continue to be subdued and inflation will fall slowly over the period to 2010. In the current projection, inflation exceeds the 3 per cent target in 2009, before easing back to it in 2010, as an effect of domestic and foreign cost shocks. The level of output is likely to remain below its potential on the horizon relevant for monetary policy, which, in turn, will help to bring inflation down. Global factors contributed significantly to inflation exceeding the medium-term target throughout the second quarter of 2008. The tightening monetary conditions partly offset the effects of a higher international inflation environment; however, on balance, prices of imported goods in domestic currency terms continued to rise. There has been unfavourable news for global economic activity in recent months. The faster-than-expected slowdown in global activity may contribute to a fall in international commodity and energy prices and, ultimately, to disinflation in Hungary. Aiming to prevent inflation expectations from becoming stuck at a high level continues to be the Monetary Council's most important task. The underlying reason for this is that if economic agents in their wage and pricing decisions relied more heavily on past inflation than the assumption in the current projection, disinflation would be slower and entail higher real economic costs. Taking all these into account, the Monetary Council decided to leave the Bank's key interest rate unchanged. Maintaining tight monetary conditions is justified as long as there are no clear indications, both internationally and domestically, of a sustained decline in upside risks to inflation."
Israel,2008-08-25,"25.8.2008</td> The Bank of Israel increases the interest rate for September 2008 by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for September will increase by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent. This step is taken in the context of the policy of maintaining price stability, in accordance with the inflation target of 1-3 percent a year. Background conditions Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 1.1 percent in July, higher than the forecasts, which had predicted 0.7 percent,and higher than the seasonal path consistent with the inflation target. The main factors contributing to the high index were the surprisingly high increase in the housing component, and the increases in energy, food, and fruit and vegetable prices. The CPI excluding the energy, food, and fruit and vegetables components, and the CPI excluding housing rose by a relatively high 0.9 percent and 0.8 percent respectively in July. In the last twelve months the CPI has risen by 4.8 percent, and the CPI excluding energy, food, and fruit and vegetables has risen by 1.3 percent. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Since the publication of the July CPI. Israeli forecasters expect, on average, that inflation over the next twelve months will be 2.7 percent, compared with 3.2 percent before the publication of the index. Most of them expect that the Bank of Israel interest rate for September will increase by 0.25 percentage points, and that it will remain around the new level during the next twelve months. Inflation expectations for the next twelve months calculated from the capital market rose until mid-July, and reached approximately 3.5 percent. However, following the publication of the June. CPI those expectations fell sharply toabout 2.8 percent, and remained at that level even after the announcement of the surprisingly high July CPI. Current interest rate expectations derived from the capital market are for an increase of 0.25-0.5 percentage points within a year. According to the Bank of Israel forecasts, inflation measured over the previous twelve months is expected to return to the target range within the next twelve months, but is expected to be above its current level for some months before the end of the year. According to one of the Bank of Israel's econometric models, an increase in the interest rate is needed this month to return inflation to the target range in the next twelve months; the second model does not suggest the need for an increase this month. Real economic activity: National Accounts data for the first half of 2008 show continued growth in activity, but at a more moderate rate than before. The GDP increased at an annual rate of 4.2 percent in the second quarter, compared with 5.6 percent in the first. Thus GDP increased in the first half of the year by 5.3 percent, annually, and business sector product by 6.3 percent. In the second quarter goods and services exports increased at an annual rate of 6.6 percent, but the domestic uses (private consumption, public consumption, and investments) particularly private consumption,declined. The index of manufacturing production, which is one of the components of the composite state-of-the-economy index, rose steeply in June, by 5.5 percent, but the overall composite index declined by 0.3 percent in July, due to the fall in the indices of goods and services exports. At the same time the indices for the previous three months were revised upwards. The labor market and wages: The trend data show that the increasein the number of employee posts slowed. In March-May the number increased by 3.6 percent compared with March-May 2007. In the December-May period the increase was 4.1 percent. The average nominal wageper employee post in March-May increased by 4.6 percent compared with March-May 2007. Budget policy: From the beginning of the year to July the government's domestic budget surplus was NIS 4.2 billion. It is expected that in 2008 the budget will be spent in full, and that the deficit will be below the ceiling of 1.6 percent of GDP. However, the downward trend in taxrevenues persists, and in the last few months they have been below the seasonal path consistent with the forecast budget revenues. The budget for 2009 passed by the government, based on a planned increase in expenditure of 1.7 percent, and a deficit of 1 percent of GDP reflects the continuation of a responsible fiscal policy. The foreign exchange market: In the period between 27 July (the date of the previous interest rate discussion) and 24 August, the exchange rate of the shekel against the dollar stayed unchanged, and against the eurothe shekel strengthened by 5.9 percent. This month the dollar strengthenedagainst most major currencies by between 2 percent and 7 percent. In contrast to the trend in the last few months, this month the volatility of the shekel/dollar exchange rate declined. The capital and money markets: From 27 July (the date of the previous interest rate discussion) to 24 August, the Tel Aviv 100 share price index remained almost unchanged, after falling sharply in the previous month. During that period, the leading share indices abroad showed mixed trends.Yields on 10-year unindexed government bonds dropped by 0.15 percentage points to 5.75 percent. Yields on US government 10-year bonds also declined, by 0.2 percentage points, so that the yield gap between the Israeli bonds and US government bonds widened a little to 1.95 percentage points. Israel'ssovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, barely changed, and stood at 0.88 percent, similar to the development in the emerging markets. The world economy: A year after its outbreak, the end of the credit crisis in the advanced economies is not yet in sight. Losses and write-offs in the financial system around the world continue, and recently crossedthe $500 billion mark. In a recently published IMF report, the Fund warns that despite adjustments in the markets and despite steps taken by decision-makers, the financial markets are still in a fragile state, and the indicators of systemic risk remain high. Since the crisis began, forecasts of global growth have fallen, and data relating to the second quarter indicate a marked slowdown in growth in the advanced economies, particularly in Europe. At the same time commodity and energy prices are still falling, although till now these reductions have not affected inflation, which is still rising in the US. Europe and Japan, and which remains high in the eurozone. The Fed, the ECB, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan kept their interest rates unchanged this month (at 2 percent, 4.25 percent, 5 percent, and 0.5 percent respectively). In light of the developments in inflation, growth,and the credit crisis, the markets expect no change in the Fed and the Bank of Japan interest rates till the end of the year, and the start of cuts in the interest rates of the ECB and the Bank of England in the next few months. The main considerations behind the decision The increase in the interest rate for September by 25 basis points is aimed at returning inflation to the target range of 1-3 percent in the next twelve months. Inflation in the last twelve months stands at 4.8 percent, and since the beginning of 2008 has been above the upper limit of the price stability target range of 1-3 percent. Inflation expectations have been in the upper part of the target range, although since the increase in the interest rate for August they have fallen, despite the high CPI in July. However, based on inflation expectations derived from the yield curve, the decline in expectations is based on the assessment that the Bank of Israel will raise the interest rate for September. The Bank of Israel expects that inflation will return to the target range during the second quarter of 2009. Oil and commodity prices have dropped sharply, but this is still a relatively new development. At this time it is difficult to assess how long the fall in priceswill continue, if at all, and to what extent it will affect prices in Israel, against the background of the possible depreciation of the shekel amongother things. Data on real economic activity show signs of continued growth, albeit at a slower ratethan in the last few years. Employment is close to the full employment level and GDP is around its potential level. Further, in March-May thenominal wage increased by a relatively rapid 4.6 percent compared with March-May 2007. In light ofthe high actual and expected inflation rates, the real interest rate on Bank of Israel lending is low. The Bank of Israel will continue to closely monitor developments in the Israeli economy and worldwide, and will act to achieve price stability, which is an essential requirement for sustainable growth. Subject to this, theBank will continue to support the attainment of a range of macroeconomic objectives, in particular the encouragement of employment and growth. In addition, the Bank will continue to support the stability of the financial system. 25.8.2008</td> The Bank of Israel increases the interest rate for September 2008 by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent.

Malaysia,2008-08-25,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to leave the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) unchanged at 3.50 percent. Since the previous MPC meeting, the global economy has weakened further with growing evidence of a deterioration of economic performance across a number of the developed economies. This has been the outcome of financial stress, tight credit conditions, asset market weakness and the impact of higher energy and commodity prices. There are also now signs of moderating growth in several emerging economies. The Malaysian economy has been affected by these developments. Although the export sector has benefited from the high energy and commodity prices, the slower global growth is expected to exert a moderating impact on exports. In addition, domestic demand is being affected by the deflationary impact of higher energy and food prices, the softening labour market conditions, and the more challenging business environment. Domestic inflation is expected to remain high for the remaining part of 2008 and going into early 2009, primarily reflecting the first-round effects of the adjustments in energy prices, and the higher commodity and food prices. Indicators such as the Producer Price Index continue to show that businesses are still facing rising operating costs. However, competitive pressures and slowing demand are likely to contain the pass-through to consumer prices. The recent decline in commodity prices is also likely to ease these cost pressures. Overall, the weaker economic conditions will reduce the likelihood of second-round effects that will generate persistent inflationary trends. The assessment is therefore that inflation is expected to moderate substantially in the second-half of 2009. Consequently, the Bank maintains the assessment that with the expected moderation in inflation in the medium term, the greater priority is to avoid a fundamental downturn in economic activity. The current level of the OPR is consistent with this outlook. Going forward, the Bank will maintain its focus on the medium term outlook for inflation and growth, and will carefully assess global and domestic developments in setting the stance of monetary policy. Bank Negara Malaysia 25 August 2008."
Philippines,2008-08-27,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to increase by 25 basis points the BSP's key policy interest rates to 6 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 8 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs, and special deposit accounts (SDAs) were adjusted accordingly. In its assessment, the Monetary Board recognized that further measured tightening of monetary policy was necessary given the latest forecasts indicating above-target inflation for both 2008 and 2009. Monetary policy needs to be appropriately tight to stabilize inflation to within the target range over the policy horizon, and to help manage inflation expectations. Moreover, fluctuations in international oil prices continue to pose a major risk to the inflation outlook. At the same time, the Monetary Board noted that the emerging inflation outlook reflected the recent easing in global food and oil prices. The declining trend in commodity prices should help moderate inflation pressures. Going forward, the Monetary Board will continue to keep a watchful eye on the balance of risks to the BSP's price stability objective with a view to implementing appropriate policy actions."
Poland,2008-08-27,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 27 August 2008 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 26-27 August 2008 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e. (cid:131) reference rate 6.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate 7.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate 4.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate 6.25% on an annual basis. The Polish economy is still in the period of growth encompassing most of its sectors. However, data released recently confirm earlier signals suggesting that the economic growth is gradually slowing down. At the same time, information on labour market developments points to a sustained high growth of wages and a continuously unfavourable relation between wage and labour productivity growth. Both the national accounts data and other information concerning economic activity in the euro area indicate stronger than expected decline in GDP growth in that region. In the United States, despite favourable data for 2008 Q2, subsequent quarters are expected to see a decline in the economic activity. At the same time, many countries continue to record increased inflation. Recently, oil prices in the world markets have decreased markedly, albeit remaining at a relatively high level. In July the annual growth of consumer prices in Poland rose to 4.8%, remaining above the NBP's inflation target of 2.5% and also above the upper limit for deviations from the target set at 3.5%. The rise in inflation primarily resulted from increased annual growth of prices of food, energy and some services. The Council maintains its assessment that in the coming months inflation will continue above the upper limit for deviations from the inflation target, which will, to a large extent, be the result of high annual growth of administered prices and food prices. In the Council's assessment, in the coming quarters the pressure on wage increases will probably persist, though the gradually slowing economic growth, weakening labour demand and deteriorating financial results of enterprises should be easing the wage pressure and, consequently, also the inflationary pressure. Increased inflation in the coming quarters will, to a large extent, result from the growth of administered prices and also from the food and fuel price growth previously observed in the world economy and affecting the Polish market. Future inflation may also be increased by rising prices of some services, which to some extent may result from the growth of energy prices. Persistently increased inflation creates a risk of inflation expectations remaining at an elevated level and, consequently, feeds the risk of second-round effects. In the medium term, easing of the inflationary pressure may be supported by the considerable slowdown in the global economy and, consequently, also by a decline in economic growth in Poland. The inflationary pressure may still be eased by the import of goods from low-cost ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51, countries. The previous increases of the NBP's interest rates as well as the zloty appreciation observed in the previous period will also contribute to lowering inflation. The Council assessed the probability of inflation overshooting the inflation target in the medium term to be higher than the probability of inflation running below the target. Therefore, the Council does not rule out that bringing inflation down to the target in the medium term would require monetary policy tightening. At the same time, due to the persistence of shocks observed in food and commodity markets, bringing inflation down to the target level may take somewhat longer time. In view of the persisting uncertainty as to the scale of a slowdown in the Polish economy, the Council assessed that a more comprehensive assessment of inflation outlook will be possible after analysing the data released in the near future. The Council is striving to bring inflation down to the inflation target in the medium term. Considering the above, the Council will be closely monitoring the growth and structure of domestic demand, the relation between wage and labour productivity growth in the enterprise sector and wage growth in the public finance sector, the degree of the expansionary fiscal policy stance, zloty exchange rate and developments in the current account balance. The Council will also analyse changes in the external factors affecting the Polish economy and their impact on the outlook for economic growth and inflation in Poland."
Thailand,2008-08-27,"No 34 /2008 Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 27 August 2008 Ms. Duangmanee Vongpradhip. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand, announces that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance. The main issues discussed were as follows. The Thai economy in 2008 Q2 expanded at a slower rate than in the first quarter of the year as a result of the slowdown in domestic demand, including government spending, partly as a result of high inflation. But the downward trend in global oil prices and robust export growth would help to support economic growth going forward. However the MPC assessed that the uncertainties surrounding global economic growth increased and would need to be monitored closely. The decline in oil prices and the effect of the government's measures to alleviate the cost of living would reduce inflationary pressures in the immediate future. However given the elevated level of inflation and inflation expectations, as well as uncertainty of oil prices in the periods ahead, the MPC assessed that the risks to inflation remained an important issue of concern. The MPC therefore decided to raise the policy interest rate by 025 per cent, from 350 per cent to 375 per cent per annum, effective immediately. The MPC deemed that this increase in the policy interest rate would bring domestic interest rates to the levels that would continue to support economic growth."
Chile,2008-09-04,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 4 September 2008 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 50 basis points, to 8.25% (annual). Given the adverse inflationary outlook, this increase in the monetary policy rate is necessary to ensure convergence of inflation toward 3% over the policy horizon. Internationally, output prospects for developed economies remain weak and world financial markets are still under stress. The oil price has continued to fall but, like the prices of other commodities, is still high. Inflationary pressures continue to be present, especially in emerging economies. Domestically, available information on third-quarter economic activity is consistent with prospects that year-on-year economic growth during the second half of 2008 will be significantly higher than in the first. Domestic demand continues to grow at a fast pace, particularly its imported component, and unemployment has remained stable. August inflation was high, although within projections. The different measures of core inflation are still high, confirming that inflationary propagation has been greater than was foreseen a few months back. To date, wage dynamics remain in line with historical patterns. The Board reaffirms its commitment to conduct monetary policy so as to reduce the current high inflation rates to 3% over the policy horizon. This is essential to align the inflationary dynamic with the price stability objective. The future path of the monetary policy rate considers further adjustments to ensure convergence of inflation to the target, at a pace that will depend on incoming information and its implications on projected inflation. * The Spanish original prevails."
Euroarea,2008-09-04,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, at today's meeting we decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The information that has become available since the last meeting has confirmed that annual inflation rates are likely to remain well above levels consistent with price stability for a protracted period of time and that upside risks to price stability over the medium term prevail. While the growth of broad money and credit aggregates is now showing some signs of moderation, the still strong underlying pace of monetary expansion points to continued upside risks to price stability over the medium term. The latest economic data also confirm the weakening of real GDP growth in mid-2008. This reflects partly an expected technical reaction to the strong growth seen in the first quarter as well as dampening effects from global and domestic factors, including direct and indirect effects from high commodity prices. In this environment, it remains imperative to avoid broad-based second-round effects in price and wage-setting. In full accordance with our mandate, we emphasise that maintaining price stability in the medium term is our primary objective and that we are resolute in our determination to keep medium and long-term inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with price stability. This will preserve purchasing power in the medium term and support sustainable growth and employment. On the basis of our assessment, the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our objective. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. According to Eurostat's first estimate, following strong quarterly growth of 0.7% in the first quarter, euro area real GDP contracted by 0.2% in the second quarter of 2008. In terms of quarter-on-quarter growth, private consumption declined by 0.2% and there was a perceptible weakness in investment, which fell by 1.2%. Growth in both euro area imports and exports declined by 0.4%. Taking into account all available information, the euro area economy is currently experiencing an episode of weak activity characterised by high commodity prices weighing on consumer confidence and demand, as well as by dampened investment growth. In particular, if persistent, the fall in oil prices from their peak in July will help strengthen real disposable income, with the level of employment remaining high and the unemployment rate low by historical standards. Moreover, growth in the world economy is expected to remain relatively resilient, benefiting mainly from sustained growth in emerging economies. This should support external demand for euro area goods and services and thereby investment. This outlook is also reflected in the September 2008 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. The exercise projects average annual real GDP growth in a range between 1.1% and 1.7% in 2008, and between 0.6% and 1.8% in 2009. In comparison with the June Eurosystem staff projections, real GDP growth figures for 2008 and 2009 are lower. In the view of the Governing Council, the uncertainty surrounding this outlook for economic activity is particularly high at the current juncture and, generally, downside risks prevail. Risks stem particularly from renewed increases in energy and food prices, which could dampen consumption and investment. Moreover, downside risks continue to relate to the potential for the financial market tensions to affect the real economy more adversely than currently foreseen. The possibility of disorderly developments owing to global imbalances also implies downside risks to the outlook for economic activity, as do concerns about rising protectionist pressures. With regard to price developments, annual HICP inflation has remained considerably above the level consistent with price stability since last autumn, standing at 3.8% in August according to Eurostat's flash estimate, after 4.0% in June and July 2008. This worrying level of inflation is largely the result of both the direct and indirect effects of past surges in energy and food prices at the global level. Moreover, wage growth has been picking up in recent quarters, at a time when labour productivity growth has decelerated, resulting in sharp increases in unit labour costs. Looking ahead, on the basis of current commodity futures prices, the annual HICP inflation rate is likely to remain well above levels consistent with price stability for quite some time, moderating only gradually during the course of 2009. Consistent with this view, the September ECB staff projections foresee average annual HICP inflation at between 3.4% and 3.6% in 2008, and between 2.3% and 2.9% in 2009. The higher inflation projections for 2008 and 2009 mainly reflect higher energy prices and, to a lesser extent, higher food and services prices than assumed previously. In this context, it is important to recall the conditional nature of the ECB staff projections. They are based on a number of assumptions that are of a purely technical nature and unrelated to policy intentions. In particular, the technical assumptions for short-term interest rates reflect market expectations as at mid-August. Moreover, it should be noted that the projections are based on the assumption that oil and non-oil commodity prices, while remaining at elevated levels, will exhibit greater stability over the projection horizon than has been the case in recent months, in line with prevailing futures prices. It is the Governing Council's view that, at the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, there are upside risks to the outlook for price developments. These risks include the possibility of renewed increases in commodity prices and of previous rises having further and stronger indirect effects on consumer prices. There is particularly a very strong concern that the emergence of broad-based second-round effects in price and wage-setting behaviour could add significantly to inflationary pressures. Moreover, the upside risks to price stability could be aggravated by unexpected rises in indirect taxes and administered prices. Against this background, it is imperative to ensure that medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels in line with price stability. Broad-based second-round effects stemming from the impact of higher energy and food prices on price and wage-setting behaviour must be avoided. The Governing Council is monitoring price-setting behaviour and wage negotiations in the euro area with particular attention. All parties concerned  in both the private and the public sectors  must meet their responsibilities in this regard. The Governing Council has repeatedly expressed its concern about the existence of schemes in which nominal wages are indexed to consumer prices. Such schemes involve the risk of upward shocks in inflation leading to a wage-price spiral, which would be detrimental to employment and competitiveness in the countries concerned. The Governing Council calls for these schemes to be abolished. The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons. In line with our monetary policy strategy, we take the view that the sustained underlying strength of monetary and credit expansion in the euro area over the past few years has created upside risks to price stability. Over recent quarters, these risks appear to have become manifest as inflation has trended upwards. Not least in the face of the ongoing tensions in financial markets, the monetary analysis helps to support the necessary medium-term orientation of monetary policy by focusing attention on the upside risks to price stability prevailing at medium to longer horizons. While the growth of broad money and credit aggregates is now showing some signs of moderation, reflecting the policy measures taken since 2005 to address risks to price stability, the strong underlying pace of monetary expansion points to continued upside risks to price stability over the medium term. The currently flat yield curve has given rise to a substitution from longer maturity assets into monetary instruments, which offer similar remuneration but greater liquidity and less risk. This substitution has led the current headline rate of M3 growth to overstate the underlying pace of monetary expansion. At the same time, shifts out of overnight deposits drove the annual growth rate of M1 down further in July. These effects, as well as other temporary factors, must be taken into account when assessing monetary developments and their implications. A broad-based analysis of the data, taking the appropriate medium-term perspective and allowing for these considerations, confirms the underlying strength of money growth. In particular, the pace, maturity and sectoral composition of borrowing from banks suggest that, at the level of the euro area as a whole, the availability of bank credit has, as yet, not been significantly affected by the ongoing financial tensions. This notwithstanding, growth in loans now shows signs of moderation, as previously anticipated, with corporate demand for credit slowing. At the same time, the growth of loans to households continues to follow the downward trend observed over the past few years, as a result of higher short-term interest rates and housing market weakness in several parts of the euro area. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis clearly confirms the assessment of upside risks to price stability over the medium term. The information that has become available since the last meeting of the Governing Council has confirmed that annual inflation rates are likely to remain well above levels consistent with price stability for a protracted period of time. The growth of broad money and credit aggregates is now showing some signs of moderation, but the still strong underlying pace of monetary expansion points to continued risks to price stability over the medium term. The latest economic data also confirm the weakening of real GDP growth in mid-2008. This reflects partly an expected technical reaction to the strong growth seen in the first quarter as well as dampening effects from global and domestic factors, including direct and indirect effects from high commodity prices. Against this background, it remains imperative to avoid broad-based second-round effects in wage and price-setting. In full accordance with our mandate, we emphasise that maintaining price stability in the medium term is our primary objective and that we are resolute in our determination to keep medium and long-term inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with price stability, thereby preserving purchasing power in the medium term and supporting sustainable growth and employment in the euro area. On the basis of our assessment, the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our objective. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Regarding fiscal policy, budget plans for 2009 should fully reflect existing policy commitments. This implies that euro area countries with relatively large fiscal deficits need to specify much more ambitious and concrete consolidation measures, especially on the expenditure side. Countries that have already achieved their medium-term budgetary objectives need to ensure that they maintain sound structural fiscal positions. At the current juncture, the steady pursuit of stability-oriented fiscal policies would help to contain inflationary pressures and provide the required budgetary room for manoeuvre to allow automatic stabilisers to contribute to smoothing the business cycle. Turning to structural policies, measures that reduce adjustment costs and promote moderate unit labour cost growth are of the utmost importance in the current economic circumstances. While this is crucial in all euro area countries, it is particularly pressing in those that have experienced a significant loss of cost and price competitiveness over recent years and where unemployment has already started to rise. Moreover, fostering productivity through enhanced investment in innovation and education enlarges the scope for increases in real incomes in the longer run."
South Korea,2008-09-11,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (5.25%) for the intermeeting period. (The following is an English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the Base Rate at its current level (5.25%) for the intermeeting period. Domestic economic activity has continued to slacken owing to lackluster domestic demand that the sustained buoyancy of exports has failed to offset. A high degree of uncertainty still surrounds future economic developments, largely due to international financial market unrest and the US economic slowdown. Consumer price inflation slowed slightly due to the decline in international oil prices, but it seems likely to remain at a high level for quite some time. The upward trend of real estate prices, however, has been blunted. Liquidity is still ample in the financial markets and financial institutions' lending continues to show a steady increase. Meanwhile, financial market price variables have shown high volatility, mainly reflecting market participants' unease."
Peru,2008-09-15,"- MONETARY PROGRAM FOR SEPTEMBER 2008 BCRP RAISES THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE FROM 6.25% TO 6.50% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to raise the monetary policy interest rate from 6.25 to 6.50 percent, thus accumulating an increase of 200 basis points in this rate since July 2007. Together with the other monetary adjustments implemented since the beginning of this year, these measures are aimed at steering inflation to gradually return to the target range and at preventing that the rises in the international prices of food and fuels may translate into inflation expectations in a context of a higher growth of domestic demand than that of the potential output. Last twelve-month inflation in August was 6.27 percent, influenced mainly by supply factors, particularly the higher prices of food, fuels and electricity, which together increased 9.2 percent, while the prices of the rest of goods and services showed an increase of 2.64 percent. However, a reduction is being observed in the international prices of food inputs and fuels, originated in the slowing of industrialized economies, and should be reflected in domestic prices. Together with the slower pace of growth expected in the expansion of domestic demand and in inflation expectations, this trend should allow inflation's convergence to the target range. The Board will continue to oversee the evolution of inflation and its determinants, particularly in terms of indicators of demand pressures and expectations of inflation, and will continue to adjust the monetary stance to ensure inflation's gradual convergence to the target range. The Board also approved the following annual interest rates on active and passive operations between the BCRP and the financial system: Direct repo and rediscount operations: 7.25 percent. Overnight deposits: 5.75 percent. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 7.25 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for October on its session of October The BCRP will publish its third Inflation Report this year on October 17."
United States,2008-09-16,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 2 percent. Strains in financial markets have increased significantly and labor markets have weakened further. Economic growth appears to have slowed recently, partly reflecting a softening of household spending. Tight credit conditions, the ongoing housing contraction, and some slowing in export growth are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters. Over time, the substantial easing of monetary policy, combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity, should help to promote moderate economic growth. Inflation has been high, spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities. The Committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year, but the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain. The downside risks to growth and the upside risks to inflation are both of significant concern to the Committee. The Committee will monitor economic and financial developments carefully and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; Christine M Cumming; Elizabeth A Duke; Richard W Fisher; Donald L Kohn; Randall S Kroszner; Sandra Pianalto; Charles I Plosser; Gary H Stern; and Kevin M Warsh. Ms. Cumming voted as the alternate for Timothy F Geithner."
Georgia,2008-09-17,"The Decision of the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Georgia on September 17, 2008 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia decided during its meeting on September 17 to leave its Main Policy Rate, the Refinancing Loan Rate, unchanged at 10 percent. The Committee noted that since its unscheduled meeting on September 12 there are certain positive trends in the banking sector, especially in the growth of deposits. Risks to financial stability have decreased considerably as well. Despite the adequate amount of liquidity which currently exists in the banking system, commercial banks need additional time to evaluate the risks and adjust to the new environment, due to which credit creation has slowed. Money supply decreased considerably during the recent military conflict, a factor which should have a positive effect on the reduction in the general level of prices. However a sharp or a less than expected change in the money supply may have a negative effect on economic growth and on the inflation rate of the following periods. The proposed supplement budget, which envisages increase in the deficit in the amount of of GEL 500 million, will help to increase the money supply. The Board of the International Monetary Fund approved on September 15 a loan in the amount of USD 750 million for Georgia, under the 18-month stand-by arrangement, which is designed to support the Balance of Payment. It is expected that the approval of the stand-by program will increase investor confidence which should help the Georgian companies in attracting foreign capital from international markets. The existing inflation risks have not changed since the last meeting of the MPC. Prices of the main commodity groups, including those of oil and wheat products, have continued to decline. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will take place on October 15, 2008."
Egypt,2008-09-18,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release September 18, 2008 The Central Bank of Egypt decided to raise its overnight deposit by 50 bps to 115 percent per annu. The discount rate was also raised by 50 bps to 115 percent per annu. In its meeting held on September 18, 2008, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise the overnight deposit and lending rates by 50 bps to 115 percent and 135 percent, respectivel. While the headline CPI inflation reached 236% in August compared to 221% in July, the monthly pace of acceleration in food prices excluding fruits and vegetables almost halved, falling from an average of 388% between January and May 2008 to 168% over the last three month. This comes on the backdrop of the decline in international food prices (particularly wheat), imposing a temporary ban on local rice exports and scrapping import tariffs on some basic staple food product. Nonetheless non-food inflation remains hig. The declining trend in international food prices suggest that the international food price shock might be wanin. Nonetheless the impact on domestic food inflation might not be fully reflected given downward price rigidities in domestic market. Moreover the MPC is mindful of the underlying inflationary pressure. Having weighed both the international and domestic information available, the MPC judges that an additional rate hike is needed today to contain inflation expectation. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments, especially the factors underlying inflation, and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter.

Nigeria,2008-09-18,"Central Bank of Nigeria's Communique No. 58 of the Monetary Policy Committee. September 18, 2008 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) held a special meeting on September 18, 2008, essentially to review the stance of monetary policy in the light of the evolving economic and financial developments in the domestic and international economies. The international financial markets are presently marked by a high degree of uncertainty. The financial stress and weaknesses of a number of financial institutions in the US and European economies have highlighted the need to look into the financial soundness of financial institutions all over the world. Stock markets in all the continents have reacted strongly with equity prices drifting downwards and trading volumes falling. number of existing financial institutions have also now come under intense public scrutiny. Credit crunch continues to persist in most industrialized economies forcing central banks in these countries to provide substantial financial support. The financial crisis has slowed down the industrialized economies. Reflecting the sharp fall in demand, crude oil prices have been softening in the international markets in recent weeks (below US$ 1 100 per barrel), even as consumer inflation continues to be relatively high in relation to target levels. The policy makers in these countries are presently concerned mainly with managing risk in the financial sector and reviving growth. In view of the growing financial and real linkages with the rest of the world. Nigeria cannot afford to be unmindful of the international financial developments. However the economic fundamentals remain very strong and therefore the impact of the global financial turmoil is expected to be limited. Foreign exchange reserves are high at US $630 billion, representing about 16 months of total foreign exchange disbursements. Inflow of foreign investment remained strong at about US$ 85 billion by the end of August 2008, compared to US$ 58 billion for the corresponding period of 2007. The Committee noted that while headline inflation and food prices have been on the increase, core inflation has been in single digit. The outlook on output for 2008 is strong, with non-oil GDP growing at over 8 per cent. The Committee acknowledges that growth in M2 and credit to the private sector have been high. Credit to the core private sector grew at 706 per cent at annualized rate by end of August 2008. However the increase in interest rates 2 in August was mainly due to pressure of liquidity in the financial markets in general and in the inter-bank market in particular. In order to lubricate the system, the MPC has decided to ensure that the financial system remains liquid. The MPC accordingly, took the following decisions: 1. reduce the MPR from 1025 per cent to 975 per cent; 2. reduce CRR from 4 per cent to 2 per cent with immediate effect; 3. reduce the liquidity ratio from 40 per cent to 30 per cent; 4. allow repo transactions against eligible securities for 90 days, 180 days and 360 days; and 5. the CBN will now buy and sell securities through the two- way quotes. The CBN will continue to monitor developments in both domestic and international economies and will be ready to take appropriate actions to ensure the smooth functioning of the financial markets and the economy in general.

Turkiye,2008-09-18,"The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) has decided to keep policy rates unchanged as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 16.75 percent, and lending rate at 20.25 percent, b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 12.75 percent, lending rate at 23.25 percent, c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 19.25 percent. Recent readings indicate a significant slowdown in domestic economic activity. Ongoing problems in international credit markets and the global economy continue to restrain both the domestic and external demand. Moreover, favorable outlook in food prices and the sharp decline in oil prices will support disinflation. Accordingly, inflation is expected to continue to fall gradually in the forthcoming period. The Committee assessed that the course of oil and food prices has been closer to the optimistic scenario outlined in the July Inflation Report and reiterated that the current level of the policy rate is supportive of disinflation. Therefore, a measured rate cut will be considered should the favorable outlook in inflation and commodity prices continue. Yet, recently heightened uncertainties in the global financial markets require monetary policy to remain cautious. Future decisions on policy rates will depend on domestic and external demand, developments in global markets, fiscal policy implementation, and other factors affecting the medium term inflation outlook. It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight working days."
Israel,2008-09-22,"22.9.2008</td> The Bank of Israel keeps the interest rate for October 2008 unchanged at 4.25 percent The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for October will remain unchanged at 4.25 percent. Background conditions Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.8 percent in August, close to the top end of the forecasts, and above the seasonal path consistent with the inflation target. The August index excluding housing rose by 0.1 percent. In the last twelve months the CPI rose by 5 percent; the index excluding food, energy, and fruit and vegetables rose by 2.1 percent in the last twelve months, and by 1.1 percent in August. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Last month the downward trend in inflation expectations for the next twelve months calculated from the capital market continued, and they are currently around the midpoint of the target range, having peaked at 3.2 percent in July. Since mid-September expectations have fallen further, to below 2 percent. Forecasters expect, on average, that inflation over the next twelve months will be 2.9 percent, compared with their previous estimate of 3.2 percent. The expectations derived from the Makam market show that since the publication of the latest CPI, the capital market does not expect a change in the interest rate in the next twelve months. However, inflation over the preceding twelve months is likely to rise in the next months above its current level of 5 percent, declining in the first half of 2009 and returning to within the target range. Most forecasters expect no change in the interest rate for October. According to one of the Bank of Israel's econometric models, a cut in the interest rate to 3.9 percent will be required in the fourth quarter of 2008,and with the exchange rate at its current level and following the drop in commodity and oil prices, inflation in the next twelve months will be 1.6 percent. The Bank's other econometric model shows that by the end of 2008 and during 2009 the interest rate will have to rise, and that inflation in the next twelve months will be 3 percent. This model gives greater weight to the fact that the economy is close to full employment and to the high rate of inflation in the last few months. Real economic activity: Real economic activity remains at a high level, although several indicators point to a slower rate of growth. The composite state-of-the-economy index for August rose by 0.1 percent, and the indices for the months from May to August have all been close to zero. The manufacturing production index, one of the components of the composite index, fell by 0.8 percent in July, after rising by 4.3 percent in June. Indirect tax revenues have dropped in the last few months. According to the Bank of Israel's most recent macroeconomic forecasts, the rate of growthwill slow in the second half of 2008 to an annual rate of 2.5 percent. The labor market and wages: The rate of unemployment declined in the second quarter by 0.3 percentage points to 5.9 percent. The fact that the economy is almost at full employment is reflected in the fall of the rate of unemployment to its lowest level for 20 years, in the increase in employment of unskilled workers, and in an increase in the real wage. The real wage per employee post increased by 1.4 percent in the first half of the year. The nominal wage per employee post went up by 5.2 percent (seasonally adjusted, in annual terms) in the period from April to June, compared with April-June 2007. Budget policy: From the beginning of the year to August the government's domestic budget surplus was NIS 3.4 billion higher than theseasonal path consistent with deficit ceiling of 1.6 percent of GDP, despite the drop in tax revenues. Tax revenues from the beginning of the year toAugust, after deducting the effects of a change in tax rates and non-recurring receipts, were 0.9 percent lower in real terms than in the equivalent period in 2007, mainly due to a sharp fall in receipts of corporation tax and tax on the capital market. Indirect tax revenues, on the other hand, rose by a real 3.4 percent. The foreign exchange market: In the period between 24 August (thedate of the previous interest rate discussion) and 21 September, the shekel weakened by 0.5 percent against the dollar, and strengthened against the euro by 2.7 percent. This weakening of the shekel against the dollar was more moderate than that of other currencies around the world, with the dollarstrengthening by up to 7 percent against most of the major currencies. The capital and money markets: From 24 August (the date of the previous interest rate discussion) to 21 September, the leading share indicesabroad dropped sharply, with a sharp rise in their volatility. In the emerging markets the falls ranged from 3 percent to 13 percent. The Tel Aviv 25 share price index also fell by a steep 11 percent. Yesterday, 21 September, there was a sharp reversal, with the Tel Aviv 25 index surging by more than 8 percent and other share indices around the world recording gains of between 5 percent and 10 percent. Yields on 10-year unindexed government bonds rose by 0.1 percentage points to 6.03 percent. Yields on US government 10-year bonds continued to fall, dropping this month by 0.1 percentage pointsto 3.77 percent, so that the yield gap between the Israeli bonds and US government bonds widened to 2.26 percentage points. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, increased markedly from 0.88 percent prior to the previous interest rate decision (on 24 August) to 1.07 percent, after reaching--in the course of the previous week--its highest level since the outbreak of the crisis. The CDS spreads in emerging markets also widened sharply, with most of the rise occurring after the announcement of the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers.</td> The world economy: There has recently been a considerable furtherdeterioration in the global financial crisis. The collapse of Lehman Brothers and disturbing news about other institutions unsettled the markets again. Share prices fell sharply again, the various risk indices rose, spreads reached record levels, and US Treasury bills were traded with negative yields. This resulted in the Department of the Treasury and the Federal Reserveintroducing several measures aimed at dealing with the problems of the financial system and the financial markets. A few days ago the US administration took a step that surpassed all the previous ones, when the Treasury announced that it would ask for congressional approval to buy problem assets from the financial institutions in the amount of about $ 700 billion. Economic activity: The global slowdown is spreading, and is now evident in almost all markets. The key question is how long the global slowdown in growth will last, and how severe will it be. That said, most forecasters are more optimistic about the US economy than they are about the other G 7 countries, partly due to the determined steps taken by the US Treasury and the Federal Reserve to end the crisis. Nevertheless, it is generally expected that the slowdown will become more severe. Inflation: The fall in commodity prices, and mainly in oil prices which this month dropped to below $100 a barrel for the first time in six months, together with the worsening economic slowdown and the severe credit crisis--which together are expected to return inflation to its target in most economies: led to cuts in interest rates in several countries and to a higher probability of reductions in many others. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to leave the interest rate for October unchanged is aimed at returning inflation to the target range of 1-3 percent in the next twelve months, and emerges from the various considerations involving inflation, the higher uncertainty in the financial markets, and real developments in Israel's economy. Inflation in the last twelve months stands at 5 percent, above the upper limit of the price stability target range. However, the decline in global commodity and energy prices in the last two months is likely to help to reduce inflation in Israel and abroad. Against this background, and the background of the latest increases in the interest rate by the Bank of Israel, inflation expectations for the next twelve months derived from the capital market and thoseof the private forecasters are now within the target range. The financial crisis in the US worsened recently, and around the world and in Israel uncertainty and the volatility of financial assets increased. Israel's economy is close to full employment. Several indicators, however, suggest that the rate of growth in real activity is slowing--the decline in recent months in indirect tax revenues, the very moderatechanges in the composite state-of-the-economy index, and the low level of demand for private consumption and investment. Labor market data, showing the increase in demand for workers and employment, indicate that real economic activity in Israel is still at a high level. The Bank of Israel will continue to closely monitor Israeli and worldwide economic developments, and will take whatever steps are necessary to achieve price stability, which is an essential requirement for sustainable growth, and to support the stability of the financial system. Subject to this, the Bank will continue to support the attainment of a range of macroeconomic objectives, in particular employment and growth. 22.9.2008</td> The Bank of Israel keeps the interest rate for October 2008 unchanged at 4.25 percent.

Poland,2008-09-24,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 24 September 2008 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 23-24 September 2008 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e. (cid:131) reference rate 6.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate 7.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate 4.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate 6.25% on an annual basis. Data released recently suggest that  despite better than expected data on GDP in 2008 Q2 - economic growth may markedly decline in the coming quarters. At the same time, information on labour market developments points to a sustained high growth of wages and a continuously unfavourable relation between wage and labour productivity growth. Information concerning economic activity in the euro area indicates a continuing marked decline in GDP growth in that region. In the United States subsequent quarters are still expected to see further slowdown in economic activity. Additionally, intensified turmoil in the financial markets observed recently is likely to deepen the economic slowdown in the external environment of the Polish economy. At the same time, many countries continue to record increased, yet falling, inflation. Recently, oil prices in the world markets have continued to decrease. In August the annual growth of consumer prices in Poland was below expectations and stayed at 4.8%, remaining above the NBP's inflation target of 2.5% and also above the upper limit for deviations from the target set at 3.5%. Inflation remaining at an elevated level resulted primarily from high, albeit declining, annual growth of food and fuel prices and increasing growth of prices of energy and some services. The Council maintains its assessment that in the coming months inflation will continue above the upper limit for deviations from the inflation target, which will, to a large extent, be the result of high annual growth of food prices and administered prices including energy prices. In the Council's assessment, in the coming quarters the pressure on wage increases will probably persist, although the gradually declining economic growth, probably below potential output growth, weakening labour demand and deteriorating financial results of enterprises should be easing the wage pressure and, consequently, also the inflationary pressure. Increased inflation in the coming quarters will, to a large extent, result from the growth of administered prices and from the growth of food and fuel prices previously observed in the world economy and affecting the Polish market. Future inflation may also be increased by rising prices of some services, which, to some extent, may result from the growth of energy prices. Persistently increased inflation creates a risk of inflation expectations remaining at an elevated level and, consequently, feeds the risk of second- round effects. ul.

In the medium term, easing of the inflationary pressure will be supported by the considerable slowdown in the global economy and, consequently, also by a decline in economic growth in Poland. The inflationary pressure may continue to be eased by the import of goods from low-cost countries. The previous increases of the NBP's interest rates as well as the earlier zloty appreciation will also contribute to lowering inflation. The Council assessed the probability of inflation overshooting the inflation target in the medium term to be higher than the probability of inflation running below the target. Therefore, the Council does not rule out that bringing inflation down to the target in the medium term will require monetary policy tightening. In view of the persisting uncertainty as to the scale of the slowdown in the Polish economy, the Council assessed that a more comprehensive assessment of the inflation outlook would be possible after analysing the data released in the near future and the October projection of inflation and GDP. The Council is striving to bring inflation down to the inflation target in the medium term. Considering the above, the Council will be closely monitoring the growth and structure of domestic demand, the relation between wage and labour productivity growth in the enterprise sector and wage growth in the public finance sector, the degree of the expansionary fiscal policy stance, the zloty exchange rate and developments in the current account balance. The Council will also analyse changes in the external factors affecting the Polish economy and their impact on the outlook for economic growth and inflation in Poland. The Council has adopted a resolution on the Monetary Policy Guidelines for 2009 which took account of the results of the Monetary Policy Council meeting with the Prime Minister and the Government representatives held on 16 September 2008 devoted to the possibility of Poland joining the euro area. Moreover. The Council has approved the Forecast of the Balance of Payments of the Republic of Poland for 2009 together with the International Investment Position of Poland in 2007."
Romania,2008-09-25,"In its meeting of September 25, 2008, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided the following:. The NBR Board is restating that it will vigilantly monitor developments in macroeconomic indicators, both domestically and internationally, and will adjust its instruments so as to ensure a consolidation of the disinflation process in order to achieve medium-term inflation targets in a sustainable manner. The analysis of the latest macroeconomic developments confirms the anticipated resumption of the disinflation process as well as an acceleration of economic growth in the context of persistently fast increases in both investment and consumption, as well as a slower rising negative contribution of net exports. The inflation rate dropped to an annual 8.02 percent in August from a peak of 9.04 percent in the previous month. The return of inflation to a downward path reflects tighter broad monetary conditions, a favourable base effect, as well as lower prices of fuel and some food products and cheaper telephony rates. The adjusted annual CORE2 inflation rate - calculated by excluding the impact of administered and volatile prices (vegetables, fruit, eggs and fuel) as well as the effect of vice tax - fell to 7.4 percent in August from 8.1 percent in July for the first time since July 2007. Nevertheless, the forecasted increase in annual consumer prices will continue to be significantly above the upper limit of the variation band around the 2008 inflation target, requiring the maintenance of a tight monetary policy stance for a longer period. Moreover, the macroeconomic risks to the disinflation process, especially those related to income policy and to increased budget spending in the electoral period, remain on the upside. Meanwhile, the dynamics of loans to the private sector stay high, even though credit expansion is starting to exhibit some signs of moderation. In light of the available data, the NBR Board has decided to keep the monetary policy rate unchanged at 10.25 percent per annum. This measure will lead to increased restrictiveness of broad monetary conditions in real terms in order to ensure the achievement of medium-term disinflation objectives in a sustainable manner. The NBR Board has also decided to pursue a firm management of money market liquidity via open-market operations as well as to leave unchanged the existing minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. Moreover, the NBR Board considers that ensuring a sustainable disinflation process and anchoring medium-term expectations not only call for maintaining monetary policy restrictiveness through an appropriate dosage of its instruments, but also require strong support from other components of the macroeconomic policy mix, especially income and fiscal policies. The heightened turbulences on world financial markets have had a limited impact so far on the Romanian banking sector, reflected mainly by increased external financing costs. Meanwhile, liquidity in the banking sector, albeit declining, remains at an adequate level in order to ensure a good functioning of markets, while the measures adopted by the NBR in August are aimed at improving prudential supervision and increasing the transparency of lending and risk management policies of credit institutions. The next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for October 30, 2008, when a new quarterly Inflation Report will be examined and approved."
Euroarea,2008-10-02,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses, at today's meeting the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We discussed extensively the recent intensification of the financial market turmoil and its possible impact on economic activity and inflation, recognising the extraordinarily high level of uncertainty stemming from latest developments. In this context, we stressed the crucial importance of keeping inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with our objective. Price stability fosters an efficient allocation of resources, contains inflation risk premia and longer-term financing costs, and preserves the purchasing power of our currency. In so doing, it supports sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. The most recent data clearly confirm that economic activity in the euro area is weakening, with contracting domestic demand and tighter financing conditions. At the same time, annual inflation rates are likely to remain well above levels consistent with price stability for some time. With the weakening of demand, upside risks to price stability have diminished somewhat, but they have not disappeared. While the still strong underlying pace of monetary expansion points to upside risks to price stability over the medium term, the growth of broad money and credit aggregates is showing some further signs of moderation. It is imperative to avoid broad-based second-round effects in price and wage-setting. All parties concerned face exceptional challenges and are called upon to meet their responsibilities Accordingly, we confirm that we remain determined to secure price stability in the medium term and will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. When analysing current developments in economic activity, it needs to be stressed that we face an extraordinarily high degree of uncertainty, in large part stemming from the recent intensification of the financial market turmoil. This complicates any assessment of the near to medium-term economic prospects. As the world economy as a whole is feeling the adverse effects of the intensified and prolonged financial market turmoil, the most recent data clearly confirm that economic activity in the euro area is weakening, with contracting domestic demand and tighter financing conditions. The fall in oil prices from their peak in July and ongoing growth in emerging market economies might support a gradual recovery in the course of 2009. In the view of the Governing Council, the economic outlook is subject to increased downside risks, mainly stemming from a scenario of ongoing financial market tensions affecting the real economy more adversely than currently foreseen. Other downside risks relate to the possibility of renewed increases in highly volatile energy and food prices, disorderly developments owing to global imbalances and rising protectionist pressures. With regard to price developments, annual HICP inflation has remained considerably above the level consistent with price stability since last autumn, standing at 3.6% in September according to Eurostat's flash estimate, after 3.8% in August. This still worrying level of inflation is largely the consequence of both the direct and indirect effects of past surges in energy and food prices at the global level. Moreover, wage growth has been picking up rather strongly in recent quarters, in spite of a weaker growth momentum and at a time when labour productivity growth has decelerated. This resulted in a sharp increase in the year-on-year unit labour cost  to 3.4%  in the second quarter of this year, after several years of more moderate increases in the order of 1-1½%. Looking ahead, on the basis of current commodity futures prices, annual HICP inflation rates are likely to remain well above levels consistent with price stability for some time, moderating gradually during the course of 2009. At the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, taking into account the weakening in demand, upside risks to price stability have diminished somewhat, but they have not disappeared. They include the possibility of previous commodity price rises having further and stronger indirect effects on consumer prices, as well as a renewed increase in commodity prices. In particular, there is a very strong concern that the emergence of broad-based second-round effects in price and wage-setting behaviour could add significantly to inflationary pressures. Moreover, unexpected rises in indirect taxes and administered prices could occur. Against this background, it is imperative to ensure that medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels in line with price stability. This is all the more the case in an environment of very high uncertainty. Broad-based second-round effects stemming from the impact of past energy and food price increases on price and wage-setting behaviour must be avoided. The Governing Council is monitoring price-setting behaviour and wage negotiations in the euro area with particular attention. We have repeatedly expressed our concern about the existence of schemes in which nominal wages are indexed to consumer prices. Such schemes involve the risk of upward shocks in inflation leading to a wage-price spiral, which would be detrimental to employment and competitiveness in the countries concerned. The Governing Council calls for these schemes to be abolished. Turning to the monetary analysis, we need to recognise that the latest monetary data refer to the end of August and thus do not yet embody the impact of the recent intensification of the financial market turmoil. As a general observation, previous episodes suggest that financial market tensions can have a relatively limited impact on monetary developments, but they have also been associated with large portfolio shifts and thus have exerted significant influence on monetary data. While the still strong underlying pace of monetary expansion points to upside risks to price stability over the medium term, data up to August show that the growth of broad money and credit aggregates moderated over the past few months, reflecting the monetary policy decisions taken since 2005 to address risks to price stability. As a more detailed examination shows, the flat yield curve and the structure of bank deposit rates have led to a number of substitution effects. First, there has been a substitution from longer-term maturity assets into instruments covered by M3, which offer similar remuneration but greater liquidity and less risk. As a consequence, the annual growth rate of M3 probably overstates the underlying pace of monetary expansion. Second, there have been substitution effects within M3. In contrast to the dynamic developments in M3, annual M1 growth has fallen to very low levels. This reflects relatively attractive interest rates for time deposits, which have increased the opportunity cost of holding cash or overnight deposits. Although, at the level of the euro area as a whole, the availability of bank credit has, as yet, not been significantly affected by the ongoing financial tensions, the gradual moderation of growth in loans continued in the August data, as previously anticipated, with corporate demand for credit slowing. At the same time, the growth of loans to households continues to follow the downward trend observed over the past few years, as a result of higher short-term interest rates and housing market weakness in several parts of the euro area. To sum up, we discussed extensively the recent intensification of the financial market turmoil and its possible impact on economic activity and inflation, recognising the extraordinarily high level of uncertainty stemming from latest developments. In this context, we stressed how crucial it is for monetary policy to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with our objective. Price stability fosters an efficient allocation of resources, contains inflation risk premia and longer-term financing costs, and preserves the purchasing power of our currency. In so doing, it supports sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. The most recent data clearly confirm that economic activity in the euro area is weakening, with contracting domestic demand and tighter financing conditions. The cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis clearly confirms that annual inflation rates are likely to remain well above levels consistent with price stability for some time and, when taking into account the weakening of demand, that upside risks to price stability have diminished somewhat, but they have not disappeared. While the still strong underlying pace of monetary expansion points to upside risks to price stability over the medium term, the growth of broad money and credit aggregates is showing some further signs of moderation. It is imperative to avoid broad-based second-round effects in price and wage-setting. All parties concerned face exceptional challenges and are called upon to meet their responsibilities Accordingly, we confirm that we remain determined to secure price stability in the medium term and will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Regarding fiscal policy, in the current situation of continuing economic uncertainty, it is essential that governments abide by the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact and ensure the sustainability of public finances. Maintaining sound public finances will enable governments to let automatic stabilisers operate freely and thus contribute to smoothing the economic cycle and to supporting private sector confidence. Turning to structural policies, measures that foster competition and flexibility and promote moderate unit labour cost growth are of the utmost importance in the current economic circumstances. While moderate unit labour cost growth is crucial in all euro area countries, it is particularly pressing in those that have experienced a significant loss of cost and price competitiveness over recent years and where unemployment has already started to rise. Moreover, labour market reforms fostering employment and investment and promoting skills, innovation and efficiency remain essential to support growth and real incomes in the longer term."
Philippines,2008-10-05,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the BSP's key policy interest rates at 6 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 8 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs, and special deposit accounts (SDAs) were also left unchanged. In its assessment, the Monetary Board considered the improving inflation outlook which indicates that inflation will decelerate to single-digit levels by the first quarter of 2009 to reach the target-consistent path by 2010. The Board also took into consideration global and regional economic and financial developments. At this point, the monetary authorities have the latitude to keep policy settings steady. Food and energy prices are retreating from recent highs, and this could indicate lower headline inflation and more flexibility for monetary policy. Furthermore, there is no further evidence of second-round effects in terms of additional wage and transport fare adjustments. There are also early signs of improving inflation expectations with the easing of oil and rice prices. Continued vigilance over price developments will be exercised, with the BSP ready to reexamine policy settings when warranted. The BSP remains committed to undertake policy actions that will help maintain the public's confidence in the financial system."
Israel,2008-10-07,"7.10.2008</td> The Bank of Israel cuts the interest rate by 0.5 percentage points with effect from 12 October 2008 From 12 October 2008 the interest rate will be 3.75 percent The Bank of Israel announces that the decision to cut the interest rate was made in light of the sharp increase in uncertainty in financial marketsaround the world and its implications for Israel's financial markets. The decision to reduce the interest rate by 0.5 percentage points was made in view of the following considerations: Inflationary pressures in Israel are expected to ease significantly due to the continued fall in world commodity prices and the expected slowdown in economic growth. Inflation expectations and Israeli forecasters inflation predictions for the next twelve months are now within the target range. Since the deterioration in the global financial crisis--with its implications for the domestic markets--the chances of a slowdown in Israel's rate of economic growth in the near future have risen. The current reduction in the interest rate will act to strengthen the economy's ability to meet the challenges confronting it. In light ofthe developments in the domestic financial markets and the sharp rise in volatility, the reduction in the interest rate serves to increase liquidity in these markets. The Bank of Israel emphasizes that this decision to cut the rate of interest is consistent with the Bank's aims to support economic growth and financial stability, as long as inflation is expected to converge to the price stability range. The Bank of Israel will continue to closely monitor Israeli and worldwide economic developments, and will take whatever steps are necessary to achieve price stability, which is an essential requirement for sustainable growth, and to support the stability of the financial system. Subject to this, the Bank will continue to support the attainment of a range of macroeconomic objectives, in particular employment and growth. The minutes of the discussions prior to the above interest rate decisionwill be published on 20 October 2008. The decision regarding the interest rate for November 2008 will be published at 18:30 on 27 October 2008. 7.10.2008</td> The Bank of Israel cuts the interest rate by 0.5 percentage points with effect from 12 October 2008 From 12 October 2008 the interest rate will be 3.75 percent. The Bank of Israel cuts the interest rate by 0.5 percentage points with effect from 12 October 2008. From 12 October 2008 the interest rate will be 3.75 percent. The Bank of Israel announces that the decision to cut the interest rate was made in light of the sharp increase in uncertainty in financial marketsaround the world and its implications for Israel's financial markets. The decision to reduce the interest rate by 0.5 percentage points was made in view of the following considerations:. Inflationary pressures in Israel are expected to ease significantly due to the continued fall in world commodity prices and the expected slowdown in economic growth."
Thailand,2008-10-08,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 8 October 2008 Ms. Duangmanee Vongpradhip. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand, announces that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance. The main issues discussed were as follows. The latest economic data up to August pointed towards a slowdown in the Thai economy, due to both domestic and external demand. In addition, risks to economic growth would increase going forward, as a result of the impact of the global financial crisis as well as domestic political factors. However the MPC assessed that the marked rise in farm income and lower inflation would improve consumers' purchasing power and support a continued economic growth. Risks to inflation declined significantly compared to the previous meeting from lower oil prices. Nonetheless inflationary pressures remained from the continued pass- through of costs and the gradual adjustment of prices under the authorities' price administration measures. The MPC therefore decided to maintain the policy interest rate at 375 per cent per annum. The MPC would closely monitor the risks to the world economy and stand ready to implement appropriate monetary policy should the impact on the Thai economy worsen from the current assessment."
United States,2008-10-08,"Joint Statement by Central Banks. Throughout the current financial crisis, central banks have engaged in continuous close consultation and have cooperated in unprecedented joint actions such as the provision of liquidity to reduce strains in financial markets. Inflationary pressures have started to moderate in a number of countries, partly reflecting a marked decline in energy and other commodity prices.Inflation expectations are diminishing and remain anchored to price stability.The recent intensification of the financial crisis has augmented the downside risks to growth and thus has diminished further the upside risks to price stability. Some easing of global monetary conditions is therefore warranted.Accordingly, the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve. Sveriges Riksbank, and the Swiss National Bank are today announcing reductions in policy interest rates.The Bank of Japan expresses its strong support of these policy actions. Federal Reserve ActionsThe Federal Open Market Committee has decided to lower its target for the federal funds rate 50 basis points to 1-1/2 percent.The Committee took this action in light of evidence pointing to a weakening of economic activity and a reduction in inflationary pressures. Incoming economic data suggest that the pace of economic activity has slowed markedly in recent months.Moreover, the intensification of financial market turmoil is likely to exert additional restraint on spending, partly by further reducing the ability of households and businesses to obtain credit.Inflation has been high, but the Committee believes that the decline in energy and other commodity prices and the weaker prospects for economic activity have reduced the upside risks to inflation. The Committee will monitor economic and financial developments carefully and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; Timothy F Geithner. Vice Chairman; Elizabeth A Duke; Richard W Fisher; Donald L Kohn; Randall S Kroszner; Sandra Pianalto; Charles I Plosser; Gary H Stern; and Kevin M Warsh. In a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 50-basis-point decrease in the discount rate to 1-3/4 percent. In taking this action, the Board approved the request submitted by the Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.

Chile,2008-10-09,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 9 October 2008 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 8.25% (annual). Inflation has remained high and the risk of alternative scenarios has increased. Given the uncertainty surrounding the global economy and its impact on projected inflation, the Board considers that this decision is necessary to reassess with more information the monetary policy course contained in the baseline scenario of the Monetary Policy Report. Internationally, the global financial system has endured extraordinary stress, affecting liquidity, access to credit and asset prices. The markets foresee a significant slowdown of the global economy while commodities, in particular copper and oil, have shown significant price declines. A number of central banks and governmental authorities have taken exceptional measures. Domestically, available third-quarter output data is consistent with prospects that the economy's annual expansion will be greater in the second half of this year than it was in the first. Domestic demand continues to grow strongly, particularly its imported component, and unemployment has remained stable. Local financial conditions have tightened. Inflation in September was somewhat above predictions, mainly due to the behavior of domestic fuel prices. The various measures of core inflation are still high, wage dynamics continue to be within historical patterns, and medium-term inflation expectations have fallen. The Board reaffirms its commitment to conduct monetary policy so as to reduce the current high inflation rates to 3% in the policy horizon. This is essential to align inflationary dynamics with the price stability objective. Although the future path of the monetary policy rate in the baseline scenario of the latest Monetary Policy Report considers further adjustments to ensure convergence of inflation to the target. The Board will evaluate in its future decisions the implications of financial developments in progress on projected inflation. * The Spanish original prevails."
Georgia,2008-10-09,"The Decision of the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Georgia on September 10, 2008 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia decided during its unscheduled meeting on September 10, to lower its Main Policy Rate, the Refinancing Loan Rate by 100 basis points, to 10 percent. The Committee noted that bank activity has slowed significantly due to increased business risks and the ongoing liquidity deficit. It is expected that the existing environment will cause banks to manage their risks conservatively in the medium term, reducing the banks' ability to expand their operations aggressively, which will influence the money multiplier and the growth rate of the velocity of money adversely. The MPC also discussed minimum reserves for banks and decided to lower the minimum reserve requirements to 5 percent, a factor which should resists the decline in the money multiplier. The abovementioned changes will take effect from October 2, 2008. It was noted during the Committee's meeting, that despite the recent military conflict, inflationary pressures have not intensified. Although according to the Statistics Department, the inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index was 12.8 percent, the reason for the increase was mainly due to a growth in the prices of several agricultural products (cabbage, herbs, salads) from the period of August 10 to the 20th, which was presumably caused by a temporary supply bottlenecks affecting. An observation of the price dynamics on the abovementioned goods indicates that the prices have returned to their initial (pre-war) levels. It was also noted that money supply decreased considerably during the recent military conflict, a factor which should have a positive effect on the reduction in the general level of prices. However, a sharp or a less than expected change in the money supply may have a negative effect on economic growth and on the inflation rate of the following periods. Due to the abovementioned conditions, it was deemed necessary to lower minimum reserve requirements, which should on the one hand provide and free up additional liquidity for banks and on the other hand increase the money multiplier, therefore increasing the money supply. The National Bank of Georgia decided to introduce refinancing operations according to the August 29 decision of the committee. The aim of the announcement is to provide short-term liquidity to the banking system in order to avoid a sharp decline in credit creation. In addition, the Board of the National Bank decided to introduce a special lending facility in the amount of GEL 150 million for the banking sector. The existing inflation risks have not changed since the last meeting of the MPC. Prices of the main commodities, including those of oil and wheat products have continued to decline. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will take place on September 17, 2008."
South Korea,2008-10-09,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points from 5.25% to 5.00%. In a related action, the Committee also lowered the interest rates on Aggregate Credit Ceiling Loans by 25 basis points from 3.50% to 3.25%. (The following is an English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points from 5.25% to 5.00%. Despite the robust growth of exports, the domestic economic slowdown has become evident owing to sluggish domestic demand. The downside risk to economic growth has increased, largely due to the international financial market unrest and global economic slowdown. Consumer price inflation has been slowing gradually due to the decline in international oil prices, but it seems likely to remain at a high level for some time owing mainly to the depreciation of the Korean won against the US dollar. The upward trend of real estate prices has been blunted. Financial market price variables such as exchange rates and stock prices have shown unstable movements, largely in response to the spread of international financial market unrest. Financial institutions have been tightening their attitude to lending. The Committee judges that this action should contribute to soothing the financial market turmoil and to avoiding a severe contraction of economic activity."
Peru,2008-10-09,"- MONETARY PROGRAM FOR OCTOBER 2008 BCRP MAINTAINS REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 6.50% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference interest rate at 6.50 percent. This decision has been made considering high uncertainty regarding the evolution of global economy and its impact on global economic activity, the international prices of our exports and imports, and international financial flows. It should be pointed out that the recent drops observed in the prices of commodities and fuels, as well as the downward trend observed in the prices of imported foodstuffs favor a gradual reduction of inflation in the country. The Board will continue to oversee the development of the national and international economic and financial situation, as well as the evolution of inflation and its determinants in order to adopt any necessary measures required to preserve monetary stability in a context of sustained growth. The Board also approved to maintain the following annual interest rates on active and passive operations (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system Direct repo and rediscount operations: 7.25 percent. Overnight deposits: 5.75 percent. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 7.25 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for November on its session of November 13. The BCRP will publish its next Inflation Report on October 24, 2008."
South Africa,2008-10-09,"Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee the turmoil on global financial markets has intensified. This development has impacted negatively on the outlook for the international economy. As the banking crisis has deepened, global markets have been characterised by declining equity prices, exchange rate volatility and widening spreads on emerging market debt. The prices of many commodities, including oil, have also declined, although gold is a notable exception by virtue of its safe haven status. Governments and central banks have undertaken various actions, both individually and in concert. The South African banking and financial system remains stable. However, domestic financial markets have experienced the impact of these developments. The domestic equity market has suffered losses in line with international markets, and the exchange rate of the rand has been negatively affected by increased global risk aversion, resulting in higher volatility and a significant depreciation. The South African Reserve Bank is monitoring developments closely. The inflation outlook remains uncertain, as the risk profile has changed somewhat. The outlook has improved on account of the lower oil prices, but the exchange rate has emerged as a significant risk factor. CPIX inflation increased from 13,0 per cent in July 2008 to 13,6 per cent in August. Food and petrol price increases were again the main contributors to this rising trend. Food prices increased at a year-on-year rate of 19,2 per cent in August, driven to a significant extent by grain product prices which increased by 36,5 per cent. Petrol prices increased at a year-on-year rate of 45,9 per cent in August, despite the 30 cent per litre reduction in the petrol price in that month. If food and petrol were excluded. CPIX inflation would have measured 8,1 per cent in August, compared with 7,4 per cent and 6,3 per cent in the prior two months. The significant upward trend in this measure was mainly due to electricity price increases of 23,9 per cent and 28,2 per cent in July and August respectively, but it also reflects continued generalised inflation pressures. Producer price inflation also remained strong. Producer prices increased at a year-on-year rate of 19,1 per cent in August. The rate of increase in agricultural food prices declined to 2,3 per cent, but manufactured food price inflation remained elevated at over 20 per cent. The most recent central forecast of the Bank shows a moderate improvement in the inflation outlook since the previous MPC meeting, although the peak is slightly higher. As was the case at the previous meeting, some assumptions were made to try to account for the rebasing and reweighting of the CPI basket that will be introduced by Statistics South Africa in January 2009. Inflation is expected to peak at an average rate of 13,3 per cent in the third quarter of this year, and to average 6,9 per cent in 2009, after a significant decline in the first quarter of that year. Consumer price inflation is still expected to return to within the inflation target range only in the second quarter of 2010, and to reach a level of 5,5 per cent in the final quarter of that year. According to the most recent inflation expectations survey conducted on behalf of the Bank by the Bureau for Economic Research at the University of Stellenbosch. CPIX inflation is expected to average 10,2 per cent in 2008 and 8,1 per cent and 7.4 per cent in 2009 and 2010 respectively. The increases in respect of 2009 and 2010 were significantly smaller than the increases observed in the previous survey. However, only the financial analysts expect inflation to return to within the target range by 2010. This is similar to the Reuters consensus survey conducted in August which indicates that inflation is expected to average 7,5 per cent in 2009 and 5,9 per cent in 2010. Inflation expectations as measured by the yield differential between conventional government bonds and inflation-linked bonds indicated some improvement in expectations over the longer term. The break-even inflation expectation declined from just over 9 per cent in July 2008 to around 6,3 per cent at the end of September. The yield curve has remained inverted but has moved down since the previous meeting. The continued upward trend in wage settlements also indicates that inflation expectations are not well anchored. According to the Quarterly Economic Survey of Statistics South Africa, year-on-year growth in unit labour cost measured 10,5 per cent in the second quarter of 2008, compared to 10,7 per cent in the previous quarter. The most recent Wage Settlement Survey of Andrew Levy Employment Publications shows that the average wage settlement rate increased to 9,6 per cent in the nine months to September 2008 compared with 8,3 per cent in the six months to June 2008. The turmoil in international financial markets has resulted in some changes in the balance of risks as perceived by the Monetary Policy Committee. The most significant of these changes relate to oil price and exchange rate developments. The recent depreciation in the rand exchange rate poses a significant upside risk to the inflation outlook. Following the initial rejection by the US Congress of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), there was significant volatility in foreign exchange markets as the dollar strengthened against a number of major currencies, particularly against those in emerging market economies. The domestic foreign exchange market was also affected, and the rand is currently trading at around R9,12 against the US dollar, compared with R8,00 at the previous MPC meeting. On a trade-weighted basis, the rand has depreciated by around 20 per cent since the beginning of the year and by almost 9 per cent since the previous meeting. The impact of the exchange rate on the inflation outlook will depend to a significant degree on the extent to which these new levels are sustained. In most other instances the risks to the outlook have declined or remained unchanged. International oil prices have declined considerably over the past few weeks. Having peaked at around US$145 per barrel in July 2008, the price of North Sea Brent crude oil (Brent) has declined to current levels of around US$83 per barrel. At the time of the previous MPC meeting Brent was trading at US$112 per barrel. In line with these oil market developments, the price of 95 octane petrol in Gauteng has declined by a total of R1,29 per litre since August. The impact of the lower international oil prices on domestic petrol prices will be offset to some extent by the recent depreciation of the rand against the dollar. As noted, food price inflation remains elevated, although agricultural price inflation at producer price level has declined further. International rice prices appear to have peaked and both maize and wheat prices are currently below the peaks reached earlier in 2008 in the global and domestic markets. Favourable base effects are also expected to contribute to a declining trend in food price inflation. However food prices are expected to remain elevated in the short-term as evidenced by high increases in processed food prices at the producer level. Household consumption expenditure has remained subdued in line with declining growth in disposable income and the less accommodative monetary policy stance. Growth in household consumption expenditure declined to 1,2 per cent in the second quarter of 2008 as expenditure on durable goods contracted by almost 15 per cent. This is reflected in the further decline in motor vehicle sales in September, at a year-on-year rate of almost 20 per cent. Retail and wholesale trade sales growth have continued their negative trends. The latest FNB/BER Consumer Confidence Index shows an improvement relative to the second quarter, but remains at levels last seen in 2004. Credit extension to the private sector exhibited further moderation. Growth over twelve months in total loans and advances to the private sector declined from 21,3 per cent in June 2008 to 19,7 per cent in August. Growth in mortgage advances moderated to 17,6 per cent in August 2008 while instalment sale credit and leasing finance grew by 11,3 per cent. The slower growth in credit extension to households is reflected in the ratio of debt to disposable income which declined in the second quarter of 2008 to 76,7 per cent. Asset prices have been significantly affected by the recent global market turmoil and the softer trend in commodity prices. The associated negative wealth effects could contribute to a further moderation in consumption expenditure growth. The all-share index on the JSE Limited has declined by about 27 per cent since the beginning of the year, and by about 25 per cent since the previous MPC meeting. The housing market is also subdued with the Absa and Standard Bank house price indices continuing to record negative real house price growth. Domestic economic growth appears to be moderating, despite the rebound in the second quarter of 2008, when GDP growth of 4,9 per cent was recorded. This improvement was mainly the result of base effects following the 2,1 per cent growth rate recorded in the first quarter of 2008. Short term indicators suggest that growth in the third quarter is likely to be subdued, and that growth will remain below its estimated potential rate. The composite leading indicator of the Bank declined further in July and the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index also declined further in the third quarter of this year. The manufacturing sector remains under pressure as seen in the weaker trend in the volume of manufacturing production, as well as in the Investec/BER Purchasing Managers Index. Growth in real gross fixed capital formation remained relatively robust despite declining from 16,9 per cent in the first quarter to 9,1 per cent in the second quarter. Investment expenditure is expected to underpin a positive growth rate. Developments in the international markets have already had a negative impact on growth in a number of regions, and global growth forecasts are being revised down further, particularly in the OECD countries. The slowing world economy is also likely to have an adverse effect on domestic growth prospects. The continuing crisis has lead to a generally more accommodative monetary policy stance in a number of countries, and some governments and central banks are taking unprecedented steps to help stabilise the situation. At this stage it is unclear how the crisis will unfold, but heightened risk and uncertainty are likely to persist for some time. The Monetary Policy Committee considered recent developments in the South African economy and the risks to the inflation outlook against the backdrop of conditions prevailing in the international financial markets. The MPC is of the view that an unchanged monetary policy stance is appropriate at this stage. Accordingly the repurchase rate remains at 12 per cent per annum. The MPC remains committed to and focused on the achievement of the SARB mandate."
Georgia,2008-10-15,"The Decision of the Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Georgia on October 15, 2008 The Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Georgia decided during its meeting on October 15, to leave its main policy rate, the Refinancing Rate, unchanged at 10 percent. The Committee noted that because of the limited participation of short-term foreign capital in Georgia, the current turmoil in the global financial markets will not have a significant impact on the financial system in Georgia. The banking sector is keeping excess liquidity. Moreover, the new stand-by arrangement by the International Monetary Fund, the high level of international reserves and the strong capitalization of domestic banks will ensure the stability of the nation's financial system On the background of significant capital inflows anticipated from international financial institutions and other donors, it is expected that overall foreign inflows will recover and strengthen the economy's balance of payments. Since the Committee's last meeting, certain positive trends have been observed in the banking system. In particular, the system has once again been experiencing moderate growth in deposits and demonstrated significant increase in liquidity. Commercial banks are still wary to issue new loans because of the perceived risks on the part of the borrowers, due to which increase in lending to the economy has not been observed. Existing inflation risks have not changed significantly since the last meeting of the Committee. Commodity prices, including those of oil and wheat have continued to decline. As was forecast during the Committee's September 10 meeting, the annual inflation decreased in September, which points to the one-off character of the spike in inflation in August. Consumer prices have dropped by 0.8 percent since last month, and as a result, the inflation has declined to 10.6 percent. It is expected that inflation dynamics will maintain a downward trend during the remainder of the year. At present, the monetary policy transmission mechanism is especially weak due to reduced activity on the interbank market. The NBG will closely monitor the developments in the domestic and international financial markets and will carry out monetary policy accordingly in case the existing risks to inflation change considerably in any direction. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will take place on November 26, 2008."
Hungary,2008-10-20,"At its meeting on 20 October 2008, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and left the central bank base rate unchanged at 8.50%. In the Council's judgement, the prospects for the Hungarian economy are shaped primarily by global factors. In recent weeks, the effects of the global financial crisis have become increasingly evident in the domestic financial markets. The global liquidity shortage has led to disturbances in markets. In the situation, maintaining the smooth functioning of financial intermediation is of key importance for the Monetary Council. To achieve this goal, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank has taken or initiated several important policy actions in recent weeks. Reviewing the latest economic developments, the Council has concluded that inflation may fall further, continuing the trends of the past few weeks. However, the slowdown in global business activity has led a to a deterioration in the outlook for growth in Hungary. The expected international economic developments increase the probability of a sustained fall in oil, food and other commodity prices. In addition, the slowing in Hungarian growth, stemming from the economic downturn in Europe and the curtailment of lending by domestic banks, is also likely to help reduce inflation further in Hungary. In the Council's judgement, therefore, maintaining tight monetary conditions is necessary in the current market environment."
Turkiye,2008-10-22,"The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) has decided to adjust the policy rates as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate is left unchanged at 16.75 percent, while lending rate is decreased from 20.25 percent to 19.75 percent, b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m. is left unchanged at 12,75 percent, while lending rate is decreased from 23,25 percent to 22,75 percent, c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions is decreased from 19.25 percent to 18.75 percent. Recent readings indicate a significant slowdown in domestic economic activity. Ongoing problems in international credit markets and the global economy continue to restrain both the domestic and external demand. Inflationary impact of the recent exchange rate movements will be offset by the favorable outlook in food prices and the sharp decline in oil prices. Inflation is expected to display a limited and temporary rise in October due to volatile food prices, yet continue to decline gradually in the medium term. Accordingly, the Committee at this point does not envision a significant revision in medium term inflation forecasts. However, it should be noted that the intensification of the financial market turmoil requires caution in terms of both the monetary policy and the inflation outlook. In this respect, the Committee decided to keep borrowing rates the key policy rates unchanged, while lowering the lending rates by 50 basis points in order to contain the potential volatility in short term interest rates. The meeting agenda also included an assessment of the developments in foreign exchange markets. The Committee emphasized the importance of a liquid foreign exchange market under current conditions and stated that supporting the liquidity positions of the banks should be the priority, and suggested that raising the transaction limits at the Foreign Exchange Deposit Markets would be helpful in this regard. Moreover, the Committee agreed that other measures would be implemented as needed. The Central Bank will continue to take the necessary measures to contain the adverse effects of the global financial turmoil on the domestic economy. Future policy decisions will largely depend on the developments in global markets and their reflections on the local financial markets. It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight working days."

Global Developments During the first nine months of 2008, the slowdown in global growth spread across developed economies in an environment of heightened uncertainty. Global economic prospects have been dampened by the weakening of the US economy, the wider repercussions of the ongoing financial market crisis and volatility in the energy, food and commodity prices. According to the World Economic Outlook (WEO) of the IMF released in October 2008, global real GDP growth on a purchasing power parity basis is expected to decelerate from 5.0 per cent in 2007 to 3.9 per cent in 2008 (4.1 per cent in WEO Update. July 2008) and further to 3.0 per cent in 2009 (3.9 per cent in WEO Update. July 2008). In the US, real GDP growth slowed to 2.8 per cent in the second quarter of 2008 from 3.8 per cent a year ago. The October 2008 WEO of the IMF expects the US economy to slow from 2.0 per cent in 2007 to 1.6 per cent in 2008 and further to 0.1 per cent in 2009. Globally, inflation has softened in several countries in recent months. There has been an overall decrease in prices of food, crude oil and metals since July 2008 which is contributing to the easing in consumer price inflation across the globe.700 billion to clear the bad debt overhang by buying unviable paper to restore liquidity in markets; allowing orderly restructuring over time without distress sales; lessening foreclosures; and helping the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in assisting troubled institutions, which was authorised by Congress in early October under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. On October 14, 2008 the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the US Department of the Treasury and the FDIC made a joint statement to protect the US economy, to strengthen public confidence in the financial institutions and to foster the robust functioning of the credit markets through a voluntary capital purchase programme and a temporary FDIC guarantee programme for a broad array of financial institutions. A wave of banking contagion in Benelux. Germany. UK. Spain. Ireland and Iceland required government intervention late September onwards and some banks were taken into temporary state ownership. Central banks have engaged in continuous close consultation and have co-operated in unprecedented joint actions. In addition to the US dollar swap lines, the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve, the Sveriges Riksbank and the Swiss National Bank reduced their policy rates by 50 basis points on October 8, 2008. Also, the Bank of Japan expressed its strong support of these policy actions.8 the BoE, the ECB. Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan and the SNB jointly announced measures to improve liquidity in short-term US dollar funding markets. Emerging market central banks have also responded in various ways to the events unfolding in the advanced economies. Monetary policy actions such as reducing required reserves and interest rates to boost liquidity have also been undertaken by some EMEs to stem the financial crisis. Several central banks in Asia have cut their policy rates in tandem with the advanced economies and have provided assurances of liquidity support to financial markets. Central banks of some countries such as Japan and Malaysia have not changed their policy rates in 2008. Some central banks that have tightened their policy rates in recent months include Bank Indonesia; Bank of Thailand; the Banco Central de Chile. Banco Central do Brasil; and Banco de Mexico. Overall Assessment Aggregate supply conditions in the Indian economy have shown resilience in the second quarter of 2008-09 in the face of a deteriorating global macroeconomic and financial environment. There are, however, growing indications that the underlying economic cycle is turning in tune with global economic developments and that domestic economic activity is straddling a point of inflexion. Aggregate demand conditions continue to be mainly investment-driven, although some slackening which set in during the first quarter of 2008-09 appears to have become broad based. Reflecting the aggregate demand pressures, key monetary and banking aggregates – money supply, deposit and non-food credit growth – have been expanding during the year so far at rates that are significantly elevated relative to indicative trajectories given in the Annual Policy Statement of April 2008. The developments in monetary conditions resulted in a tightening of liquidity conditions in domestic financial markets through the second quarter of 2008-09. Signs of deterioration in the fiscal situation appear to be adding to aggregate demand pressures in the economy. Domestically, imported inflation pressures have been keeping headline inflation at elevated levels with considerable uncertainty as to where it will peak and when.Since the First Quarter Review of July 2008, global economic prospects have weakened further. The global economy is facing the deflationary effects of the financial crisis. There is increasing evidence that the US slowdown is spreading via the trade and financial channels. The outlook for the emerging economies remains positive, but uncertainties about their resilience to the global shocks have increased. The international financial system is gripped by extreme risk aversion in the wake of spectacular failures among the world's largest financial institutions, including several credited with history and tradition. Conditions in global financial markets have worsened with the freezing of inter-bank markets in US and Europe necessitating massive liquidity injection facilities from central banks in these economies, reduction of policy rates, recapitalisation of troubled private banks by governments, coordinated action by European governments to bail out weak banks and guaranteeing of all deposits in the banking system in many countries. In the overall assessment, global economic conditions have worsened and the future path of their evolution has turned highly uncertain. The broadening slowdown of economic activity in the advanced economies is beginning to impact the macroeconomic prospects of emerging economies, with those reliant on exports and on international financial markets for external financing needs likely to be the most vulnerable. Inflation remains elevated and a key risk to global economic prospects. Stance of Monetary Policy This Mid-Term Review is set in the context of several complex and compelling policy challenges. There have been severe disruptions in international money markets, sharp declines in stock markets across the world and evidence of extreme risk aversion among financial sector participants. Governments, central banks and financial regulators around the world are responding to the crisis with aggressive, radical and unconventional measures to restore calm and confidence to the markets and bring them back to normalcy and stability. India's financial sector is stable and healthy. All indicators of financial strength such as capital adequacy, ratios of non-performing assets (NPA) and return on assets (RoA) for our commercial banks, which account for 88 per cent of banking assets, are robust. Nevertheless, the global developments have had some indirect, knock-on effects on domestic financial markets. In the wake of the stress on our financial markets as a result of the global financial crisis, the immediate challenge for the Reserve Bank was to infuse confidence by augmenting both domestic and foreign exchange liquidity. Accordingly, the Reserve Bank has taken a series of measures since mid-September, 2008The measures taken since mid-September 2008 have substantially assuaged liquidity stress in domestic financial markets arising from the contagion of adverse external developments. The task of monetary management has always centered around managing a judicious balance between price stability, sustaining the growth momentum and maintaining financial stability. The global financial turmoil, has, however, reinforced the importance of putting special emphasis on preserving financial stability. The current challenge, accordingly, is to strike an optimal balance between preserving financial stability, maintaining price stability, anchoring inflation expectations, and sustaining the growth momentum. To manage this challenge, the Reserve Bank has deployed and will continue to deploy both conventional and unconventional tools. Since the First Quarter Review of July 2008, there have been significant global and domestic developments which have rendered the outlook uncertain, and have increased the downside risks associated with this projection. Taking these developments and prospects into account, the Reserve Bank has revised the projection of overall real GDP growth for 2008-09 to a range of 7.5-8.0 per cent. Keeping in view the supply management measures taken by the Government and the lagged demand response to the monetary policy measures taken by the Reserve Bank over the last one year, the earlier projection of inflation of 7.0 per cent by end-March 2009 appears to be valid. It has, therefore, been decided to maintain this estimate for policy purposes. Going forward, the Reserve Bank's policy endeavour would be to modulate the monetary overhang generated by the sustained expansion of money supply since 2005-06. The Reserve Bank will monitor the rate of credit growth and credit quality closely and will, as necessary, engage with select banks which are outliers on the norms. The Reserve Bank will maintain a close vigil on the entire financial system to prevent pressures building up in the financial markets. This will include enhancing liquidity if pressures persist. This could also mean curtailing liquidity if the recent liquidity easing measures are seen to have injected excess liquidity, thereby stoking inflationary pressures. The management of the global financial crisis has highlighted two important aspects. First, that resolution of a crisis of this magnitude and complexity demands going beyond the rule book to unconventional, unorthodox and swift policy actions. Second, there is need for close coordination between the Government and the regulatory agencies without at the same time eroding institutional integrity and independence. These aspects are important and relevant for India too.The Reserve Bank has endeavoured to be proactive, and has taken measures to manage the rapid developments and ease pressures stemming from the global crisis. In conclusion, the Reserve Bank reiterates that it is confident of managing the situation and minimising the adverse impact of the global crisis on the Indian economy. Our financial system is strong and healthy, and our economic fundamentals are strong. Once the global situation is managed and calm and confidence are restored, we will return to our higher growth trajectory. Based on the above overall assessment of the macroeconomic situation, the stance of monetary policy for the rest of 2008-09 will be as follows: Ensure a monetary and interest rate environment that optimally balances the objectives of financial stability, price stability and well-anchored inflation expectations, and growth; Continue with the policy of active demand management of liquidity through appropriate use of all instruments including the CRR, open market operations (OMO), the MSS and the LAF to maintain orderly conditions in financial markets; In the context of the uncertain and unsettled global situation and its indirect impact on the domestic economy in general and the financial markets in particular, closely and continuously monitor the situation and respond swiftly and effectively to developments, employing both conventional and unconventional measures; Emphasise credit quality and credit delivery, in particular, for employment-intensive sectors, while pursuing financial inclusion. Monetary Measures The Bank Rate has been kept unchanged at 6.0 per cent. The repo rate under the LAF is kept unchanged at 8.0 per cent. The reverse repo rate under the LAF is kept unchanged at 6.0 per cent. The Reserve Bank has the flexibility to conduct repo/reverse repo auctions at a fixed rate or at variable rates as circumstances warrant. The Reserve Bank retains the option to conduct overnight or longer term repo/reverse repo under the LAF depending on market conditions and other relevant factors. The Reserve Bank will continue to use this flexibility including the right to accept or reject tender(s) under the LAF, wholly or partially, if deemed fit, so as to make efficient use of the LAF in daily liquidity management. The cash reserve ratio (CRR) kept unchanged at 6.5 per cent.Developmental and Regulatory Policies Interest rate Policy Interest rate ceilings on FCNR(B) and NR(E)RA deposits were increased by 50 basis points each, i.e., to Libor/Swap rates minus 25 basis points and to Libor/Swap rates plus 50 basis points, respectively effective from the close of business on September 16, 2008. These ceilings were increased further by 50 basis point each, i.e., to Libor/Swap rates plus 25 basis points and Libor/Swap rates plus 100 basis points, respectively, effective from the close of business on October 15, 2008. Financial Markets The Reserve Bank announced special market operations (SMO) on May 30, 2008 on an ad hoc basis which were conducted through designated banks in oil bonds held by public sector oil marketing companies. The SMO was terminated effective from August 8, 2008, but taking into account the continuing uncertain global situation and the potentially adverse implications for domestic financial markets, the Reserve Bank announced on October 15, 2008 that it has decided to reinstitute a similar facility when oil bonds become available. For fine-tuning the management of bank reserves on the last day of the maintenance period, a second liquidity adjustment facility (SLAF) is now conducted on a daily basis beginning September 17, 2008. A special 14-day repo for a notified amount of Rs.20,000 crore was announced on October 14, 2008, which was further extended to be conducted on a daily basis up to the cumulative amount of Rs.20,000 crore, to enable banks to meet the liquidity requirement of mutual funds. Banks were allowed to avail additional liquidity support exclusively for the purpose of meeting the liquidity requirements of mutual funds to the extent of up to 0.5 per cent of their NDTL.

Malaysia,2008-10-24,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to leave the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) unchanged at 3.50 percent. Since the last MPC in August, the global economic situation has deteriorated considerably and the international financial turmoil has yet to stabilise. The greater focus of policymakers is now towards restoring the functioning of the international financial markets and towards avoiding a sharp global economic downturn. While the downside risks to global growth have increased significantly, concerns about inflation have subsided as commodity and energy prices declined, and as slower growth sets in. While the Malaysian financial markets have been affected by these global developments, there is ample liquidity in the domestic financial system and there has been normal functioning of the financial markets. The banking institutions are operating with strong capital and liquidity buffers, and have continued to provide financing to the economy. The current elevated inflation rate reflects the effects of the fuel and other administered price adjustments made earlier this year. However, the assessment is that inflation has now peaked and is expected to moderate into 2009. An increasing number of indicators now signal an easing of inflationary pressures. Lower cost pressures and moderating domestic demand are expected to reduce inflation in 2009. The slower global growth and the decline in commodity prices will affect the performance of the export sector and consequently, the overall economic growth in 2009. Malaysia is entering this challenging period from a position of strength following several years of steady growth, reinforced by the current account surplus, the strong reserves position, low level of external indebtedness, and a well-capitalised banking system. In the face of diminishing inflationary pressures, and in the event of heightened downside risks to growth, the Bank will take swift monetary policy action to provide support to the economy. Bank Negara Malaysia 24 October 2008."
Israel,2008-10-27,"27.10.2008 The Bank of Israel reduces the interest rate for November 2008 by 25 basis points to 3.5 percent The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for November 2008 will be reduced by 25 basis points, to 3.5 percent. Background conditions Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) remained unchangedin September, below the average forecast of 0.4 percent. In the last twelve months the CPI rose by 5.5 percent, well above the upper limit of the inflation target range of 1-3 percent a year. The index excluding food, energy, and fruit and vegetables rose by 2.9 percent in the last twelve months, and remained unchanged in September. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: The downward trend in inflation expectations for the next twelve months continued: in October expectations calculated from the capital market averaged 0.4 percent (this low level is apparently due to technical factors). Forecasters' twelve-month-forward predictions continued to fall, and following the publication of the September CPI reached an average of 1.3 percent. Interest rate expectations derived from the capital market show that no change in the rate is expected in the next twelve months. The forecasters, on average, expect a reduction of 25 basis points in the interest rate for November. Real economic activity: Data received this month indicate a slowdown in the rate of expansion of real activity. This can be seen in the latest indicators (based on partial data) of the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) for the third quarter, which show a further slowdown in the rate of growth. The composite state-of-the-economy index for September dropped by 0.3 percent, and the indices for June and August were revised downwards, also becoming negative. Preliminary data from the Companies Survey for the thirdquarter show a drop in the growth of demand, and expectations of a furtherdecline in the growth of activity in the fourth quarter. The slower rate of expansion was reflected also in tax revenues: health tax revenues, which serve as an indicator of total wage expenses in the economy, and VAT on domestic production slowed in the third quarter, and direct tax revenues (excluding the effect of changes in tax rates) fell by 7.9 percent, nominal rate, compared with the level in the third quarter of 2007. According to the Bank of Israel's most recent macroeconomic forecasts, the rate of growth in 2009 will be 2.7 percent. The labor market and wages: There are signs that the downward trend in the rate of unemployment in the last few years has halted. Unemployment trend data for July (seasonally adjusted) give a rate of 6.1 percent, similar to the level in the previous two months. From March to July there wasno change in the number of employee posts (seasonally adjusted). The nominal wage per Israeli employee post rose by 0.6 percent in June-July compared with its level in April-May. Budget policy: From the beginning of the year to September, the government's domestic budget surplus was NIS 4.3 billion higher thanthe seasonal path consistent with the deficit ceiling of 1.6 percent of GDP, despite the drop in tax revenues, but due in part to under-expenditure of about 2 percent. Tax revenues in that period were 1.2 percent lower in real terms than in the equivalent period in 2007 (after deducting the effectsof a change in tax rates and non-recurring receipts). The foreign exchange market: In the period between the monetary policy discussions of 21 September and 26 October, the shekel weakened by 9.8 percent against the dollar, and by 3.8 percent against the index of the effective exchange rate (weighted by the volume of trade), and strengthened by 3.2 percent against the euro. In this period the dollar continued to strengthen significantly against most of the major currencies, by between 3 percent and 29 percent, so that the weakening of the shekel against the dollar was moderate compared with the global trend. The capital and money markets: Between the interest rate discussion of 21 September and 26 October, the leading share indices abroad droppedsharply: in the advanced economies the indices plunged by between 19 percent and 40 percent, and in the emerging markets by between 10 percent and 47 percent. In this period the Tel Aviv 25 and the Tel Aviv 100 share price indices declined more moderately than the average, by about 20 percent. Yields on 10-year unindexed government bonds were unchanged at 6 percent. Yields on US government 10-year bonds continued to fall, dropping this month by 0.1 percentage points to 3.69 percent, so that the yield gap between the Israeli bonds and US government bonds widened to 2.35 percentage points. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, increased markedly from 1.07 percent prior to the previous interest rate decision (on 21 September) to 2.20 percent, its highest level in the last five years. The CDS spreads in emerging markets widened even more sharply. The world economy: The situation in financial markets around the world deteriorated further. Governments and central banks took unprecedented steps and announced far-reaching rescue plans, consisting mainly of massive injections of liquidity to the money markets both by the central banks and by means of government programs to carry out swaps of problem and illiquid securities for liquid assets, or government purchases of problem securities; granting explicit or implied government guarantees for bank deposits and bank bonds to prevent bank runs; and programs for nationalizing bankruptbanks or refinancing weak ones. For these purposes countries allocated in total about $3.3 trillion. First indications are that the programs are leading to an improvement in the situation and to the beginning of stabilization in the money and credit markets, but at the same time, a high degree of uncertainty still prevails. Economic activity: Confidence in the global economy slumped in the last month following the deeper freeze in the financial markets and the greater uncertainty that increased the probability of a global recession. The global economy is entering a period of a significant growth slowdown in the advanced economies, or even a recession in some of them, and the slowdown in growth is evident in emerging markets too. Inflation:Inflationary pressures world wide have started to ease against the background of the sharp drops in commodity and oil prices. The slowdown in global growth and the increase in unemployment support the trend of falling inflation. Against this background the major central banks reduced their interest rates, and are expected to continue to lower their rates and to maintain their low interest policies. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to reduce the interest rate for November, following the out-of-schedule reduction of half a percentage point announced on 7 October, is consistent with the objective of returning inflation to the target range of 1-3 percent in the next twelve months, with the strengthening ofthe economy's ability to cope with the implications of the global financial crisis, and with the provision of support for real activity. Following the sharp falls in world commodity and energy prices and the expected slowdown in demand, forecasters' predictions and expectations derived from the capital market are that inflation over the previous twelve months will return to the target range around the middle of 2009. The high level of uncertainty in the financial markets continued to rise, leading to expectations of further reductions in interest rates by central banks aroundthe world. Against the background of the continued rise in uncertainty, the current cut in the interest rate is intended to reduce the cost of creditand to help the economy deal with the possible implications of the global financial crisis. The global slowdown is expected to be reflected by a slowdown in Israel's rateof economic growth. The reduction in the interest rate is aimed at supporting economic activity. The Bank of Israel notes that in light of the weakening of the transmission between developments in the shekel exchange rate and inflation, it appears that the depreciation of the shekel against the dollar recently has at this stage had only a minimal effect on inflation in Israel. The Bank of Israel will continue to closely monitor Israeli and worldwide economic developments, and will take whatever steps are necessary to achieve price stability, which is an essential requirement for sustainable growth, to support the stability of the financial system, and to encourage employment and growth. 27.10.2008 The Bank of Israel reduces the interest rate for November 2008 by 25 basis points to 3.5 percent.

South Korea,2008-10-27,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower the Base Rate by 75 basis points from 5.00% to 4.25%. In a related action, the Committee also lowered the interest rates on Aggregate Credit Ceiling Loans by 75 basis points from 3.25% to 2.50%. (The following is an English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower the Base Rate by 75 basis points from 5.00% to 4.25%. The Committee judges that a large cut in the Base Rate is called for in order to guard securely against the possibility of a sharp contraction of real economic activity against the backdrop of the large swings of the exchange rate and stock prices and the partial seizing-up of the credit markets under the impact of the international financial market turmoil on domestic markets. Looking ahead, the Committee will do what is needed to ward off the risk of a severe slowdown in economic activity while keeping a vigilant watch on the changes in the upside risk to inflation."
Poland,2008-10-29,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 29 October 2008 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 28-29 October 2008 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e. (cid:1) reference rate 6.00% on an annual basis; (cid:1) lombard rate 7.50% on an annual basis; (cid:1) deposit rate 4.50% on an annual basis; (cid:1) rediscount rate 6.25% on an annual basis. Data that have been released recently indicate that economic growth in Poland will decrease in the coming quarters. Stronger than previously expected economic slowdown will be driven by a significant decline in economic growth abroad, increased uncertainty as to the economic outlook as well as limited credit availability and its increased costs resulting from higher risk premium incorporated in market interest rates. At the same time, information on labour market developments points to a sustained high growth of wages and a continuously unfavourable relation between wage and labour productivity growth. Since the Council's meeting in September, turmoil in the financial markets has intensified and the situation in housing markets has continued to worsen, which results in a marked deterioration of the outlook for economic growth in the external environment of the Polish economy. At the same time, inflationary pressure in many countries is expected to ease, which will be driven by decreasing food and commodity prices in the world markets and the anticipated considerable slowdown of economic growth. The weakening of inflationary pressure and inflation expectations along with the intensified turmoil in the financial markets have urged major central banks to decrease their policy interest rates. The turmoil in the global financial markets has led to increased risk aversion, as a result of which exchange rates of many economies, including those of some Central and Eastern European countries, have depreciated considerably. In September the annual growth of consumer prices in Poland decreased to 4.5%, remaining above the NBP inflation target of 2.5% and also above the upper limit for deviations from the target set at 3.5%. Contributing to inflation persisting at an elevated level was the increased growth of prices of services, including primarily services related to flat maintenance, and of energy prices. The annual growth of food and fuel prices declined, yet remaining at a relatively high level. The Council maintains its assessment that in the coming months inflation will continue above the upper limit for deviations from the inflation target which will, to a large extent, be the result of high, albeit declining, annual growth of food prices as well as high growth of administered prices, including energy prices. The Council got acquainted with the projection of inflation and GDP based on the NECMOD model, prepared by the Economic Institute of the NBP, which is one of the inputs into the Council's decision-making on the NBP interest rates. The macroeconomic projection which will be presented in the Inflation Report has been prepared based on data released until 26 September ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51, 2008. The annual growth of consumer prices forecast in the October projection is in 2009 higher and at the end of 2010 lower than expected in the June projection. Under constant interest rates, there is a 50-percent probability that projected inflation will lie within the range of 4.24.4% in 2008 (compared to 3.84.7% in the June projection), 3.95.7% in 2009 (compared to 2.55.8%) and 1.94.5% in 2010 (compared to 0.15.7%). According to the October projection, the annual GDP growth will remain, with a 50-percent probability, within the range of 5.05.3% in 2008 (compared to 4.35.5% in the June projection), 1.93.7% in 2009 (compared to 3.46.2%) and 2.74.5% in 2010 (compared to 3.86.8%). Due to considerable deterioration of global economic growth outlook and the ensuing lowering of forecasts for commodity prices and inflation across the world observed after 26 September 2008, the impact of those changes on inflation and GDP outlook throughout the projection horizon was assessed with the use of the NECMOD model. This assessment, based on data released until 16 October 2008, indicates that under constant interest rates, there is a 50-percent probability that projected inflation may lie within the range of 4.24.4% in 2008 (compared to 3.8 4.7% in the June projection), 3.15.3% in 2009 (compared to 2.55.8%) and 1.54.3% in 2010 (compared to 0.15.7%). In turn, the annual GDP growth may lie, with a 50-percent probability, within the range of 4.95.2% in 2008 (compared to 4.35.5% in the June projection), 1.73.5% in 2009 (compared to 3.46.2%) and 2.44.3% in 2010 (compared to 3.86.8%). This assessment does not take into account data released after 16 October 2008. In the Council's assessment, in the coming period the pressure on wage increases will probably persist, although the economic growth declining below potential output growth, weakening labour demand and deteriorating financial results of enterprises will be easing the wage pressure and, consequently, also the inflationary pressure. Increased inflation in the coming period will, to a large extent, result from the growth of administered prices. Future inflation may also be increased by rising prices of some services, which may, to some extent, result from the growth of energy prices, and by the recent considerable depreciation of the zloty exchange rate. Persistently increased inflation creates a risk of inflation expectations remaining at an elevated level. In the medium term, easing of the inflationary pressure will be supported by the considerable slowdown in the global economy and, consequently, also by a decline in economic growth in Poland. The inflationary pressure may continue to be eased by the import of goods from low-cost countries. The previous increases of the NBP's interest rates as well as the currently observed and expected further tightening of banks' lending conditions will also contribute to lowering inflation. The Council assessed the probability of inflation running above or below the target in the medium term to be roughly equal. The Council's decisions in the coming months will depend on the incoming information on the outlook for economic growth and inflation in Poland and abroad. The Council will analyse the impact of developments in the domestic interbank market on the monetary policy transmission mechanism in Poland. The Council maintains its view that Poland should join the euro area at the earliest possible date, after achieving the necessary political support for amendments in the Constitution of the Republic of Poland and other legal acts necessary for the euro adoption in Poland. The Council has adopted the Inflation Report - October 2008. Balance of Payments of the Republic of Poland in 2008 Q2, and Opinion of the Monetary Policy Council on the Draft Budget Act for the Year 2009."
United States,2008-10-29,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 50 basis points to 1 percent. The pace of economic activity appears to have slowed markedly, owing importantly to a decline in consumer expenditures. Business equipment spending and industrial production have weakened in recent months, and slowing economic activity in many foreign economies is damping the prospects for U.S. exports. Moreover, the intensification of financial market turmoil is likely to exert additional restraint on spending, partly by further reducing the ability of households and businesses to obtain credit. In light of the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities and the weaker prospects for economic activity, the Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters to levels consistent with price stability. Recent policy actions, including today's rate reduction, coordinated interest rate cuts by central banks, extraordinary liquidity measures, and official steps to strengthen financial systems, should help over time to improve credit conditions and promote a return to moderate economic growth. Nevertheless, downside risks to growth remain. The Committee will monitor economic and financial developments carefully and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; Timothy F Geithner. Vice Chairman; Elizabeth A Duke; Richard W Fisher; Donald L Kohn; Randall S Kroszner; Sandra Pianalto; Charles I Plosser; Gary H Stern; and Kevin M Warsh. In a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 50-basis-point decrease in the discount rate to 1-1/4 percent. In taking this action, the Board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston. New York. Cleveland, and San Francisco."
Romania,2008-10-30,"In its meeting of October 30, 2008, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided the following:. The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which assesses the recent macroeconomic environment and the inflation outlook, and identifies the main challenges and risks to monetary policy in the coming period. The Inflation Report will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled for November 3, 2008. The analysis of the latest macroeconomic developments indicates a continuation of the disinflation process and the maintenance of high economic growth throughout 2008, underpinned by the expansion of both investment and consumption. At the same time, the deepening of the financial crisis on global markets has triggered uncertainties surrounding the world economic outlook and the implications on the Romanian economy. The inflation rate dropped to an annual 7.3 percent in September from 8.02 percent in the previous month, after the peak of 9.04 percent in July. The adjusted annual CORE2 inflation rate - calculated by excluding the impact of administered and volatile prices (vegetables, fruit, eggs and fuel) as well as the effect of vice tax - also fell to 6.7 percent in September from 7.4 percent in August. These developments came against the background of tighter real monetary conditions, as well as due to a favourable base effect recorded in the prices of certain food items. Wage dynamics have continued to outpace productivity gains. The growth of real credit to the private sector exhibited further signs of moderation in the context of a more significant deceleration of foreign currency-denominated loans. This occurred as an effect of constraints related to higher external financing costs amid marked volatility on world financial markets, of a continued trend of gradual reduction in excess liquidity in the banking system and of the central bank shifting towards a creditor position in its relation with credit institutions. The past successive monetary policy rate hikes along with the prudential measures adopted by the NBR over time have ensured the conditions for an orderly moderation in non-government credit growth. Nevertheless, the annual inflation rate will remain in the upcoming period above the upper limit of the variation band around the 2008 target. Macroeconomic risks associated to the disinflation process, especially those related to incomes policy and to increased budget spending, remain on the upside in the context of heightened uncertainties related to the impact of the global crisis on financial markets. In such circumstances, the maintenance of a firm monetary policy stance as well as a consistent support from the other components of the macroeconomic policy mix is required. In light of the available data, the NBR Board has decided to keep the monetary policy rate unchanged at 10.25 percent per annum. This measure will ensure the consolidation of its positive level in real terms, in line with the achievement of medium-term disinflation objectives in a sustainable manner. The NBR Board has also decided to lower the minimum reserve requirement ratio on leu-denominated liabilities of credit institutions to 18 percent from 20 percent previously starting with the November 24 - December 23, 2008 maintenance period as well as to leave unchanged the existing minimum reserve requirement ratio on foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. This decision is aimed mainly at improving liquidity management on the interbank money market, amid renewed turbulences on world financial markets, with a view to ensure sustainable financing of the economy. The NBR will pursue liquidity management so as to ensure an adequate functioning of the interbank market. The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which assesses the recent macroeconomic context and inflation outlook, as well as the main challenges and risks to monetary policy in the coming period. This Report will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled for November, 3, 2008. The NBR Board will continue to vigilantly monitor domestic and global economic developments in the context of the ongoing international deleveraging process, of increased risk aversion by investors and of difficulties in assessing the duration and effects of the international financial crisis. The NBR Board is restating that it will continue to manifest the utmost vigilance in fulfilling its objectives in what concerns price stability as well as ensuring financial stability. The next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for January 6, 2009."

Euroarea,2008-11-06,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup. Prime Minister Juncker, and Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses, at today's meeting the Governing Council decided to reduce the key ECB interest rates further by 50 basis points, following the previous coordinated interest rate cut on 8 October 2008. Inflation rates are expected to continue to decline in the coming months, reaching a level in line with price stability during the course of 2009. The intensification and broadening of the financial market turmoil is likely to dampen global and euro area demand for a rather protracted period of time. In such an environment, taking into account the strong fall in commodity prices over recent months, price, cost and wage pressures in the euro area should also moderate. At the same time, the underlying pace of monetary expansion has remained strong but has continued to show further signs of deceleration. All in all, the information available and our current analysis indicate a further alleviation of upside risks to price stability at the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, even though they have not disappeared completely. At this juncture, it is therefore crucial that all parties, including public authorities, price-setters and social partners, fully live up to their responsibilities. The level of uncertainty stemming from financial market developments remains extraordinarily high and exceptional challenges lie ahead. We expect the banking sector to make its contribution to restore confidence. The Governing Council will continue to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with its medium-term objective. In so doing, it supports sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. When analysing current developments in economic activity, we face an extraordinarily high degree of uncertainty in large part stemming from the intensification and broadening of the financial market turmoil. The world economy as a whole is feeling the adverse effects, as tensions increasingly spill over from the financial sector to the real economy and from advanced economies to emerging market economies. In the case of the euro area, the latest survey data confirm that momentum in economic activity has weakened significantly, with sluggish domestic and external demand and tighter financing conditions. Looking forward, it will be crucial to lay sound foundations for a recovery. For this to materialise as early as possible, it is of the utmost importance to maintain discipline and a medium-term perspective in macroeconomic policy-making, and to avoid second-round effects. It is equally important that the banking sector takes fully into account the significant support measures adopted by governments to deal with the financial turmoil. These measures should be supporting trust in the financial system and should help to prevent undue constraints in credit supply to companies and households. In combination with the recent broad-based falls in commodity prices, these measures should help to restore confidence. In the view of the Governing Council, a number of the downside risks to economic activity identified earlier have materialised, particularly those stemming from the financial market tensions. Other downside risks continue to relate to disorderly developments due to global imbalances and rising protectionist pressures, as well as to the possibility of renewed increases in commodity prices. With regard to price developments, annual HICP inflation has remained considerably above the level consistent with price stability since last autumn. However, it has been steadily declining since July, falling  according to Eurostat's flash estimate  to 3.2% in October, from 3.6% in September and 3.8% in August. The continued high level of inflation is largely due to both the direct and indirect effects of past surges in energy and food prices at the global level. Moreover, strong wage growth in the first half of the year, in spite of a weaker growth momentum, combined with a deceleration in labour productivity during the same period, resulted in a significant increase in unit labour cost. Looking forward, recent sharp falls in commodity prices, as well as the ongoing weakening in demand, suggest that the annual HICP inflation rate will continue to decline in the coming months and reach a level in line with price stability during the course of 2009. Depending, in particular, on the future path of oil and other commodity prices, some even stronger downside movements in HICP inflation cannot be excluded around the middle of next year, particularly due to base effects. These movements would be short-lived and therefore not relevant from a monetary policy perspective. Looking through such volatility, however, upside risks to price stability at the policy-relevant horizon are alleviating. The remaining upside risks relate to an unexpected increase in commodity prices, as well as in indirect taxes and administered prices, and the emergence of broad-based second-round effects in price and wage-setting behaviour, particularly in economies where nominal wages are indexed to consumer prices. The Governing Council calls for these schemes to be abolished. It is imperative to ensure that medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels in line with price stability. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rates of broad money and credit aggregates, while still remaining strong, continued to decline in September. Taking the appropriate medium-term perspective, monetary data up to September confirm that upside risks to price stability are diminishing but that they have not disappeared completely. A closer examination of the money and credit data indicates that the recent intensification of financial tensions has already had an identifiable impact, particularly in the form of outflows from money market funds and greater inflows into overnight deposits. However, the full impact of investors' uncertainty on their portfolio allocation behaviour is still to be seen in the coming months. Both portfolio shifts between nonmonetary and monetary assets and shifts between different types of monetary assets can therefore not be ruled out in the period ahead. Hence, such effects will need to be taken into account when assessing monetary growth and its implications for price stability over the medium term. There is also some evidence in the September data that the recent intensification of the financial tensions has triggered a slower provision of bank credit to euro area residents, mostly taking the form of smaller holdings of securities. At the same time, for the euro area as a whole, up to September there were no indications of a drying-up in the availability of bank loans to households and non-financial corporations. In particular, the maturity composition of loans suggests that non-financial corporations continued to obtain funding, also at relatively long maturities. However, more data and further analysis are necessary to form a robust judgement. To sum up, the intensification and broadening of the financial market turmoil is likely to dampen global and euro area demand for a rather protracted period of time. In such an environment, taking into account the strong fall in commodity prices over recent months, price, cost and wage pressures in the euro area should also moderate. At the same time, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms that the underlying pace of monetary expansion has remained strong but has continued to show further signs of deceleration. Hence, when taking all information and analysis into account, there is a further alleviation of upside risks to price stability at the policy-relevant medium-term horizon, even though they have not disappeared completely. At this juncture, it is therefore crucial that all parties, including public authorities, price-setters and social partners, fully live up to their responsibilities. The level of uncertainty stemming from financial market developments remains extraordinarily high and exceptional challenges lie ahead. We expect the banking sector to make its contribution to restore confidence. The Governing Council will continue to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with its medium-term objective. In so doing, it supports sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. In the area of fiscal policy, medium-term challenges, such as population ageing, strongly underline the need for fiscal policy to focus on medium-term sustainability and thereby build confidence. Accordingly, and as recently confirmed by the ECOFIN Council and the European Council, the fiscal policy provisions of the Maastricht Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact should continue to be applied fully. The fiscal rules are one of the indispensable pillars of EMU and the single currency, which must remain firmly in place so as not to undermine the confidence in fiscal sustainability. Finally, the current situation calls for ensuring the high quality and timeliness of statistical information on government interventions to ensure the transparent and accountable use of public funds. Turning to structural policies, the ongoing period of weak economic activity and high uncertainty about the economic outlook will require a significant degree of resilience from the euro area economy. The current situation should therefore be seen as a catalyst to foster the implementation of necessary domestic reforms so that countries may fully exploit the benefits offered by the enhancement of international trade and market integration, in line with the principle of an open market economy with free competition."
Egypt,2008-11-06,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release November 6, 2008 The Central Bank of Egypt decided to keep its overnight deposit and discount rate unchanged at 115 percent per annu. In its meeting held on November 6, 2008, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit and lending rates unchanged at 115 percent and 135 percent, respectivel. Over the past six weeks, turmoil in the global financial markets has severely intensified, leading many central banks in developed and emerging countries to intervene in their respective domestic markets using all tools available to ease liquidity shortages and ensure that their money markets are orderly functionin. The effects on the Egyptian banking sector, however, have been minimal in light of prudent regulations and comfortable domestic liquidity condition. In the meantime, domestic inflationary pressures are expected to ease supported by the significantly lower international commodity prices and the expected moderation in the domestic economic growth in light of the global slowdow. Domestic Inflation and Economic Growth For the first time since November 2007, annual headline CPI inflation declined to 215% in September compared to 236% in August, as domestic food inflation has fallen from 31% to 256. While inflation is still high, the pace of monthly acceleration is moderating, declining from an average of 227% between January 2008 and August to 027% in Septembe. This comes on the back of a marked decline in international food prices and the softening of domestic inflationary pressure. Generally speaking, most of the upside risks to inflation, discussed in the previous MPC meeting, have ease. This comes on the backdrop of the improving outlook for international commodity prices in light of the projected slowdown in global economic activity and the consequent moderation in domestic economic growt. Against this background, the domestic inflation outlook is better than previously envisage. While the impending global recession will impact exports of goods and services negatively, growth momentum that has been building up over the past three years will contribute to a soft landing for the Egyptian economy, supported mainly by domestic deman. deeper and more protracted global recession than currently projected presents a downside risk to domestic economic growt. Incoming data over the next few months will be crucial to assess the domestic growth outloo. The Banking System The Egyptian banking system continues to be relatively isolated from the global turbulence as domestic banks have very limited exposure to the failed and stressed global financial - 1 - institution. Moreover the exposure of domestic banks to risky assets has been marginal since there are virtually no investments in structured credit products or other impaired derivative product. Prudent regulatory surveillance and effective banking supervision, which have been strengthened under the Central Bank of Egypt's Banking Sector Reform Program launched in 2004, have ensured that the Egyptian banking system continues to function normally amid the global financial turmoi. The stability of the domestic banking sector has also been aided by the high levels of balance sheet liquidit. Judging by the structure of the banking system's balance sheet, the share of wholesale funding has been marginal whereas retail deposits correspond to more than two thirds of the banking system's liabilitie. Accordingly the financing of loan expansion originates predominantly from domestic deposits, which results in minimal dependence on funds from foreign market. The overall loans-to-deposit ratio is around 55 percent, with a high proportion of assets being short term and liqui. Furthermore Egyptian corporates obtain most of their finances domestically which makes them highly sheltered from the freeze in international money markets and the higher cost of funds in light of higher international risk aversio. Hence the domestic banking system can be characterized as highly liquid and well capitalize. Moreover the money and foreign exchange markets have been operating in an orderly manner and remain very liqui. Therefore it becomes clear that the fundamental requirements for the domestic banking sector to continue to function smoothly are entrenched in the system, lending the necessary support to the economy's growth momentum going forwar. Monetary Policy Stance Given the monetary tightening since February, the MPC believes that the current level of the policy rate is supportive of disinflatio. Yet ongoing uncertainties surrounding the projected slowdown of external demand pose downside risks to domestic economic growt. The MPC will consider a measured rate cut when needed, so as to prevent economic growth from falling below its potentia. Dr Rania Al-Mashat Division Chief.

Philippines,2008-11-06,"The Monetary Board approved on 6 November the reduction of the regular reserve requirement on bank deposits and deposit substitutes by two percentage points effective 14 November. At the same time, the Board also increased the BSP budget for the peso rediscounting facility from P20 billion to P40 billion effective immediately. The two measures are aimed at preemptively ensuring the proper functioning of the interbank market and guarding against a possible liquidity or credit tightness arising from the global rise in risk aversion. The reduction in the reserve requirement has been a medium-term policy objective of the BSP to lower banks' intermediation costs, and the Monetary Board believes that present conditions provide room for a calibrated reduction. The Board also agreed to increase the budget for the rediscounting facility to allow more banking institutions to obtain loans from the BSP against eligible promissory notes for short-term liquidity needs. Going forward, the BSP will continue to monitor financial and monetary developments, particularly those in the credit market, and act as warranted to shield the financial system from the adverse effects of the global financial crisis."
South Korea,2008-11-07,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points from 4.25% to 4.00%. In a related action, the Committee also lowered the interest rates on Aggregate Credit Ceiling Loans by 25 basis points from 2.50% to 2.25%. (The following is an English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points from 4.25% to 4.00%. The domestic economic slowdown persists. The pace of export growth has declined owing to the weakening of global economic growth and domestic demand such as private consumption remains sluggish. The downside risk to economic growth is considered to have been augmented by the knock-on effects of the financial market unrest. Despite the depreciation of the Korean won against the US dollar, consumer price inflation has been slowing gradually due to the decline in international oil prices and the impact of the economic slowdown. Transactions in the real estate market have declined and prices are showing a downward tendency. Financial market price variables such as the exchange rate and stock prices have continued to show unstable movements. Fund-raising conditions for firms have become more difficult mainly due to the outflow of foreign portfolio investment and the tightening of financial institutions' attitude to lending. Looking ahead, the Committee will do what is needed to ward off the risk of a severe slowdown in economic activity brought about mainly by the financial market unrest while keeping a vigilant watch on the changes in the upside risk to inflation."
Chile,2008-11-13,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 13 November 2008 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 8.25% (annual). This decision is consistent with the Board's update of the baseline scenario considered in the last Monetary Policy Report, which accounts for the drastic changes observed in the global economy and their impact on projected inflation. This update will be published tomorrow at 16.30 hrs. Internationally, measures adopted by various central banks and government authorities have averted more extreme scenarios, although access to credit and asset prices continue under high stress. Markets foresee a significant slowdown of the world economy while commodity prices, particularly those of copper and oil, have fallen sharply. Domestically, the available information for output during the second-half of 2008 is consistent with a higher annual expansion than in the first half, but in a decelerating path. Although domestic demand continues to grow at high year-on- year rates, a slowdown is perceived in some components of durable consumption. Unemployment has remained stable and tight lending standards persist. In October, monthly inflation was high, and the various measures of core inflation are still elevated. Meanwhile, wage dynamics continue to be in line with historical patterns and medium-term inflation expectations have fallen. The Board reaffirms its commitment to conduct monetary policy so as to reduce the current high inflation rates to 3% over the policy horizon. * The Spanish original prevails."
Peru,2008-11-15,"- MONETARY PROGRAM FOR NOVEMBER 2008 BCRP MAINTAINS REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 6.50% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference interest rate at 6.50 percent. In October, the rate of inflation reflected the rise in the prices of some foodstuffs (potato) and public utilities (electricity and water). However, in the next months inflation should resume the downward path foreseen in the evolution of inflation, which includes the effects of the recent drops observed in the international prices of food inputs and fuels. The Board will continue to oversee the development of domestic demand and of the national and international economic and financial situation, as well as the evolution of inflation and its determinants, including the impact of public utility rates. The Board also reiterates that the Central Bank will adopt any necessary measures to lead inflation to gradually converge to the target range in a context of sustained growth, including adopting a more flexible monetary stance, should this be required. The Board also approved to maintain the following annual interest rates on active and passive operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system: Direct repo and rediscount operations: 7.25 percent. Overnight deposits: 5.75 percent. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 7.25 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for December on its session of December 11, 2008."
Philippines,2008-11-19,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to keep the BSP's key policy interest rates steady at 6 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 8 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs, and special deposit accounts (SDAs) were also left unchanged. In its assessment, the Monetary Board considered the outlook on inflation, including the balance of risks. The Board noted that, while price pressures are retreating and inflation expectations are moderating, the rising readings on core inflation suggest that there are still price pressures in the pipeline. Furthermore, sources of upside inflation risks remain, including the volatility in the foreign exchange market. The monetary authorities noted that the two-percentage-point reduction in the reserve requirement and the doubling of the BSP peso rediscounting budget to P40 billion have infused additional liquidity in the financial system, which would adequately support the growth requirements of the economy amid tight global financial conditions. The BSP will monitor closely the impact of ongoing global developments on prices and domestic economic activity. It will continuously assess macroeconomic developments and calibrate monetary policy settings as warranted."
Turkiye,2008-11-19,"The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) has decided to lower the policy rates as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate is decreased from 16.75 percent to 16.25 percent, while lending rate is decreased from 19.75 percent to 18.75 percent, b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m. is decreased from 12.75 percent to 12.25 percent, while lending rate is decreased from 22.75 percent to 21.75 percent, c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions is decreased from 18.75 percent to 17.75 percent. Recent readings indicate a significant slowdown in domestic economic activity. Ongoing problems in international credit markets and the global economy will continue to restrain both the domestic and external demand for an extended period, limiting the pass-through from exchange rates to domestic prices. Besides, the sharp decline in oil and other commodity prices will have a favorable impact on disinflation. Accordingly, the Committee judges that inflation will display a more rapid fall than envisaged before. In this respect, the Committee has decided to lower the borrowing rates by 50 basis points. Moreover, the margin between the lending and borrowing rates was reduced by a further 50 basis points in order to contain the potential volatility in short term interest rates. The Committee has underscored the importance of maintaining the smooth functioning of the financial system and the efficiency of credit markets, and has thus decided to implement additional measures regarding the foreign exchange liquidity. The Central Bank will continue to take the necessary measures to contain the adverse effects of the global financial turmoil on the domestic economy, provided that they do not conflict with the price stability objective. Future policy decisions will largely depend on the developments in global markets and their reflections on the domestic markets. It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight working days."
Hungary,2008-11-24,"At its meeting on 24 November 2008, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and reduced the central bank base rate by 50 basis points from 11.50% to 11.00%, effective from 25 November 2008.The Council discussed the November 2008 issue of the Bank's Quarterly Report on Inflation. The crisis hitting the international financial system has caused a fundamental change in the path of the Hungarian economy in recent months. In the period ahead, economic growth and inflation both may be sharply lower than expected earlier. With a temporary decline in economic activity followed by a slow recovery, inflation may fall significantly below the 3 per cent target on the horizon relevant for monetary policy. The fall in investors' willingness to take risk internationally and the sharp reduction in market liquidity make it necessary to reduce further Hungary's external financing requirement, which may be achieved through a closing of the gap between incomes and expenditures of domestic economic agents. As a consequence of the financial crisis, growth in Hungary's foreign trade partners has slowed significantly and, therefore, the correction of external and domestic demand is taking place simultaneously, making it particularly difficult to adjust. The deterioration in the prospects for economic activity at home and abroad has led to a considerable shift in the future path of inflation compared with earlier expectations. In addition to a weakening in domestic demand, the reduction in inflationary pressures from the global economy, closely linked to oil, commodity and food prices, are expected to contribute to inflation easing back at a faster pace.A month ago, amidst a general decline in willingness to take risk, the narrowing in liquidity worldwide and a lack of confidence in the country's ability to finance its external debt, the exchange rate of the forint came under significant downward pressure  much greater than justified by economic fundaments. In these extraordinary circumstances, the Monetary Council decided to increase the base rate by 300 basis points on 22 October 2008, in order to preserve the stability of the domestic financial intermediary system, check capital outflows, prevent depreciation expectations from increasing further, as well as to make it more expensive to speculate against the forint. The agreement reached with the International Monetary Fund and the government's planned budgetary adjustment measures reduced the risks of financing the country's external debt, which, in turn, increased the room for monetary policy manoeuvre. The Monetary Council therefore decided to reduce the base rate. Official interest rates can be reduced further if the risks around the persistence of capital inflows and the stability of the financial intermediary system continue to diminish."
Israel,2008-11-24,"24.11.2008 The Bank of Israel reduces the interest rate for December 2008 by 50 basis points to 2.5 percent The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for December 2008 will be reduced by 50 basis points, to 2.5 percent. Background conditions Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.1 percent in October, slightly below the average forecast of 0.2 percent. In the last twelve months the CPI has risen by 5.5 percent. The index excluding food, energy and fruit and vegetables rose by 3.5 percent in the last twelve months, and by 0.2 percent in October. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: The downward trend in inflation expectations for the next twelve months that started in the second half of September continued in November: expectations calculated from the capital market averaged 0.2 percent (this low level may be partly due to technical factors), and forecasters' predictions averaged 1.1 percent. Interest rate expectations, both those derived from the capital market and those of forecasters, are for a reduction of about 25 basis points on average in the interest rate for December. Real economic activity: The picture that emerges from the monthlydata, particularly those relating to September and October, is of a significant slowdown in economic growth. According to the National Accounts for the third quarter. GDP increased by 2.3 percent, and nonresidential investment dropped by 16.5 percent, both at annual rates. The composite state-of-the-economy index declined by 0.4 percent in October, and the indices for theprevious three months were revised downwards. The index of manufacturing production, which is one of the components of the composite index, fell by 5.7 percent, and the index of manufactured exports declined by 5.2 percent. The drop in tax revenues is an indication of a significant slowdown in the growth of domestic economic activity and in imports, mainly of durables. The Bank of Israel cut its estimate of growth in 2008 and its forecast for 2009 to 4.3 percent and 1.5 percent respectively. The labor market and wages: National Insurance Institute data up to August point to a standstill in employment in the third quarter (in contrast to the improvement recorded in previous quarters), and drops of 2 percent in the nominal wage and 5 percent in the real wage from their levels in the previous quarter. According to the Ministry of Industry. Trade and Labor Employers Survey, the number of vacancies has fallen, as have expectations of the rise in the payroll, but so far there is no sign of a change in the rate of employment terminations. Budget policy: The rate of government expenditure fell sharply in the months from August to October, creating a cumulative shortfall of NIS 3.5 billion from the rate of expenditure consistent with the seasonal budget path. Government tax revenues were NIS 3.5 billion below the forecast seasonal path. Non-tax revenues exceeded the forecast by a similar amount, so that total government revenues are consistent with the seasonal path of thebudget, and tax revenues till the end of the year are expected to be in line with the forecast. Based on developments till now, and assuming full expenditure of the budget, the domestic deficit excluding credit operations isexpected to be below the target of 1.6 percent of GDP. The foreign exchange market: In the period between the monetary policy discussions of 26 October and 23 November, the shekel weakened by 3.7 percent against the dollar, by 3.8 percent against the euro, and by 2.6 percent against the index of the effective exchange rate (weighted by the volume of trade). In this period the dollar continued to strengthen against most of the major currencies by up to 6 percent, so that the development of the exchange rate of the shekel against the dollar was in line with that of most of the main currencies. The capital and money markets: Between the interest rate discussion of 26 October and 23 November, the Tel Aviv 25 and the Tel Aviv 100 share price indices declined 23 percent and 24 percent respectively. The leading share indices abroad also dropped. In this period yields on 10-year unindexed government bonds rose by 0.41 percentage points to 6.40 percent. Yields on US government 10-year bonds continued to decline, and this month fell by 0.49 percentage points, to 3.2 percent, so that the yield gap between the Israeli bonds and US government bonds widened to 3.2 percentage points. Prices of corporate bonds continued to fall in this period. The Tel-Bond 20 index fell by 9 percent, and the Tel-Bond 40 index by 18 percent. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, increased markedly in the week following the previous interest rate decision on 26 October, from 2.20 percent to 2.51 percent, but then dropped back again to reach 2 percent on 21 November. The CDS spreads in emerging markets also widened to unprecedented levels. The world economy: The crisis in the global financial system continued. The financial markets were still under heavy pressure, and uncertainty remained at a high level. The tightening of credit terms, in particular for households, persisted, despite significant cuts in the interest rates by central banks. Economic activity: In the last few months the global economy underwent a significant slowdown, verging on a recession. This resulted in downward revisions of the various growth forecasts, including those of the IMF, the OECD, the World Bank, and several investment houses. The IMF lowered its global growth forecast again this month, and this now stands at 2.2 percent for 2009. Inflation: The IMF expects that world inflation will remain high in 2008 and that it will moderate in 2009. Against that background many central banks made further cuts in their interest rates this month,and they are expected to maintain a low-interest policy. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to reduce the interest rate for December by half a percentage point is consistent with the objective of returning inflation to the target range of 1-3 percent in the next twelve months, it helps to strengthen the economy's ability to cope with the implications of the global financial crisis, and supports real activity. Inflation expectations are for a reduction to around the lower limit of the target inflation range (1 percent) in the first half of 2009. Forecasters' predictions and expectations derived from the capital market continued to fall, and since the beginning of the month have averaged 1.1 percent and 0.2 percent respectively. Against thebackground of the decline in global economic activity and the increased cost of credit to the Israeli business sector, the data on real activity in Israel indicate a more severe slowdown in the expansion of economic activity. Uncertainty in the global financial markets and in Israel's financial marketsis high. In light of the global financial crisis and the expected continued deterioration in global economic activity, as well as the worldwide reductions in inflation expectations, the capital markets expect central banks around the world to continue to cut their interest rates The current reduction in the interest rate is intended to help cut the cost of credit and to strengthen the economy's ability to handle theexpected slowdown in economic activity and the implications of the global financial crisis. Furthermore, it appears that in the current circumstances, the depreciation of the shekel against the dollar does not at this stage threaten the achievement of the inflation target or financial stability. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor Israeli and worldwide economic developments closely, and will take whatever steps are necessary to support the stability of the financial system and to encourage employment and growth, as long as inflation continues to decline towards and achieve the price stability target. 24.11.2008 The Bank of Israel reduces the interest rate for December 2008 by 50 basis points to 2.5 percent. The Bank of Israel reduces the interest rate for December 2008 by 50 basis points to 2.5 percent.

In light of the global financial crisis and the expected continued deterioration in global economic activity, as well as the worldwide reductions in inflation expectations, the capital markets expect central banks around the world to continue to cut their interest rates. The current reduction in the interest rate is intended to help cut the cost of credit and to strengthen the economy's ability to handle theexpected slowdown in economic activity and the implications of the global financial crisis."
Malaysia,2008-11-24,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to reduce the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) to 3.25 percent. The ceiling and floor rates of the corridor for the OPR are correspondingly reduced to 3.50 percent and 3.00 percent respectively. Since the previous MPC meeting, the outlook for global growth has deteriorated further. Several major advanced economies are now in recession amid severe stress in their respective financial systems. The sharp slowdown in global demand, the significant fall in commodity prices and the substantial decline in equity prices have exerted greater downward pressure on the growth prospects of regional economies. In this environment, global inflation has begun to recede and this downward trend is expected to continue. These global developments have prompted authorities to provide significant liquidity support to the financial system, undertake financial sector resolution measures, as well as fiscal stimulus and monetary easing to support economic growth. The impact of these measures will however take some time to be fully realised. The adverse global developments have already affected the Malaysian economy, as evidenced by the slowdown in export performance and lower equity prices. While domestic demand remains resilient, there are indications of slower private sector activity amid some softening in the labour market conditions and a more challenging business environment. Under these conditions, sustaining domestic demand is key to ensuring that growth in 2009 remains positive. The risk to domestic price stability is now substantially reduced. Inflation has begun to moderate from its peak in the third quarter of 2008. Going forward, the lower cost pressures and the slowdown in demand are expected to exert a greater dampening influence on inflation. Inflation is, therefore, expected to moderate significantly, particularly in the second-half of 2009. Given the heightened downside risks to growth and the diminishing inflationary pressures, the reduction in the OPR is a pre-emptive measure aimed at providing a more accommodative monetary environment. To further reduce the cost of intermediation, the MPC also decided to reduce the Statutory Reserve Requirement (SRR) from 4% to 3.5%, with effect from 1 December 2008. Going forward, the global economic and the international financial conditions are expected to continue to remain volatile and uncertain. Bank Negara Malaysia will monitor closely the evolving developments and will undertake the appropriate policy response to avoid a severe economic downturn. The meeting also approved the schedule of MPC meetings for 2009. The Monetary Policy Statement will continue to be released at 6:00 p.m. on the same day as the MPC meeting.

Georgia,2008-11-26,"26.11.2008: The NBG Decreases its Policy Rate (Refinancing Rate) by 100 Basis Points, to 9 Percent. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on November 26, 2008 and decided to lower its main policy rate (the refinancing rate), by 100 basis points to 9 percent. The world is currently going through the most serious international financial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930's. The global macroeconomic forecast is pessimistic and envisages a sharp decline in the growth rate of GDP on a worldwide level. Many nations are even expected to experience decreasing GDP levels. Significant uncertainty remains in the global financial markets, although expectations of a global recession have increased. According to forecasts, demand in international markets will decrease, which will have an impact on Georgia's exports. The developments in international markets as well as the Russian aggression in Georgia have weakened the confidence of local and foreign investors. The latter, in its part, is responsible for the reduction of investment and consumption. Subsequently, the demand for imports and its prices, are decreasing. Despite the expected decrease in imports, with the abovementioned factors considered, the GDP growth in Georgia is projected to slow down both in 2008 and 2009. The international assistance package allocated for Georgia will significantly soften the adverse impact of the abovementioned factors. Using fiscal levers to channel the international aid to the economy through high capital expenditures will support economic activity. Commodity prices are expected to continue declining in international markets, a factor which increases deflation risks. According to the inflation forecast, there is a high likelihood that the actual rate of inflation may be lower than the target rate. The low growth rate of the monetary aggregates is also putting downward pressure on prices. Despite the fact that the elevated level of uncertainty, as in many other countries, has decreased the effectiveness of monetary policy in Georgia, the National Bank of Georgia is softening its monetary policy stance taking into account the existing forecasts on the current fundamental factors affecting the economy. The NBG will closely monitor current developments in the economy and financial markets with the objective of achieving the forecast inflation rate and will in due course act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will take place on December 24, 2008."
Poland,2008-11-26,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 26 November 2008 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 25-26 November 2008 The Council decided to lower the NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage point to the level: (cid:131) reference rate 5.75% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate 7.25 % on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate 4.25% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate 6.00% on an annual basis. Data that have been released recently indicate that economic growth in Poland will decrease in the coming quarters. Stronger than previously expected economic slowdown will be driven by a significant decline in economic growth abroad, increased uncertainty as to the economic outlook as well as limited credit availability and its increased costs resulting from higher risk premium incorporated in market interest rates. At the same time, information on labour market developments points to a sustained high growth of wages and a continuously unfavourable relation between wage and labour productivity growth. Decelerating employment growth signals softening of the labour market and a likely diminishing wage pressure in the coming quarters. Since the Council's meeting in October growth forecasts for the global economy have been further revised downwards due to the persisting turmoil in the global financial markets and its growing impact on the real economy. At the same time, strong slowdown in the global economy  in particular, recession in the United States, the euro area and Great Britain  and the accompanying decline in commodity and food prices in the world markets contribute to decline in inflation, which has urged many central banks to continue to decrease their policy interest rates. The turmoil in the global financial markets has led to increased risk aversion, accompanied by depreciation of exchange rates of many countries, including Central and Eastern European countries, and by increased volatility of these exchange rates. In October the annual growth of consumer prices in Poland decreased again (to 4.2%), although remaining above the NBP inflation target of 2.5% and also above the upper limit for deviations from the target set at 3.5%. Further rise in the prices of energy and considerable part of services, including primarily services related to flat maintenance, was contributing to inflation persisting at an elevated level. In the Council's assessment in the near future inflation will continue above the upper limit for deviations from the inflation target which will mainly result from the increase in regulated prices. Yet, in the medium term stronger than previously expected slowdown in the global economy  in particular, the recession in Poland's major trading partners  and, consequently, the decline in domestic economic growth will contribute to lowering inflation in Poland. Decreasing GDP growth and the related falling labour demand as well as deteriorating financial condition of enterprises will contribute to easing the wage pressure, and, consequently, also the inflationary pressure. The ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51, tightening of banks' lending conditions will also contribute to lowering inflation. Factors delaying the decline in inflation may include  apart from high annual growth in regulated prices  growing prices of some services, which may be partly driven by the growth in energy prices. The Council assessed the probability of inflation running below the target in the medium term to be higher than the probability of inflation running above the target and decided to lower the NBP interest rates. The Council's decisions in the coming months will take account of the incoming information on the outlook for economic growth and inflation in Poland and abroad. Maintaining fiscal discipline in the public finance sector may be conducive to easing monetary policy. The Council will analyse the impact of developments in the domestic interbank market on the monetary policy transmission mechanism in Poland. The Council maintains its view that Poland should join the Exchange Rate Mechanism II (ERM and the euro area at the earliest possible date, after achieving the necessary political support for amendments in the Constitution of the Republic of Poland and other legal acts necessary for the euro adoption in Poland. At the meeting the Council got acquainted with the Report on the Condition of Polish Banks in 2007 prepared by the Polish Financial Supervision Authority."
Thailand,2008-12-03,"No 44 /2008 Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 3 December 2008 Ms. Duangmanee Vongpradhip. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand, announces that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance. The main issues discussed were as follows. The global financial crisis has led to a significant and more-than-expected slowdown in growth in industrial economies as well as a marked decline in exports of regional economies. Thailand's economic data in the third quarter and latest indicators in October pointed towards a noted slowdown in economic activities as well as a substantial rise in the risks to growth going forward. In addition, the impact of fiscal stimulus is likely to be delayed, while domestic political problems are likely to have greater repercussions on economic growth than previously assessed, particularly to confidence and tourism. Risks to inflation declined significantly compared to the previous meeting from lower oil and commodity prices due to weaker global economic conditions. This will help keep inflationary pressures low throughout 2009. Given the significant change in the environment, the MPC assessed that monetary policy could be eased to help support economic recovery, particularly as the economy faced numerous negative risks, both on the domestic and external fronts. The MPC therefore decided to lower the policy interest rate by 100 percent per annum, from 375 per cent per annum to 275 per cent per annum, effective immediately."
Euroarea,2008-12-04,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference here in Brussels. I would like to thank Governor Quaden for his kind hospitality and to express our special gratitude to his staff for the excellent organisation of the meeting of the Governing Council. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting, which was also attended by Mrs Lagarde. President of the ECOFIN Council, and Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to reduce the key ECB interest rates by a further 75 basis points. This step follows the two 50-basis point reductions in the key ECB interest rates announced on 8 October and 6 November 2008. Overall, since our last meeting, the evidence that inflationary pressures are diminishing further has increased and, looking forward, inflation rates are expected to be in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon, supporting the purchasing power of incomes and savings. The decline in inflation rates is due mainly to the fall in commodity prices and the significant slowdown in economic activity. Largely related to the effects of the intensification and broadening of the financial turmoil, both global demand and euro area demand are likely to be dampened for a protracted period of time. At the same time, while the underlying pace of monetary expansion has remained strong, it has continued to decelerate further. All in all, the level of uncertainty remains exceptionally high. The Governing Council will continue to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with its medium-term objective. In so doing, it supports sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Since September, there has been an intensification and broadening of the financial market turmoil. Tensions have increasingly spilled over from the financial sector to the real economy, and the world economy as a whole is feeling their adverse effects. In the euro area, a number of the downside risks to economic activity that were identified previously have materialised, leading in the third quarter to a contraction of 0.2% in real GDP growth, on a quarterly basis, according to Eurostat's first estimate. Available survey data and the monthly indicators for October and November suggest that economic activity has weakened further during the fourth quarter of 2008. Looking further ahead, on the basis of our current analysis and assessment, we see global economic weakness and very sluggish domestic demand persisting in the next few quarters. According to the December 2008 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, a subsequent recovery should then gradually take place, supported by the fall in commodity prices and assuming that the external environment improves and the financial tensions weaken. Eurosystem staff project annual real GDP growth of between 0.8% and 1.2% for 2008, between -1.0% and 0.0% for 2009, and between 0.5% and 1.5% for 2010. These figures represent substantial downward revisions relative to the previous ECB staff projections for 2008 and 2009 published in September. Forecasts by international organisations have also been revised downwards and are broadly in line with the December 2008 Eurosystem staff projections. In the view of the Governing Council, the economic outlook remains surrounded by an exceptionally high degree of uncertainty. They relate mainly to the potential for a more significant impact on the real economy of the turmoil in financial markets, as well as concerns about protectionist pressures and possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances. It is crucial that all parties concerned make their contribution to lay sound foundations for a sustainable recovery. For this to materialise as early as possible, it is of the utmost importance to maintain discipline and a medium-term perspective in macroeconomic policy-making. The significant measures announced by governments to deal with the financial turmoil should be implemented swiftly so as to help ensure trust in the financial system and to prevent constraints on credit supply to companies and households. With regard to price developments, annual HICP inflation has declined substantially since July. According to Eurostat's flash estimate. HICP inflation was 2.1% in November, after 3.2% in October and 4.0% in July. The significant decline in headline inflation since the summer mainly reflects the considerable easing in global commodity prices over the past few months, which more than offsets the impact of the sharp rise in unit labour costs in the first half of this year. Looking forward, lower commodity prices and weakening demand lead us to conclude that inflationary pressures are diminishing further. The annual HICP inflation rate is expected to continue to decline in the coming months and to be in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon. Depending primarily on future developments in oil and other commodity prices, a faster decline in HICP inflation cannot be excluded around the middle of next year, mainly due to base effects. However, also due to base effects, inflation rates could increase again in the second half of the year, so that any sharp fall in HICP inflation should be short-lived and is therefore not relevant from a monetary policy perspective. Consistent with this assessment, the December 2008 Eurosystem staff projections foresee annual HICP inflation of between 3.2% and 3.4% for 2008 and declining to between 1.1% and 1.7% for 2009. For 2010. HICP inflation is projected to lie between 1.5% and 2.1%. The HICP inflation projections for 2008 and 2009 have been revised downwards substantially in relation to the September 2008 ECB staff projections, reflecting mainly the large declines in commodity prices and the impact of weakening demand on price developments. In this context, let me remind you of the conditional nature of these projections, which are based on a series of technical assumptions, including market expectations for short and long-term interest rates, as well as futures prices for oil and non-energy commodities. In addition, the projections are based on the expectation of a decline in wage pressure over the projection horizon. Forecasts from international organisations give a broadly similar picture. Looking through the shorter-term volatility in headline HICP inflation rates, risks to price stability at the policy-relevant horizon are more balanced than in the past. Unexpected further declines in commodity prices could put downward pressure on inflation, while upside risks to price stability could materialise particularly if the recent fall in commodity prices were to reverse or if domestic price pressures turn out to be stronger than assumed. It is therefore crucial that price and wage-setters fully live up to their responsibilities. Turning to the monetary analysis, various estimates of underlying broad money growth point to a sustained but moderating rate of monetary expansion in the euro area. Monetary trends therefore support the view that inflationary pressures are diminishing further, with some risks remaining on the upside in the medium to longer term. It should be recognised that the intensification of the financial market turmoil since mid-September marks a potential watershed in the evolution of monetary developments. The most recent money and credit data indicate that this intensification has had a significant impact on the behaviour of market participants. Thus far, such developments have largely taken the form of substitution among components of the broad aggregate M3, rather than sharp changes in the evolution of M3 itself. The latest available data, namely up to the end of October, reveal a continued moderation of the growth rate of loans to the non-financial private sector. At the same time, for the euro area as a whole, there were no significant indications of a drying up in the availability of loans. The annual growth rate of loans to households also moderated further, in line with the weakening of economic and housing market prospects and tighter financing conditions. The data do signal an impact of the intensification of the financial turmoil on bank behaviour. Looking forward, more data and further analysis are necessary to form a robust judgement. To sum up, there is increased evidence that inflationary pressures are diminishing further and inflation rates are expected to be in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon, supporting the purchasing power of incomes and savings. The decline in inflation rates is due mainly to the fall in commodity prices and the significant slowdown in economic activity largely related to the global effects of the financial turmoil. A cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports this view. While the underlying pace of monetary expansion has remained strong, it has continued to decelerate further. Hence, when considering all available information and analysis, the Governing Council decided to reduce the key ECB interest rates by a further 75 basis points. All in all, the level of uncertainty remains exceptionally high. The Governing Council will continue to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with its medium-term objective. In so doing, it supports sustainable growth and employment and contributes to financial stability. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead. Regarding fiscal policies, the Governing Council considers it crucial that discipline and a medium-term perspective are maintained, taking fully into account the consequences of any shorter-term action on fiscal sustainability. It is of the utmost importance that the public's confidence in the soundness of fiscal policies is preserved, with the rules-based EU fiscal framework being fully applied and its integrity being fully preserved. The provisions of the Treaty of Nice and the Stability and Growth Pact require a medium-term perspective and allow for the necessary flexibility. Automatic fiscal stabilisers are relatively large in the euro area and provide a powerful source of fiscal support to a weakening economy. Where room for manoeuvre exists, additional budgetary measures could be effective if they are timely, targeted and temporary. Turning to structural policies, the ongoing period of weak economic activity and high uncertainty about the economic outlook imply the need to strengthen the resilience and flexibility of the euro area economy. Product market reforms should foster competition and speed up effective restructuring. Labour market reforms should help to facilitate appropriate wage-setting, as well as labour mobility across sectors and regions. The current situation should therefore be seen as a catalyst to foster the implementation of necessary domestic reforms in line with the principle of an open market economy with free competition."
Chile,2008-12-11,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 11 December 2008 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 8.25% (annual). This decision is consistent with the Board's update of the baseline scenario contained in the last Monetary Policy Report, due to the drastic changes observed in the global economy and their impact on forecasted inflation. Internationally, access to credit and asset prices continue under high stress. Latest data confirms a significant slowdown in the global economy. Commodity prices, particularly those of copper and oil, have fallen again. Domestically, information available for the imported components of internal demand shows smaller than foreseen levels, while output remains on a decelerating path. Unemployment is still stable and tight credit conditions persist. In November, due to the lower price of fuels, monthly inflation was negative, but the various measures of core inflation remain high. Meanwhile, the peso has depreciated, while wage dynamics continue in line with historical patterns and medium-term inflation expectations have fallen. The Board considers that, in the most likely scenario, a process of monetary easing will begin, the pace of which will depend on inflation perspectives. Accordingly, the Board reaffirms its commitment to conduct monetary policy so as to reduce the current high inflation rates to 3% over the policy horizon. * The Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2008-12-11,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower the Base Rate by 100 basis points from 4.00% to 3.00%. In a related action, the Committee also lowered the interest rates on Aggregate Credit Ceiling Loans by 50 basis points from 2.25% to 1.75%. (The following is an English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower the Base Rate by 100 basis points from 4.00% to 3.00%. The domestic economy is slowing down rapidly. The sluggishness of domestic consumption and investment has been deepening and export growth has turned negative. There is now judged to be a strong likelihood that growth will fall sharply as a result of the worldwide economic slowdown along with the financial market unrest including the credit crunch. Despite the depreciation of the Korean won against the US dollar, consumer price inflation has been decelerating steadily due to the fall in international oil prices and the impact of the economic slowdown. In the real estate market, the volume of transactions and prices have continued to decline. Financial market price variables such as the exchange rate and stock prices have been increasingly volatile. Fund-raising conditions for firms have become more difficult mainly due to the continuation of both foreign portfolio investment outflows and the tightening of financial institutions' attitude to lending. Looking ahead, the Committee will do what is needed to improve liquidity conditions and to ward off the risk of a severe slowdown in economic activity."
Nigeria,2008-12-11,"CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE No. 59 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE. DECEMBER 11, 2008 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) held its 206th meeting today. December 11, 2008 and reviewed the economic and financial developments in the international scene and the domestic economy. The Committee noted the continued weakening of the global economy despite the coordinated response by the fiscal authorities and central banks to the global financial crisis and the ensuing economic downturn. Specifically global unemployment has been on the rise, shortage of liquidity and acute scarcity of credit have remained visible in the financial institutions, while stock market developments have been marked by a high degree of fluctuation and corporations have continued to post financial losses. With falling demand by developed economies, the international crude oil and other commodity prices have declined sharply during the preceding three months. Inflation however, appeared to have moderated slightly in most developed economies and some emerging market economies. The Committee also evaluated the outcomes of the policy decisions taken at its Special Meeting on September 18, 2008 and noted that the desired macroeconomic outcomes were largely achieved. Inflation rose further in October contrary to the seasonal pattern, while the naira exchange rate depreciated in all segments of the foreign exchange market since November. In addition, key interest rates rose during the review period after some moderation in September through October following the implementation of the decisions taken at the Special Meeting of the Committee. The MPC also expressed concern on the potential negative impact of the rapidly declining oil prices on the fiscal operations of the three tiers of Government and the overall economy. Against this background, therefore, the overall macroeconomic outlook remains challenging. KEY MACROECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS Inflation The Committee noted the sharp rise in headline year-on-year inflation in October to 147 per cent from 130 per cent in September 2008, which is counter seasonal and driven by both food and non-food components. Similarly core inflation rose to 79 per cent in October from 69 per cent in September. Staff projections indicate that the year-on-year headline inflation is not likely to moderate significantly in the remaining months of 2008. Output Aggregate output growth in the third quarter was estimated at 683 per cent compared with 523 per cent in the second quarter. The growth was driven largely by the non-oil sector, which grew by an estimated 916 per cent. However output of the 2 oil sector declined by 081 per cent. Current NBS estimate of real GDP growth for the fourth quarter of 2008 is 869 per cent, while the overall output growth for 2008 is estimated at 677 per cent compared with 640 per cent in 2007. Money and Credit Provisional data showed that growth in broad money (M2) moderated in October 2008. M2 which grew by 435 per cent, as at end-October, 2008 which when annualized translates to 522 per cent. The growth in M2 has continued to be driven mainly by credit to the core private sector, which grew by 525 per cent (or 630 per cent annualized) as at end-October, 2008. Interest Rates Key interest rates moderated in late September through October following the implementation of the decisions of the Special MPC meeting held on September 18, 2008. The rates rose in early November but have since moderated. Exchange Rate The sustained stability that has characterized the foreign exchange market in the last 24 months appeared to have come under threat since November 2008 largely due to the global economic and financial developments. The demand for foreign exchange at the WDAS has risen sharply since October as private inflows have shrunk and oil prices softened at the international market. Banking Sector Performance The Committee noted with satisfaction that Nigerian banks were largely robust enough to withstand the effects of the financial turmoil. Whereas many banks abroad have been making loses and faced with potential bankruptcies. Nigerian banks have in fact been posting profits. Nonetheless there is in general a welcome recognition of the need to enhance regulatory and supervisory efforts to set up appropriate information profiles and risk management strategies in the banks. The industry liquidity ratio declined from 5295 per cent in September to 4922 per cent in October 2008 but rose to 5155 per cent in November. The Capital adequacy ratio continued to be robust at 2225 per cent in November, 2008. External Reserves The MPC noted with satisfaction the level of external reserves at US$5811 billion as at December 10, 2008. The Committee also expressed concern about the effect of the continuing slide in oil prices on the domestic economy and assured that appropriate policy measures would be adopted to minimize the overall impact on the wider economy. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK The general expectation is that in 2009 highly developed economies would post negative growth rates while emerging market economies are likely to register sharp slowdown as a consequence. Other developing countries are also expected to decelerate. In the circumstance, the policy responses of most developed and emerging economies have tended to focus on growth and financial stability. Overall the challenges facing the Nigerian economy are in respect of developments in the international oil market encompassing both slack demand from advanced economies and declining oil prices. If the current trend continues. Nigeria's fiscal and external payments positions are likely to be further weakened in 2009. It is, however, expected that the domestic non-oil sector will rise to the challenge to offset to some extent the slack from the external sector. The optimism stems from the expected buoyant agricultural output, improvement in infrastructure as financial resources flow to the sector, and other development-enhancing activities of the government. In the light of the above, the Monetary Policy Committee decided as follows: 1. Leave the MPR unchanged at 975 per cent; 2. Reduce banks' foreign exchange net open position from 200 to 100 per cent of shareholders' funds with effect from Monday December 15, 2008; and 5 3. CBN to participate actively in the daily inter-bank foreign exchange market by buying and selling through the two-way quotes. In conclusion, the Committee noted the anxiety of participants in the foreign exchange market and will like to assure the public that the CBN remains committed to a stable exchange rate regime and will continue to meet demand for foreign exchange at market determined rates.

South Africa,2008-12-11,"Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, domestic inflation has moderated and is expected to decline further over the coming months. At the same time, the South African economy has been affected by the significant global slowdown that has intensified recently. The domestic economy experienced negligible growth in the third quarter, while a number of sectors contracted. Moreover, while there has been some improvement in the inflation outlook, risks posed by uncertainty with regard to the exchange rate in particular, remain. The data releases over the past weeks have shown that the international economy is slowing down faster than previously expected and that global inflation pressures are subsiding. This has resulted in the recent global interventions by policy makers. Domestic monetary policy remains guided by local conditions. Monetary policy always takes into consideration the possible impacts of global developments on the South African economy in general and on inflation in particular. CPIX inflation (headline inflation excluding mortgage interest cost) measured 13,6 per cent in August 2008 and subsequently declined to year-on-year increases of 13,0 per cent and 12,4 per cent in September and October, respectively. Food, petrol and electricity prices were the main contributors to the inflation outcomes, despite the petrol price reductions in September and October. Food prices increased at a year-on-year rate of 17,2 per cent in October, while petrol and electricity prices increased by 31 per cent over the same period. If food and petrol were excluded. CPIX inflation would have measured 8,4 per cent in October, compared to 8,5 per cent in September. Producer price inflation also showed signs of moderating in the past two months despite significant electricity price increases. Producer price inflation increased at a year-on-year rate of 19,1 per cent in August but moderated to 14,5 per cent in October. Agricultural food prices declined for the third successive month in October when the year-on-year rate declined to 10,4 per cent. Manufactured food prices increased by 15,6 per cent in October, compared with 20,5 per cent in August. The most recent central forecast of the Bank shows a further improvement in the inflation outlook since the previous MPC meeting. With an unchanged stance of monetary policy, inflation is expected to continue its downward trajectory, and to return to within the inflation target range in the third quarter of 2009. Inflation is expected then marginally to breach the upper end of the target range in the first quarter of 2010 as a result of technical base effects associated with the decline in petrol prices at the end of 2008. However, the downward inflation trend is forecast to continue thereafter. Inflation is expected to average 6,2 per cent and 5,6 per cent in 2009 and 2010 respectively and to average 5,3 per cent in the final quarter of 2010. The forecasts are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than usual, given the highly volatile global environment, and the uncertainty related to the impact of the rebasing and reweighting of the CPI basket to be introduced by Statistics South Africa in January 2009. Inflation expectations as measured by the yield differential between conventional government bonds and inflation-linked bonds declined from just over 9 per cent in July 2008 to around 5,1 per cent in early December. The yield curve has remained inverted at the longer end and has declined since the previous meeting, particularly in the one-to-five year maturity range. Inflation expectations as reflected in the inflation expectations survey conducted on behalf of the Bank by the Bureau for Economic Research at the University of Stellenbosch had deteriorated marginally for 2009 but then improved slightly for 2010. Average inflation expectations for 2009 measured 8,2 per cent compared to 8,1 per cent the previous quarter, while inflation expectations for 2010 measured 7,2 per cent compared to 7,4 per cent in the previous survey. This was the first time since the first quarter of 2006 that expectations for any forecast year declined. Unit labour cost in the third quarter of 2008 increased by 12,5 per cent compared to the same quarter last year. However, the improved inflation expectations, coupled with the lower actual trend in inflation, may have a moderating impact on unit labour costs which will most likely be influenced by the weaker state of the economy. The exchange rate remains the most significant upside risk to the inflation outlook. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand exchange rate has depreciated against the US dollar by about 11 per cent. At the time of the previous meeting, the rand was at a level of R9,15 to the US dollar. The currency subsequently depreciated to a level of R11,80 but recovered soon after, and for the past few weeks has traded in a relatively narrow range of between R10,00 and R10,50. On a trade weighted basis, the rand has depreciated by around 7,6 per cent since the previous meeting. The rand, along with other emerging market currencies, is influenced by the risk aversion prevailing in the uncertain global environment. International crude oil prices have declined further. North Sea Brent crude oil is currently trading at around US$40 per barrel, compared to US$83 per barrel at the time of the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee. The lower international oil price has resulted in a cumulative decline in domestic petrol prices of R3,35 per litre since August, and by R2,06 since the previous MPC meeting. If current levels of international oil prices and exchange rates persist, a further sizeable decline in the domestic petrol price can be expected in January. The trend in international food prices has also followed that of other commodities, and since June 2008 there has been a 30 per cent decline in the Economist Food Price Index. These developments have contributed to the year-on-year declines in the agricultural food component of the producer price index mentioned above, and to the significant fall in domestic spot prices of maize and wheat, despite the depreciation of the rand over the past weeks. Food price increases at the consumer price level remain elevated, but the spot price developments are expected to impact on these prices in the coming months. South Africa's economic growth rate also declined significantly in the third quarter of 2008 when real gross domestic product increased at an annualised rate of 0,2 per cent. This represented a significant widening of the output gap. The slowdown was a result of contractions in mining, manufacturing and the retail and wholesale trade sectors. Manufacturing output declined further in October. The Bank's leading indicator of economic activity has been trending downward for some time, and more recently the coincident indicator has followed this trend. The Investec/BER Purchasing Managers' Index declined to its lowest level since its inception to reach a level of 39,5, a level similar to that prevailing in a number of other countries. The RMB/BER Business Confidence Index also reflects a negative outlook. Gross fixed capital formation held up relatively well in the third quarter when it grew at a rate of 10,0 per cent, mainly as a result of investment by public corporations and general government. However, growth in private sector gross fixed capital formation declined to 2,6 per cent. This was particularly the case in investment in private residential buildings where the real value of residential and non-residential building plans continued to decline. Household consumption expenditure contracted in the third quarter for the first time since 1998. Consumption of durable goods in particular declined by almost 10 per cent, while non-durable goods consumption also contracted. Motor vehicle sales continued to decline in October and November, while real retail trade sales declined further in October. The FNB/BER Consumer Confidence Index showed a further deterioration in the fourth quarter of 2008. The rate of growth of credit extension to the private sector continued to moderate. Year-on-year growth in total loans and advances to the private sector declined to 17,1 per cent in October, while growth in mortgage advances and instalment sale credit and leasing financed decline to 16,1 per cent and 10,5 per cent respectively. There are also indications of tighter credit standards being applied by banks to both households and the corporate sector. The lower rate of credit extension to households contributed to the further moderation of household indebtedness. Household debt as a percentage of disposable income measured 75,3 per cent in the third quarter, compared to 78,5 per cent in the first quarter of 2008. The current account deficit, which measured 7,9 per cent of GDP in the third quarter of 2008, is likely to moderate in the coming months as a result of the lower international oil price and lower dividend payments to non-residents, among other factors. The turmoil in the international financial markets has been reflected as well in domestic asset prices. The all-share index on the JSE Limited has followed global equity market trends and has exhibited a high degree of volatility over the past months. Since the previous meeting, the index has declined by about 1,5 per cent, but at one stage it had declined by about 15 per cent. The housing market remains subdued, with prices falling in real terms, and in some instances in nominal terms as well. These negative wealth effects are likely to weigh on household expenditure in the coming months. Global developments are also expected to contribute to downward inflation pressures. Apart from sharply declining commodity prices, the decline in the volume of world trade has also lowered transport costs significantly. Growth forecasts have been revised down significantly, particularly in the advanced economies, and the expected protracted slowdown is likely to lower prices of other goods as well, as the pricing power of firms dissipates. The possible stimulus to growth provided by more accommodative monetary policies and fiscal stimuli are likely to take some time to filter through, given the fragile state of the banking systems and the marked declines in business and consumer sentiment. The Monetary Policy Committee considered recent developments in the South African economy and the risks to the inflation outlook against the backdrop of conditions prevailing in the global economy and international financial markets. The MPC has noted improvements in the inflation outlook in South Africa since its previous meeting in October 2008. However risks to the inflation outlook remain and will be monitored closely. The MPC has therefore decided to reduce the repurchase rate by 50 basis points to 11,5 per cent per annum with effect from 12 December 2008. ADDENDUM TO THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE.

Peru,2008-12-15,"- MONETARY PROGRAM FOR DECEMBER 2008 1 BCRP MAINTAINS REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 6.50% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference interest rate at 6.50 percent. Monthly inflation in November was lower than in previous months despite the prices rises observed in residential electricity and potable water rates. Inflation in the next months should continue showing the expected downward trend, which includes the effects of the recent drops observed in the international prices of food inputs and fuels. The Board also approved to reduce minimum legal reserve requirements from 9.0 to 7.5 percent, which would release approximately 650 million, and to reduce marginal reserve requirements in foreign currency from 35 to 30 percent. The series of policies applied by the Central Bank since September to offset the effects of the international financial crisis have allowed financial entities to significantly increase their liquidity and that credit to the private sector, in both domestic and foreign currency, continue to grow, showing higher rates of growth than the ones observed in the first nine months of the year. The flow of credit in soles increased from a monthly average of 1,077 million between January and September to a total of 2,487 million in October and to an estimated flow of 1,882 million in November. On the other hand, credit in dollars increased from a monthly average of US$ 203 million between January and September to US$ 385 million in October and to an estimated flow of US$ 379 million in November. These figures reflect the normal flow of credit, which contributes to economic growth. The Board will continue to oversee the development of domestic demand and of the national and international economic and financial situation, as well as the evolution of inflation and its determinants. The Board also reiterates that the Central Bank will adopt any necessary measures to lead inflation to gradually converge to the target range. Moreover, the Board reaffirms its commitment of using monetary instruments to supply the economy with the amount of liquidity required and states that a more flexible monetary stance will be adopted as inflation expectations start converging towards the target range. The Board also approved to maintain the following annual interest rates on active and passive operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system: Direct repo and rediscount operations: 7.25 percent. Overnight deposits: 5.75 percent. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 7.25 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for January 2009 on its session of January 8, 2008. 1 The Board's session to determine the monetary program for the month of December was held on Wednesday. December 10 instead of on Thursday. December 11 due to a Governor's mission abroad."
United States,2008-12-16,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to establish a target range for the federal funds rate of 0 to 1/4 percent. Since the Committee's last meeting, labor market conditions have deteriorated, and the available data indicate that consumer spending, business investment, and industrial production have declined. Financial markets remain quite strained and credit conditions tight. Overall, the outlook for economic activity has weakened further. Meanwhile, inflationary pressures have diminished appreciably. In light of the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities and the weaker prospects for economic activity, the Committee expects inflation to moderate further in coming quarters. The Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability. In particular, the Committee anticipates that weak economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time. The focus of the Committee's policy going forward will be to support the functioning of financial markets and stimulate the economy through open market operations and other measures that sustain the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet at a high level. As previously announced, over the next few quarters the Federal Reserve will purchase large quantities of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities to provide support to the mortgage and housing markets, and it stands ready to expand its purchases of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities as conditions warrant. The Committee is also evaluating the potential benefits of purchasing longer-term Treasury securities. Early next year, the Federal Reserve will also implement the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility to facilitate the extension of credit to households and small businesses. The Federal Reserve will continue to consider ways of using its balance sheet to further support credit markets and economic activity. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; Christine M Cumming; Elizabeth A Duke; Richard W Fisher; Donald L Kohn; Randall S Kroszner; Sandra Pianalto; Charles I Plosser; Gary H Stern; and Kevin M Warsh. In a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 75-basis-point decrease in the discount rate to 1/2 percent. In taking this action, the Board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York. Cleveland. Richmond. Atlanta. Minneapolis, and San Francisco. The Board also established interest rates on required and excess reserve balances of 1/4percent."
Philippines,2008-12-17,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to reduce the BSP's key policy interest rates to 5.5 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 7.5 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility, effective immediately. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs, and special deposit accounts (SDAs) were also adjusted accordingly. The Monetary Board based its decision on the latest baseline forecasts which reflect a decelerating inflation path over the policy horizon, with inflation falling within target by 2010, partly due to the sharp fall in November inflation which came earlier than expected. This outlook is supported by the downward shift in the balance of risks, following the easing of commodity prices, the moderation in inflation expectations, and the expected slowdown in economic activity. As commodity prices stabilize, cost and wage pressures are also expected to moderate, reducing the risks of second-round effects. However, the Monetary Board continues to recognize the remaining upside risks to inflation, including the tight demand-supply conditions in the global commodities market, the pass-through effect of the weaker peso on retail prices, and the still elevated core inflation. In its overall assessment, the Monetary Board believes that with inflation pressures continuing to recede, there is therefore greater latitude to ease policy rates. Given the uncertainty about the duration and the depth of the global downturn, a reduction in policy rates would help avoid credit tightness. Such action is expected to reduce domestic borrowing costs, which could stimulate consumer spending and assist sectors such as manufacturing, construction, and small and medium enterprises. Monetary policy will continue to focus on achieving price stability while allowing room for the economy to grow. The BSP will also continuously watch evolving financial market conditions to ensure the efficient functioning of the credit market."
Turkiye,2008-12-18,"The Monetary Policy Committee (The Committee) has decided to lower the policy rates as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate is decreased from 16.25 percent to 15 percent, while lending rate is decreased from 18.75 percent to 17.50 percent, b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Borrowing rate between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m. is decreased from 12.25 percent to 11 percent, while lending rate is decreased from 21.75 percent to 20.50 percent, c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions is decreased from 17.75 percent to 16.50 percent. Recent readings indicate that the slowdown in the domestic economic activity has intensified. Ongoing problems in international credit markets and the global economy are expected to continue to restrain both the domestic and external demand for an extended period, putting downward pressure on inflation. Moreover, the developments in oil and other commodity prices are having a favorable impact on disinflation. Looking ahead, the Committee has judged that inflation will display a rapid fall in the forthcoming period. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to lower short- term interest rates by 125 basis points. Uncertainties regarding the impact of the problems in financial markets on the real economy remain at high levels. The Central Bank will continue to take the necessary measures to contain the adverse effects of the global financial turmoil on the domestic economy, provided that they do not conflict with the price stability objective. The extent and the timing of the next rate cut will depend on the factors affecting inflation outlook. It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to the inflation outlook may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within eight working days."
Hungary,2008-12-22,"At its meeting on 22 December 2008, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by 50 basis points, from 10,5% to 10,0%, with effect from 23 December 2008. The Monetary Council continues to be of the view that inflation may to fall further, in line with the trend of recent months, and it may drop significantly below the 3% target on the horizon relevant for monetary policy. The slowdown in global economic activity has led to a deterioration in the prospects for growth of the domestic economy. Consequently, the economy may recover only slowly in 2010, following the downturn expected in 2009. Monetary policy should continue to pay attention to preserving the stability of the financial intermediary system and to ensuring that capital flows remain balanced, in addition to focusing on inflation and real economic performance. Following the sharp deterioration in sentiment about Hungary in October, risks associated with external financing have recently declined gradually. But even allowing for these factors, there remains limited room for monetary policy manoeuvre. The recent negative developments in the international environment may act to change the conditions for access to external financing of the Hungarian economy for a protracted period. Global risk tolerance may remain below pre-crisis levels over the longer term, which makes it necessary for domestic economic agents to adjust, and to reduce the gap between costs and incomes on a sustained basis, in particular. The Monetary Council took its decision to ease policy further consistent with the projections of an economic slowdown and a sharp decline in inflation. The base rate may be reduced further in the coming months, if capital flows remain undisturbed and the stability of the financial intermediary system is preserved."
Poland,2008-12-23,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 23 December 2008 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 22-23 December 2008 The Council decided to lower the NBP interest rates by 0.75 percentage point to the level: (cid:131) reference rate 5.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate 6.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate 3.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate 5.25% on an annual basis. Data that have been released recently, in particular a marked decline in investment growth in 2008 Q3, confirm that the economic growth in Poland has been slowing considerably. Stronger than previously expected economic slowdown in the coming quarters will be driven by a significant decline in economic growth abroad, deteriorating expectations of economic agents as well as limited credit availability and its increased costs resulting from higher risk premium incorporated in market interest rates. At the same time, information on labour market developments points to declining employment, increasing unemployment and decelerating wage growth in the enterprise sector which will be conducive to diminishing inflationary pressure. Since the Council's meeting in November growth forecasts for the global economy have been further revised downwards. Strong slowdown in the global economy  in particular, the deepening recession in the United States, the euro area and the United Kingdom  and the accompanying decline in commodity and food prices in the world markets contributing to faster than expected decline in inflation, have urged many central banks to pursue further considerable easing of their monetary policy. The turmoil in the global financial markets and increased risk aversion contribute to continued increased exchange rate volatility of currencies of many countries, including Central and Eastern European countries. In November the annual growth of consumer prices in Poland decreased again (from 4.2% to 3.7%), although remaining above the NBP inflation target of 2.5% and also slightly above the upper limit for deviations from the target set at 3.5%. Further rise in the prices of some energy products and services related to flat maintenance as well as still high annual growth of prices of other services were major factors contributing to inflation persisting at an elevated level. In the Council's assessment, in the coming months inflation will be within the tolerance range for deviations from the inflation target. In the medium term stronger than previously expected slowdown in the global economy  in particular, the recession in Poland's major trading partners  and, consequently, the significant decline in domestic economic growth will contribute to further lowering inflation in Poland. Decreasing GDP growth and the related falling labour demand as well as deteriorating financial condition of enterprises will contribute to easing the wage pressure, and, consequently, also the inflationary pressure. The tightening of banks' lending conditions will also contribute to lowering inflation. Factors limiting the decline in inflation may include further growth ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51, in regulated prices as well as zloty depreciation observed in the past few months, although its impact on inflation may be limited amidst the economic slowdown. The Council assessed the probability of inflation running below the target in the medium term to be higher than the probability of inflation running above the target and decided to lower the NBP interest rates. The easing of monetary policy should contribute to stabilising economic growth around potential output growth which, in the medium term, will support the achievement of the inflation target. The Council's decisions in the coming months will take account of the incoming information on the outlook for economic growth and inflation in Poland and abroad. Maintaining fiscal discipline in the public finance sector may be conducive to easing monetary policy. The Council will analyse the impact of developments in the domestic interbank market on the monetary policy transmission mechanism in Poland. The Council maintains its view that Poland should join the Exchange Rate Mechanism II (ERM and the euro area at the earliest possible date, after achieving the necessary political support for amendments in the Constitution of the Republic of Poland and other legal acts necessary for the euro adoption in Poland. The Council prolonged the period of using by the National Bank of Poland of the extended array of monetary policy instruments, in particular foreign exchange swaps, to 2009. This decision constitutes an amendment to the chapter on monetary policy instruments in the Monetary Policy Guidelines for 2009. The Council has adopted The Financial Plan of the National Bank of Poland for 2009."
Georgia,2008-12-24,"24.12.2008: The NBG Lowers its Policy Rate (Refinancing Rate) by 100 Basis Points, to 8 Percent The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on December 24, 2008 and decided to lower its main policy rate (the refinancing rate), by 100 basis points to 8 percent. The annual rate of inflation has been marked by decelerating in the recent months. Annual inflation in November stood at 6.3 percent. Core inflation measures have decreased significantly as well. It is noteworthy that the prices on medicines, unlike other products, have been increasing consequently largely contributing to annual inflation. According to the latest data, the slowdown in economic activity is even more evident. The forecast growth of the gross domestic product has been lowered to 2 percent for 2008. Despite the growth in deposits in the banking system, commercial banks are still cautious in extending new loans. Therefore, lending growth rates are decreasing, which in turn, is restraining aggregate demand. The global financial crisis will likely continue to decrease domestic and foreign demand, which should act as a limiting factor for inflation. Thus, it is expected that disinflationary processes will continue in the beginning of the next year. The Lari exchange rate correction has mitigated the influence of the global financial crisis on Georgia. The exchange rate will be more flexible in the future in order to soften external shocks on the economy, although the National Bank will seek to avoid sharp deviations in the exchange rate. The global economic outlook has worsened and became more pessimistic since the last meeting of the MPC. Uncertainty regarding the possible impact and duration of the crisis has increased. According to existing forecasts, oil prices will be on a downward trend during the next year. In light of the deepening global financial crisis and taking into consideration the existing forecasts, the National Bank of Georgia is softening its monetary policy stance. The NBG will closely monitor current developments in the economy and financial markets with the objective of achieving the forecast inflation rate and will in due course act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will take place on January 21, 2009."

Israel,2008-12-29,"29.12.2008 The Bank of Israel reduces the interest rate for January 2009 by 0.75 percentage point to 1.75 percent The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for January 2009 will be reduced by 0.75 percentage point to 1.75 percent. Background conditions Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) declined by 0.6 percent in November, in line with forecasters' expectations. Since the beginning of 2008 the CPI has risen by 3.9 percent, and in the last twelve monthsby 4.5 percent. The index excluding food, energy and fruit and vegetables rose by 1.8 percent in the last twelve months, and in November it dropped by 0.3 percent. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: The downward trend in twelve-month inflation expectations derived from the capital market and those of forecasters, a trend that started in the second half of September, continued in November, and those expectations averaged -0.85 percent and 0.5 percent respectively. Average interest rate expectations derived from the capital market are for a reduction of about 40 basis points for January 2009, and forecasters' expectations are on average for a reduction of 60 basis points. Real economic activity: The continued slowdown in global economicactivity and the impact on the global financial system are having the effect of slowing economic activity also in Israel. Following the slowdown in the growth rate in the third quarter, data relating to the fourth quarter indicate a standstill--or even a reduction--in economic activity. Thus, the composite state-of-the-economy index, which after falling in the last few months fell by another 0.4 percent in November, shows that the slowdown in the rate of growth that started in the secondquarter of 2008 is continuing. The trade and services revenue index declined by 2.2 percent in October. Sales in chain stores, imports of consumer goods and VAT on domestic production declined by 1.6 percent, 2.2 percent, and 4.1 percent respectively. Purchases via credit cards, however, increased in November by 0.3 percent. The labor market and wages: : Initial data from the Ministry of Industry. Trade and Labor survey of employers for the fourth quarter show a significant decline in the number of vacancies in the business sector, a rise in the number of employment terminations, and a decline in jobs filled. Health tax revenues--a useful indicator of the level of employment--were 5.8 percent lower in November than the average in the months August-October. In November the number of job seekers registered at the labor exchanges rose by 2.2 percent. National Insurance Institute data for the third quarter show that the average nominal wage per employee post remained unchanged from the second to the third quarter.Budget policy: Tax revenues in January-November were 7 percent lower in real terms than in the equivalent period in 2007. Non-tax revenues rose in this period, however, and real expenditure fell as a result of the unexpected inflation. The government is expected to meet the deficittarget of 1.6 percent of GDP in 2008. To date there is underspending in nominal terms (of NIS 3.9 billion, about 2 percent of expenditure), but this is expected to fall almost to zero in December. The foreign exchange market: In the period between the monetary policy discussions of 23 November and 28 December, the shekel strengthened by 3.5 percent against the dollar, and weakened by 7.5 percent against the euro. Against the index of the effective exchange rate (weighted by the volume of trade) the shekel weakened by about 1 percent. In this period the dollar weakened against most of the major currencies at rates of up to more than 13 percent. The capital and money markets: Between the interest rate discussions of 23 November and 28 December, the Tel Aviv 25 and the Tel Aviv 100 share price indices maintained their relative stability, and even rose slightly, in contrast to their falls in the previous period. Share indices abroadalso remained relatively calm in this period, with a slight upward trend. In this period yields on 10-year unindexed Israel government bonds fell by 1.4 percentage points to about 5 percent. Yields on US government 10-year bonds continued to decline, and this month fell by 1.1 percentage points to 2.1 percent, so that the yield gap between the Israeli bonds and US government bonds contracted slightly to 2.9 percentage points. Prices of Israeli corporate bonds rose slightly in this period. The Tel-Bond 20 index rose by 5 percent, and the Tel-Bond 40 index by 7 percent. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, fell by 0.15 percentage points to 1.6 percent. The CDS spreads of emerging market countries also showed similar declines. The world economy: Following decisive steps taken by various authorities around the world, pressure in the financial markets eased to some extent recently. Nonetheless, the level of uncertainty apparently remains high. Economic activity: Most data on the global economy still paint a negative picture. Many countries have already posted two quarters or more of negative growth--that is to say, they are in recession--and forecasts are pessimistic. The World Bank assessment is that global growth in 2009 will reach only 0.9 percent, and there is a risk that this forecast may be adjusted downward. The World Bank expects world trade to decline by 2.1 percent in 2009. Its forecast for 2010 is more optimistic--global growth of 3 percent, and a surge in world trade. The IMF, which a few weeks ago published its global growth forecast for 2009 of 2.2 percent, announced that in January it expects to lower its forecast. Inflation: The sharp falls in commodity and energy prices together with the economic slowdown resulted in a marked drop in inflation itself and concern over inflation. That concern was replaced by concern over price falls. Against this background central banks around the world accelerated the rateof their interest rate cuts and are expected to continue reducing interest rates rapidly to unprecedentedly low levels. Thus the Fed cut its rate by 75 basis points to a target range of 0 to 1/4 percent, the Bank of England reduced its bank rate by 1 percentage point to 2.0 percent, and the Bank ofJapan cut its rate by 0.2 percentage points to 0.1 percent. The main considerations behind the decision The reduction of the interest rate for January by 0.75 percentage point will help strengthen the economy's ability to cope with the implications of the global economic crisis and support real activity. It is consistent with the return of inflation to the target range of 1-3 percent within the next few months. The main considerations behind the decision are: The effectsof the global crisis on real economic activity in Israel are evident. Dataon real activity point to a marked slowdown in growth, and some indicatorseven suggest a reduction in activity. The inflation environment has fallen. Forecasters expect inflation in 2009 to be belowthe lower limit of the target range. Expectations derived from the capitalmarket are also for price reductions in 2009. These forecasts indicate a return to within the target inflation range as early as in the first third of 2009, although the inflation rate is expected to fall below the target range later in the year. Last month many central banks cut their interest rates sharply, in some cases to unprecedentedly low levels, and the capital markets expect further cuts in a number of leading economies. The security-related developments of the last few days have opposing effects. On the one hand they increase geopolitical uncertainty in Israel, and on the other they have the potential to impact negatively on real activity. The current reduction in the interest rate is intended to help cut the cost of credit and to strengthen the economy's ability to handle theslowdown in economic activity and the implications of the global economic crisis. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor Israeli and worldwide economic developments closely, and will take whatever steps are necessary to support the stability of the financial system and to encourage employment and growth, as long as inflation continues to decline towards and achieve the price stability target. 29.12.2008 The Bank of Israel reduces the interest rate for January 2009 by 0.75 percentage point to 1.75 percent.
