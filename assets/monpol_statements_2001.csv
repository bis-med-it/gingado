Peru,2001-01-04,"Monetary Program - Information Note: January 2002 For the month of January, the Board increased the range for its operating target at 160 - 170 million as a daily average consistent with a higher preference for domestic currency. In December, the said balance was 165 million, which fell above the announced range (150  160 million) avoiding unnecessary fluctuations in interbank interest rates in a context of high concentration of supply and demand in the interbank market. The Central Bank Board of Directors also established that the following interest and commission rates would be used in domestic-currency Central Bank operations since January 4: For monetary regulation credits in domestic currency, the effective interest rate would be the weighted average of the interbank interest rates, or 4,0 percent, whichever is highest. Formerly, the said rate was 5,0 percent. For overnight deposits in domestic currency held by banks at the Central Bank, the effective interest rate remained at 2,0 percent. For foreign exchange temporary purchase operations (swap operations), the commission implies an effective annual cost of 4,0 percent. The latter cost was 5,0 percent. The following interest rates will be used in foreign-currency operations: The effective annual rate for monetary regulation credits will be 3,5 percent. Formerly, the said rate was 4,5 percent. For overnight deposits held by banks at the Central Bank, the rate is equivalent to the average obtained by the Central Bank for similar deposits abroad. The Central Bank grants monetary regulation credits in domestic and foreign currency on a regular basis. Besides, the Central Bank operations will be oriented to reduce volatility in the exchange market. If justified by financial conditions, the values mentioned above could be modified in order to ensure the attainment of the objective to preserve monetary stability, which mean avoiding inflationary or deflationary pressures."
South Korea,2001-01-11,"Inflation Target Following consultation with the government, the inflation target for the year 2001 has been set at 3., 0\xc2\xb11 percent, based on the annual rate of increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) after stripping out non-cereal agricultural products and petroleum-based products. In addition, the mid-term inflation target will be kept at 2., 5 percent on an annual average basis in order to maintain the consistency and credibility of monetary policy. The utmost efforts will be exerted to stabilize consumer prices as soon as possible toward a level consistent with the mid-term inflation target. Monetary Policy in the Year 2001 This year the Bank of Korea will place the focus of its monetary policy on attaining the annual inflation target, set at 3., 0\xc2\xb11 percent, and strengthening the foundation for price stability. Subject to these constraints, it will remain flexible in its conduct of monetary policy, taking into overall account the situation prevailing in the real sector and the financial market., ( Monetary Policy Framework ) The Bank will make use of the annual target figures for M3 growth as a monitoring indicator rather than as the intermediate target. The short-term interest rate, as represented by the overnight call rate, will remain the operating target for monetary policy. The Bank will confirm the appropriateness of the overnight call rate on a monthly basis and adjust its target accordingly so that the short-term interest rate can be induced to a level consistent with the inflation target. Greater efforts will be devoted to strengthening the Bank's capabilities for the analysis and forecasting of inflation, and to heightening the transparency and the credibility of its policies. This will help the inflation targeting regime become firmly established. ( Interest Rate Policy ) Placing its focus on price stability, the Bank of Korea will adjust the overnight call rate flexibly in line with the state of the real and financial sectors and changes in the domestic and international environments. It will also endeavor to bring about an environment conducive to the slowing of the level of price increases to one consistent with the mid-term inflation target by suppressing the reemergence of inflationary expectations. This will help avoid price rises during this year translating into higher inflation over the medium term. To guard against possible internal and external imbalances that might arise, there should be close coordination of exchange rate, interest rate and fiscal policies. ( Money Supply ) This year's monitoring range for annual M3 growth rate has been set at 6 to 10 percent, based on the inflation target(3., 0\xc2\xb11%), the economic growth forecast. Due to the economic slowdown and the contraction of consumption, the private sector's demand for money is not expected to expand rapidly. The growth of broad money. M3, this year is not anticipated to rise above last year's level in view of the unlikelihood of a substantial expansion of corporate funding by financial institutions amid continuing concerns over corporate credit risk. ( Credit Policy ) The Bank of Korea will conduct its credit policy to facilitate the enlargement of the funds flow into the corporate sector and support financial market stability. The Bank of Korea will introduce a new lending facility intended to reduce the issue and circulation of post-dated promissory notes in commercial transactions. This facility will be electronically-based and will take the form of a system of lending against the collateral of sales- on-credit receivables. The allocation of the Aggregate Credit Ceiling will be changed to encourage banks to expand their supply of funds to firms. Those banks that purchase corporate bonds and commercial paper or increase their corporate lending will receive increased allocations within the Aggregate Credit Ceiling. The Bank intends to bring about the amelioration of settlement practices in commercial transactions so as to improve the cash flow of small and medium enterprises and reduce chain bankruptcies by its efficient operation of lending facilities. The Bank of Korea stands ready to provide, subject to a close inspection of bank's liquidity status, timely Liquidity Adjustment Loans to banks facing temporary liquidity shortages arising in the process of restructuring. This stance is adopted in support of financial restructuring and in order to avoid the spread of financial system instability. The economy shows signs of more rapid slow-down than expected. The growth of both production and domestic demand has declined steeply. Also, the growth rate of exports has flattened out markedly. Consumer prices have shifted to a rising trend in December, following their decline over the last two months. This represents the effect of the hike in industrial product prices and service charges. Moreover, there are underlying factors that could push up prices further including the recent depreciation of the won and the expected rise in public service charges. In the financial markets, while the concern over corporate credit risk has not been dispelled, financial institutions' conservative attitude toward lending to the corporate sector remains unchanged amid the uncertainties surrounding the restructuring of the banking sector, and so forth. Recently, however, stock market trading has become somewhat brisker and the corporate credit crunch has begun to give slight indication of easing. Taking overall account of the evolution of the real and financial sectors, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea today decided to maintain the overnight call rate at around its current level in January. The committee, nevertheless, noted that monetary policy would be flexible in its response to the economic situation, watching the movements of the real economy warily. To help bring about the continued lightening of the corporate credit crunch, the Bank of Korea will be flexible in its supply of liquidity and will do all it can to facilitate the flow of financial resources to the corporate sector."
Chile,2001-01-18,"Santiago. January 18, 2001 Press Release At its monthly monetary policy meeting held today, the Board of the Central Bank decided to lower the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points from UF plus 5% to UF plus 4.75% and to lower the rates on liquidity credit lines by the same amount each. As usual, the Board analyzed recent economic developments and the outlook for the next twenty-four months. The data examined indicates that the world economy is suffering a more pronounced slowdown than had been expected. This has generated a less favorable climate for growth of the Chilean economy and has eased inflationary pressures. Both these effects could be only partially compensated by the foreseeable lower cost of external financing. On the domestic front, private consumption is falling, employment is flat and consumer confidence is depressed. Investment is up but this brings with it an increase in domestic expenditure which consequently eases inflationary pressures. For these reasons the monetary policy rate was lowered by 25 basis points in order to keep inflation on the lines projected and gradually centering on the mid-range target. The Bank will maintain its flexible monetary policy stance in order to face any threat to achieving the inflation target."
South Africa,2001-01-19,"1.1 Since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee international oil prices have declined markedly. After averaging more than US$32 per barrel in November 2000, the price for Brent crude declined to an average of US$25,60 in December and then fluctuated around this level during the first two weeks of January. The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has indicated that it will regulate output to maintain prices within a range of between US$22 to US$28 per barrel. 1.2 The downturn in economic activity in the United States appears to have intensified. The growth in real gross domestic product for the third quarter of 2000 has been revised downwards from the previous estimate of 2,7 per cent to 2,2 per cent. Various indicators point to a material slowdown of growth in the fourth quarter. These developments prompted the Federal Reserve Board to lower the US Federal Funds rate by 50 basis points to 6 per cent on 3 January 2001. Despite the slowdown, the United States labour market remains tight and record deficits continue to be reported on the current account of the balance of payments. Inflation is largely contained and the year-on-year rate of increase in the consumer price index was unchanged at 3,4 per cent in November 2000. 1.3 Economic growth in the euro area slowed down somewhat. The annualised rate of increase in the real gross domestic product of the euro area declined from 3,3 per cent in the second quarter of 2000 to 2,7 per cent in the third quarter. The euro area inflation continued to accelerate and the increase in the overall harmonised index of consumer prices reached 2,9 per cent in November 2000, the highest rate since 1994. However, the lower oil price and the strengthening euro, which appreciated by about 12 per cent against the dollar from the end of October, are likely to moderate these inflationary pressures. In the meantime the European Central Bank has not followed the US in cutting interest rates. 1.4 In the United Kingdom economic growth moderated to 2,8 per cent in the third quarter of 2000, down from 4,1 per cent in the preceding quarter. Inflation in the United Kingdom remained below target. The Japanese recovery remains fragile with growth in real gross domestic product increasing marginally from 0,9 per cent in the second quarter of 2000 to 1,0 per cent in the third quarter. Analysts still point to problems in the banking sector, the high public debt and a rapidly ageing population as major obstacles to the achievement of sustained higher growth. 1.5 The emerging markets of Asia. Africa and Latin America are expected to be adversely affected by the downturn in the United States. Third quarter growth rates were generally subdued in these regions, except in Korea where growth amounted to a seasonally adjusted and annualised rate of 14 per cent. The growth in the real gross domestic product in Brazil, at 4,7 per cent, was also quite healthy. Mexico is likely to be most affected by a slowdown in the United States. Concerns that Argentina's recent liquidity crisis could have negative contagion effects in Latin America have subsided somewhat following the recent rescue package of the International Monetary Fund. 2.1 In contrast to the general slowdown in economic activity in many parts of the world, the South African economy continued to recover in the second half of 2000. Although estimates of the national accounts for the fourth quarter of 2000 are not yet available, various indicators point to robust growth. The growth in the physical volume of manufacturing production, which had abated somewhat in the middle of 2000, rebounded strongly in November. Similarly, the reduction in the value of unfilled orders in August and September 2000 was followed by a marked increase in October and November. Capacity utilisation rates in the manufacturing sector generally moved higher in the third quarter of 2000. 2.2 In addition, a distinct upward trend is discernible in the output of the non-gold mining sector of the economy from the third quarter of 2000, notably in the mining of copper, nickel and diamonds. Non-gold mineral sales were boosted by higher sales of especially platinum and coal. 2.3 The trade sector seems to have experienced higher activity levels in the fourth quarter of 2000. The growth in total retail and wholesale trade accelerated in October 2000 after it had weakened somewhat in the third quarter. Furthermore, preliminary indications point to better than expected year-end retail sales. Signs of some improvement in the financial position of households and small businesses are supported by a continued decline in the number of insolvencies of individuals and partnerships in October 2000. 2.4 Contrary to these positive developments, the strong rise in new vehicle sales lost much of its momentum in the fourth quarter, signalling some weakness in households' spending on durable consumer goods. The number of real-estate transactions remained at a relatively high level, but the upward movement flattened out during the course of 2000. The strong upward momentum in the composite leading business cycle indicator abated slightly during the course of 2000. 2.5 Despite the general recovery in economic activity, the latest available labour market statistics show a continuation of the decline in the regularly surveyed formal non-agricultural employment in the third quarter of 2000. Under-utilisation of labour resources remained high and no additional wage pressures were evident from the rate of growth in nominal salaries and wages in the third quarter of 2000. In combination with strong growth in labour productivity, the moderate increase in remuneration per worker gave rise to a growth in unit labour costs consistent with a future fall in inflation. 3.1 The growth in the broadly defined money supply (M3) levelled off in October and November 2000, following the brisk growth in the preceding two months. This brought the twelve-month rate of increase in M3 to 6,6 per cent in November, with even lower corresponding growth rates in the narrower monetary aggregates. The deceleration in money supply growth, however, was partly due to the high base in 1999 when the demand for money was strong because of Y2K concerns. 3.2 The twelve-month rate of increase in bank credit extension to the domestic private sector accelerated from 8,6 per cent in August 2000 to 11,8 per cent in November. Although part of this acceleration was the result of banks' holdings of investments, there were also signs of a more rapid increase in the demand for mortgage, instalment sale and leasing finance. This was to be expected, given the ongoing upswing in economic activity. 3.3 Revised estimates show a decline in the borrowing requirement of the non-financial public sector from 4,7 per cent of gross domestic product in the first half of fiscal 1999/2000 to 3,0 per cent in the corresponding period of 2000/01. This further improvement was related to continued discipline applied in government expenditure and greater efficiency in the collection of taxes. The deficit in the current fiscal year has been financed to a considerable extent by issuing Treasury bills at a relatively low interest cost to the taxpayer. 4.1 Capital market turnovers remained buoyant in the final months of 2000. As a result record turnovers were registered on the JSE Securities Exchange, the Bond Exchange and the Futures Exchange during 2000. 4.2 Since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, bond prices have continued to strengthen despite substantial net sales by non-residents. There has therefore been a downward movement in bond yields that started on 18 October 2000. These changes could reflect lower inflation expectations as well as the low demand for loanable funds by the government. The lower inflation expectations are also confirmed by a narrowing of the difference between the yield on inflation-linked bonds and ordinary government bonds of similar maturity from the beginning of November 2000. 4.3 Non-residents were net sellers of bonds to the amount of R20,3 billion in 2000, while the yield on the R150 bond moved from 13,26 per cent on 4 January 2000 to 12,03 per cent on 29 December 2000. At the same time non-residents were net buyers of South African shares to an amount of R17,4 billion during 2000, which brought the combined net sales of securities to R2,8 billion in the year as a whole. This can be compared with net purchases of securities by non-residents of R54,9 billion in 1999. Further improvements in bond yields occurred in the first two weeks of January. 4.4 On balance, share prices lost considerable ground during 2000. The all-share price index declined from a peak of 9 227 on 17 January 2000 to 8 494 on 29 December 2000. However, since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, share prices have risen by 7,2 per cent up to 18 January 2001. 4.5 Over the same period, money market interest rates remained generally stable, with the 91-day Treasury bill rate, for instance, fluctuating within a narrow range of between 10,15 per cent and 10,25 per cent. However, money-market interest rates with a maturity of longer than 6 months at first declined significantly reflecting market expectations of reduced interest rates during the course of 2001. From 10 January 2001 this trend was partly reversed with the weakening in the external value of the rand. BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET. 5.1 Monthly international trade data indicate that the current account of the balance of payments probably remained in deficit during the fourth quarter of 2000, and that this deficit could perhaps be even higher than the seasonally adjusted and annualised rate of R3,7 billion in the third quarter of the year because of a deterioration in the trade balance. The trade surplus decreased from a seasonally adjusted and annualised rate of R25,2 billion in the third quarter of 2000 to R15,1 billion in October and November 2000. This was largely the result of a sharp rise in imports related to the economic recovery, the high price of oil and a depreciating currency. The value of exports also declined over this period. 5.2 Measured by the change in the country's international reserves, there was a deficit of R4,0 billion on the overall balance of payments in October 2000 and R0,5 billion in November 2000. This could indicate that the surplus on the financial account of the balance of payments shrank or that it may even have reverted to a deficit. 5.3 On balance, the nominal effective exchange rate of the rand declined by 12,4 per cent from the end of December 1999 to the end of December 2000. The deficit on the overall balance of payments, together with unsubstantiated market rumours about delays in the implementation of government's privatisation programme and relaxations of exchange controls put further downward pressure on the rand in the first few days of January 2001. On 11 January the rand traded briefly at the level of R8,01 against the US dollar. The weighted exchange rate of the rand nevertheless fell by 3,7 per cent from the end of 2000 to 18 January 2001. 6.1 From the above analysis it is apparent that many factors appear positive for the desired inflation outcome in 2002. These include apparently lower inflationary expectations, moderate rates of increase in nominal unit labour costs, surplus production capacity in manufacturing, an under-utilisation of labour, little evidence of demand pressures on prices, lower oil prices since December 2000, a slowdown in the growth of money supply and prudent fiscal and monetary policies. The likely positive effects of these factors on inflation are substantiated by econometric projections of the Bank that show that, all things remaining the same, the average rate of increase in the CPIX will be within the target range in 2002. 6.2 However during the course of 2000 the rate of inflation rose because of the depreciation of the rand, a steep rise in oil prices and an upward shift in food prices. In the last few months of the year lower rates of increase of food prices and in the running costs of transport equipment were the main reasons for a slowdown in inflation. As a result the percentage change over twelve months in consumer prices excluding mortgage costs (CPIX), which had increased from 6,5 per cent in October 1999 to 8,1 per cent in September 2000, fell back to 7,7 per cent in November. Moreover, the month-on-month changes in the consumer price index in the second half of 2000 reached levels which bode well for the attainment of the inflation target in 2002. 6.3 Developments in production price inflation are unfortunately less encouraging. The rate of increase in the all-goods production price index measured over twelve-month periods rose from 6,0 per cent in October 1999 to 9,9 per cent in November 2000. This acceleration was largely due to a rise in the prices of imported goods arising from the weakness of the rand and the increase in international oil prices. The prices of domestically produced goods, however, also rose sharply over the same period. These raise concerns about the possibility of production price increases spilling over into higher consumer price inflation in the months to come, thus posing some threat to the attainment of the inflation target in 2002. 6.4 In view of the above considerations, the Monetary Policy Committee has decided to keep the monetary policy stance unchanged."
Thailand,2001-01-20,"Monetary Policy Board's Decision on 18 January 2001 The Monetary Policy Board met today to assess recent developments in inflation and economic conditions. The MPB viewed that the slowdown in US economic growth would directly affect growth in the Asian region. This would have an impact on Thai export growth because the US market and Asian region market (including Japan) accounted for approximately 20 per cent and 50 per cent of the total value of Thai exports respectively. Consequently the MPB assessed that the Thai economy in 2000/2001 will grow at a lower rate than the previous forecast. Nonetheless positive contributing factors to Thai economic growth included the accommodating monetary policy stance adopted for over a year, the declining trend in oil prices, and the timely reduction in US interest rates that reduced the risk of a hard landing. Lessening cost pressures and inflation expectations of the general public have reduced risks to inflation. As the economic and financial system has become more broad-based. Thailand can better cope with changing external market conditions. Therefore the US economic slowdown would not have a strong impact on Thai economic and financial stabilityThe MPB took into account policies advocated by the new government. However due to lack of details regarding conditions and timing of these measures, assumptions used on public spending and public debt remain unchanged. In light of the outlook for core inflation and risks to economic growth, the MPB decided to maintain the key policy rate at 15 per cent per annum, but will continue to closely monitor the economic and political conditions and stand ready to adopt an appropriate monetary policy stance in order to maintain price stability conducive to sustainable economic growthFurther details regarding the assessment of the economy and risks, together with the output and inflation projections, will be released during the January 2001 Inflation Report Press Conference at 200 pm. on 29 January 2001. Bank Of Thailand 18 January 2001."
Israel,2001-01-29,"Range of change of CPI. Annual rate of inflation. Greatest change in CPI. Smallest change in CPI. Difference between largest and smallest change in CPI. Ratio of the difference to annual rate of inflation. Inter-month standard deviation. January 29, 2001 The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for February 2001, according to which its interest rate will be reduced by 0.3 percentage points. The Bank of Israel explains that the decision to lower the nominal interest rate for February by this amount is consistent with the long-term inflation target set by the government. The decision was taken against the background of the current assessment that inflation in 2001 will be between 1 percent and 2.5 percent a year, below the lower limit of the targetrange for the year, and that in the 2002 and 2003 it will be within the range ofthe long-term target set by the government. It will be recalled that the government decided that monetary policy should focus on attaining the inflation target of 2.5 to 3.5 percent for 2001, 2 to 3 percent for 2002, and 1 to 3 percent-arange which is defined as price stability-from 2003 onwards. Setting a long-term inflation target path reflects a commitment to maintaining long-term price stability as a major component in Israel's integration into the global economy. In so doing, it also helps interest-rate policy to bring inflation into the target range and to consolidate and maintain sustainable economic growth. At the same time it minimizes fluctuations in the rate of interest, which helps lower volatility in the money, capital and foreign-currency markets and in the inflation rate, and maintains economic stability. The Bank of Israel points out that the policy pursued in the last two years, of careful, gradual cuts in the rate of interest leading to the convergence of the domestic interest rate with international rates, contributed to the stability achieved in Israel's financial markets in the last two years. This is all the more notable an achievement in the light of the increased volatility in world markets, particularly in the US stock exchanges, and the rise in economic uncertainty caused by domestic political developments and changes in the geopolitical situation. This uncertainty has grown recently, partly related to unrest in the public-sector labor market and concern regarding a weakening of fiscal discipline in the current year. The Bank notes that the period of low inflation in the economy has already contributed to changes in the wage negotiation process, to the willingness to base the financing of the budget deficit on unindexed bonds and lengthen their maturity, and to the awareness of the need to switch from CPI-adjusted financial statements to nominal ones. The Bank of Israel hopes that the infrastructure created so far is sufficient to establish a tax system on a nominal basis in the future. The Bank adds that the risk premium which international capital markets ascribe to Israel's economy is currently estimated at between one percentage point (for half a year) and 1.9 percentage points (for 10 years), a reduction from last month's level. The change in interest-rate differentials between Israel and overseas has implications for capital flows andthe management of the public's portfolios of assets and liabilities, and thus for Israel's financial markets. It is relevant to note that one of the important elements affecting the domestic foreign-currency market and the exchange rate of the NIS is long-term foreign investment in Israel. The supply of foreign exchange from this source has slackened in the last few months, and this, if it continues, could have implications for the exchange rate and the inflation rate. The Bank of Israel explains that one of the features of price stability is low monthly price volatility. Despite the reduction in inflation in the last two years, however, no parallel reduction in the monthly fluctuations of the CPI is evident yet, and the standard deviation and the range of fluctuations in changes in the CPI are similar to those of the mid-1990 s. This is an indication of the fragility of price stability at this stage of the process of bringing inflation under control. The Bank of Israel notes again that the assessment of the inflation path for one and more years ahead, against the background ofthe long-term horizon of the inflation target, is based as always on the Bank's forecasts of inflation, on inflation expectations derived from the capital market, and on the predictions of various private forecasters. It mustbe borne in mind that it is estimates of inflation for the next 12 months and beyond that are significant, and not changes in any single Consumer Price Index-whether it happens to fall or rise relatively steeply or by a small amount. Similarly, short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate or in inflation expectations also hold no significance, unless they incorporate elements thatmay alter the assessments of inflation within the policy horizon-the following one to three years.

Euroarea,2001-02-01,"Ladies and gentlemen, let me welcome you to our first press conference of 2001. The Vice-President and I are here to report, as we have done for more than two years now, on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB, which was also attended by the Eurogroup President. Minister Reynders, as well as by Commissioner Solbes. Let me also take this opportunity to again welcome Greece as the twelfth country to join the euro area. Mr. Papademos, the Governor of the Bank of Greece, has been participating in our meetings as a member of the Governing Council since 1 January 2001. The Governing Council conducted its regular examination of monetary and economic developments and their implications for the maintenance of price stability in the euro area. The decision to keep interest rates unchanged reflects the Governing Council's assessment that the risks to price stability in the medium term now appear more balanced than at the end of last year. Factors which might pose upward risks to price stability in the medium term are still present and as such will be subject to ongoing close monitoring. Starting with the first pillar of the monetary policy strategy of the ECB, monetary data for December 2000 confirmed the gradual moderation of the growth of monetary aggregates which has been observed since the spring of last year. According to the latest data, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 in the months from October to December 2000 stood at 5.0%, which was slightly lower than the average of 5.1% recorded for the period from September to November 2000. Therefore, after the recent slowdown in monetary growth, the risks to price stability from the monetary side have become increasingly balanced. Caution still needs to be exercised, however, given the continued dynamics in credit growth to the private sector and the upward deviation of M3 from the reference value in the past. Turning to the examination under the second pillar, broadly similar indications are emerging, as inflationary impulses resulting from previous developments in oil prices and the external value of the euro are gradually diminishing. As regards economic activity, uncertainty concerning the external environment for the euro area has increased, mainly related to signals that the slowdown in growth in the United States may be more significant than earlier expected. This is likely to result, directly and via a spillover to other regions, in some deceleration of growth in the world economy. World real GDP growth, which in 2000 posted its strongest performance for many years, may therefore moderate in 2001 but will still remain at an acceptable level. This deceleration will clearly have some dampening effects on euro area net exports. The euro area is a large economy where exports of goods and services amount to around 17% of GDP only. Economic activity in the euro area is therefore determined mainly by domestic factors. Overall, the fundamentals of the euro area remain broadly favourable. While, as recently published data show, real GDP growth slowed somewhat in the second half of last year, the level of business and household confidence has remained high, supported by, inter alia, high degrees of capacity utilisation and ongoing unemployment declines. Moreover, real income in the private sector will benefit from lower oil prices and from the reductions in direct taxes in 2001. Hence, while downside risks to real GDP growth exist, growth is very likely to continue at a reasonably robust pace. Developments in the euro area bond markets are in line with this outlook for economic activity. Moreover, inflationary expectations implied by bond yields confirm that the financial markets expect current levels of consumer price inflation to be temporary, and price stability to be maintained in the medium term. This assessment may also have been reinforced by the recent moderation in oil prices and the movement of the euro exchange rate in the period since the end of October 2000. Lower oil prices and the appreciation of the euro have already produced some effects on price developments. In December 2000 the annual rate of increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) declined to 2.6%, from 2.9% in November. A confirmation of recent developments in oil prices and the euro exchange rate would contribute to a further downward adjustment of overall HICP inflation in the period ahead. Over the near term, this process may be slowed down by the delayed impact of past import price increases and possibly also by some transitory further food price rises caused by the current health issues associated with beef consumption. It may therefore take some time for HICP inflation to move back below 2%. Notwithstanding the assessment that the risks to price stability are now more balanced, there are still factors posing upside risks which therefore require continued attention. These are mainly related to potential second-round effects on wages of the past increases in import prices, as well as to bottlenecks and shortages in labour markets. For the medium term, it remains paramount that wage developments remain moderate. In addition, it is crucial that structural adjustments continue. This requires sustained labour market reforms, continuing liberalisation of product markets and further integration in the financial services sector, all of which will expand economic activity and increase employment. It is equally important that further progress be achieved in the area of fiscal policy reform, with continuing progress in fiscal consolidation through limits in public spending growth, allowing both a reduction in remaining budget deficits and an alleviation of the fiscal burden on corporations and households without threatening or slowing the progress in fiscal consolidation. Overall, the existence of the euro and the single monetary policy has provided the euro area with an institutional setting which leaves it significantly less exposed to external influences. Within the euro area the maintenance of price stability over the medium term, together with further progress on structural reforms, will provide an important contribution to the achievement of sustained non-inflationary economic growth and will thereby also support a further solid and sustainable expansion of the world economy. Let me now give the floor to the Vice-President, who will inform you about other issues decided by the Governing Council. The Governing Council has adopted a set of standards, recently endorsed by the G10 Governors, as the minimum standards of the Eurosystem's common oversight policy on payment systems. The Eurosystem will assess all systemically important payment systems in the euro area against these ""Core Principles"" and will make the results of its assessments available to the public. Concerning issues relating to euro banknotes and coins. I should also like to provide you with the following information. First, the Governing Council adopted an ECB Guideline on the 2002 cash changeover. Owing to the crucial importance of this matter, and given the responsibility of the Eurosystem as a whole in achieving a smooth cash changeover, a legal framework has been established. The Guideline will enable all those involved to become familiar with the basic rules to be followed in preparing for the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins. This ECB Guideline will be published today on the ECB's website and shortly in the Official Journal of the European Communities. Second, yesterday evening the members of the Governing Council were given a presentation by Publicis, the communication agency selected to assist in conducting the Eurosystem's Euro 2002 Information Campaign, on the current status of the campaign. This focused in particular on the creative concept of the mass media campaign, which will start in September 2001. A website dedicated to the Euro 2002 Information Campaign has now been launched in all 11 official languages of the European Community. The website currently contains a section on the euro banknotes and coins. Further sections will be added over the next two weeks to help specialist groups and the general public to prepare for the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins."
Peru,2001-02-02,"BANCO CENTRAL DE RESERVA DEL PERU Informative note on the Monetary Program: February 2001 As anticipated in the Monetary Program Report for 2001. The Central Reserve Bank Board of Directors established that, on the first Friday of each month, the Bank would announce the range for the average daily balance of the current accounts held by banks at the Central Bank, to be taken as benchmark for monetary operations during the month. Additionally, the Bank will announce the interest rates to be maintained during the month for monetary regulation credits and overnight deposits held by banks at the Central Bank. For the month of February, the range referred to in the previous paragraph will be 125 - 135 million as a daily average. In January, the said balance was 128 million. The Central Bank Board of Directors also established that the following interest and commission rates would be used in domestic-currency Central Bank operations: For monetary regulation credits in domestic currency, the effective interest rate would be the average of the top-decile interbank interest rates, or 12,5 percent, whichever is highest. This rate has been maintained at its current level since January 4, when it was reduced from 14,0 percent. For overnight deposits in domestic currency held by banks at the Central Bank, the effective interest rate will be 4,5 percent. Until February 1, this rate was equivalent to the average obtained by the Central Bank for overnight deposits abroad (approximately 6,0 percent in January). For foreign exchange temporary purchase operations (swap operations), the commission will be 0,01720 percent, equivalent to an effective 12,5 percent annual cost. This cost has been maintained at its current level since January 4, when it was reduced from 14 percent. The following interest rates will be used in foreign-currency operations: The effective annual rate for monetary regulation credits will be 8,5 percent. This rate has been maintained at its current level since 17 November, when it was reduced from 10,0 percent. For overnight deposits held by banks at the Central Bank, the rate is equivalent to the average obtained by the Central Bank for similar deposits abroad. If justified by financial conditions, the values mentioned above could be modified in order to ensure the attainment of the objective to preserve monetary stability."
Peru,2001-02-07,"BANCO CENTRAL DE RESERVA DEL PERU Monetary Program - Information Note: February 2002 In order to attain an annual rate of inflation of 2,5 percent plus or minus 1 percent point, the monetary policy made possible that interbank interest rate be 2,7 percent on average during January. Thus, the balance of banks' current account at the Central Bank (operating target) was 160 within the announced balance (160  170 million). This balance was lower than in December, because of lower cash requirements. After the assessment of the monetary policy, the Central Bank Board of Directors established: The range for banks' current account deposits at the Central Bank will be kept at 160  170 million on a daily average basis. For monetary regulation credits in domestic currency, the effective interest rate would be the weighted average of the interbank interest rates, or 3,5 percent, whichever is highest. Formerly, the said rate was 4,0 percent. For overnight deposits in domestic currency held by banks at the Central Bank, the effective interest rate remained at 1,9 percent. Formerly, the said rate was 2,0 percent. For foreign exchange temporary purchase operations (swap operations), the commission implies an effective annual cost of 3,5 percent. The former cost was 4,0 percent. The following interest rates will be used in foreign-currency operations: The effective annual rate for monetary regulation credits will be 3,0 percent. Formerly, the said rate was 3,5 percent. For overnight deposits held by banks at the Central Bank, the rate is equivalent to the average obtained by the Central Bank for similar deposits abroad. The Central Bank grants monetary regulation credits in domestic and foreign currency on a regular basis. Besides, the Central Bank operations will be oriented to reduce volatility in the exchange market. If justified by financial conditions, the values mentioned above could be modified in order to ensure the attainment of the objective to preserve monetary stability, which mean avoiding inflationary or deflationary pressures."
South Korea,2001-02-08,"The economy has contracted more rapidly than had been anticipated. Industrial production slowed for four straight months from last September onwards. The growth of exports has also seen a sharp deceleration. Consumer and business confidence has declined markedly. Consumer prices rose significantly in January due to the higher prices of farm-fisheries products and public services. There are destabilizing factors present, including the influence of the recent depreciation of the Korean won, which could further push up prices. Demand- side pressures are, however, subsiding owing to the rapid economic slow- down. In the financial markets, market interest rates have shown a gradual decline and there appears to be a partial easing of the corporate credit crunch. However, there are underlying factors making for market instability including the possibility of a worsening of corporate cash-flow resulting from the economic slow-down and lingering concerns over the credit risk of corporations that are liable to turn distressed. Taking this situation in the real and financial sectors into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea today decided to lower its target for the overnight call rate from 5., 25 percent to 5., 0 percent. The MPC also noted that a close watch would be kept on economic developments as well as price movements so as to respond to them through monetary policy. To help bring about the continued easing of the corporate credit crunch, that has recently become evident, the Bank of Korea will do all it can to facilitate the flow of financial resources to the corporate sector. In order to restore firmly-based financial market stability against the background of the recent partial improvement that has occurred in the financial markets, it is essential to pursue financial and corporate restructuring in an effective manner."
Chile,2001-02-20,"Santiago. February 20, 2001 Press Release At its monthly monetary policy meeting held today, the Board of the Central Bank decided to lower the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points from UF plus 4.75% to UF plus 4.5% and to lower the rates on liquidity credit lines by the same amount each. As usual, the Board analyzed recent economic developments and the outlook for the next twenty-four months. In recent weeks, world economic growth forecasts for this year have continued on a downward trend and interest rates in relevant markets are expected to fall. The expected lower cost of external financing is backed by a reduction in Chile's sovereign spread. The recent appreciation of the peso is related to these indicators. On the domestic front, output growth is stable and compatible with expectations for this year despite the erratic monthly indicators. Inflation is predicted to revert last year's rising trend this quarter and soon return within the target range. Inflationary pressures in Chile will thus ease. Financial markets agree, as seen by the drop in interest rates at all maturities compared to last month. These indicators support the Bank's decision to lower the monetary policy rate, a decision that is fully coherent with projected inflation converging gradually on the mid-range target. The Bank will maintain its flexible monetary policy stance in order to face any threat to achieving the inflation target."
Israel,2001-02-26,"Monetary program for March 2001 26 February 2001 As a result of instructions issued by the Workers' Committee, the following stages in the process of decision-making regarding the rate of interest for March 2001 have not taken place: 1. Data have not been submitted by the four departments involved in the process (the Monetary. Research. Foreign Exchange Control, and Foreign Currency Departments). 2. Departmental discussions headed by managers of the departments to formulate recommendations have not been held. 3. The discussion to assess the monetary situation,a wide forum headed by the Governor held with the participation of the staff who prepared the data and the recommendations, did not take place. 4. The discussions in the Monetary Forum, a narrower forum also headed by the Governor, was held on the basis of incomplete and partially non-updated information. The main items missing were data on economic trends expected in the US and Europe and their implications for theIsraeli economy; on possible developments in capital flows from and to Israel, and their effects on the exchange rate; on the forecasts of real changes, growth, and unemployment in Israel; and alternative scenarios of expected inflation based on econometric models of the Research Department and the Monetary Department. In addition to the above, the instructions of the Workers' Committee have prevented the Bank of Israel from publishing data for the public, such as the money supply and inflation expectations, which are essential for understanding monetary policy; these data have not been supplied to the Bank's management either. It is impossible to manage monetary policy in a cloud of uncertainty. The Bank therefore asked the government on 21 February 2001 to introduce emergency regulations so that confinement orders could be issued in limited areas and quantities, to enable, among other things, the existence of the minimum requirements necessary to manage monetary policy. In the absence of such regulations and orders, at this stage, the management of the Bank was faced with the choice ofpostponing the publication of the rate of interest until such timeas a decision could be taken on the basis of all the data and after the due process of discussions had taken place, or accepting a process of improvised decision-making, based on partial and non-updated data. Given this background, and in the light of the assessment-within the limitations of the available data-that at the current rate of interest, inflation in the next twelve months is expected to be below the target, the Bank of Israel's interest rate for March will be reduced by 0.2 percentage points, from 7.7 percent to 7.5 percent. The Bank of Israel stresses that the possibility ofimplementing the interest-rate decision depends on the non-disruption of the process of holding daily monetary auctions. The management of the Bankcannot assess whether it will be possible to implement and maintain the change in the rate of interest, and how events will develop by the end ofthe week (when the change should take effect), and thereafter.

Poland,2001-02-28,"Information on the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council on February 27-28, 2001 On February 27-28th, 2001 the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council was held during which the following decisions were taken: 1. lombard rate was lowered from 23 to 22% (annualized), 2. rediscount rate was lowered from 21.5 to 20.5% (annualized), 3. the National Bank of Poland would perform 28-day open market operations the annualized minimum yield of which is 18%. The resolutions adopted by the Monetary Policy Council become effective on March 1st, 2001. The Council maintains its neutral position in the area of monetary policy. Within the period since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Council that was held on January 22nd, 2001, the phenomena and signals have been noted that, according to the Council, make the achievement of the inflation target in 2001 more probable and in a way that enables the achievement of the mid-term target of the monetary policy below 4% in 2003. The following tendencies, observed for several months, that are positive from the point of view of inflationary processes have been maintained: 1. A further essential decrease of the growth pace of consumer goods and services prices and also industrial output prices has been observed. A low dynamics of the latter creates positive circumstances for the forecasts of consumer goods and services prices. In December, the base inflation indices decreased again. These changes confirm the effectiveness of the monetary policy that is carried out. 2. The external imbalance in 2000 has been decreased considerably; the current account deficit decreased from the level of 7.4% of GDP in 1999 to about 6.2% of GDP. 3. The money supply growth pace remained moderate. The dynamics of loan growth, including loans to individuals, has been still decreasing gradually; at the same time, the deposit growth dynamics remains high, especially deposits denominated in PLN placed by individuals. 4. The current estimates of the domestic demand dynamics suggest that it halts the inflationary processes. At the same time, new phenomena and signals of future developments indicating the inflation pressure weakening have been observed: 1. Inflation expectations of banks and households have decreased. Counteracting the inflation expectations growth was an essential circumstance of the latest interest rate increase in August last year. 2. The Government decision - consistent with the Council stipulation - on the introduction of the ceiling of duty- free import of 500 thousand tons of grain will contribute to the reduction of foodstuff prices growth pace. However, it is very probable that this quota may appear insufficient to complete the domestic supply. In order to halt the possible price pressure it is necessary to increase this amount. The scale of the interest rate lowering performed by the Monetary Policy Council considers the necessity of further counteracting the inflation expectations and also the relationship between the dynamics of deposits and loans to individuals and changes of nominal interest rates level. Maintaining strong stimuli to increase savings of households is a necessary factor of restoring tendencies for a balanced growth of the economy. While making the decision, the Council took into consideration the following phenomena that may take place in the following months this year and may adversely affect the achievement of the inflation target, especially in medium term. According to the Council's opinion, among these phenomena there should be enlisted: uncertainty about the future developments in public finance sector, uncertainty about getting the planned revenues from privatization that besides the increase of the cost of public debt servicing will decrease financing of the current account deficit through direct investments, risk of an accelerated price growth on the foodstuff market caused by the insufficient supply, risk of the excessive liquidity increase on money market as a result of the Government actions, possibility of a jump increase of expenses connected with the cumulating in a short time of the salary rising in the state budget sector, paying out the additional funds due to the valorization of pensions and disability benefits, compensations and reparations for the forced labor during world war II. The Council wants to emphasize very strongly a considerable importance of structural reforms (further deregulation and privatization) that would improve the supply side of the economy. The biggest barriers in this area are on the labor, foodstuff and energy carriers markets, that is why the biggest effects should be expected after the firm actions on just these markets. Such actions in the economic policy, which would trigger the insofar blocked supply potential and increase the pace of the productivity growth, would contribute to the production and employment increase without increasing the inflation pressure. INFLATION The increase of consumer goods and services prices in January 2001 amounted to 0.8% as compared to December last year. As a result, the consumer price index calculated at the twelve-month scale lowered in January this year to 7.4% - from the level of 8.5% a month before In January, there was maintained - since November last year - the tendency to fuel prices dropping. They decreased by 2.9% during a month mainly due to the appreciation of the zloty in relation to the US dollar. After removing this component from the basket of consumer goods and services prices their growth in January would amount to 0.9%, so a bit more than the amount of growth of the general price index. After excluding fuel prices and also foodstuff and soft beverages prices that in January increased by 0.6%, the remaining consumer goods and services prices (so-called net inflation) exceeded the level of total inflation, rising by 1.0% last month. Annually, however, the net inflation index decreased to 7.2% - from 8.2% in December last year. The confirmation of these conclusions was also the formation of sold industrial output prices that in January dropped by 0.2% as compared to the previous month. It was mainly caused by the drop, by 0.5%, of prices in the industrial processing sector that was mainly connected with the lowering of prices of the production of coke, oil processing products and derivatives. An annual growth pace of the sold industrial output prices in January decreased again - to 4.8% as compared to 5.7% in December. A slow growth pace of the sold industrial output prices creates favorable conditions for further decrease of the consumer goods and services prices dynamics. MONEY In January this year, the annual growth pace of the total money supply amounted to 14.5%, i.e. was maintained at a moderately low level that was close to the level noted during last year. There was also maintained the tendency to decrease the lending activity dynamics; an annual growth pace of loans to enterprises dropped to 11.8% as compared to 13.4% in December last year, and the growth pace of loans to individuals decreased to 31.3% as compared to 32% in December last year. The growth pace of PLN-denominated deposits placed by individuals in January was still high and amounted to 22.7% as compared to 24.1% in December. REMUNERATIONS In January, an average gross salary in the enterprise sector (calculated for the period since January last year) increased by 9.9% in nominal terms and by 2.3% in real terms, while during the whole year 2000 these indices amounted to: 11.4% and 1.2%, respectively. Therefore, the growth pace of salaries in nominal terms in January remained relatively low. However, due to the inflation drop, the dynamics of salaries in real terms increased. OUTPUT. EMPLOYMENT. UNEMPLOYMENT In January this year, the sold industrial output was bigger by 10.1% than in January last year, what, after considering differences in working hours, means the increase by about 5.1%. The output of the processing industry increased by 11.1% in this period. The construction and assembling output in January dropped by 9.8% as compared to January last year. The tendencies towards the decrease of employment and increase of the unemployment rate that were observed last year also took place in January this year. An average employment in the enterprise sector in January decreased by 0.3% as compared to December last year and by 2.5% as compared to January last year. The rate of unemployment at the end of January amounted to 15.6% as compared to 15% at the end of December last year and 13.7% at the end of January last year. In January, the surveyed enterprises evaluated their current economic situation more pessimistically than a month before or at the similar level. However, their forecasts for the nearest months were better than in December. The evaluations made in January are of a strongly seasonal nature. The most pessimistic evaluations of the current economic activity were made by construction enterprises, although they also evaluated their future situation more optimistically than a month before. Therefore, assuming the forecasts of the surveyed enterprises were right, the survey by GUS suggests the possibility of the economic situation improvement in the nearest months. EXTERNAL IMBALANCE AND EXCHANGE RATE In December 2000 the situation in the area of current account of the balance of payments was still favorable. The current account deficit amounted to USD 0.7 billion and was lower by almost USD 1 billion as compared to December 1999. The amount of current account deficit within the whole year 2000 was USD 9.9 billion (as compared to USD 11.6 billion in 1999), what constituted about 6.2% of GDP. Such decrease of the external imbalance in 2000 was affected by the decrease of the trade deficit and the increase of unclassified current transactions surplus - with the stabilization of the remaining items of current account. Since May 2000, the annual growth pace of export revenues started to exceed the growth pace of import expenses, which was relatively stable during the whole year. As compared to 1999, the export revenues denominated in USD increased by 7.3% and denominated in the euro increased by 24.6%. Import expenses denominated in USD increased by 1.7% and denominated in the euro increased by 17.5%. In January 2001, similarly to December last year, the exchange rate of the Polish currency appreciated in both nominal and real terms. Against the US dollar the mid-month appreciation of the zloty rose by 4.7% as compared to December 2000, and against the euro - by 0.4%. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Council will be held on March 27-28th, 2001."
Euroarea,2001-03-01,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here to report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. The Governing Council conducted its regular examination of monetary and economic developments and analysed their implications for the maintenance of price stability in the euro area. The decision to keep interest rates unchanged reflects the following assessment. As regards the first pillar of the monetary policy strategy of the ECB, data for January 2001 indicated that the moderation of the growth of monetary aggregates, which has been observed since the spring of last year, continued. According to the latest data, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 in the months from November 2000 to January 2001 stood at 5.0%, which was slightly lower than the average of 5.1% recorded for the period from October to December 2000. As regards the second pillar, there are indications that euro area real GDP growth was lower in the second half of last year than in the first half, but the general outlook for this year and next remains positive. Economic activity in the euro area is mainly determined by domestic factors. The conditions on the domestic side, as shown in long-term financing costs and disposable income developments, for example, have remained favourable. In addition, the euro area's high rates of capacity utilisation, continuing employment growth and declines in unemployment should contribute to fostering private investment and consumption. The overall level of confidence in the euro area has remained high and economic indicators relating to developments around the turn of the year support the view that economic growth will remain fairly robust. This notwithstanding, an element of uncertainty with regard to the outlook for euro area growth continues to be the world economy and its potential impact on euro area developments. However, at this juncture, there are no signs that the slowdown in the US economy is having significant and lasting spillover effects on the euro area. Nevertheless, a close monitoring of global developments is warranted. As regards recent price developments, the annual rate of increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) in January 2001 was 2.4%, as published by Eurostat, 0.2 percentage point lower than in December 2000. The rate of increase in energy prices continued to decline, but other HICP components, notably unprocessed food and services prices, rose significantly. The latter have been affected by increases in indirect taxation and administered prices. Oil prices and the euro exchange rate in January and February 2001 were subject to some volatility. Caution is therefore warranted in assessing their likely impact on HICP inflation in the short run. Moreover, indirect effects of past oil price increases and the depreciation of the euro are still coming through, as witnessed by the continued rise in producer price increases for consumer goods. Taken together, these factors might prevent consumer price inflation from falling quickly below 2% for some months to come. Governments can contribute to fostering non-inflationary growth by continuing structural reforms in order to further enhance the flexibility of labour and goods markets in the euro area. Long-term growth perspectives for the euro area will also benefit if governments reinforce their efforts to proceed along the path of fiscal consolidation. It is regrettable that budgetary plans, as recently expressed in countries' updated stability programmes, are not very ambitious. Tax cuts are welcome, but current budgetary plans foresee insufficient spending restraint. Overall, for the medium-term outlook for price stability, risks appear to be more balanced than in late 2000. In particular, the indications from M3 growth over recent months point to a gradual decline in upward risks. In this respect, it is crucial that social partners continue the process of wage moderation seen in the past. In this, they can be assured that the Governing Council will maintain price stability over the medium term."
Thailand,2001-03-01,"Monetary Policy Board's Decision on 1 March 2001 The Monetary Policy Board (MPB) met today to review recent developments in economic conditions and inflation outlook in order to determine the appropriate course of monetary policy action. The MPB found that the latest data showed Thai economic growth rate and inflation rate to be close to the previous projection in January. Growth was moderating due to the downside risk of economic slowdown in the United States and Asia. Thailand's major export markets. However the growth of these economies are expected to pick up in 2002 following their current stimulus policies. The MPB took into consideration the new government's policy proposed to the parliament and expected the new spending package to result in disbursements starting the second quarter of 2001 onwards. The effect on growth will depend on the actual amount disbursed each year, whether such spending leads to any increase in private investments, and how much import is induced. Nevertheless since economic activity is still below the potential level, the MPB viewed that the fiscal stimulus will not add inflationary pressure and core inflation for 2001 and 2002 will remain within the target. The MPB found that the easy monetary stance that has been adopted for some time in order to support the recovery, has gained more and more success in bringing down long-term interest rates over the past 2 years. The downward movement was particularly rapid since the beginning of 2001 when the market yield of 14-year Thai government bond dropped from the level of 66 per cent to 54 per cent at the end of February. Therefore the MPB decided to maintain the key policy rate at 15 per cent per annum to support further economic recovery. Bank of Thailand 1 March 2001."
Peru,2001-03-02,"BANCO CENTRAL DE RESERVA DEL PERU Informative note on the Monetary Program: March 2001 Increase in the benchmark for monetary operations and reduction of BCRP operations' interest rates As anticipated in the Monetary Program Report for 2001. The Central Reserve Bank Board of Directors established that, on the first Friday of each month, the Bank would announce the range for the average daily balance of the current accounts held by banks at the Central Bank, to be taken as benchmark for monetary operations during the month. Additionally, the Bank will announce the interest rates to be maintained during the month for monetary regulation credits and overnight deposits held by banks at the Central Bank. For the month of March, the range referred to in the previous paragraph will be 128 - 138 million as a daily average. In February, the said balance was 134 million, within the announced range (125  135 million) and higher than in January (128 million). The Central Bank Board of Directors also established that the following interest and commission rates would be used in domestic-currency Central Bank operations since March 2: For monetary regulation credits in domestic currency, the effective interest rate would be the average of the top-decile interbank interest rates, or 11,5 percent, whichever is highest. This rate implied a reduction with respect to the rate ruling since January 4 (12,5 percent). For overnight deposits in domestic currency held by banks at the Central Bank, the effective interest rate will be 4,0 percent. Until March 1, this rate was 4,5 percent For foreign exchange temporary purchase operations (swap operations), the commission will be 0,0165 percent, equivalent to an effective 11,5 percent annual cost. This cost is lower than that ruling since January 4 (12,5 percent). The increase in the benchmark for monetary operations and the decrease in the reference interest rates for monetary regulation credits and overnight deposits as well as the commissions for swap operations are justified by the declining trend on inflation expectations of economic agents for the current year. This trend is expected to continue, addressing to new adjustments in the benchmark and reductions in the interest rates before mentioned. The following interest rates will be used in foreign-currency operations: The effective annual rate for monetary regulation credits will be 8,5 percent. For overnight deposits held by banks at the Central Bank, the rate is equivalent to the average obtained by the Central Bank for similar deposits abroad. If justified by financial conditions, the values mentioned above could be modified in order to ensure the attainment of the objective to preserve monetary stability."
Peru,2001-03-07,"BANCO CENTRAL DE RESERVA DEL PERU Press release MONETARY PROGRAM APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF THE BANK FOR MARCH 2002 a The Board of the Bank decided to rise the average balance of the banks' current account and to reduce the Central Bank interest rate in domestic currency from 3,5 to 3,0 percent The Board of the Bank decided to rise the average balance of the banks' current account to 185 million- 195 million on a daily average basis, which is consistent with a higher preference for domestic currency. In February, the current account balance was 189 million, higher than the operating target of that month (160 million to 170 million). The latter is associated with the recomposition of the banks' reserve requirement, which rose the demand of current account in order to substitute cash in vaults in compliance of the legal minimum reserve requirement (6 percent). Considering this higher demand of current account funds, the Bank rose the disposal of banking liquidity with respect to the February Monetary Program announce in order to avoid interbank interest rates rising pressures. Thus, the average interbank interest rate in domestic currency was 2,6 percent in February, compared with 2,7 percent in January. The Board of the Bank also established for domestic currency operation the following: For monetary regulation credits and temporary purchase of CDBCRP and Treadury bonds out of auctions, the effective interest rate would be the weighted average of the interbank interest rates, or 3,0 percent, whichever is highest. Formerly, the said rate was 3,5 percent. For overnight deposits in domestic currency held by banks at the Central Bank, the effective interest rate remained at 1,9 percent. For foreign exchange temporary purchase operations (swap operations), the commission implies an effective annual cost of 3,0 percent. The former cost was 3,5 percent. The following interest rates will be used in foreign-currency operations: The effective annual rate for monetary regulation credits will be 2,75 percent. Formerly, the said rate was 3,0 percent. For overnight deposits held by banks at the Central Bank, the rate is equivalent to the average obtained by the Central Bank for similar deposits abroad. The Central Bank grants monetary regulation credits in domestic and foreign currency on a regular basis. Besides, the Central Bank operations will be oriented to reduce volatility in the exchange market. If justified by financial conditions, the values mentioned above could be modified in order to ensure the attainment of the objective to preserve monetary stability, which mean avoiding inflationary or deflationary pressures."
South Korea,2001-03-08,"Real sector activity has continued to slow, while consumer and business confidence seems to be improving to some extent. Industrial production increased somewhat in January and signs of a revival of exports emerged. Consumer prices increased by more than 4 percent on a year-on- year basis in February for the second successive month. There are still destabilizing factors present, including the rise of some service charges and the effect of the depreciation of the Korean won. Despite underlying factors making for market instability such as lingering concerns over corporate credit risk in the financial markets, the corporate credit crunch appears to be easing. There has been a large increase in the corporate sector's issuance of bonds and commercial paper while market interest rates have maintained an underlying downward trend. Taking overall account of the evolution of the real and financial sectors, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea today decided to maintain the overnight call rate at around its current level in March. The Committee also noted that monetary policy would be flexible in its response to the economic situation, watching developments in the external economic environment as well as the business conditions and price movements. In order to maintain stable movement of market interest rates and bring about a constant improvement in corporate fund-raising, it is vital to lower corporate credit risk by promptly putting in place market- based structural reforms in a systematic manner."
Chile,2001-03-15,"Santiago. March 15, 2001 Press Release At its monthly monetary policy meeting held today, the Board of the Central Bank decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at its current level of UF plus 4% and that liquidity credit lines would also remain unchanged. As usual, the Board analyzed recent economic developments and the outlook for the next twenty-four months. Data gathered in the past two weeks since the special meeting of the Board on March 2 confirms the conclusions reached at that meeting. The present rate is thus appropriate for keeping inflation within the target range and converging on 3% a year within the policy horizon (12 to 24 months). The Central Bank will continue flexible in its use of monetary policy to face any threats to achieving the inflation target."
South Africa,2001-03-16,"1.1 After the world economy had registered strong growth during the first half of 2000, it slowed down during the rest of the year. Particularly notable was the slowdown in the growth of the gross domestic product of the United States from a seasonally adjusted and annualised rate of 5½ per cent in the second quarter of 2000 to only 1 per cent in the fourth quarter. Economic activity in the United Kingdom and the euro area also became less robust, while Japan's aggregate production remained weak. There is as yet no clear picture of the impact of this slowdown on the emerging-market economies of Latin America. Asia and Africa. A severe downturn in the world economy could negatively affect international commodity prices and the exports of these countries. 1.2 A more benign inflationary environment is generally expected after oil prices settled at levels of between US$23 to US$28 per barrel in recent weeks. Oil price developments and a stronger euro brought down the rate of increase in the overall harmonised index of consumer prices in the euro area from 2,9 per cent in November 2000 to 2,4 per cent in January. Japan is still experiencing deflationary conditions, while the inflation rate in the United Kingdom of 1,8 per cent in January 2001 continued to be well below the target rate of 2,5 per cent. In the United States there were signs of increased inflationary pressures with the year-on-year change in the all-goods consumer price index rising from 3,4 per cent in November 2000 to 3,7 per cent in January 2001. In the same month of the preceding year, the corresponding rate of increase was still only 2,7 per cent. 1.3 The marked slowdown in economic activity in the United States resulted in a 100-basis-point reduction in the Federal Funds rate in two steps during January, from 6,5 per cent at the beginning of the month to 5,5 per cent at the end of the month. This led to a general decline in the interest rates in a number of advanced as well as emerging-market economies. A notable exception in this regard was the euro area, where the European Central Bank maintained its official rate at a level of 4,75 per cent. 1.4 The gold price has moved somewhat from its low of US$256 per fine ounce on 16 February 2001. A sharp rise in gold lease rates helped to underpin the firmer gold price, probably because central banks have shifted their gold deposits out towards longer-dated deposits to achieve a higher return on their assets. As a result, gold has traded between US$260 and US$275 per fine ounce in the past two weeks. However, the prices of palladium and platinum have moved down to lower levels. 2.1 Economic activity in South Africa remained buoyant despite the slower growth experienced in industrialised countries. In fact, the annualised rate of increase in real gross domestic product amounted to 4 per cent in the third quarter of 2001, before decreasing slightly to 3 per cent in the fourth quarter. This lower growth rate had more to do with a moderation in the increase in agricultural output following an exceptionally strong rise in the preceding quarter, than with any general weakness in output. Strong growth continued in the manufacturing and tertiary sectors, and real value added by the mining sector picked up despite a further fall in the output of gold mines. 2.2 Aggregate domestic final demand and exports remained strong throughout the second half of 2000. This was the combined result of a sharp rise in both real consumption expenditure and gross fixed capital formation. Growth in spending on durable consumer goods slowed down somewhat in the fourth quarter of 2000, but this was mostly caused by prospective buyers of new motorcars delaying their purchases until after the year end. The recorded increases in new car sales in January and February 2001, seem to confirm that strong demand conditions might have persisted in the first two months of 2001. 2.3 The increase in domestic final demand was countered to some extent by a more subdued accumulation of inventories in the fourth quarter of 2001. Together with the increase in exports, the slower rate of increase in inventories contributed to an improvement in South Africa's transactions in goods and services with the rest of the world. 2.4 The growth in unit labour cost was contained to a year-on-year rate of about 1,5 per cent in the first three quarters of 2000 (the latest period for which this information is available). This was largely brought about by a further decline in the demand for labour. The consequent under-utilisation of labour resources contributed to a significant moderation of nominal wage growth and a substantial improvement in productivity. 3.1 The monetary aggregates started to reflect the stronger real economic activity and easier monetary conditions from the fourth quarter of 2000. The seasonally adjusted and annualised rate of increase in M3, for instance, accelerated from 4,7 per cent in the third quarter of 2000 to 14,7 per cent in the fourth quarter and to 23,5 per cent in January 2001. The twelve-month growth in M3 amounted to 9,1 per cent in January 2001. Such high growth rates in money supply, if sustained, are not conducive to low and stable inflation. 3.2 Banks' loans and advances to the domestic private sector expanded at a firm pace from the middle of 2000. This aggregate, which includes instalment sale credit, leasing finance, mortgage and other loans and advances, recorded an annualised rate of increase of 9,6 per cent over the six months up to January 2001, i.e. at a pace considerably in excess of the overall inflation rate. 3.3 The easier monetary conditions were accompanied by continued fiscal prudence reflected in a low borrowing requirement during the current fiscal year. The latest Budget indicates that government intends maintaining fiscal discipline in the coming year, while at the same time stimulating the domestic economy by lowering the tax rates for especially the lower and middle-income groups and increasing expenditure on social and infrastructural development. The relatively small projected budget deficit will mainly be financed by the expected proceeds from the restructuring of state assets and by making use of foreign financing. 4.1 Capital market turnovers remained high in the first 2½ months of 2001, following the record levels which were reached in 2000. Interest in this market was supported by a further increase in bond prices and a corresponding decline in yields. Nominal bond yields have receded considerably since early November 2000. On 5 March 2001 the R150-yield briefly broke the 11 per cent level, reflecting receding inflation fears and the conservative deficit financing of government. These changes in longer-term bond yields resulted in both a flattening and a downward shift of the yield curve. 4.2 Other asset prices have generally also recorded increases during the second half of 2000 and the beginning of 2001. Share prices rose in early 2001 to a new record level on 16 February and then receded up to 15 March 2001. On this date they were nevertheless 28 per cent above their lower turning point on 17 April 2000. Starting from a low base, housing prices were rising at year-on-year rates of around 20 per cent towards the end of 2000. 4.3 The money market was characterised by continued stability with relatively stable rates and the liquidity requirement fluctuating between R8,3 billion and R10,2 billion since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee. However, forward rates continued to reflect market expectations of moderate decreases in interest rates in the course of 2001. BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET. 5.1 A favourable export performance in the last quarter of 2000 counteracted the effects of high crude oil prices and increases in the volume of imports. As a result, the seasonally adjusted and annualised deficit on the current account of the balance of payments of R6,3 billion in the third quarter of 2000 turned into a surplus of R2,5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2000. This change occurred despite a further worsening in the deficit on the services and income account. In January 2001 the three-month centred moving average trade surplus fell from R37,0 billion (seasonally adjusted and annualised) from October to December 2000 to R31,9 billion in the three months from November to January 2001. 5.2 The financial account of the balance of payments was in deficit to the amount of R1,0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2000, following a surplus of R10,9 billion in the third quarter. Judging by the net sales of securities by non-residents on the South African financial markets, the financial account remained fairly weak in the early months of 2001. However, prospects seem favourable for a strong inward movement of capital later in the year with the planned external borrowing programme of the government and the restructuring of state assets. Optimism was buoyed even further with the proposed restructuring of stockholdings in the De Beers diamond company which is expected to precipitate an inward movement of foreign capital of roughly R22 billion. 5.3 The net result of the balance of payments movements was a small addition to the country's overall holdings of international reserves since the end of September 2000. The net oversold position in foreign currency nevertheless remained unchanged at US$9,5 billion. 5.4 In tandem with international currency markets, the nominal effective exchange rate of the rand continues to be characterised by great volatility. The trade-weighted value of the rand nevertheless has declined by 1,5 per cent from the end of 2000 up to 15 March 2001. This brought the total decline from the beginning of 2000 to as much as 13,7 per cent. This reflects the strength of the US dollar as reflected by substantial depreciations of other currencies such as those of Australia and New Zealand. 6.1 The depreciation of the rand exerted upward pressure on the prices of imported intermediate and final goods. Other upward pressure arose from high international oil prices. The effect of these factors was countered to some extent by the low growth in unit labour costs, and by cost absorption in industry and commerce, which is not uncommon in the early stages of an upturn in economic activity. The twelve-month rate of increase in the production price index nevertheless picked up from 8,6 per cent in July 2000 to 10,0 per cent in December and declined to 9,2 per cent in January 2001. Measured from quarter to quarter, production price inflation accelerated from 7,4 per cent in the third quarter of 2000 to 10,6 per cent in the fourth quarter. 6.2 The targeted CPIX inflation (i.e. the overall consumer price inflation for metropolitan and other urban areas, excluding changes in mortgage bond rates) slowed down from a twelve-month rate of increase of 8,2 per cent in August 2000 to 7,6 per cent in December and 7,7 per cent in January 2001. The rate of increase in the quarter-to-quarter seasonally adjusted CPIX also declined from 8,8 per cent in the second quarter of 2000 to 6,2 per cent in the fourth quarter. 6.3 These changes show that the normal long-established relationship between movements in production and consumer prices has apparently broken down. In the past, changes in production prices usually led changes in consumer prices by two or three months. The breakdown of the relationship between production and consumer prices was mainly due to the fact that oil price changes had a more serious impact on production prices than consumer prices. Another factor was that the rate of increase in retail food prices had slowed down in the last half of 2000, whereas the inflation rate of food prices in the production price index remained virtually unchanged. 6.4 The baseline forecast for CPIX inflation falls within the target range, although close to the upper limit. The inflation expectations survey of the Bureau for Economic Research of the University of Stellenbosch showed that inflation expectations have improved slightly from the fourth quarter of 2000 to the first quarter of 2001. 6.5 In view of the above considerations, the Monetary Policy Committee has decided to keep the monetary policy stance unchanged."
Israel,2001-03-26,"Monetary program for April 2001 26 MArch 2001 The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for April 2001, according to which its interest rate will be reduced by 0.3 percentage points. The Bank of Israel explains that the decision to lower the nominal interest rate for April by this amount is consistent with the long-term inflation target set by the government. The decision was taken against the background of the current assessment that inflation in the period to which the target relates will be between 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent a year-slightly below the lower limit of the target range for 2001, and within the range set by the government in the longer term. Thus, the reduction of the interest rate contributes to attaining the inflation target in 2001 and is consistent with achieving it in the coming years. It will be recalled that the government decided that interest-rate policy should aim at attaining an inflation target of 2.5 to 3.5 percent in 2001, 2 to 3 percent in 2002, and 1 to 3 percent-a range which is defined as price stability-in 2003 and subsequently. Monetary policy aspires to achieve these targets, which help Israel to integrate successfully into the global economy and serve to buttress sustainable economic growth. At the same time it minimizes fluctuations in the rate of interest, thereby lowering volatility in the money, capital, and foreign-currency markets. The Bank of Israel points out that the decision to reduce the interest rate this month was made inter alia in the context of uncertainty regarding the government's budgetary policy for this year, and its implications for the announced path of continued deficit reduction in the next two years. As regards the national budget, there are apprehensions that acceding to demands to increase various budgetary items, general government sector wage agreements, and private legislation, without making equivalent cutsin other expenditure items, could significantly increase the budget deficit for 2001,especially in view of a possible drop in tax receipts due to the economic slowdown. A major divergence in government expenditure and the budget deficit this year will impede attainment of the declining path of the deficit, and raises questions concerning thegovernment's commitment to the steady reduction of the deficit and the debt, whichhas been a cornerstone of macroeconomic policy in the last decade. Furthermore, the increase in the deficit could be accompanied by a rise in government expenditure as a share of GDP, as well as by a change in the composition of this expenditure in a direction that does not support growth but serves to raise the standard of living without being based on sustainable sources. The Bank of Israel also notes that in the wake of the sharp falls in share prices in the US stock markets, long-term investments in Israel by nonresidents is expected to decline this year, continuing the reduction in the supply of foreign currency from this source in recent months. The contraction of capital inflow has implications for both the exchange rate and the inflation rate, although in view of the moderation of economic activity and slowing of demand, the effect of the exchange rate on the inflation rate appears to be less than in the past. The risk premium which international capital markets ascribe to Israel's economy is currently estimated at between 1.1 (for half a year) and 1.9 percentage points (for 10 years), a slight rise from last month's level. The interest-rate differential between Israel and overseas widened a little in March because US interest rates declined more steeply than those in Israel, but this came after the ongoing contraction of the differential since the end of 1998-from 9 percent to only 2 percent in the last few months. Note that the interest-rate differential has repercussions on both capital flows and the composition of the asset and liabilities portfolio, and through them on Israel's financial markets. The Bank of Israel notes also that the assessment of the inflation path for one and more years ahead, against the backdrop of the long-term horizon of the inflation target, is based on the Bank's forecasts of inflation, on inflation expectations derived from the capital market, and on the predictions of various private forecasters. It must be borne in mind that it is estimates of inflation for the next 12 months and beyond that are significant, and not changes in any single ConsumerPrice Index-whether it happens to fall or rise relatively steeply or by a small amount. Similarly, neither are short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate or in inflation expectations of any significance unless they incorporate elements that may alter the assessments of inflation within the policy horizon-the following one to three years. Note that the risk premium is characterized by volatility which is sometimes caused by factors related to Israel's economy, and sometimes by global events. **The Open Market Committee of the US Federal Reserve is set to convene on May 15 for its regular review of interest-rate policy.

Poland,2001-03-28,"Information on the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council on March 27- 28, 2001 The Monetary Policy Council held its meeting on March 27-28th, 2001. The Council discussed the inflation developments at the background of general economic situation of the country. The Council took the following decisions: 1. lombard rate was lowered from 22% to 21% (annualized), 2. rediscount rate was lowered from 20.5% to 19.5% (annualized), 3. the National Bank of Poland would perform 28-day open market operations the annualized yield of which is not lower than 17%. At the same time, the Council decided to maintain its neutral position in the area of monetary policy. The resolutions adopted by the Monetary Policy Council become effective on March 29th, 2001. JUSTIFICATION In March, a further improvement was noted in the area of inflation. The observed inflation tendencies were weakened and, at the same time, the factors supporting the further inflation lowering were strengthened. The probability of achieving the inflation target for 2001 increased (6%-8% in December), close to the lower border of its range, and the mid-term target (inflation below 4% in 2003). The Council observes the following positive tendencies within the area of inflationary processes formation: I Inflation indices 1. The increase of consumer goods and services prices in February this year amounted to 0.1%. As a result, the consumer price index (CPI) calculated at the twelve-month scale clearly lowered - to the level of 6.6% from 7.4% in January. The low inflation level in February mainly resulted from the drop of foodstuff and soft beverages prices - by 0.2%, and fuel prices - by 1.0%. The inflation-lowering tendency has been maintained continuously since August last year - the CPI in this period lowered by 5 percentage points. 2. The base inflation indices also dropped - a bit slower, however, what confirms the stability of the lowering tendency of inflation. Their level in February was in the range 6.8-7.3% annualized. 3. The industrial output prices rose by 0.1% in February this year. The twelve-month producer price index (PPI), as a result, lowered to the level of 4.2% in February this year from 4.8% in January 2001. It should be emphasized that both CPI and PPI dropped in February more rapidly than expected. II. Inflation expectations 1. In March, the decrease of inflation expectations of households was observed again. They forecast the inflation at the end of this year within the range of the inflation target. A probable further drop of inflation should strengthen this tendency. 2. The expectations of banks clearly decreased - the average expectation at the end of 2001 is now below the lower border of the inflation target (6%). 3. The inflation expectations of industry processing entities were clearly lower in February 2001 than in February 2000 and in January 2001. III. Money supply and loans There are maintained favorable - for the prices in future - tendencies within the area of monetary phenomena: 1. The growth pace of money supply is maintained at the stable level of 14-15% annualized. At the same time, there is maintained a big growth pace of deposits placed by individuals at banks, at the level of 22-23% annualized. As a result, the share of deposits within the monetary aggregate M2 increases. 2. At the same time, the growth pace of lending decreased. The dynamics of receivables from individuals and businesses lowered in February to 15.5% as compared to 16.1% in January this year and 17.7% in December 2000. This tendency will rather not be subject to material changes in the nearest months due to the observed weakening of the pace of economic activity and domestic demand. IV. Output, domestic demand, labor market 1. The situation in the real sector indicates the lack of possibilities for the formation of inflation impulses connected with a bigger increase of demand than the output. The domestic demand dynamics in the 4th quarter last year was slower than the dynamics of GDP. The insofar information does not indicate the reverse of this tendency in the first half this year. 2. The increase of unemployment in February was bigger than expected. A high level of unemployment decreases potential inflation pressures connected with the increase of income and expenses of the population. The same direction of influence is observed in case of a very moderate growth pace of salaries in real terms: real salaries in the enterprise sector within the period January-February 2001 increased by 1.7% annualized, i.e. at the pace close to the one registered in the year 2000. With the absolute drop of employment and increase of output it means a further increase of productivity in the enterprise sector. 3. On the basis of the available forecasts, there should not be expected, in the nearest months, the price increase of foreign basic imported raw materials, including oil, and even with the output reduction by OPEC. At the same time, the Monetary Policy Council still observes threats to the process of inflation reduction: 1. A serious threat is still the situation in the budget sector. The advancement of the state budget deficit within the period January-February 2001 amounted to 58% of the plan for the whole year. It is the evidence for the accumulation of serious difficulties in financing the public sector expenses. The Council observes a real threat of exceeding the level of economic deficit planned for this year (1.8% of GDP). An increase of economic deficit would negatively affect inflation. 2. There is still the risk of the failure to get the forecasted revenues from privatization, what would mean the necessity to increase the lending needs of the public finance sector, pressure for the increase of market interest rates and the increase of the cost of public debt servicing. 3. There are still concerns related to the timing of funds transfers to pension funds (OFE). The delays in this area mean, in fact, the increase of the economic deficit. 4. A source of inflation pressures at the demand side can be the planned paying out of compensations, reparations for the forced labor in III Reich and within the framework of valorization of pensions and disability benefits. However, the risk connected with this threat got decreased due to the extension of the payoffs in a longer period. 5. The agricultural products and foodstuffs market remains a potential source of inflation pressures. A risk of negative phenomena will be lowered due to an effective introduction of a quota for the consumer grain imports. The Monetary Policy Council strongly states that in the formation of monetary policy in the next months this year it would pay a special attention to the pace of strengthening of positive developments observed so far. Especially, the Council emphasizes a key importance of maintaining the insofar tendencies related to a gradual lowering of inflation, formation of money variables in proportions that ensure the achievement of the mid-term inflation target, and Government actions in order to restore the budget balance and relaxation of inflation pressures on markets subject to administration intervention, including mainly on the agricultural market. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Council will be held on April 25-26th, 2001."
South Korea,2001-04-06,"Real sector activity has continued to slow. However, the downward trend of the economy seems to have moderated while industrial production has registered a small increase for the second successive month and consumer and business confidence shows signs of improvement. Consumer prices have maintained a sharply rising trend of more than four percent on a year-on-year basis for the three straight months since January. There are still destabilizing factors present, including the recent depreciation of the Korean won. In the financial markets, the fund-raising conditions of the corporate sector have continued to improve. Corporate bonds and commercial paper have been absorbed without difficulty. Nevertheless, there still exist lingering concerns over the credit risk of some large corporations. Moreover, the exchange rate and interest rates have displayed increased volatility in line with developments in the internal and external environment. Taking overall account of the evolution of the real and financial sectors, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea today decided to maintain the overnight call rate at around its current level in April. Monetary policy should continue to be conducted flexibly to take account of the status of price movements, business activity and the financial markets and of the impact of changes in external conditions on the domestic economy. Additional efforts will be made, in particular, to bring about the continuing improvement of conditions for corporate fund- raising. At the same time, it is important that monetary policy should act to secure price stability in the future. However, the recent upward trend of prices has been driven largely by a series of hikes in public service charges. Therefore, for price stability, it is essential to carry out plans for the stabilization of public service charges smoothly."
Peru,2001-04-06,"BANCO CENTRAL DE RESERVA DEL PERU Informative note on the Monetary Program: April 2001 The BCRP reduces its reference interest rate from 11,5 to 11,0 percent and rises the benchmark for monetary operations in 1,5 percent As anticipated in the Monetary Program Report for 2001. The Central Reserve Bank Board of Directors established that, on the first Friday of each month, the Bank would announce the range for the average daily balance of the current accounts held by banks at the Central Bank, to be taken as benchmark for monetary operations during the month. Additionally, the Bank will announce the interest rates to be maintained during the month for monetary regulation credits and overnight deposits held by banks at the Central Bank. For the month of April, the Board increased 1,5 percent the range referred to in the previous paragraph to 130 - 140 million as a daily average. In March, the said balance was 131 million, which fell within the announced range (128  138 million). The Central Bank Board of Directors also established that the following interest and commission rates would be used in domestic-currency Central Bank operations since April 6: For monetary regulation credits in domestic currency, the effective interest rate would be the average of the top-decile interbank interest rates, or 11,0 percent, whichever is highest. This rate implied a reduction with respect to the rate effective since March 2 (11,5 percent). For overnight deposits in domestic currency held by banks at the Central Bank, the effective interest rate will be 4,0 percent. This rate is effective since March For foreign exchange temporary purchase operations (swap operations), the commission will be 0,0159 percent, equivalent to an effective 11,0 percent annual cost. This cost is lower than that effective since March 2 (11,5 percent). With the decrease in the reference interest rates for monetary operations in domestic currency, the decline in financial system interest rates is expected to continue. To that extent, the increment of 1,5 percent in the range referred lines above it is justified. It should be noted that the increase in the Consumer Price Index in the first quarter is in line with the target for 2001 (2,5 to 3,5 percent). March inflation (0,5 percent or 3,6 percent in annual terms) is due to temporary events affecting food products, which are expected to cease in April. The following interest rates will be used in foreign-currency operations: The effective annual rate for monetary regulation credits will be 8,5 percent. For overnight deposits held by banks at the Central Bank, the rate is equivalent to the average obtained by the Central Bank for similar deposits abroad. If justified by financial conditions, the values mentioned above could be modified in order to ensure the attainment of the objective to preserve monetary stability."
Euroarea,2001-04-11,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here to report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB, which was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup. Mr. Reynders. The Governing Council conducted its regular examination of monetary and economic developments and analysed their implications for the maintenance of price stability in the euro area. In order to explain today's monetary policy decisions in some more detail, let me share with you our assessment of the information provided under the two pillars of the monetary policy strategy of the ECB. As regards the first pillar. M3 growth has been on a gradual downward trend since spring 2000. The three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 reached 4.8% in the period from December 2000 to February 2001. Growth in credit aggregates has also been less buoyant over the past few months. All in all, the information from the first pillar is signalling that upward risks to price stability have diminished over the past few months. As regards the second pillar, upward risks to price stability have also diminished somewhat over the past few months, but they have not disappeared. Starting with the external environment for the euro area, forecasts for world growth have been revised downwards, and the uncertainty surrounding these forecasts has increased. In particular, this applies to the extent and duration of the slowdown in the United States and Japan, but also to associated spillovers to the rest of the world. While this indicates that the external environment is less favourable than it was up to autumn 2000 and is marked by high uncertainty, there are no indications of a risk of a global recession. Turning to the euro area, it is of utmost importance that current developments in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) be judged appropriately. Short-term price developments are indeed subject to volatility, owing to energy and unprocessed food prices, in particular. Over recent months, the energy component has again been affected by fluctuations in oil prices and the exchange rate of the euro. Unprocessed food prices have been influenced by health concerns related to meat consumption and the consequences of the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. Also if these most volatile components are excluded, there has been a broad upward movement in HICP inflation since the summer of 1999. In part, this reflects the pass-through of the indirect effects of past rises in oil prices and the past depreciation of the euro. This impact is likely to continue for some more months to come, but should gradually diminish over time. This should be taken into consideration by the general public and by wage negotiators as consumer price inflation above 2% for some more months will be temporary. Beyond the short term, the abatement of domestic upward pressure on HICP inflation remains conditional on the continuation of wage moderation, and wage developments remain an upward risk to price stability which needs to be closely monitored. The deterioration of the external environment will imply a fall from last year's high rate of economic growthin the euro area this year; this reduction will be stronger than that envisaged some months ago. At the same time, however, available forecasts suggest that actual growth will be in line with, or above, trend potential growth. Hence, the moderation in growth should not be a source of pessimism as regards the economic strength of the euro area itself. This is all the more true as the euro area has not accumulated any fundamental macroeconomic imbalances over recent years, and domestic demand can therefore be expected to continue to sustain real GDP growth. Industrial confidence has been deteriorating, reflecting the weakening of world demand. However, consumer confidence has remained high in recent months. Growth in private consumption is expected to remain sound, underpinned by increases in real disposable income which, in turn, reflect ongoing employment growth, reductions in direct taxes and lower oil prices. Monetary policy has to focus on the outlook for price stability in the medium term. With this commitment to price stability and the policy decisions since the start of Monetary Union, monetary policy has supported economic growth and employment and will continue to do so. Nominal and real short-term as well as long-term interest rates are not high by historical standards. Monetary policy cannot lift the euro area's production potential, which is largely determined by structural factors. The improvement of the structural conditions for raising potential growth is undoubtedly of utmost priority. The responsibility for this lies with governments, as well as with the key national economic agents on the side of labour and industry. To increase potential output growth, comprehensive structural reform policies aimed at an increased labour market participation rate and improved investment incentives are required. While acknowledging that significant progress has been made, a more ambitious implementation of market-oriented reforms is needed in many areas. The still high level of unemployment calls for ongoing policy efforts to remove structural rigidities from the labour markets and to diminish adverse incentives provided by tax, benefit and pension systems. It is crucial to increase investment incentives in the euro area through structural policy measures such as deregulation, privatisation and tax reforms. The continuous contribution of social partners will be essential to prevent temporary inflationary pressures from possibly translating into longer-lasting effects. Finally, fiscal policy will have to make its contribution towards enhancing the growth potential of the economy. This requires both the continuation of the fiscal consolidation process in line with the Stability and Growth Pact and qualitative improvements on the income and expenditure sides of the budget. In addition. I should like to inform you that the visual appearance of the euro banknotes and their security features will be unveiled to the public at a press conference to be held on 30 August 2001, shortly before the euro banknotes are frontloaded to banks on 1 September 2001. It will take place immediately after a press conference we shall now hold to report to you on the Governing Council meeting on that day. Therefore, we have decided to bring the press conference originally scheduled for 13 September forward to 30 August 2001. Moreover, the press conference planned for 2 August 2001 has been cancelled."
Thailand,2001-04-20,"Monetary Policy Board's Decision on 19 April 2001 The Monetary Policy Board (MPB) met today to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance, taking into account recent economic conditions as well as medium-term economic outlook. The MPB viewed that Thai economic growth rate and inflation rate in the next 8 quarters are likely to remain close to the previous projection in March. In 2001, the Thai economy is expected to grow by about 25-4 per cent, while core inflation should average around 15-2 per cent, which is well within the announced target. The economic slowdown in the US and Japan would directly affect Thai exports. Fiscal stimulus and the recovery of domestic demand are therefore essential to promote growth and offset the weakening external demand. Since the country's overall demand has not fully recovered and excess production capacity still remains, the fiscal stimulus will not add inflationary pressure. The MPB viewed that the growth of Thai economy in 2002 should pick up despite the presence of external economic uncertainties. The adoption of expansionary fiscal and monetary policies by a number of major trading partners since the beginning of this year should revive the growth of these economies over the medium term, which should in turn benefit the Thai economy. The 50 basis point reduction in the interest rates by the Federal Reserve yesterday clearly reflected the Fed's determination to stimulate the economy, which should enhance confidence of consumers and investors. In Thailand, the MPB has adopted the easy monetary policy stance for some time by keeping the key policy rate at a low level. However world economic and financial conditions have not been conducive to economic recovery, and domestic commercial banking system has not yet functioned efficiently. As a result, the Thai economy has not yet grown at a sustainable high rate. The MPB thus decided to maintain the 14-day repurchase rate at 15 per cent per annum for a while further. Further details regarding the assessment of the economy and risks, together with the output and inflation projections, will be released during the April 2001 Inflation Report Press Conference at 2. 00 p. m. on 26 April 2001. Bank of Thailand 19 April 2001."
Israel,2001-04-24,"Monetary program for May 2001 has been postponed 24 April 2001 The Bank of Israel announces that as a result of sanctions imposed by the Workers' Committee, and their cumulative effect over the last three months, it will not be possible to keep to the normal schedule, and so the decision regarding the interest rate for May which should have been announced on Monday 23 April has been postponed. Decisions on changes in the Bank of Israel's rate of interest are based on a broad information system covering three main areas:economic data from Israel and abroad; forecasts of expected developments of several variables; and assessments by the Bank's economic departments of inflation compared with the targets in the next few years. As a result of the Workers' Committee sanctions, the following stages in the decision-making process have not taken place: 1. The daily discussions chaired by the head of theMonetary Department to make decisions about the daily monetary auction arenot being held. 2. Discussions in the weekly Monetary Forum, headedby the Governor, are held on the basis of incomplete information, so that a complete assessment of the situation cannot be made. 3. Departmental discussions under the heads of the Monetary. Research. Foreign Exchange Control, and Foreign Currency Departments prior to the monthly interest-rate meetings have not been held. In these discussions the data are reviewed, and recommendations regarding the interest rate are formulated. 4. The monetary discussion with the above four departments, headed by the Governor, has not taken place. In this discussion economists of the Bank present data, forecasts, and assessments of the situation regarding (a) expected trends in the US. Europe, and Japan (interest rates, exchange rates, developments in financial markets and real economicactivity) and their implications for Israel's economy; (b) possible developments in capital flows from and to Israel, and their effects on the exchange rate; and (c) forecasts of changes in real activity, growth, and employment, and different scenarios regarding expected inflation based on econometric models of the Research Department and the Monetary Department. 5. As a result, the discussion in the narrow Monetary Forum headed by the Governor, in which the departments' recommendations regarding the interest rate are presented and discussed, did not place either. It should be emphasized that the monthly decision on the rate of interest is not one confined to the Governor alone, but is the culmination of a long and intensive process of formulating proposals regarding the interest rate. These proposals are based on a broad information base as outlined above and on discussions in which representatives of the appropriate professional departments in the Bank of Israel participate, and are made against the background of a combination of the weekly assessments of the situation during the month. In addition to the above, the instructions of the Workers' Committee have prevented the Bank of Israel from publishing data for the public, thereby harming the transparency of monetary policy. The Bank of Israel notes that the sanctions of the Workers' Committee have continued for three months, disrupting some of the Bank's essential tasks. The management of the Bank explains that it is doing everything it can to minimize the disruption of the services which the Bank affords the public and to prevent damage which could result from the Workers'Committee sanctions, although its ability to do so is limited. As is known, the Bank asked the Government to issue confinement orders to enable minimal performance of the services vital to the economy. This refers not only to the abilityto manage the interest-rate policy, but also to the existence of a proper level of banking supervision, and the ability to make decisions required for the management of the country's foreign-exchange reserves. All the above have been conducted in an irregular manner for the last three months, with the Bank's management unable to fully carry out its responsibility. The Bank of Israel announces that as a result of sanctions imposed by the Workers' Committee, and their cumulative effect over the last three months, it will not be possible to keep to the normal schedule, and so the decision regarding the interest rate for May which should have been announced on Monday 23 April has been postponed."
South Africa,2001-04-25,"1.1 The international economic outlook continues to be dominated by the downturn of activity in the United States and the effect that this will likely have on the rest of the world economy. Recent information indicates that economic growth in the United States will probably remain subdued for much of the year. Although industrial production rose in March after it had declined from September 2000, other data indicate that the economy remains under pressure. These include lower retail sales, a rise in the unemployment rate, a decline in imports, lower fixed investment, the erosion in current and expected profitability and the possible negative effects that lower equity prices may have on consumption. 1.2 The full extent of the impact of the United States' downturn on the rest of the world is still unclear. The countries that will probably be most affected will be those with a strong export orientation to the United States, particularly the East Asian economies specialising in high-technology products. Sluggish conditions in Japan are likely to accentuate the overall weakness of Asian trade. The World Bank nevertheless still predicts only a modest fall in the growth rate of gross domestic product in all developing economies from 5,4 per cent in 2000 to 4,2 per cent in 2001, whereas growth in high-income countries is expected to fall from 3,7 per cent to 1,7 per cent over the same period. 1.3 As a result of the continued poor performance of the United States' economy, the Federal Reserve Board announced a further cut of 50 basis points in its targeted federal funds rate on 18 April 2001. This brought the federal funds rate to 4,5 per cent, representing a decrease of 2 percentage points since the beginning of the year. The decline in interest rates in the United States has resulted in generally lower interest rates internationally, in both developed and emerging-market economies. A notable exception in this regard is the euro area, where the European Central Bank has maintained short-term rates at the levels prevailing since October 2000. Another exception is Brazil where interest rates have been raised on two occasions in the past two months when inflation exceeded the target range. 1.4 Generally there has been little evidence of an increase in inflationary pressures internationally. In the United States. United Kingdom and the euro area, the rate of inflation is lower than levels recorded at the end of 2000 because of declines in oil prices. The inflation rate in the euro area at 2,6 per cent in March, compared with the same month in the preceding year, was nevertheless still above the target ceiling of 2 per cent. With the exception of Asia, consumer prices in developing countries are increasing at considerably higher rates than those in advanced economies. 2.1 Information on real domestic economic activity for the first quarter of 2001 is still incomplete and due to conflicting signals, it is difficult to determine whether the strong growth in the last half of 2000 has been maintained. All in all, it seems that economic growth levelled off during the first three months of 2001, although activity remained at a relatively high level. This is confirmed by a downward movement in the volume of imports in the first two months of the year, a decline in the physical volume of manufacturing and non-gold mining production in January and February and a decrease in wholesale and retail sales during January from the high levels reached in December. In contrast to these developments, the quarter-to-quarter growth in new vehicle sales was substantial in the first quarter of 2001 and the value of unfilled orders in manufacturing rose to a new record level in February 2001. The volume of merchandise exports was not significantly affected by the slower international economic growth and continued to rise in the first two months of 2001. 2.2 The creation of employment opportunities for South Africa's growing population, remains the major challenge facing the country. The new Labour Force Survey of Statistics South Africa reports an increase in the unemployment rate during 2000 because of the majority of new work seekers who were unable to find jobs. The oversupply of labour, rationalisation of production processes and increases in output contained the increase in the cost of labour per unit of output. The growth in nominal unit labour cost therefore decreased from an already low level of 2,8 per cent in 1999 to 2,3 per cent in 2000, alleviating pressures on price increases. Towards the end of 2000 there was a moderate acceleration in the growth of nominal unit labour cost when the year-on-year rate of increase rose from 1,8 per cent in the third quarter to 3,7 per cent in the fourth quarter. 3.1 The growth in the monetary aggregates continued to reflect the higher level of real economic activity and easier monetary conditions. The year-on-year rates of expansion in the broadly defined money supply (M3) accelerated from 6,0 per cent in July 2000 and 7,5 per cent in December to 9,3 per cent in February 2001. More rapid growth was also discernible in the narrower monetary aggregates, with the exception of M1A. 3.2 The relatively high level of economic activity resulted in a moderate expansion in the loans and advances of banks to the domestic non-bank private sector. The year-on-year growth in this aggregate amounted to 8,2 per cent in February 2001. The demand for instalment sale credit and mortgage finance continued to strengthen in line with brisk motor vehicle sales and better property market conditions. In contrast to these developments, other loans and advances by banks to the private sector, including bank overdrafts, declined from a high of R239,6 billion in November 2000 to R233,4 billion in February 2001. 3.3 Preliminary information about the national government's finances for the full fiscal year 2000/2001 indicates that the deficit before borrowing was even smaller than that which had been anticipated at the time of the Budget. This deficit is now estimated at 1,9 per cent of gross domestic product, largely owing to higher revenue collections than had initially been expected as well as prudent management of the fiscus. 4.1 In the first quarter of 2001 turnover in the secondary bond and share market slid back slightly from the record levels reached in the fourth quarter of 2000. Bond rates and share prices fluctuated considerably during the first few months of 2001. Bond yields reached a lower turning point in early March following a bull run of about ten months, but then rebounded by about half a percentage point as a result of profit taking by investors. Share prices peaked on 16 February 2001, but have declined by about 14 per cent up to 3 April 2001. Subsequently share prices have recovered again somewhat. Early indications are that property rents and real-estate prices rose less rapidly in the first quarter of 2001 than during most of the preceding year. 4.2 Money market conditions remained relatively stable throughout the first quarter of 2001 with slight fluctuations in short-term interest rates and a liquidity requirement that fluctuated between R8 billion and R10,4 billion. Since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, on 16 March 2001, money market rates have generally firmed. This led to a steepening of the money-market yield curve. The short end of the money-market yield curve is now higher than immediately after the 25-basis-point increase in the repo rate on 16 October 2000. BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET. 5.1 South Africa's overall balance of payments position is expected to have remained sound during the first quarter of 2001. This is firstly indicated by a trade surplus, at a seasonally adjusted and annualised rate, of R23 billion in the first two months of 2001. Although this surplus was smaller than in the fourth quarter of 2000 it was brought about by a continued strong export performance. In particular, the exports of platinum and manufactured goods did well, reflecting a firm international demand and the improved price competitiveness of South African goods related to the depreciation of the rand. The improvement in exports was partly neutralised by a rise in the value of imports, largely capital and intermediate goods. 5.2 Secondly, the transactions by non-residents in domestic securities indicate some improvement in South Africa's financial flows with the rest of the world. Non-residents have been net buyers on the JSE Securities Exchange to an amount of R11,4 billion since the beginning of 2001, compared with R2,6 billion in the first four months of 2000. On the bond market they were net sellers in January and February 2001, but became net buyers in March. These purchases have brought their cumulative net bond sales since the beginning of the year down to R6,5 billion. 5.3 Despite these favourable developments, the exchange rate of the rand has remained under pressure in 2001, and heightened volatility has been experienced in the market for foreign exchange. Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the rand has declined to new record levels against the dollar and has traded in a range between R8,00 and R8,20 per dollar during April. This reflected to a significant extent the strength of the US dollar. The trade-weighted value of the rand nevertheless declined by 3,0 per cent from the end of 2000 to 25 April 2001. 6.1 Although the depreciation of the rand exerted upward pressure on the prices of imported goods, the overall effect on prices was counteracted by the lower international prices of oil combined with moderate inflation rates in South Africa's main trading-partner countries. As a result, the year-on-year rate of increase in the prices of imported goods moderated from 15,0 per cent in December 2000 to 12,3 per cent in March 2001. Slower rates of increase in domestic food prices further contained the inflation in production prices in 2001. The year-on-year rate of increase in the all-goods production price index consequently declined from 10,0 per cent in December 2000 to 8,9 per cent in March 2001. 6.2 The same factors were responsible for a marked slowdown in consumer price inflation during the first three months of 2001. In fact, the quarter-to-quarter seasonally adjusted and annualised rate of increase in the consumer price index excluding mortgage costs (CPIX) has declined consistently from 8,8 per cent in the second quarter of 2000 to 6,1 per cent in the first quarter of 2001. The year-on-year increase in the CPIX also decreased from a high of 8,2 per cent in August 2000 to 7,5 per cent in March 2001. 6.3 The South African Reserve Bank remains focussed on achieving the inflation target. Factors mentioned in previous statements of the Monetary Policy Committee, such as surplus production capacity, no signs of excessive domestic demand, low increases in nominal unit labour costs, low growth in monetary aggregates, fiscal prudence and monetary discipline, are all pointing to lower future domestic inflation. Projections for the year 2002 accordingly indicate that the average annual rate of increase in the CPIX should fall within the target range of 6 to 3 per cent if all other things remain the same. The main risk in this projection is the impact of prices of imported goods on domestic prices."
Poland,2001-04-26,"Information on the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council on April 25- 26, 2001 The Monetary Policy Council held its meeting on April 25-26th, 2001. The Council was submitted the materials prepared by the Management Board and departments of the NBP, documents by other domestic institutions (inter alia. Central Statistical Office. Ministry of Finance. Ministry of Economy. Government Center for Strategic Studies) and international institutions (inter alia. OECD. IMF), and also information and analytical materials prepared by research institutes and commercial banks. The mentioned materials served as a basis for Council's discussion of inflation processes in Poland and development tendencies in the world economy. As a result of the discussion, the Council decided: not to change parameters of monetary policy, i.e. maintain the central bank interest rates at the actual level and maintain a neutral position in the area of monetary policy. JUSTIFICATION I. The Monetary Policy Council observes positive tendencies in the area of inflation processes. However, there are also maintained threats to the process of inflation reduction, mainly in mid term. The Council has decided that - according to the forecast of its previous meeting - we need time to be able to be convinced whether the balance of forces forming the future inflation is being improved. The Council observes the following positive tendencies in the area of inflation processes formation: 1. Inflation indices. In March this year, the increase of consumer goods and services prices amounted to 0.5% and the consumer price index (CPI) calculated at the twelve-month scale lowered to the level of 6.2% from 6.6% in February this year. The further drop was also noted in case of base inflation indices calculated at the NBP. The industrial output prices rose by 0.2% in March this year as compared to the previous month. The twelve-month producer price index (PPI) lowered to the level of 3.9% from 4.2% in February 2001. The drop was also noted in case of the twelve-month construction price index from 6.5% in February to 6.1% in March. 2. Inflation expectations. According to the forecasts, a further drop of inflation expectations of individuals took place in April this year. In the second month in a row they are maintained within the range of the Council's inflation target for 2001. The drop was also observed - although a slight one - in case of banks' inflation expectations that are now slightly below the lower border of the inflation target for this year. 3. Money supply and loans The growth of money supply (M2) is maintained in a range 14-15% annualized. In March 2001, the money supply was bigger by 14.8% as compared to the end of March 2000. There is still maintained a big growth pace of deposits in PLN placed by individuals (in March this year 22.4% annualized). The growth pace of lending decreases systematically and in March it amounted to approximately 15% annualized (as compared to 17% in January and approximately 16% in February). At the same time, lending to individuals grew at a pace of approximately 28% and to businesses at a pace of approximately 12%. 4. Output, domestic demand, labor market. In March this year, the sold industrial output was bigger by 2.8% than in March 2000. In the 1st quarter this year the sold industrial output was bigger by 4.1% than in the same period in 2000. The drop pace of industrial output dynamics was decreased what together with available data on further increase of imports and exports gives rise to the expectation that the growth pace of GDP in the 1st quarter 2001 will be maintained at the level noted in the 4th quarter last year. Within the structure of demand the share of exports is growing while the dynamics of domestic demand is still low. Both the dynamics of output and the structure of demand do not cause inflation threats. The unemployment is still growing, although its growth pace decreased. The situation on labor market reduces pressure on salary increase what reduces the inflation pressure connected with both the increase of production costs and the expenses of the population. At the same time, the Council observes the maintained threats to the process of inflation reduction. 1. Inflation indices. Lower growth of consumer goods and services price index in March this year mainly resulted from a considerable (by 3.4% as compared to February this year) drop of fuel prices that, in turn, resulted from a favorable influence of external factors (drop of import price). The majority of base inflation measures decreased at a lower pace than the consumer price index. In March this year, base inflation measures were bigger than the consumer goods and services price index (6.5% - 7.1%). On the basis of the analysis of particular indices it can be expected that the insofar-big pace of disinflation will be subject to some decrease in the nearest months. 2. Situation in public finance sector: A threat to the process of disinflation is still the situation in public finance sector. The budget deficit at the end of March exceeded 73% of the amount planned for the whole year 2001. A further worsening in this area is expected in April. Such a big advancement of the deficit in the 1st quarter - the biggest since 1990 - causes a threat in a form of expenses cumulating and it may result in additional inflation pressures. The observed difficulties in a planned realization of the budget, inter alia, in the area of timely transfer of funds to Open Pension Funds, increase the danger of exceeding the level of economic deficit planned for this year (1.8% of GDP). 3. Money supply. A stable pace of money supply in nominal terms in conditions of decreasing inflation means an accelerated growth of money supply in real terms. The growth pace of M2 deflated by CPI increased within the last 6- month period from approximately 3.5% to approximately 7.5%. The maintenance of this tendency for a longer time may lead to the increase of inflation pressures. 4. Remaining factors of uncertainty and potential threats: o The acceleration of consumer demand is possible as a result of a cumulated effect of payoffs of different compensations and single money benefits. o The agricultural products and foodstuffs market still remains a source of potential inflation pressures. Lately observed price increases of foodstuffs prove high sensitivity of these prices to supply and demand fluctuations. IV. The Council evaluated in very detail the situation in the real sector of the economy, including mainly unfavorable tendencies in the area of production and employment. In the Council's opinion, monetary policy now has got very limited abilities to improve the situation in the real sector. Especially, potential interest rate cuts are not able to change the situation on the labor market in a perceptible and permanent way and they would be able to threaten the achievement of the inflation target. A basic role in new jobs creation in the present situation is to be played by fiscal policy, including systematic cut of fiscal costs of labor, and structural policy. That is why the Council notes that the discussion, and mainly actions to increase employment and achieve a higher pace of economic growth, should be focused on necessary structural reforms of the Polish economy, especially liquidation of barriers to undertake and run businesses, privatization, a reform of labor market and public finance sector. With the lack of a basic improvement in these areas, interest rate cuts made too early or too thoroughly would lead to the reverse of the decreasing trend of inflation without an effect in the area of employment increase and strengthening the development of the economy. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Council will be held on May 21st, 2001. The subject of this meeting will be: Report of monetary policy guidelines accomplishment in 2000. Report of activities of the National Bank of Poland in 2000."
Peru,2001-05-04,"BANCO CENTRAL DE RESERVA DEL PERU Monetary Program for 2001- Information Note: May 2001 The BCRP maintains its reference interest rate at 11,0 percent and set the benchmark for monetary operations at 120-130 million. The Bank also reduces the interest rate for liquidity credits in foreign currency from 8,5 to 7,5 percent For the month of April, the Board of the Bank decided to maintain the range for the average daily balance of the current accounts held by banks at the Central Bank to 120 - 130 million as a daily average. In April, the balance was 123 million, within the range (120 - 130 million). It should be noted that this range was revised downwards from 130 - 140 million as a consequence of the uncertainty and turmoil in financial markets associated with external and domestic events. The Central Bank Board of Directors also decided to maintain the interest and commission rates used in domestic-currency Central Bank operations: For monetary regulation credits in domestic currency, the effective interest rate would be the average of the top-decile interbank interest rates, or 11,0 percent, whichever is highest. This rate is effective since April For overnight deposits in domestic currency held by banks at the Central Bank, the effective interest rate will be 4,0 percent. This rate is effective since March For foreign exchange temporary purchase operations (swap operations), the commission will be 0,0174 percent, equivalent to an effective 11,0 percent annual cost. This rate is effective since April The following interest rates will be used in foreign-currency operations: The effective annual rate for monetary regulation credits will be 7,5 percent. This rate is lower to that effective since November 17, 2000 (8,5 percent). The reduction follows the trend in international interest rates along the year. For overnight deposits held by banks at the Central Bank, the rate is equivalent to the average obtained by the Central Bank for similar deposits abroad. If justified by financial conditions, the values mentioned above could be modified in order to ensure the attainment of the objective to preserve monetary stability."
South Korea,2001-05-08,"The economy has not yet been able to shake off its subdued tone. Its downward trend, though, has moderated to some degree while economic indicators such as those for production and consumption have shown mild improvement. Consumer prices rose significantly in April due to the higher prices of farm-livestock-fisheries products for the second straight month and price hikes for industrial products. In the financial markets, corporate fund-raising conditions have continued to improve; meanwhile, there is sufficient market liquidity and the overall level of demand for funds is not high. Nonetheless, there are some underlying factors making for market instability including the concerns over the credit risk of some corporations. Taking overall account of the evolution of the real and financial sectors, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea today decided to maintain the overnight call rate at around its current level in May. The Monetary Policy Committee also noted that monetary policy would be conducted so as to avoid demand-side inflationary pressures as well as assist an economic recovery while a careful watch would be kept on price movements, business conditions and the external environment. It also noted that it would be on the alert to avoid the recent upward trend of prices leading to heightened inflationary expectations among the general public."
Chile,2001-05-10,"Santiago. May 10, 2001 Press Release At its monthly monetary policy meeting held today, the Board of the Central Bank decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at its current level of UF plus 3.75% and that liquidity credit lines would also remain unchanged. The Board based its decision on recent economic developments and on the outlook for the next 24 months. Inflationary pressures in the medium term are contained and even though inflation may fluctuate in the short term, the Board considers that it will stay around the mid-range target (3%) in the usual time horizon if the current monetary policy interest rate is maintained. This is the result of slower-than-expected domestic demand growth but coherent with more dynamic output growth as from the second half of the year. Considering both external and internal risks, the Bank will continue to use monetary policy with the necessary flexibility to avoid any deviations from the inflationary target."
Euroarea,2001-05-10,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here to report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. The Governing Council conducted its regular examination of monetary and economic developments and analysed their implications for the maintenance of price stability in the euro area. It decided to lower the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. This reduction is to be seen as an adjustment of the level of interest rates to somewhat lower inflationary pressure over the medium term. On the basis of the information available, this is the appropriate level of interest rates to ensure that the euro area economy will be able to maintain price stability and thereby to contribute to sound economic growth over the coming years. In order to explain today's monetary policy decisions in some more detail, let me share with you our assessment of the information provided under the two pillars of the ECB's monetary policy strategy. As regards the first pillar, also taking into account the latest available information, monetary developments no longer pose a risk to price stability. M3 growth has been on a gradual downward trend since spring 2000, reflecting the increase in the key ECB interest rates which occurred in the period from November 1999. The three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 was 4.8% in the period from January to March 2001, which is close to the reference value of 4 1/2%. In the past few months, some slowdown in credit aggregates has also been visible. In addition, as already stated on several occasions, there have been indications that the monetary growth figures are distorted upwards by non-euro area residents' purchases of negotiable paper included in M3. This has now been confirmed by clear evidence, and the magnitudes involved are significant. As regards holdings of money market fund units/shares by non-euro area residents, on which we now have solid statistical data, the distortion has become more sizeable over recent months and currently amounts to around half a percentage point. In addition, there have been non-negligible upward distortions to the annual growth of M3 as a result of non-euro area residents' holdings of other marketable paper included in M3, for which precise statistical information is currently being developed. The ECB will keep the public informed about ongoing developments in these categories of M3. As these factors can be broadly identified, the information content under the first pillar is ensured. Taking into account these upward distortions, as well as all information from the first pillar, it can now be concluded that there is no longer a risk to price stability over the medium term emanating from the first pillar. As regards the second pillar, upward risks to price stability over the medium term have diminished somewhat. The evidence available, however, requires continued monitoring of growth trends and wage developments, in particular. First, owing to the less favourable external environment, a moderation in real GDP growth in the euro area will contain upward pressure on consumer prices arising from the demand side. Notwithstanding the high uncertainty surrounding the outlook for external developments, forecasts suggest that actual economic growth will nevertheless be broadly in line with trend potential growth, supported by domestic demand. Second, wage moderation has so far been maintained for the euro area as a whole, despite the effect of the oil price shock. This has been a very positive factor and lends support to those forecasts which assume that current inflation rates will not spill over into future wage negotiations. This notwithstanding, wage developments need to be continuously monitored. An abatement of domestic cost pressures on HICP inflation remains conditional on the continuation of wage moderation. For the Governing Council, it is of utmost importance that wage negotiators should have full confidence in monetary policy maintaining price stability in the euro area over the medium term. For some months to come, this medium-term trend will be overshadowed by temporary developments in unprocessed food prices following the health concerns related to meat consumption and the consequences of the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. Moreover, the pass-through of the indirect effects of past rises in oil prices and the past depreciation of the euro is likely to continue for some months. The effects of these extraordinary factors should, however, gradually diminish over the course of this year, implying an improved outlook for inflation to fall below 2% in 2002. The Governing Council has to focus on the outlook for price stability in the medium term as only this perspective allows for the time lags for monetary policy to work its way through the economy. The information under the first pillar indicates that price stability can be maintained over a medium-term horizon. The information under the second pillar indicates that upward pressure on prices can be contained. The Governing Council will continue to monitor wage developments as well as external and domestic demand trends. Fiscal policy will have to continue the consolidation process in line with the Stability and Growth Pact and the commitments made in the context of the stability programmes. The avoidance of inflationary pressures on a permanent basis in an environment of solid growth requires that governments and social partners implement decisively the structural measures in labour and product markets that are essential for lifting the growth potential of the euro area. Let me now give the floor to the Vice-President, who will inform you about two other issues relating to the production and introduction of the euro banknotes. First. I should like to address the production of euro banknotes after 2001. As you are aware, the euro area national central banks (NCBs) are producing the euro banknotes they will need for the initial supply at the end of this year. With regard to the production after 2001, the Governing Council has decided to apply a so-called decentralised production scheme with pooling. This means that not all banknote denominations will be produced by every printing works involved. This volume is based on the estimated national requirements of the NCBs. As the future national needs for euro banknotes cannot be reliably determined on account of the potential impact of banknote migration between countries, production from 2003 onwards will be allocated to the NCBs, taking into account their launch stock requirements, the capital key and the specific situation of banknote demand in some countries. Second, many of you will be aware that this is the ""Week of Europe"" and that yesterday marked the 51st anniversary of the Declaration of Robert Schuman. In this context, the ECB participated in the European Institutions' open days in Brussels and in Strasbourg, which offered another opportunity for the public to obtain information about the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins. Furthermore, as previously announced, a series of conferences on euro changeover issues is being organised by the NCBs in the framework of the Euro 2002 Information Campaign, in which the members of the Executive Board are actively participating. These conferences aim to bring together the key parties involved in the euro cash changeover process. Two such conferences have been held so far: one on 6 March in Brussels and one on 4 April in Madrid. Two further such conferences will take place next week: on 15 May in Lisbon and on 16 May in Frankfurt. I should also like to remind you that comprehensive information related to the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins can be obtained in all 11 official Community languages from the Euro 2002 Information Campaign website. Finally, the Governing Council has decided that its two meetings outside Frankfurt in 2002 will be held in Maastricht on 7 February to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty on European Union (""Maastricht Treaty"") and in Luxembourg on 4 July."
Thailand,2001-05-24,"Monetary Policy Board's Decision on 24 May 2001 Mr. Thirachai Phuvanat naranubala. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand, as the Secretary of the Monetary Policy Board, announced that the Monetary Policy Board (MPB) met today to determine the monetary stance appropriate to the economic conditions and inflation outlook. The MPB viewed that current Thai economic conditions remained close to the previous projections made in April, although risks from external demand persisted. The positive signs were that economic stimulus packages were introduced in various countries and our trading partners' economic growth should improve in the next period. These stimulus packages included the Federal Reserve's fifth cut in the Fed funds rate since the beginning of this year, the cut in the refinancing rate by the European Central Bank (ECB), and the economic restructuring policies introduced by the new Japanese government. Although inflation rose noticeably in April due to the excise tax hike and the rising oil prices, inflation in the next 8 quarters ahead should remain within the target range of 0-35 per cent. The MPB viewed that if the government could increase its spending for the year 2001 as planned, more funds would be injected into the economy and capacity utilization would improve. The creation of the Thai Asset Management Corporation (TAMC) which would start the loan transfer process in the next few months should facilitate a more efficient function ing of the financial system. The increase in fiscal spending together with the creation of TAMC should soon produce a further economic expansion Since mid-1997, capital outflow reduced foreign debt burden from 112 to 76 billion dollars and decreased yearly foreign debt repayment by one third. This should help the BOT in its overseeing of the baht movement. The MPB thus decided to maintain the 14-day repurchase rate at 15 per cent per annum. close monitoring of the economic conditions would be also maintained."
Israel,2001-05-29,"29 May 2001 Monetary program for June ;2001 The Bank of Israel advises that due to continued employee sanctions and thedesire to prevent a situation in which monetary policy does not respond todevelopments in the economy, it has decided at this stage to reduce the rate of interest for June by 0.2 percentage points, to 7.0 percent. The Bank of Israel states that if it becomes possible to undertake an informed discussion of interest-rate policy for achieving the inflation target, either as a result of the ending of sanctions by the Bank's employees or due the government deciding to empower the Governor of the Bank of Israel to issuecertain employees with confinement orders, it may rediscuss interest-ratepolicy more fully in the course of June. The Bank explains that in order to arrive at a decision regarding the rate of interest for June, various alternatives to the complete information infrastructure required for a soundly based interest-rate decision were examined. As is known, the regular infrastructure is currently lacking due to sanctions by employees which have continued for several months, and whichprevented a decision regarding the rate of interest for May. In the light of the ongoing sanctions and the fact that the government has till now not empowered the Governor to issue confinement orders which would ensure the provision of the Bank of Israel's services to the public, including a decision on the monetary rate of interest, the bank examined various alternatives to the totality of data required. These alternatives includedinflation expectations of investors in the capital market derived from government bonds, and indicators of changes in the output gap. Inflation expectations are measured by the difference between the yield onunindexed fixed-interest bonds and that on indexed fixed-interest bonds. The raw data relating to these expectations currently place expected inflation at between one percent and two percent a year for the next six years, lower than the annual inflation target for the years 2001 and 2002, but within the target of price stability from 2003 onwards. The assessment of inflation expectations from the capital market was in thepast an important basis for decisions as to the rate of interest, but itsimportance declined as other methods of assessment developed, due to the fact that interest-rate decisions based on these expectations suffer from two shortcomings: First, it became apparent that till now assessments derived from the capital market missed the turning points in inflation, both upturns and downturns. Their value in forecasting inflation, an essential aspect of every interest-rate decision, is therefore very limited. A research infrastructure was thus developed in the Bank of Israel for examining the sensitivity of future inflation to the main factors which affect it, such as capital flows and exchange rates, adherence to the budget, and actual GDP growth related to the economy's growth potential (the output gap), all for a period of the next few years. The second drawback of assessments of future inflation derived from the capital market is that it provides no answer to the next question required for a decision on the rate of interest: what is the expected effect of a given change in the rate of interest on future rates of inflation, given the expected changes in all the other variables mentioned above?. To answer this question, too, the Bank of Israel developed special quantitative macroeconomic models. Regarding the output gap, various indicators have suggested that in the last few months it has been a widening; research carried out in the Bank of Israel shows that the effect of this is felt after a lag, and that it can itself cause a slowdown in the rate of inflation. The Bank of Israel emphasizes that reliance on inflation expectations based on the capital market and on partial indicators of the output gap in deciding on the rate of interest is a poor and problematic substitute for basing the decision on the Bank's complete assessment infrastructure. Only very restricted and temporary use may be made of such a method, and only with full and explicit awareness of its inherent limitations. The Bank of Israel goes on to emphasize that neither changes in the rate ofinterest determined according to the inflation target nor the exchange-rateregime, provide the means for offsetting the dampening effects on Israel's economy of factors such as the slowdown in the US, the security situation in Israel, and structural problems of specific industries and development areas. To address this problem there is no alternative to changing the compositionof government expenditure to support growth and focusing on specific areasand issues, while maintaining the downward path of the budget deficit in accordance with the government decision of August 2000. This fiscal policymust be reinforced by structural reforms, the pace of which has recently slowed significantly, also in the social sphere, and by greater transparency, including the submission of a report to the government and the public on the estimated deficit for 2001, using the internationally accepted definitions. The Bank of Israel points out the importance of continued maintenance of the stability which has been achieved in the financial markets as a result ofmonetary policy, among other things. In this context the Bank of Israel notes that the exchange-rate regime, which was created under circumstances no longer applicable and which harbors the potential to cause a financial crisis of inestimable magnitude and could lead to the Bank of Israel's superfluous and distorting intervention in the markets, must be changed.

Peru,2001-06-06,"BANCO CENTRAL DE RESERVA DEL PERU Monetary Program for 2001- Information Note: June 2001 The BCRP reduces its reference interest rate from 11,0 to 10,5 percent and rises the benchmark for monetary operations in 4 percent The revision of the forecast elaborated for the assessment of the Multiannual Macroeconomic Framework of the Ministry of Finance underlines that the target for the annual inflation in 2001 will be within the range announced in the Monetary Program for that year (2,5-3,5 percent). As a consequence, the intermediate target, which indicates an increase in the monetary base of 3,0 to 5,0 percent has been maintained. These previsions consider an increment of real GDP of 1,5 percent (2,5 percent in the Monetary Program) and Nominal GDP of 4,6 percent (6,1 percent in the Monetary Program). It is estimated that the operative target (the average daily balance of the current accounts held by banks at the Central Bank to be taken as benchmark) will be reached. The benchmark announced for the year 2001 is 130-145 million. From January to May, the average balance was 128 million. For the month of June, the Board increased 4 percent the range referred to in the previous paragraph to 125 - 135 million as a daily average. In May, the said balance was 122 million, which fell within the announced range (120  130 million). The Central Bank Board of Directors also established that the following interest and commission rates would be used in domestic-currency Central Bank operations since June 7: For monetary regulation credits in domestic currency, the effective interest rate would be the average of the top-decile interbank interest rates, or 10,5 percent, whichever is highest. This rate implied a reduction with respect to the rate effective since April 6 (11,0 percent). For overnight deposits in domestic currency held by banks at the Central Bank, the effective interest rate will be 4,0 percent. This rate is effective since March For foreign exchange temporary purchase operations (swap operations), the commission will be 0,0171 percent, equivalent to an effective 10,5 percent annual cost. This cost is lower than that effective since April 6 (11,0 percent). The following interest rates will be used in foreign-currency operations: The effective annual rate for monetary regulation credits will be 7,0 percent. This rate implied a reduction with respect to the rate effective since May 4 (7,5 percent), which is consistent with the evolution of the international interest rates along the year. For overnight deposits held by banks at the Central Bank, the rate is equivalent to the average obtained by the Central Bank for similar deposits abroad. If justified by financial conditions, the values mentioned above could be modified in order to ensure the attainment of the objective to preserve monetary stability."
Euroarea,2001-06-07,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here to report on the outcome of today's meetings of the General Council and the Governing Council of the ECB. The Governing Council conducted its regular examination of monetary and economic developments and analysed their implications for the maintenance of price stability in the euro area. On the basis of the information available at today's meeting, the Governing Council concluded that the current level of interest rates remains appropriate to ensure that the euro area economy will be able to maintain price stability in the medium term, and thus decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Let me share with you our assessment of the information provided under the two pillars of the ECB's monetary policy strategy in some more detail. As regards the first pillar. M3 growth has been on a gradual downward trend since spring 2000, driven predominantly by its most liquid components and reflecting the increase in the key ECB interest rates which occurred in the period between November 1999 and October 2000. The three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3, adjusted - as explained in the last Monthly Bulletin - for the effects of holdings by non-residents of the euro area of money market fund shares/units, was 4.6% in the period from February to April 2001. In addition, as was also explained earlier, there are preliminary indications which suggest that holdings by non-residents of the euro area of other negotiable paper included in M3 may have contributed half a percentage point or so to the annual growth of M3 in recent months. The growth rate of loans to the private sector continued to moderate over recent months. As regards the second pillar, inflationary pressures will ease over the medium term, although this is likely - for some months to come - to be overshadowed by short-term increases in inflation that relate mainly to oil prices and the impact of animal diseases on food prices. Primarily as a result of the less favourable external environment, real GDP growth in the euro area is expected in 2001 to come down from the high level reached in 2000, and this should contribute to a dampening of upward pressure on consumer prices. This picture of a moderation in economic growth has been confirmed by recently released euro area survey data for May and by partial evidence from national accounts data of euro area member countries for the first quarter of 2001. When looking beyond this year, the outlook for real GDP growth in the euro area is subject to uncertainty with regard to the global outlook for growth. Expectations are that economic growth will be supported by domestic demand and will remain broadly in line with trend potential growth. This is consistent with the strong economic fundamentals of the euro area, current and planned tax reforms, and favourable financing conditions. Wage moderation will have to play an important role in containing inflationary pressures in the coming years. When looking back, as already indicated in my previous introductory statement, the wage developments seen so far have been satisfactory. Looking forward, there is ongoing concern about the emergence of second-round effects, so that wage developments need to be monitored very closely. In this context, it appears particularly important that wage setters fully understand that current price developments are strongly affected upwards by factors which should only have a temporary impact on the inflation rate. The recent rise in HICP inflation, to around 3% in April 2001, was due mainly to developments in unprocessed food prices, the rebound in oil prices and increases in indirect taxes and administered prices. Moreover, the pass-through of the indirect effects of past rises in oil prices and last year's depreciation of the euro have played a role. All these factors will also show an upward effect in the inflation rate for May However, if no further unfavourable price shocks occur, this upward pressure should soon start to diminish, making it likely that annual HICP inflation will start to fall in the course of this year and be below 2% in 2002. Nevertheless, there is a need to remain vigilant as regards future developments affecting the balance of risks to price stability, although weaker economic growth than that currently expected might reduce inflationary pressures. Close attention needs to be paid to factors which might entail a resurfacing of upward risks to price stability, including, in particular, wage developments, energy prices and recent movements in the exchange rate, which is an important indicator to be taken into account under the second pillar. Let me reiterate our position that we have a strong interest in a strong euro. The current increase in the euro area fiscal deficit ratio, the first deterioration since 1993, is disappointing. Fiscal policy will have to resume the consolidation process and governments should abide by the commitments entered into under the Stability and Growth Pact and to those made in the context of their stability programmes. Progress along the road towards the medium-term objective of achieving budgetary positions ""close to balance or in surplus"" cannot be postponed. Finally, the expansion of the growth potential of the euro area economy is an objective to be pursued with utmost determination. The best contribution monetary policy can make in this regard is to preserve price stability. Ongoing policy efforts to remove structural rigidities in the product and labour markets and to diminish disincentives created by tax, benefit and pension systems as well as to raise investment incentives through deregulation and privatisation are all working in this direction and should be taken as the main challenge for economic policies in the euro area. Let me now give the floor to the Vice-President, who will inform you about some other issues. First, next Thursday (14 June) will be another key date in the countdown to the cash changeover, when 200 days will be left before the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins. To date, already more than 8 billion euro banknotes have been printed. In order to mark next week's key date, the third media kit focusing on the production of the euro banknotes and coins and on the changeover modalities will be released in all 11 official Community languages as part of the Euro 2002 Information Campaign. Let me take this opportunity to emphasise that the Eurosystem is delighted with the positive response that the ""Partnership Programme"" has received. This is a very important communication channel of the Euro 2002 Information Campaign. So far, over 1,000 organisations from the euro area and beyond have been participating as so-called ""Euro-Partners"". By mobilising other significant players in the cash changeover process and assisting them in communicating with their staff, customers and business partners, the Partnership Programme helps to get the right information about the cash changeover to the right places at the right time. Second, at its meeting, the General Council conducted its annual review of developments in public finances in the EU. It also carried out its annual review of the functioning of ERM II. Finally, let me draw your attention to the calendar for meetings of the Governing Council and General Council in 2002. A separate press release listing the dates as well as the related dates for the press conferences is being released this afternoon."
South Korea,2001-06-07,"The real economy has by and large been unable to shake off its subdued tone. Exports and investment have continued to decline considerably, whereas consumption is exhibiting a mild increase. Consumer price rises have maintained a high level, running at more than 5 percent on a year-on-year basis in May for the second successive month under the continued impact of high oil prices, the rises in public service charges and the depreciation of the Korean won, all of which commenced during the second half of last year. There still remains the problem of the structural weakness of the financial markets. However, with ample liquidity, market apprehensions have subsided and corporate fund-raising conditions have continued to improve with the progress in the resolution of the problems surrounding some large corporations. Taking overall account of the evolution of the real and financial sectors, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea today decided to maintain the overnight call rate at around its current level in June. The Monetary Policy Committee noted that monetary policy would be conducted flexibly with consideration of a possible continuation of recent slowdown of the economy, while a careful watch would be kept on the financial and foreign exchange markets at the same time."
Thailand,2001-06-08,"Monetary Policy Committee Meeting on 12 July 2001 Mr. Thirachai Puvanat naranubala. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand announced that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to determine the monetary policy stance appropriate for the economic conditions. The details of the meeting are as follow. 1) The new MPC determined to maintain the existing monetary policy framework by targeting the core inflation below the 35 per cent ceiling. The new MPC also maintain the 14-day repurchase rate as the policy rate used to signal the monetary policy stance appropriate for the long term objective of sustainable economic growth and price stability. 2) However, in the implementation of monetary policy, the MPC agreed with the Bank of Thailand's (BOT) determination to also closely monitor factors contributing to external stability. The MPC was concerned about declining current account surplus, and agreed with the BOT's determination to let the exchange rate move in line with market conditions and fundamentals while avoiding day-to-day excess volatility. 3) The MPC would meet monthly to monitor economic and financial markets internal and external conditions. The MPC would also maintain transparency in its communication with the public through the quarterly publication of the Inflation Report. The next issue of the Report would be that for July 2001. 4) In the assessment of economic conditions, the MPC deemed that the trend of the major trading partners remained weak. However a few positive signs also developed. In the US, the tax cut package proposed by President George W Bush had already been legislated. In Japan, the newly proposed structural economic reform should help recovery in the next period. 5) Considering Thailand's inflation trend, the MPC saw the probability of inflation breaching the target ceiling remained low. In addition, the MPC deemed that the BOT's decision to raise the interest rate on 8 June 2001 had already mitigated the misalignment in the structure of short-term interest rates, and thus decided to maintain the 14-day repurchase rate at the current level of 25 per cent per annum."
South Africa,2001-06-14,"At a meeting on 13 and 14 June 2001 the Monetary Policy Committee analysed international and domestic economic developments in order to evaluate the monetary policy stance. After lengthy deliberations the Committee decided that the repo rate should decline by 100 basis points to 11,0 per cent with effect from 15 June 2001. The Committee believes that this should lead to downward adjustments in the lending rates of banks. This decision was based primarily on the following considerations:. 1.1 The economic performance of the United States of America remains weak with first-quarter growth now estimated at a seasonally adjusted annualised rate of 1,3 per cent, i.e. only marginally higher than the 1,0 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2000. Inventory depletion was higher than expected in the first three months of 2001, though private consumption expenditure is still supporting economic growth. Industrial production, particularly durable goods production, declined in April. This brought the capacity utilisation rate of manufacturing enterprises to its lowest level in more than a decade. The manufacturing sector continued to shed jobs and productivity declined in the first quarter for the first time since 1995. This latter development caused a rise in unit labour costs, which may, if sustained over time, put upward pressure on inflation. 1.2 The Japanese economy appears to be heading for a recession. In the first quarter of 2001, real gross domestic product declined by 0,8 per cent. Lower industrial production figures in April point to an even weaker second quarter. Growth in the euro area is also starting to show some effects arising from developments in the United States, with growth in total production amounting to an annualised rate of 2,2 per cent in the first quarter of 2001. The global economic slowdown further curbed demand for British exports, leading to a decline in the industrial production of the United Kingdom in February and March 2001. Asian and Latin American economies were also adversely affected by the slower world economic growth. Particularly in non-Japan Asia, the downturn has been more marked than originally expected. The IMF World Economic Outlook nevertheless still forecasts world growth of 3,2 per cent for 2001, compared with 4,8 per cent in 2000. 1.3 As a result of the poor short-term outlook for the United States' economy, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) reduced interest rates by a further 50 basis points on 15 May 2001. This has been the fifth cut in interest rates since the beginning of the year, with the benchmark rate moving from 6,50 to 4,00 per cent. The European Central Bank decreased rates by 25 basis points in May 2001. Other countries that have reduced official interest rates since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, include Denmark. Canada. Israel and New Zealand. None of these countries, however, have decreased rates to the same extent as the United States. By contrast, interest rates in Brazil, where the inflation rate is still above the target range, were raised during May. 1.4 Although there are currently no strongly pervasive inflationary trends, higher inflation has been evident in the euro area and some Asian and Latin American countries. The international oil price has moved above the upper end of the OPEC target and, if sustained, could put upward pressure on world inflation. However. OPEC appears to be committed to maintaining oil prices within the target band of US$22 to US$28 per barrel. 2.1 The growth in real gross domestic product in South Africa also slowed down further from an annualised rate of 4 per cent in the third quarter of 2000 to 3 per cent in the fourth quarter and 2 per cent in the first quarter of 2001. At first the lower rate of increase in output could be attributed to a decrease in agricultural production. However, in the first quarter of 2001 output growth slowed down in most sectors, with the exception of financial services and the mining industry. 2.2 The general slowdown in economic activity in the first quarter of 2001 once again proves that the fortunes of the South African economy are inextricably interwoven with the global economy. It is almost inevitable that domestic activity will be influenced by changes in international economic conditions. The current global slowdown led to a decline in South African exports and harmed the goods-producing and the trade sectors of the economy. These developments, in turn, affected most of the tertiary sector activities. 2.3 Aggregate domestic demand increased by 2½ per cent in the first quarter of 2001. Private household spending on durable goods, gross fixed capital formation by the private sector and inventory accumulation by manufacturers and traders increased during the first quarter. 2.4 Households were prepared to incur debt to finance part of their purchases of durable goods, which resulted in some increase in their debt-to-income ratio. At about 56 per cent in the first quarter, this ratio is high but does not seem to have any serious underlying risks. Increases in real private fixed capital formation were reported over the full spectrum of production sectors and were not confined to a few large projects. In addition, businesses added to their stocks of intermediate and finished goods. By contrast, government consumption expenditure at constant prices rose modestly. 2.5 In line with the growth in expenditure, there was some indication towards the end of 2000 that employment was improving. The number of people employed in the formal private non-agricultural sectors of the economy increased during the fourth quarter of 2000. 3.1 The seasonally adjusted and annualised quarter-to-quarter growth in the broadly defined money supply (M3) accelerated from 4,9 per cent in the third quarter of 2000 to 14,7 per cent in the fourth quarter and 19,2 per cent in the first quarter of 2001. The year-on-year growth in M3 also increased sharply from 7,5 per cent in December 2000 to 12,3 per cent in April 2001. This acceleration reflected increases in aggregate domestic demand, but M3 growth outpaced the rate of increase in the narrower aggregates because of a comparatively strong rise in longer-term deposits of the public. 3.2 Growth in total bank credit extension slowed down from an annualised 18,9 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2000 to 2,8 per cent in the first quarter of 2001. The year-on-year growth in bank credit extension, however, remained below 10 per cent in the first four months of 2001. The largest part of this increased demand for credit came from households. 3.3 Public finances were characterised by disciplined spending in the fiscal year ended 31 March 2001. As a result of this, and with national government revenue exceeding earlier expectations, the deficit before borrowing was reduced to a level well below that which had originally been budgeted. The non-financial public-sector borrowing requirement amounted to only 2,2 per cent of gross domestic product in fiscal 2000/01, compared with an average ratio of 4,2 per cent in the preceding five fiscal years. 4.1 Activity in the secondary bond and share market generally remained strong in the first five months of 2001. Bond yields, which move inversely to bond prices, declined from a monthly average of 12,9 per cent in December 2000 to 11,9 per cent in May. Share prices rose by 24 per cent from the most recent low in May 2000 to February 2001. The average monthly level of share prices then declined by 8 per cent until April, before increasing again by 9 per cent to an all-time high in May 2001. 4.2 Money-market conditions remained relatively stable throughout the first five months of 2001, with the liquidity requirement fluctuating between R8 billion and R11,7 billion. Since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, overnight rates have increased by approximately ½ percentage point. By contrast, longer-term money-market rates eased, resulting in a substantial flattening of the money-market yield curve. BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND FOREIGN-EXCHANGE MARKET. 5.1 A small deficit of R0,5 billion was recorded in the overall balance of payments in the first quarter of 2001, which put some downward pressure on the exchange rate of the rand. 5.2 Despite the already noted increase in domestic demand, the surplus on the current account of the balance of payments improved in the first quarter of 2001. After adjustment for seasonal factors and annualised, this surplus increased from R2,5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2000 to R6,9 billion in the first quarter of 2001. This was largely the result of a decline in interest and dividend payments to the rest of the world. The volume of merchandise exports declined in the first quarter of 2001, but export earnings were boosted by a general improvement in export prices following the depreciation of the rand. Simultaneously, higher prices for imported goods dampened the demand for imports, holding back growth in the nominal value of imports. 5.3 The deficit on the external financial account exceeded the surplus on the current account of the balance of payments. This deficit was mainly the result of direct investments made abroad by South African companies wishing to expand their activities in other parts of the world and a rise in foreign assets related to trade finance. Portfolio capital, on a net basis, continued to flow into the country. The net purchases of domestic shares by non-residents amounted to R15,9 billion in the first five months of 2001. This was offset to some extent by net sales of bonds to the value of R3,6 billion over the same period. In May, however, non-resident investors were net buyers of bonds to the amount of R2,8 billion. 5.4 After the exchange rate of the rand had been under considerable pressure during the first four months of 2001, it regained most of its losses in May due in large measure to the restructuring of the De Beers Diamond Corporation which led to a substantial inflow of capital. The trade-weighted value of the rand, which had declined by 3,0 per cent from the end of 2000 to 25 April 2001, was therefore on 14 June 2001 only 0,9 per cent below its level at the end of last year. 6.1 Consumer and production prices clearly indicate that inflation is slowing down. CPIX inflation, targeted to attain an annual average rate of between 3 and 6 per cent in the year 2002, fell from a year-on-year rate of 8,2 per cent in August 2000 to 6,7 per cent in April 2001. Measured from quarter to quarter and at seasonally adjusted and annualised rates. CPIX inflation came down from 8,8 per cent in the second quarter of 2000 to 6,1 per cent in the fourth quarter and remained at that level in the first quarter of 2001. All-goods production price inflation slowed down on a year-on-year basis from 10,0 per cent in December 2000 to 8,1 per cent in April 2001, and on a quarter-to-quarter basis from 11,8 per cent in the first quarter of 2000 to 8,5 per cent in the first quarter of 2001. 6.2 This moderation in price increases was mainly the result of more moderate rises in food and energy prices, which had shown exceptionally large increases in 2000. More fundamentally, the slowdown in inflation was related to the moderate rise in unit labour costs over the past two years. This relieved pressure on price increases in an environment that is now relatively open to foreign competition. Although growth in domestic demand has accelerated noticeably, there is still no sign of excessive aggregate demand. Moreover, the current account of the balance of payments has been in surplus during the past two quarters. The rate of capacity utilisation in manufacturing at about 80 per cent is clearly still well below any level that could put pressure on prices, and the private sector has continued to increase investment over the past five quarters. The recent pace of growth of money supply is, however, somewhat disconcerting. Fortunately, it has still been relatively constrained in cheque and transmission deposits, which are usually held mainly for transaction purposes. 6.3 With continued fiscal and monetary discipline, the target range of inflation in the year 2002 is achievable. This is supported by the projections made using the Reserve Bank's suite of models. However, the latest quarterly survey of inflation expectations by the Bureau of Economic Research of the University of Stellenbosch indicates a slight increase in average inflation expectations for the year 2001 through 2003. The upside risks for inflation remain primarily developments in the international price of oil, the second-round effects of last year's depreciation of the rand and continued increases in administered prices. 6.4 After carefully considering these risks, the Monetary Policy Committee decided that the repo rate should be reduced. Amongst other factors considered by the Committee in reaching this decision were the following changes that have taken place since the beginning of the year:. A clearly discernible declining trend in inflation in line with the projections of the Committee that the average annual rate of increase in CPIX will be in the target range in 2002. A stronger external value of the rand. After the trade-weighted value of the rand had decreased sharply in the first four months of 2001, it started to increase from the end of April to just below the level that it had reached at the end of 2000. Only moderate signs of any pressure on inflation arising from the depreciation of the rand during 2000. A current account of the balance of payments that changed from a deficit in the third quarter of 2000 to two consecutive quarterly surpluses. Greater stability in international oil prices than during 2000. A declining trend in long-term bond yields. Continued moderation in nominal wage increases, no signs of excessive aggregate demand growth and an underutilisation of production capacity were also factors taken into consideration by the Committee."
Israel,2001-06-18,"18 Jun 2001 Adjusment of the Monetary program for June 2001 The Bank of Israel announces a further reduction of 0.2 percentage points in the rate of interest for June 2001 to 6.8 percent, giving a total reduction for the month of 0.4 percentage points. As is generallyknown, the current decision regarding the interest rate was taken following the ending of employee sanctions in the Bank of Israel and the full return to normal working, which enabled a return to discussions of interest-rate policy for the current month, in line with the undertaking given. Next Monday, 25 June, the Bank of Israel will publish its interest-rate decision for July, thus reverting to the decision-making format which had prevailed previously. The Bank of Israel explains that estimates of inflation for the next few years obtained from inflation expectations in the capitalmarket, private forecasters' assessments, and inflation estimates based on macroeconomic models developed in the Bank of Israel are below the target range for 2001,and within the target range for periods of more than one year, so that the reduction is consistent with the achievement of the target for the next few years. The Bank of Israel goes on to emphasize that changes in the rate of interest determined according to the inflation target, and the exchange-rate regime do not provide the means for offsetting the dampening effects on Israel's economy of factors such as the slowdown in the US and the security situation in Israel, nor for solving the structural problems of specific industries and development areas. These difficulties can only be tackled by changing the composition of government expenditure so that it supports growth and focuses on specific areas and issues, while maintaining the downward path of the budget deficit till 2003 in accordance with the government decision of August 2000. This fiscal policy must bereinforced by structural reforms-the pace of which has recently slowed significantly-also in the social sphere, and by greater transparency, including the submission of a report to the government and the public on the estimated deficit for 2001, using the internationally accepted definitions. The Bank of Israel points out the importance of continued maintenance of the stability which has been achieved in the financial markets as a result of monetary policy among other things. In this context the Bank of Israel draws attention to the need to change the exchange-rate regime, which was created under circumstances no longer applicable and which harbors the potential to causea financial crisis of inestimable magnitude and could lead to the Bank of Israel's superfluous and distorting intervention in the markets.

Euroarea,2001-06-21,"Today, the Governing Council met for the third time outside Frankfurt. Therefore, let me first of all thank our host. Governor O'Connell, for inviting us to meet in Dublin and for the generous hospitality offered to us. Our meeting was also attended by Mr. Solbes from the European Commission. As usual, we conducted our regular examination of monetary and economic developments and analysed their implications for the maintenance of price stability in the euro area. The Governing Council decided to keep the ECB key interest rates unchanged. We also exchanged views on the issue of the convergence and divergence of economic developments within the euro area. Let me very briefly report on our regular examination and assessment of the information provided under the two pillars of the ECB's monetary policy strategy. Against the background of available information, the current level of ECB key interest rates remains appropriate to ensure that the euro area economy will be able to maintain price stability in the medium term. As regards the first pillar, no new data on monetary developments have become available since 7 June, so that our previous assessment remains unchanged. Concerning the second pillar, recently published data on real GDP growth in the first quarter of 2001 as well as on industrial production in April 2001 pointed to a moderation of economic activity in the euro area, and the latest information on global economic developments continues to suggest significant uncertainty. In addition, as I already indicated two weeks ago. HICP inflation rose further, to 3.4% in May. Price developments continued to reflect mainly temporary upward pressure from energy and food prices, which was taken into account in our previous decisions. Overall, the latest information did not change our assessment of the outlook for price stability over the medium term. We continue to expect the currently high rates of inflation to remain a transitory phenomenon and, in the absence of further unfavourable price shocks, inflation rates should fall below 2% in 2002. These developments are expected to take place in an environment of weaker economic growth, which should, however, remain broadly in line with trend potential growth of the euro area. We will continue to remain vigilant as regards future developments affecting the balance of risks to price stability, including - in particular - monetary developments, real GDP growth, price setting behaviour and wage developments. At this juncture, at which price developments are affected mainly by transitory factors, it is crucial that the current upward movement of prices does not become more lasting, and it is therefore important that wage moderation is continued. I should like to take the opportunity offered by this special meeting to make a few remarks on what is often referred to as a ""one size fits all"" monetary policy. In this connection. I will address a few issues related to the ongoing discussions about the degree of convergence in the euro area. Itis indeed not surprising that many academics and market analysts devote much of their research to one of the most interesting questions in contemporary economics, namely the conduct of monetary and economic policies in a currency area extending from Finland to Portugal and from Greece to Ireland and encompassing one decision-making body for monetary policy and many more actors for other fields of responsibility. Concerning monetary policy, it is obvious that the Governing Council of the ECB can only pursue one objective - the maintenance of price stability in the euro area as a whole. In doing so, it needs to adopt an area-wide perspective in its assessment of economic conditions and the outlook for price stability. Such an area-wide perspective, of course, applies to all central banks in the world which are responsible for conducting monetary policy. The Governing Council has defined price stability with a focus on the euro area, namely as ""year-on-year increases in the HICP for the euro area of below 2%"". The Governing Council's monetary policy decisions are based on an area-wide analytical framework, its now well-known two-pillar strategy. The first pillar assigns a prominent role to monetary developments in the euro area and the second pillar encompasses a wide range of other economic and financial variables - again exclusively with a euro area-wide perspective. Underpinned by this two-pillar analysis, the Governing Council then arrives at an overall assessment and sets the ECB key interest rates with a view to maintaining price stability for the euro area in the medium term. These are the basics of our approach to conducting the single monetary policy for the euro area as a whole. Evidently, a single monetary policy for a group of 12 countries does not imply the same economic developments in the same year in all countries alike, nor does it imply identical developments in individual regions or sectors within a country. Rather, real GDP growth may differ, and there may be differences in unemployment rates or other important economic variables, i.e. there may be regional differences, as is the case in all large economic and monetary areas of the world. Such differences are unavoidable and have existed, within countries, since way back. In many respects, they reflect differences in the quality and in the success of the economic policies of individual countries comprising the euro area. Successful policies enlarge a country's production potential by means of structural reform, ensure a flexible functioning of the economy to fully exploit this potential and ultimately increase per capita income, enhance employment growth and reduce unemployment. As a consequence, successful countries also achieve sound fiscal positions in combination with diminishing taxation. As we are well aware, there are examples among the euro area countries where such highly positive developments have taken place in the recent past. These examples clearly demonstrate that there is ample room for competition in the field of best practices. The most successful countries will eventually provide a benchmark against which other countries will be measured. However, there are types of divergence that can be a matter of concern. Here I would refer, in particular, to a situation marked by high rates of national inflation as a result of excessive wage increases, an unsustainable expansion of profit margins and/or an expansionary stance in fiscal policy. If such developments were to become entrenched in the economy, this would lead to a loss in competitiveness and, eventually, to a loss in output and employment growth. While there is no way for the single monetary policy to take responsibility for such national developments, just as there is no possibility for national authorities to adjust nominal exchange rates within the euro area after having adopted the single currency, national economic policies must contribute to avoiding a situation which would subsequently require painful adjustment. For this purpose, a wide range of national economic policies is available - such as fiscal adjustment, appropriate wage setting, structural reforms and competition policy. Making use of them is not only in the interest of the euro area, but also to the benefit of the individual country itself. To sum up, a single monetary policy for a group of 12 countries can function smoothly. Looking back over the first two and half years since the start of the single monetary policy, there can be no doubt that macroeconomic developments in the euro area have been very favourable. Divergences within the euro area are likely also to exist in future. For the euro area to function smoothly, however, well-balanced national economic policies should complement the single monetary policy with its primary objective of maintaining price stability in the euro area as a whole."

December. 25 June 2001 Monetary program for July 2001 The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for July 2001, according to which its interest rate will be reduced by 0.3 percentage points, to 6.5 percent The Bank of Israel explains that estimates of inflation for the next few years obtained from inflation expectations in the capitalmarket, private forecasters' assessments, and inflation estimates based on macroeconomic models developed in the Bank of Israel are below the target range for 2001,and within the target range for periods of more than one year, so that the reduction is consistent with the achievement of the target for 2001 and the next few years. As is known, the Bank of Israel's monetary policy strives to achieve the inflation targets, with the intention of continuing to strengthen the financial stability which the economy has demonstrated in the money, capital and foreign currency markets. This stability has been achieved as a result of monetary policy, among other things. Maintaining and cultivating stability is of special importance in the conditions of uncertainty caused by domestic and external forces to which Israel's economy is exposed. The Bank of Israel goes on to emphasize that changes in the rate of interest determined according to the inflation target, and the exchange-rate regime do not provide the means for offsetting the dampening effects on Israel's economy of factors such as the security situation in Israel and the slowdown in the US. The persistence of these developments and the slowdown in economic activity in Israel have widened the output gap, which can itself help slow down the rate of price rises, but as stated above, cutting the rate of interest cannot offset these effects. The Bank of Israel emphasizes that that there is great uncertainty regarding the government's fiscal policy for 2001, and greater transparency is required, including the submission of a report to the government and the public on the estimated deficit for 2001, using the internationally accepted definitions. As far as budget policy for the next few years is concerned, it is vital to maintain the downward path of the budget deficit in accordance with the government decision of August 2000. Total government expenditure must be contained within the preset limits, giving weight to components which encourage growth, and structural reforms, thepace of which has slowed greatly in the recent past, must be renewed. The Bank of Israel notes that since the beginning of 2000 the rate of interest has been reduced by more than 4 percentage points (from 10.7 percent to 6.5 percent), and real interest, i.e. the Bank of Israel interest rate minus inflation expectations derived from the capital market, has also come down, by more than 2.5 percentage points, and is currently below 6 percent. At the same time reallong-term interest, as measured by the yield on government bonds and mortgage interest, has also come down, as has the difference between short-term and long-term real interest. The continuation of the downward trend of real interest depends on the maintenance of an environment of price stability, and this can be achieved only if fiscal discipline is maintained, and the obligation to stick to the reducing deficit targetsand to lower government debt is honored. The Bank adds that the risk premium which international capital markets ascribe to Israel's economy is currently estimated at 0.7 of a percentage point (for half a year) and 1.6 percentage points (for 10 years), a reduction from last month's level. The interest-rate differential between Israel and overseas is currently about 2.5 percentage points, and it has risen slightly in the first half of 2001 from its level in the first half of 2000. Note that the differential has fallen from alevel of about 9 percentage points at the end of 1998 to the 2-3 percent range, while it has had little effect on capital flows as reflected in the share of credit and assets in these aggregates. The Bank of Israel adds that the exchange-rate bandshould be abolished. It was created in circumstances which no longer apply, andits existence is inconsistent with an inflation-target regime. The crawling exchange-rate band contains the potential for causing a financial crisis, the extent of which cannot be predicted and which could lead to unnecessary and distorting Bank of Israel intervention in the markets.

Poland,2001-06-27,"Information on the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council on June 26- 27, 2001 The Monetary Policy Council held its meeting on June 26-27th, 2001. The Council was submitted the materials prepared by the Management Board and departments of the NBP and information and analytical materials prepared by Ministry of Finance, research institutes and commercial banks. On this basis, before starting the decision-making part of the meeting, the Council discussed inflation processes; tendencies in the area of money supply, lending and interest rates; external conditions and the situation in the real sector of the economy and in public finance sector. I. Inflation processes. 1. In May this year, consumer goods and services prices rose by 1.1% as compared to April this year (as compared to 0.7% increase a year before). As a main reason for a considerable increase of prices there should be considered the influence of seasonal factors and single decisions: o fruit prices increase (by 25.8%), o increase of the phone subscription fee by Telekomunikacja Polska S.A. (by 40%), o medications price increase (by 2.8%). These 3 groups, in spite of the fact that they amount in total to only 5.5% of the basket of goods and services used for calculating CPI, they contributed in approximately 80% to the price increase in May. It should be emphasized that the influence of temporary factors ceased and in the 2nd half of May the foodstuffs prices dropped (by 0.4% as compared to the 1st half of the month). The twelve-month consumer price index rose in May this year to the level of 6.9% from 6.6% a month before. 2. In May this year, three base inflation indices calculated at the twelve-month scale lowered: o 15%-cut average to the level of 6.5% (as compared to 6.8% a month before), o inflation after the most variable prices are excluded to 6.5% from 6.8% in April this year, o inflation after the most variable and fuel prices are excluded to 7.0% from 7.2% a month before. The two remaining measures of base inflation calculated at the twelve-month scale rose: o ""net"" inflation to the level of 7.2% (as compared to 7.0% a month before), o inflation after controlled prices are excluded to 7.0% annually (from 6.6% in April this year). Base inflation was more favorable in May this year than a month before when the growth of all indices was noted except for the 15%-cut average that did not change. 3. The sold industrial output prices rose by 0.1% as compared to April this year (by the same amount as in April this year). In May 2000, a similar growth amounted to 0.9%. The twelve-month PPI dropped to the level of 2.5% (as compared to 3.4% in April this year and 7.9% a year before). A clear decrease, and to a very low level, has been noted in case of the producer price index in the industrial processing section (to 0.8% annually from 1.5% a month before and 7.9% in May 2000). The data of May also indicate the termination of impulses increasing prices in the section of production and provision of electric energy, natural gas and water (prices in this section rose in May, as calculated at the monthly scale, by 0.3% as compared to 1.6% in April and 3.5% in March). Moreover, according to the survey among entrepreneurs. PPI will be held at a low level in the nearest months what will create favorable conditions (lack of pressure posed by industrial output prices) for the future formation of CPI. 4. In surveys of inflation expectations of individuals made at the beginning of June this year, despite the increase of the current inflation, the percentage of people expecting that the prices will rise slower than now rose by 5 percentage points and it is the biggest within the last few years. It may reflect the improvement of the way of formulating inflation expectations by individuals. The expected by banking analysts inflation rate in 11-month horizon dropped by 0.3 percentage points (to 5.6%) as compared to a survey made a month before. A small increase, however, was noted in banks´ expectations as far as the amount of CPI in December this year is concerned (to 5.9% from 5.8% in April this year). The price growth noted in May, in the opinion of the Council, does not constitute a threat to the inflation target achievement and it is a temporary development. Moreover, the analysis of base inflation measures, sold industrial output price index and inflation expectations indicates that the signals enhancing favorable outlook for the inflation decrease appeared. II. Money supply, loans, interest rates. 1. In May this year, money supply (M2) increased by 0.6% as compared to April this year (a year before a similar growth amounted to 1.1%). The annual growth pace of money supply decreased to 13.5% (as compared to 14.0% in April this year and 15.2% in May 2000). 2. Favorable for future inflation processes tendencies in deposits and lending growth are being confirmed: o the growth pace of PLN-denominated deposits placed by individuals is maintained at a high level - in May this year the total of PLN-denominated deposits placed by individuals was bigger than in May 2000 by 21.3% (i.e. by PLN 29.4 billion), and as compared to the end of December last year this total amount rose by 8.7% (i.e. by PLN 13.4 billion); o a decrease tendency of lending dynamics started in the second half of last year has been maintained; total amount of extended loans calculated at the twelve-month scale rose by 11.3% (as compared to 12.6% a month before), since December 2000 it increased by PLN 5.0 billion (i.e. only by 2.4%), and only in May dropped by PLN 107 million (i.e. by 0.1%) as compared to the amount as of the end of April this year (as compared to 0.2% growth in April this year and 1.3% growth in May 2000); o the growth pace of lending to individuals dropped (to 22.1% annually from 25% a month before) and to businesses (to 8.3% from 9.4% annually in April this year). In May this year, the favorable for future inflation processes tendencies in the area of monetary developments were enhanced. According to analyses, now there is no threat to the process of lowering inflation that could be posed by monetary factors which are the most dependent on decisions of the Monetary Policy Council. Despite the decrease of loan and deposit interest rates in commercial banks (as a reaction to decisions made this year by the Monetary Policy Council), a high growth pace of PLN-denominated deposits placed by individuals and a decrease tendency of the loan dynamics are maintained. III. External conditions. 1. Since the last meeting, in the opinion of the Council members, signals being the evidence of a change of economic growth outlook in the USA this year, and especially in the euro zone, did not appear. The growth pace of the development of these economies will be definitely slower than last year and smaller than it was earlier forecasted. It is now forecasted that the economic growth pace in the United States will decrease from 5.0% in 2000 to 1.7% and in the countries within the euro zone from 3.4% in 2000 to 2.2% this year (in Germany from 3.0% to 1.8%). 2. According to the actual forecast of petroleum prices, in conditions of a global demand decrease in 2001 the petroleum prices will not rise as compared to 2000 and they will remain at an average level of USD 26.7 per barrel as compared to USD 28.6 in 2000. In the 4th quarter this year - due to a bigger demand (as a result of an accelerated pace of economic growth in the USA and factors of seasonal nature) - the increase of petroleum prices is probable (but they should be below the prices noted in the same period last year). The forecasts of a slower pace of economic growth in the USA and within the euro zone remain effective. Like a month ago, the situation on the world raw materials markets (mainly petroleum) indicates that the risk of a strong inflation impulse coming from external prices at a scale comparable to 1999 and 2000 is small. IV. Supply, demand, situation on labor market and income. 1. Gross domestic product in the 1st quarter this year increased in real terms by 2.3% as compared to the same period of 2000. The domestic demand was lower by 1.4% than in the 1st quarter last year. In the 1st quarter 2001, the individual consumption and gross fixed assets expenditures each rose by 1.5% as compared to the 1st quarter 2000. 2. In May this year, the industrial output (in real terms) rose by 2.9% as compared to April this year, and as compared to May last year it decreased by 1.0%. Within the period January - May this year, the industrial output was bigger by 2.5% than in the same period of 2000. The drop of construction and assembling output deteriorated. In May this year, the construction and assembling output was smaller by 11.9% than in May 2000 (as compared to 10.8% drop in April this year). 3. It is estimated that in May this year the retail sales volume was still smaller than a year before, however this drop was smaller than in the period February - April this year. 4. In May this year, a seasonal drop of unemployment was noted. The unemployment rate decreased to 15.7% from 15.8% a month before. 5. However, the decrease tendency of employment in the enterprise sector has been maintained. As compared to April this year, employment decreased by 0.4% and as compared to May 2000 by 3% (in April the decrease amounted to 0.3% and 2.7% respectively). 6. After a drop of an average salary in real terms in the enterprise sector in April this year (by 1.3% as compared to April 2000), in May the real increase by 1.9% took place. 7. In May this year, an average pension in real terms was smaller by 1.4% than in May 2000. However, due to the started valorization of disability benefits and pensions, since June this year a very big increase of purchasing power of pensions will be noted. The latest data related to the real sector signal a clear drop of demand pressure. This opinion is additionally enhanced by the results of surveys made among entrepreneurs and a probable weakening of the growth pace of exports (as a result of a weaker economic situation of the major trade partners). The situation on labor market reduces the pressure on salaries growth, and by that it decreases the inflation pressure. The uncertain factor is still a probable increase of demand pressure on inflation as a result of payoffs of compensations, reparations and the valorization of disability benefits and pensions despite the extension of these payoffs in a bigger time frame. V. Situation in public finance sector. 1. In May this year, the budget deficit increased by PLN 2 billion. After five months the deficit of the budget amounted to PLN 20.4 billion what constitutes 99.3% of the plan for the year. 2. According to forecasts, in June this year the situation in the area of the budget deficit achievement will be improved (inter alia, due to the payment of the next installment for the third generation cell phone communication license (UMTS) and the earnings by the NBP). 3. The revenues from privatization are still small (PLN 1.9 billion as compared to the planned PLN 18.0 billion for the whole year). After five months the budget deficit planned for the whole year 2001 has been already achieved in 99.3%. A big deficit of public finance sector limits the playing field in the area of monetary policy and it is not favorable for a long-term development of the economy. VI. Decision of the Monetary Policy Council. 1. In the Council´s opinion, the majority of factors affecting inflation have improved: o Three measures of base inflation at the twelve-month scale lowered as compared to April this year. Moreover, two of them were below CPI again. It enables expecting the return of the consumer price index to a decreasing path. o Inflation expectations of both households and banking analysts were favorable what supports the achievement of the monetary policy targets. o Favorable from the point of view of the future inflation, tendencies in the area of monetary developments have been enhanced. Analyses indicate that there is no visible threat to the process of inflation reduction posed by monetary factors. o The situation in the real sector of the economy signals the decrease of the demand pressure. o A clear drop of sold industrial output prices, especially in industrial processing - and to a very low level - indicates the lack of pressure for the increase of consumer price index posed by industrial output prices. 2. At the same time, the threats in the area of public finance, which were signaled many times by the Council, come true. 3. Considering all factors affecting future inflation, and especially the fact that the majority of them got improved, the Council decided to lower the basic interest rates of the NBP by 150 basis points and maintain its neutral position in the area of monetary policy. The Council will treat threats in the area of fiscal policy as a limitation for the future monetary policy that is aimed at the achievement of the mid-term inflation target. The role of this limitation will be as much bigger as the scale of public finance deficit reduction smaller. It should be emphasized that the decisions of Sejm according to which the future expenses of the state would be considerably bigger, threaten in a form of a bigger imbalance in public finance sector in the nearest years. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Council will be held on July 19-20th, 2001."
Euroarea,2001-07-05,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here to report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB, which was also attended by Mr. Reynders. President of the EU Council, and Mr. Solbes from the European Commission. As usual, we conducted our regular examination of monetary and economic developments and analysed their implications for the maintenance of price stability in the euro area. The Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. It considers that the current monetary policy stance remains appropriate and should bring inflation back in line with price stability in the medium term. Maintaining a favourable perspective for price stability is the best contribution monetary policy can make to fostering economic growth over the long run. Let me elaborate somewhat on our assessment of the information provided under the two pillars of the ECB's monetary policy strategy. Regarding the first pillar, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 (adjusted for non-residents' holdings of money market fund shares/units) stood at 4.9% in the period from March to May 2001. As indicated previously, there is some evidence that M3 is currently distorted upwards by holdings of money market paper and short-term debt securities of non-euro area residents. Taking this into account, the three-month moving average of M3 in the period from March to May 2001 was broadly in line with the reference value of 4 1/2%. In addition, over recent months, the annual growth rate of credit to the private sector in the euro area has continued to moderate. Concerning the second pillar, given the circumstances, it seems particularly important to recall the forward-looking nature of our assessment. At the current juncture economic developments appear to be particularly influenced by special factors. HICP inflation is still high at present, mainly reflecting past trends in energy and food prices. However, given the nature of these shocks and taking into account the present monetary policy stance, we expect them to have only a temporary effect on inflation rates. If no further unfavourable shocks occur, it is likely that annual rates of inflation will start to fall and reach rates of below 2% in 2002 - although the decrease from current levels over the months to come may be subject to some volatility. The main risk related to this outlook concerns second-round effects having an impact on wage negotiations this year and early next. As has been said on previous occasions, when looking back, the wage developments seen so far have been satisfactory, while, when looking to the future, there is ongoing concern. As has now been confirmed, overall economic growth in the euro area moderated substantially in early 2001 and both survey and confidence indicators suggest a pattern of continued growth moderation for the second quarter of the year. These developments appear to be related to the less favourable external environment as well as to the weak growth of domestic demand. The latter reflects the adverse effects on income and consumption from past increases in energy and food prices and the slowdown in investment. However, in the course of the year, domestic demand should gradually recover from adverse price effects, given the sound economic fundamentals of the euro area, previous and ongoing tax reforms and favourable financing conditions. Average real GDP growth in the euro area is therefore expected to remain broadly in line with trend potential growth in 2001 and 2002. Overall, our current policy stance should ensure price stability in the medium term. Of course, we shall continue to monitor closely future developments affecting the balance of risks to price stability, including - in particular - monetary developments, real GDP growth, price-setting behaviour and wage developments. As I said earlier, at a point in time when economic developments are being affected by a number of special factors, the Governing Council would like to stress its medium-term and forward-looking perspective. Monetary policy will ensure a stance consistent with price stability over the medium term. Keeping firmly to this commitment has favourable effects on the economy as a whole. Since the start of Monetary Union, monetary policy has been successful in maintaining low inflationary expectations over the medium term. As a consequence, the euro area enjoys low long-term interest rates which are conducive to both economic growth and employment creation. A factor facilitating the maintenance of price stability will be continued wage moderation. Such moderation will help employment growth and thereby foster consumer confidence and domestic demand in the period ahead. In addition, the prospects for non-inflationary economic growth can be significantly enhanced by decisive structural reform. Delays in introducing such reforms on the basis of cyclical considerations would be at the expense of medium-term growth opportunities. A medium-term perspective is also most warranted for the conduct of fiscal policies in the euro area member countries. For all euro area countries, it is of crucial importance to fulfil in a credible manner the commitments made under the Stability and Growth Pact and those laid down in the context of the stability programmes. Let me now give the floor to the Vice-President, who will inform you about some other issues. Let me first refer to the current discussion on the potential impact on prices of the euro cash changeover. In general, price transparency and market competition are likely to limit inflationary pressures from the cash changeover. As regards administered prices, the finance ministers forming the Eurogroup have pledged that ""overall, the conversion into euro of all prices, charges and fees administered by their governments will be price neutral or smoothed in favour of the consumer"". The Governing Council calls on governments at other levels and enterprises to follow this example set by central governments. Moreover, the ECB calls upon the public's vigilance in monitoring prices and price changes, encouraging consumer and other organisations to actively engage in this task. Second. I should like to inform you that the Governing Council has decided that euro area national central banks may frontload euro banknotes to central banks outside the euro area as from 1 December 2001. This measure is aimed at contributing to a smooth cash changeover in 2002. You will find further information relating to this decision in a separate press release to be issued this afternoon. Third, as you are aware, the Governing Council paid particular attention to the specific needs of the blind and partially sighted when agreeing on the design of euro banknotes. To that end, several features have been incorporated into both the banknotes and the coins. In order to further assist visually handicapped citizens in recognising the euro banknotes and coins, and to help them to distinguish between the various denominations, the Governing Council decided to allocate about EUR 1 million to the production of 400,000 specially designed cash-testing devices. These will be made available via the network of the European Blind Union. Finally, the Governing Council has adopted a Decision amending the Decision on the adoption of the Conditions of Employment for Staff of the European Central Bank. This Decision will be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities."
South Korea,2001-07-05,"Industrial production has continued to slow due to stagnant facility investment and the steep decline of exports. Inventories have registered a significant increase. As to the external environment, there still remain uncertainties over world economic recovery, including the United States. Consumer prices have maintained a high rate of increase under the impact of high oil prices, the rises in public service charges and the depreciation of the Korean won, all of which commenced during the second half of last year, as well as the recent drought. Demand-side pressures are, however, weak due to the economic slowdown. Financial market conditions have continued to improve due to ample market liquidity and progress in the resolution of the problems surrounding some debt-ridden large corporations. Nonetheless, there are some underlying factors making for market instability, including concerns over the aggravation of corporate sector profitability stemming from the economic slowdown as well as the weak corporate sector credibility. Taking overall account of the evolution of the real and financial sectors, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea today decided to lower its target for the overnight call rate from 5., 0 percent to 4., 75 percent. Taking into consideration the fact that uncertainties surrounding the internal and external environments remain high, monetary policy will be conducted flexibly, while a careful watch will be kept on the status of price movements, business activity and the financial markets."
Peru,2001-07-05,"Informative Note on the Monetary Program: July 2001 The BCRP reduces its reference interest rate from 10,5 to 10,0 percent and rises the benchmark for monetary operations in 8 percent For the month of July, the Board increased 8 percent the range for its operating target with respect to the previous month to 135 - 145 million as a daily average, in line with a greater volume of transactions recorded in the month of July. In June, the said balance was 130 million, which fell within the announced range (125  135 million). The Central Bank Board of Directors also established that the following interest and commission rates would be used in domestic-currency Central Bank operations since July 6: For monetary regulation credits in domestic currency, the effective interest rate would be the weighted average of the interbank interest rates, or 10,0 percent, whichever is highest. As a consequence, the determination of the financial cost for these credits is modified. Formerly, it considered the maximum between the top-decile of interbank interest rates and the benchmark for monetary operations. This change will allow lower volatility of interbank interest rates in domestic currency, since the Central Bank grants liquidity to the banks asking for these funds according to the average conditions recorded on that day, when there be interest rates rising pressures in that market. It should be noted that this new level (10,0 percent) implies a reduction with respect to the rate effective since June 6 (10,5 percent). For overnight deposits in domestic currency held by banks at the Central Bank, the effective interest rate will be 4,0 percent. This rate is effective since March For foreign exchange temporary purchase operations (swap operations), the commission will be 0,0158 percent, equivalent to an effective 10,0 percent annual cost. This cost is lower than that effective since June 6 (10,5 percent). The following interest rates will be used in foreign-currency operations: The effective annual rate for monetary regulation credits will be 6,5 percent. This rate implied a reduction with respect to the rate effective since June 6 (7,0 percent), which is consistent with the evolution of the international interest rates along the year. For overnight deposits held by banks at the Central Bank, the rate is equivalent to the average obtained by the Central Bank for similar deposits abroad. The Central bank grant monetary regulation credits in domestic and foreign currency on a regular basis. If justified by financial conditions, the values mentioned above could be modified in order to ensure the attainment of the objective to preserve monetary stability."
Chile,2001-07-12,"Santiago. July 12, 2001 Press Release At its monthly monetary policy meeting held today, the Board of the Central Bank decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at its current level of UF plus 3.5% and that liquidity credit lines would also remain unchanged. The Board based its decision on recent economic developments and on the outlook for the next 24 months. The domestic economic situation is esentially the same as last month despite the deterioration of world growth figures and terms of trade. The Board still foresees demand picking up in the second half and inflationary pressures controlled and it will remain attentive to any threat that might deviate inflation from its target within the policy horizon. In recent weeks there has been growing turbulence in emerging economies' financial markets which has had unusual repercussions on the domestic exchange market but the Board considers that these are merely temporary because the Chilean economy is sound. Nevertheless, it will keep a close watch on financial and exchange market developments and will use its policy instruments to achieve its objectives."
Poland,2001-07-20,"Information on the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council on July 19-20, 2001 The Monetary Policy Council held its meeting on July 19-20th, 2001. The Council was submitted the materials prepared by the Management Board and departments of the NBP and information and analytical materials prepared by Ministry of Finance, research institutes and commercial banks. Before starting the decision-making part of the meeting, the Council members discussed the current economic situation, especially considering factors that influence the future inflation processes. I. Inflation processes. 1. In June this year, consumer goods and services prices lowered by 0.1% as compared to May this year. It mainly resulted from the drop of foodstuff prices (by 0.6%), especially seasonal drop of fruit prices (by 9.5%) and the drop of fuel prices (by 0.5%) as compared to the previous month. However, it is worth stressing a slight price rise as compared to May this year in the remaining groups that are included into the CPI basket (the price rise within the range 0.1-0.2%). The twelve-month consumer price index lowered to 6.2% from 6.9% in May this year. 2. In June this year, the base inflation measures looked favorable. All the base inflation indices calculated at the twelve-month scale lowered and amounted from 5.3% to 6.8%. 3. The sold industrial output prices dropped by 0.4% as compared to May this year. The twelve-month PPI lowered to 0.9% from 2.3% in May this year and 8.9% in June 2000. A relatively low level of this index results from the price drop in the industrial processing section by 0.9% annually (as compared to the rise by 0.6% in May this year and by 8.9% in June last year). It should be stressed, however, that the biggest drop of prices was noted in these industrial-processing sections where a considerable growth was noted last year: o in the production of coke, petroleum products and derivatives the prices dropped by 11.7% (as compared to the rise by 48.6% a year before), o in the production of pulp and paper the prices lowered by 4.0% (as compared to the rise by 16.7% in June 2000), o in the production of motor vehicles the prices dropped by 3.2% (as compared to the 2.5%-rise a year before). However, in the industrial sections where the market mechanism is limited, the price dynamics is maintained at a high level: o in the section of production and provision of electric energy, natural gas and water the prices rose by 9.8% annually, o in mining the prices rose by 5.2%. The construction and assembling production prices rose by 0.1% as compared to the previous month and as compared to June last year they rose by 3.9%. 4. The inflation rate expected by the bank analysts at the end of the year actually amounts to 6.0% (as compared to 5.9% a month before), i.e. it is the same as the bottom level of the inflation target. The inertia in making inflation expectations by individuals is getting smaller. Therefore, the earlier forecasts of the Council that the growth of the consumer goods and services prices in the previous two months was a temporary development got confirmed. In June, there was noted a drop of the twelve-month consumer price index, producer price index and all the measures of base inflation. Favorable - for the future inflation - were also inflation expectations. II. Money supply, loans, interest rates.*** 1. In June this year, money supply rose by 0.9% as compared to May this year and it is the lowest indicator for this month within the last six years. The annual growth pace of money supply lowered to 12.3% from 13.5% a month before. 2. Favorable developments in the area of the deposits and lending growth are maintained: o In June this year. PLN-denominated deposits placed by individuals rose by PLN 2.5 billion (i.e. by 1.5%) as compared to May this year (in May, the monthly growth pace amounted to 0.7%). Within 6 months of this year the total of PLN-denominated deposits placed by individuals increased by PLN 15.4 billion (i.e. by 10.0%). The dynamics of PLN-denominated deposits placed by individuals calculated at the 12-month scale amounted to 21.4% (as compared to 21% a month before). o The lending dynamics lowered again; the total amount of granted loans rose by 10.0% as compared to June last year and by 11.3% in May this year. o The twelve-month dynamics of loans dropped both to individuals (to 20.3% from 22.1% a month before) and to businesses (to 7.2% from 8.4% in May this year). 3. Commercial banks quickly reacted to the Monetary Policy Council decision made in June on the cut of the basic interest rates of the NBP by 1.5 percentage point. According to the latest data, the APR for loans and deposits at commercial banks was lowered on average: o in case of deposits by 0.4-1.1 percentage point, o in case of loans to individuals by 1.1 percentage point, o in case of loans to businesses by 1.4-1.6 percentage point. The favorable tendencies for future inflation processes in the area of monetary developments were enhanced. A strong tendency to save by households is maintained. III. External conditions. 1. Within the last month, the forecasts of the economic growth in the euro zone were lowered from 2.2% to 2%. The forecast of the economic growth in Germany was lowered to 1.6% from 1.8% a month before. The uncertainty related to the economic growth outlook in the USA is still maintained. 2. Within a month, there were no additional signals inducing to the verification of forecasts concerning fuel prices on the world markets as compared to the previous month. The current forecasts of external conditions indicate that they do not threaten the achievement of the monetary policy targets. The actual forecasts of growth in the euro zone signal less favorable - than it resulted from the previous forecasts - conditions for the growth of the Polish exports and GDP. IV. Balance of payments, exchange rate. 1. In May this year, the current account deficit based on payments amounted to USD 708 million (as compared to USD 519 million in April this year and USD 405 million in May last year). Within the period January-May 2001, the current account deficit amounted to USD 3.397 million and as compared to the same period last year it decreased by USD 1.378 million. 2. Since November 2000 a gradual appreciation of the zloty took place. Within the period November 2000 - June 2001, the zloty appreciated by 16.4% against the dollar and 14.7% against the euro. Since July 6th this year the reversal of this tendency took place and after several days of considerable fluctuations the exchange rate of the zloty is now at the level 4.20-4.30 for a dollar. 3. The latest developments on the currency market resulted from the mix of external and internal factors: o The external impulse of the depreciation was the situation in Argentina and Turkey that resulted in the drop of investors' confidence to countries included into the so-called emerging markets. o From the group of domestic factors the most important were: unclear situation of the budget, worse than expected data on current account in May and statements of some politicians. o The market participants expected the depreciation of the zloty as the current exchange rate - in their opinion - was overvalued. o The strengthening of the depreciation was also affected by mechanisms typical to financial markets. The speculation of short-term investors resulted in the fast withdrawal of their capital at the moment of problems in Argentina and Turkey. In May, there were visible some signs of exports dynamics weakening and current account balance worsening as a result of the zloty appreciation within the last months and the weakening of the external demand dynamics. However, after five months of the year, the situation in the area of external balance was much better than a year before. Within the last days, there appeared considerable fluctuations of the exchange rate and the depreciation of the zloty that resulted from the joining of external and internal factors. V. Supply, demand, situation on labor market and income. 1. In June this year, the sold industrial output was lower by 4.8% than a year before. After adjusting the difference of business days, the drop of industrial output amounted to approximately 3%. The construction and assembling output was smaller than in June last year by 10.1%. 2. In June, a further drop of employment in the enterprise sector took place. The number of the employed was smaller by 0.3% than in May this year and by 3.3% as compared to June last year. 3. Average wages in the enterprise sector in June this year were higher by 4.9% than in June last year, and in real terms they lowered by 1.2%. Within the period January-June this year, average wages in the enterprise sector as compared to the same period last year rose by 7.3% in nominal terms (the growth in real terms amounted to 0.6%). The information on the situation in the real sector and a low dynamics of sold industrial output confirms the lack of demand pressure on the price growth in the nearest months. VI. Situation in public finance sector. 1. In June this year, due to the payment of the NBP earnings and the payment of the next installment for the third generation cell phone communication license the state budget had a positive balance. As of the end of June this year the level of budget deficit achievement was 91.1% of the amount set forth in the act on the state budget (as compared to 99.3% a month before). 2. The Council of Ministers submitted the Sejm the project of the amendment to the act on the state budget containing the increase of the budget deficit level by maximum PLN 8.6 billion. The Government also forecasts the reduction of budget expenses at the amount of PLN 7.5 billion if the lack of revenues amounts to PLN 17.5 billion. 3. The increase of budget deficit requires an additional issue of treasury securities what will cause pressure on the increase of their profitability. The increase of profitability, in turn, will increase the cost of public debt service and may cause the increase of the market interest rates. The lower revenues from privatization the bigger this pressure. It should be emphasized that the Government decision is a temporary action and does not solve basic problems of public finance. A thorough reform of the state finance is necessary that would reduce the scale of public expenses mainly by the replacement of the wasteful systems of spending (e.g. system of medication refund) with the more reasonable ones in order to enable the public finance balancing in the next years. VII. Decision of the Monetary Policy Council. 1. In June this year, according to the earlier forecasts of the Monetary Policy Council, a drop of CPI took place (up to 6.2% annually from 6.9% a month before). 2. Positive tendencies in the area of factors affecting the future inflation were maintained: o all measures of base inflation decreased, o the producer price index lowered again, o inflation expectations of individuals and bank analysts were favorable, o positive tendencies in the area of monetary developments were enhanced, o the situation in the real sector of the economy indicates a lack of threats to the achievement of inflation target in 2001. 3. At the previous meeting, the Monetary Policy Council forecasted that positive tendencies from the point of view of future inflation processes would be maintained. These forecasts were taken into consideration in making the decision on the interest rates cut by 150 basis points. 4. Threats connected with the situation in public finance sector are maintained. They result from the uncertainty as far as the 2001 budget amendment and the contents of the act on the state budget for 2002 are concerned. Only the firm actions directed towards the public finance improvement (especially the reduction of expenses) will enable the reduction of budget deficit what, in turn, is necessary to enhance macroeconomic bases of the Polish economy development. Considering the above mentioned conditions, the Monetary Policy Council decided to maintain the basic interest rates of the NBP at the current level and its neutral position in the area of monetary policy. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Council will be held on August 21-22nd, 2001. * ***In June last year, there was noted a short-term considerable growth of money supply, loans and deposits due to the sale of the stocks of PKN Orlen and the transfer of funds for the repurchase of bonds made by the state budget to Dom Maklerski Pekao S.A. (brokerage house Pekao S.A.). Due to this reason the annual dynamics of the money supply, loans and deposits are adjusted by the influence of these factors."

November. December. 23 July 2001 The monetary program for July 2001 The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for July 2001, according to which its interest rate will be reduced by 0.2 percentage points, to 6.3 percent. The Bank of Israel explains that estimates of inflation for the next few years obtained from inflation expectations in the capital market, private forecasters' assessments, and inflation estimates based on macroeconomic models developed in the Bank of Israel are within the target range of inflation for 2002, and within the long-term target range. The interest-rate reduction is consistent with the achievement of the target for the next few years and also supports the attainment of the target for 2001. As is known, the Bank of Israel's monetary policy strives to achieve the inflationtargets, the infrastructure essential for sustainable growth and continuing to strengthen the financial stability which the economy has demonstrated in the money, capital and foreign currency markets. This stability has been achieved as a result of monetary policy, among other things. Maintaining and cultivating stability is of special importance in the conditions of uncertainty caused by domestic and external forces to which Israel's economy is exposed. The Bank of Israel goes on to emphasize that changes in the rate of interest determined according to the inflation target cannot provide the means for offsetting the dampening effects on Israel's economy of factors such as the security situation in Israel and the slowdown in the US economy. The persistence of these developments and the slowdown in economic activity in Israel have widened the output gap, which can itself help slow down the rate of price rises. The Bank of Israel emphasizes that there is great uncertainty regarding the government's fiscal policy for 2001, and greater transparency is required, including the submission of a report to the government and the public on the estimated budget deficit for 2001, using the internationally accepted definitions. Total government expenditure must be contained within the preset limits, with preference given to components which encourage growth, and structural reforms, the pace of which has slowed greatly in the recent past, must be renewed. The downward path of the budget deficit for the next few years, in accordance with the government decision of July 2000, must be adhered to. Any increase in the budget deficit or the public debt are likely to halt and even reverse the downward trend of the real rate of interest in the bond market and the rate of interest on mortgages, as the government will need to increase its borrowing. Such fiscal expansion may also undermine the prevailing stability in Israel's markets, against the background of the tremors felt in the financial stability of several other countries. The Bank of Israel notes that since the beginning of 2000 the rate of interest has been reduced by 4.4 percentage points (from 10.7 percent to 6.3 percent), and real interest, i.e. the Bank of Israel interest rate minus inflation expectationsderived from the capital market, has also come down, by about 3.5 percentage points, and is currently about 5 percent, its lowest level in the last two years. The continuationof the downward trend of real interest depends on the maintenance of an environment of price stability, and this can be achieved only if fiscal discipline is maintained, and if the obligation to stick to the reducing deficit targets and to lower the public debt-and the interest payments it entails-is honored. The annual risk premium which international capital markets ascribe to Israel's economy is currently estimated at 0.7 of a percentage point (for half a year) and 1.6 percentage points (for 10 years), the same as last month's levels. The NIS-dollar interest-rate differential is currently about 2.5 percentage points, and it has risen slightly in the first half of 2001 from its level in the second half of 2000. The further narrowing of interest-rate differentials could result in the adjustment of the public's assets and liabilities portfolio and via its effect on the exchange rate could have an impact on the rate of inflation. Note that differentials in expected returns on financial assets are also affected by non-uniform tax rates in different channels, and steps should be taken to bring tax rates into line (without changing total tax collection on financial assets), which will improve the functioning of the financialmarkets.

Chile,2001-07-26,"Santiago. July 26, 2001 Press Release At an extraordinary meeting held today, the Central Bank Board decided that, as from August 9, the monetary policy interest rate will be defined in nominal terms, that is as a percentage in relation to a value in pesos and not in UF as had been the case. The same will apply to rates on credit lines and liquidity deposits. The Board set the nominal annual interest rate at 6.5%, corresponding to the current monetary policy rate of UF plus 3.5%. This value was established on the grounds of a real interest rate target of 3.5% and expected inflation of 3.0%, which is at the center of the inflationary target range. This measure was taken as part of a coherent modernization process of Central Bank policies which to date has included adopting the scheme of inflationary targets as a way of keeping inflation low and stable, within a range of 2% to 4% a year and centering on 3%; allowing the exchange rate to float; eliminating restrictions on capital flows; and gradually offering promissory notes denominated in pesos in financial markets. This modernization process has been possible thanks to ten years of successfully meeting inflationary targets and achieving price stability. More recently, the convergence of headline inflation and underlying inflation towards the center of the inflationary target range and belief in the Central Bank's commitment to keeping inflation within this target range have brought private sector expectations of inflation to a steady 3% a year. It has thus been easier to make the monetary policy rate in UF homologous with the nominal rate announced today. Nominalization of the monetary policy rate in today's context of consistently low inflation contributes to: • reducing the fluctuation of prices and earnings on various financial assets denominated in pesos and of more liquid monetary aggregates; • improving markets that operate with nominal interest rates by making them more transparent and less volatile; • encouraging financial integration into world markets. This measure taken by the Central Bank will not affect the depth and liquidity of markets dealing in medium- and long-term instruments denominated in UF. At its meeting programmed for August 9, the Board will decide the eventual changes in the nominal monetary policy interest rate on the same grounds as used for the indexed policy rate. That is, the inflationary outlook and the progress of other key variables will be considered in order to focus monetary policy on keeping inflation within the target range."
South Africa,2001-07-26,"The Monetary Policy Committee made a detailed analysis of recent economic developments at its meeting on 26 July 2001 to decide on the most appropriate monetary policy stance. After these deliberations the Committee decided that the repo rate should remain unchanged at 11,0 per cent. This decision was based primarily on the following considerations:. 1.1 Oil prices, which had declined in June, continued to drift down in July and have traded around a level of US$24 per barrel in the past week. These developments, in conjunction with weaker international demand, have contributed to reduced pressure on inflation rates in many parts of the world. Headline inflation in the United States fell from a year-on-year rate of 3,6 per cent in May 2001 to 3,0 per cent in June. Similar declines were also recorded in the United Kingdom and the euro area. Japan continued to be characterised by deflation, while inflation rates in developing countries tended downwards. 1.2 The outlook for world economic growth remains bleak. Forecasts of the Federal Reserve System for economic growth in the United States range from 1,25 to 2 per cent for 2001. After nine months of decline, the industrial production of the United States in June 2001 was 3,6 per cent below its level in the preceding year. Indications are that the euro area slowdown has continued into the second quarter of 2001, and in Germany the growth rate is expected to fall below 1 per cent. Japan is still struggling to move out of a recession, and a decrease in the demand for primary products affected the economic growth of emerging-market economies. 1.3 International conditions have been overshadowed recently by events in Argentina and Turkey. Renewed fears that Argentina would default on its external debt and continued problems in the banking sector in Turkey put pressure on emerging-market exchange rates and spreads on foreign currency denominated debt in general. In particular, the currencies of Brazil. Chile. Indonesia and Poland have been affected seriously by the increase in risk aversion and weaker international stock markets. The Brazilian currency, for example, has declined by nearly 27 per cent since the beginning of the year, despite a cumulative increase of 325 basis points in official interest rates. From 3 July 2001 the exchange rate of the rand also depreciated sharply, bringing its value vis-á- vis the US dollar on 26 July down to a level that was 8,1 per cent below the level at the end of 2000. On a trade-weighted basis, however, the rand decreased by a more modest 3½ per cent over the same period. 2.1 Most domestic economic indicators suggest that the slowdown in the growth of real economic activity continued in the second quarter of 2001. The physical output of the manufacturing sector declined in the first five months until May 2001. Wholesale trade at constant prices also declined from the high levels at the end of 2000, while the three-months moving average of retail sales in April 2001 was also 0,5 per cent down from its peak in December 2000. Similarly, total new vehicle sales in the second quarter of 2001 were about 8,8 per cent lower than the peak in the first quarter of 2001. Other indicators, such as electricity generated and the real value of buildings completed, confirm a slowing in economic growth in the second quarter of 2001. In contrast to these developments, the physical volume of mining production increased in the first five months of this year. 2.2 The positive signs of some recovery in private-sector employment during the fourth quarter of 2000 were not sustained in the first quarter of 2001. According to the latest information, the number of workers in the regularly surveyed formal non-agricultural sectors declined by 2,1 per cent from the first quarter of 2000 to the first quarter of 2001. However, it is encouraging to note that the rate of increase in non-agricultural nominal unit labour cost increased at a slower pace in the first quarter of 2001 than in the fourth quarter of last year. In the manufacturing sector, unit labour cost increased by barely 0,5 per cent in the first quarter of 2001. This important component of the inflation process therefore does not pose any threat to an acceleration in inflation. 3.1 The annual growth in the broadly defined money supply (M3) accelerated from 6,5 per cent in November 2000 to 13,5 per cent in May 2001. The narrowly defined money supply aggregates increased at a much slower pace than M3, indicating that the rise in the broad money supply could partly be attributed to an increase in longer-term deposits by the private sector. Such longer-term deposits are in most cases not used to purchase goods and services and may be less of an inflationary threat than shorter-term deposits. 3.2 Bank credit extension to the private sector increased by 10,0 per cent in May 2001 compared with the same month in the preceding year. The growth in instalment sale credit and leasing finance gained momentum in the first five months of 2001, reflecting the firm private households' demand for durable goods. Mortgage advances also accelerated considerably in support of the solid performance of the property market. 3.3 Government expenditure in the first two months of fiscal 2001/02 increased by 14,0 per cent compared with the same period in the preceding year. This high increase was recorded despite the fact that the payment of the bonuses of civil servants for the first three months of the calendar year were not paid in April as had been the case in previous years. The increase in government revenue measured over a twelve-month period amounted to 11,7 per cent in the first two months of fiscal 2001/02, with the result that the cumulative budget deficit in this period resembled its usual seasonal pattern. 4.1 Lively trading conditions prevailed in the bond market during the second quarter of 2001. The value of turnover in the secondary bond market increased by 4,6 per cent from the first quarter of 2001 to the second quarter. Non-resident transactions in the bond market, however, fell over the same period, with the result that they now account for only about 10 per cent of total turnover. 4.2 The long bond yield declined from an average of 12,1 per cent in April 2001 to 11,3 per cent in June 2001. The endorsement of lower inflation expectations by the Reserve Bank when it lowered the repurchase rate by 100 basis points on 15 June 2001 gave further impetus to the decline in bond yields. 4.3 Turnover in the secondary share market remained high in the first six months of 2001, probably related to volatile share-price movements and corporate restructuring. The all-share index of the JSE Securities Exchange increased, on balance, over this period, performing much better than most other stock exchanges. However, from 14 June this index started to decline, affected primarily by the prices of banking, industrial, platinum-mining and information technology shares. 4.4 In the money market, the daily liquidity provided to the market has fluctuated between R9,8 billion and R7,7 billion since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee. These figures reflect the somewhat easier money-market conditions which prevailed in the period from March to May 2001. As could be expected, the reduction in the repo rate resulted in a much steeper money-market yield curve. At first most of the money-market rates declined by only 75 basis points with the reduction in the repo rate, more or less in line with the decline in the prime lending rates. After the prime rate was brought down by a further 25 basis points with effect from 16 July 2001, money-market rates came down further. Currently most of the money-market rates have declined by more than 1 percentage point since the lowering of the repo rate on 15 June 2001. 5.1 Preliminary estimates indicate that South Africa's overall balance of payments improved significantly in the second quarter of 2001. The larger overall surplus was obtained essentially because of a change from a deficit to a surplus on the financial account, while the current account of the balance of payments probably remained in surplus. 5.2 Seasonally adjusted and annualised, the surplus on the trade account increased only marginally from R38,6 billion in the first quarter of 2001 to R39,3 billion in April and May 2001. A moderate contraction in the value of merchandise exports was more than offset by an increase in the value of net gold exports. The value of merchandise exports shrank somewhat over this period in line with the slower growth internationally and a sharp decline in commodity prices, especially in the price of platinum. 5.3 The financial account of the balance of payments is expected to have registered a sizeable surplus in the second quarter of 2001. The net inward movement of foreign capital resulted mainly from the restructuring of the stockholding in the De Beers Diamond Corporation and net portfolio inflows into the country. The national government borrowed €500 million on the international capital market in April 2001 and ¥30 billion in June 2001. In addition, non-residents remained net purchasers of domestic shares in the second quarter of 2001. These net purchases to the value of R7,2 billion were to some extent offset, as in previous quarters, by the net sales of bonds by non-residents amounting to R2,1 billion. This brought the net purchases of shares and bonds to R5,1 billion. 5.4 These capital inflows made it possible for the Reserve Bank to reduce its net oversold open position in foreign exchange from US$9,4 billion at the end of March 2001 to US$5,3 billion on 30 June 2001. On 18 July 2001, the net open position in foreign exchange declined further to US$4,8 billion when the Reserve Bank purchased the proceeds of government's recent Samurai bond issue of ¥60 billion. 6.1 Recently released consumer and production price statistics indicate that inflationary pressures have abated further in South Africa. The twelve-month rate of increase in the consumer price index for metropolitan and other urban areas excluding mortgage cost (CPIX), which is used as the benchmark for inflation targeting, has continued to decline from 8,2 per cent in August 2000 to 6,4 per cent in June 2001. To a large extent this decline has been due to lower rates of increase in the prices of food and oil products. From February 2001 the prices of consumer services also slowed down from a year-on-year rate of 8,9 per cent to 6,7 per cent in June 2001. Measured from quarter to quarter and adjusted for seasonal influences, the rate of increase in CPIX slowed down from 6,1 per cent in the first quarter of 2001 to 3,8 per cent in the second quarter. 6.2 The rate of increase over twelve months in the all-goods production price index declined from 10,0 per cent in December 2000 to 8,6 per cent in June 2001. This decline in the growth of production prices was to a large extent the result of a slowdown in the rate of increase in the prices of imported goods from 15,0 per cent in December 2000 to 10,0 per cent in June 2001. Lower international oil prices and an appreciation of the rand during May and June, together with low inflation levels in trading-partner countries, contributed to the moderation of import prices. The rate of increase in the prices of domestically produced goods also slowed down further in the first half of 2001. The quarter-to-quarter seasonally adjusted and annualised rate of increase in production prices amounted to 6,7 per cent in the second quarter of 2001, compared with 8,5 per cent in the first quarter of the year. 6.3 Most of the recent developments, with the notable exception of the depreciation of the rand during July, point to a further decline in domestic inflation. Moderate credit growth, strong productivity growth, low rates of increase in nominal unit labour cost, a surplus on the current account of the balance of payments, a decline in international oil prices and continued fiscal and monetary prudence, are all factors favourable to the containment of inflation. It is, however, important that the secondary effects of the depreciation in the external value of the rand are carefully monitored. A further cause for concern is the fact that administered prices have been rising faster than average consumer prices over the past two years. With continued monetary and fiscal discipline, the projections of the Reserve Bank nevertheless show that the average annual rate of increase in CPIX should fall within the target range of 6 to 3 per cent in 2002."
Peru,2001-08-02,"Informative Note on the Monetary Program: August 2001 The BCRP reduces its reference interest rate in domestic currency from 10,0 to 9,0 percent and from 6,5 to 6,0 in foreign currency, as well as the benchmark for monetary operations to a 130  140 million range. For the month of August, the Board approved a range of 130 - 140 million on a daily average for its operating target, lower than the July range (135  145 million), in line with the lower demand for current account balances observed in July as a consequence of the flexibility in the conditions of the monetary regulation credits of the Central Bank. For this reason, the current account balance in July was 129 million, which fell below the announced range. The Central Bank Board of Directors also established that the following interest and commission rates would be used in domestic-currency Central Bank operations since August 3: For monetary regulation credits in domestic currency, the effective interest rate would be the weighted average of the interbank interest rate, or 9,0 percent, whichever is highest. It should be noted that the new level of the reference interest rate for monetary regulation credits implied a reduction for the third consecutive month. Since July 6, this rate was 10,0 percent. For overnight deposits in domestic currency held by banks at the Central Bank, the effective interest rate will be 4,0 percent. This rate is effective since March For foreign exchange temporary purchase operations (swap operations), the commission will be 0,0138 percent per day, equivalent to an effective 9,0 percent annual cost. This cost is lower than that effective since July 6 (10,0 percent). The following interest rates will be used in foreign-currency operations: The effective annual rate for monetary regulation credits will be 6,0 percent. This rate implied a reduction with respect to the rate effective since July 6 (6,5 percent). For overnight deposits held by banks at the Central Bank, the rate is equivalent to the average obtained by the Central Bank for similar deposits abroad. The Central bank grants monetary regulation credits in domestic and foreign currency on a regular basis. If justified by financial conditions, the values mentioned above could be modified in order to ensure the attainment of the objective to preserve monetary stability. Attached to this informative note is a summary chart on the monetary policy decisions in the last 6 months."
Chile,2001-08-09,"Santiago. August 9, 2001 Press Release At its monthly monetary policy meeting held today, the Board of the Central Bank decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at an annual 6.5% and that liquidity credit lines would also remain unchanged at the levels announced on July 26. This nominal rate represents the same monetary policy rate as previously expressed as UF plus 3.5%. The inflationary outlook is still within the target range. There is a slight improvement in output growth in this second half compared to the first half and external accounts are sound, despite the fact that terms of trade have worsened over the past few months due to the slower-than-expected world economic growth and a less optimistic medium-term outlook. Chile's exchange market continues under pressure from the persistent financial turbulence in some Latin American countries, although the depreciation of the peso is also partly due to world economic deterioration and to our own stubbornly slow domestic demand. The Central Bank will continue attentive to financial and exchange market developments and to other macroeconomic variables in order to respond with a flexible use of policy instruments to avoid any threat to achieving the inflationary target."
South Korea,2001-08-09,"Industrial production has continued to contract, most notably in the IT industry including semi-conductors. The decline of exports has deepened and facility investment has maintained a downward trend. There is concern that the economic slowdown may be more serious than had been anticipated due to a worsening of the economy worldwide including the United States. Although there remain unfavorable factors present such as rises in real estate prices, the rate of increase of consumer prices fell a little in July. It is anticipated that price rises will be gradually blunted. In the financial markets, the fund-raising conditions of the corporate sector have continued to improve. Market interest rates, as well as bank lending and deposit rates, have declined considerably since the reduction of the target level for the overnight call rate in July. Corporate bonds and commercial paper have both maintained a net-issuance position. The uncertainties surrounding the restructuring of some debt- ridden large corporations and concerns over the worsening of corporate sector profitability, however, remain as factors making for financial market instability. Taking this situation of the real and financial sectors into account as well as price movements, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea today decided to lower the overnight call rate target from 4., 75 percent to 4., 5 percent. In a related decision, the lending rate on Liquidity Adjustment Loans will be reduced from 4., 5 percent to 4., 25 percent. In order for the reduction in the overnight call rate to translate into an economic recovery, more aggressive fiscal measures should be taken in response to the economic slowdown. It is similarly essential to carry out corporate restructuring in a resolute manner, as this would serve to dispel the uncertainties surrounding the economy."
Poland,2001-08-22,"Information on the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council on August 21- 22nd, 2001 The Monetary Policy Council held its meeting on August 21-22nd, 2001. The Council was submitted the materials prepared by the Management Board and departments of the NBP and information and analytical materials prepared by the Ministry of Finance, research institutes and commercial banks. On this basis, before starting the decision-making part of the meeting, the Council discussed inflation processes; tendencies in the area of money supply, lending and interest rates; external conditions and the situation in the balance of payments, real sector of the economy and in public finance sector. I. Inflation processes. 1. In July this year, consumer goods and services prices lowered by 0.3% as compared to June this year. It mainly resulted from: o Seasonal drop of foodstuff prices (by 2.6%), especially prices of vegetables (by 24.6%) and fruit (by 9.3%), o And drop of fuel prices (by 1.7%) connected with a favorable situation on the world fuel markets. The drop of prices in July this year - combined with the fact that in July last year instead of the seasonal drop the prices rose by 0.7% as compared to June - resulted in the decrease of the twelve-month consumer price index to 5.2% from 6.2% a month before. 2. All base inflation measures calculated on the twelve-month scale dropped: o 15%-cut average from 6.0% to 5.5%; o inflation after the controlled prices are excluded from 6.6% to 5.2%; o inflation after the most variable prices are excluded from 5.3% to 4.5%; o inflation after the most variable and fuel prices are excluded from 6.2% to 5.4%; o net inflation from 6.8% to 6.7%. 3. The sold industrial output prices rose in July this year by 0.1% as compared to June (a month before they dropped by 0.4%). The prices in industrial processing section lowered by 0.3% and the price increase was noted in the section of production and provision of electric energy, natural gas and water by 2.6% and in mining - by 0.6% as compared to June this year. The twelve-month producer price index amounted to 0.4% (0.9% in June and 2.3% in May this year and 9.0% in July 2000). In industrial processing section prices dropped by 1.7% as compared to July 2000, but the prices of production and provision of electric energy, natural gas and water increased by 11.6%. The construction and assembling production prices rose by 0.3% as compared to June (as compared to the rise by 0.1% a month before) and as compared to July last year they rose by 3.8% (a year before the price increase amounted to 8.9% annually). 4. The inflation rate expected by bank analysts for December 2001 lowered and currently amounts to 5.9% (as compared to 6.0% a month before). However, inflation expectations of bank analysts in the 11-month horizon slightly increased (from 5.6% to 5.7%). The drop of the current inflation rate that was known to the surveyed at the moment of the survey caused a decrease of the inflation rate in the 12-month horizon expected by individuals. At the same time, the structure of answers to some questions of the survey worsened. In July this year, according to the forecasts, consumer goods and services prices lowered as compared to June. It mainly resulted from a typical for that month drop of foodstuff prices and the drop of fuel prices that was connected with a favorable situation on the world fuel markets. Together with the fact that in July last year - instead of a seasonal drop - the prices rose as compared to June, this resulted in a considerable decrease of the twelve-month consumer price index. All the measures of base inflation calculated on the twelve-month scale decreased as well. The producer price index decreased again and it is at a very low level what favorably affects the prospects for the prices of consumer goods and services. II. Money supply, loans, interest rates. 1. In July this year, as compared to June the total money supply (M2) rose by 2.2% (PLN 6.8 billion). A big part of the money supply growth was related to the depreciation of the zloty. The twelve-month nominal growth of total money supply amounted to 13.4%. 2. Favorable developments in the area of deposit growth are maintained. In July this year. PLN-denominated deposits placed by individuals rose by PLN 2.1 billion (i.e. 1.3%) as compared to June this year. Since December 2000 the total PLN-denominated deposits placed by individuals increased by PLN 17.2 billion (i.e. 3. In July this year, the amount of loans to individuals and businesses increased by PLN 4.9 billion (2.3%). An essential reason for the growth of this category was the increase of the value in zlotys of foreign currency loans that resulted from the depreciation of the exchange rate of the zloty. The increase of total loans as compared to July last year amounted to 11.5%. The favorable tendencies for future inflation in the area of monetary developments are maintained. Households still indicate a strong tendency to save and the growth pace of money supply is under control. In July this year, a considerable growth of loans to individuals and businesses took place, however, an essential reason was the increase of the value in zlotys of foreign currency loans that resulted from the depreciation of the zloty. III. External conditions. 1. There appear clear signs of the economic slowdown in the euro zone. They are especially visible in Germany where July was the seventh month of the unemployment growth. According to the latest forecasts, the economic growth in Germany will slightly exceed 1% as compared to 3% a year before. 2. The uncertainty related to the American economy outlook increased. In June and July this year, the retail sales in the United States lowered as compared to the same period a year before. The slowdown in the manufacturing sector starts to spread over other sectors. 3. In July this year, petroleum prices dropped on the world markets. Now, they are at the level of approximately USD 25 per barrel. The petroleum producers that are the members of OPEC announce that since September the petroleum production will be decreased by 1 million barrels per day. However, it should not result in a considerable increase of prices for this raw material due to the decreasing demand. This year, the external conditions are favorable for the inflation lowering. The situation on the world markets of petroleum this year is favorable and the risk of the inflation impulse coming from the fuel market is small. The forecasts indicate that the economic growth in the world will be clearly slower than last year and than it was expected what may adversely affect Polish exports. IV. Balance of payments, exchange rate. 1. In June this year, the current account deficit based on payments amounted to USD 952 million (as compared to USD 734 million in May this year and USD 836 million in June last year). It should be emphasized that a big current account deficit in June this year mainly resulted from a considerable income deficit (USD 407 million). In June this year, exports amounted to USD 2,553 million (as compared to USD 2,473 million in May this year and USD 2,397 million in June 2000), and imports amounted to USD 3,410 million (USD 3,638 million in May this year and USD 3,439 million in June 2000). The trade deficit amounted to USD 857 million and was lower than in May this year (USD 1,165 million) and lower than in June 2000 (USD 1,042 million). In the first six months this year, the current account deficit amounted to USD 4,376 million and as compared to the same period last year it decreased by USD 1,235 million. 2. In July this year, the exchange rate of the zloty depreciated. The average rate against the dollar amounted to PLN 4.19 (PLN 3.97 in June) and against the euro PLN 3.6 (PLN 3.39 in June). The information on problems with the project of the budget for 2002 triggered the further depreciation of the zloty. The exchange rate of the Polish currency is actually at the level PLN 4.25 - 4.3 for a dollar and PLN 3.9 for a euro. In June this year, the current account deficit increased. The main reason for this was a considerable income deficit. The trade deficit in June this year was lower than in May this year and lower than in June 2000. It was a result of the bigger export and smaller import. The information on problems with the project of the budget for 2002 triggered the further depreciation of the Polish currency in August. The insofar depreciation of the zloty should not significantly affect the inflation processes. V. Supply, demand, situation on labor market and income. 1. In July this year, the sold industrial output was bigger by 1.1% than a year before (in June this year it dropped by 4.8%). After adjusting the difference of business days, the industrial output in July this year was at the level similar to the one in July 2000. The construction and assembling output was lower by 10.4% than a year before (in June this year the drop amounted to 10.0%). 2. The retail sales in nominal terms, in July this year, were bigger by 1.5% than a year before. In real terms they were at the level similar to the one in July last year. 3. Employment in the enterprise sector in July this year lowered by 0.5% as compared to June this year and it was lower by 3.5% than a year before. 4. The unemployment rate increased to 15.9%. The number of the registered unemployed increased by 22.3 thousand, while a year before the increase of the number of the unemployed amounted to 40.2 thousand. 5. Average wages in the enterprise sector increased by 2.3% as compared to June. As compared to July 2000, they increased in nominal terms by 8.0% and in real terms it increased by 2.9%. Within the period January-July 2001, average wages in the enterprise sector increased by 7.5% as compared to the same period last year (the growth in real terms amounted to 0.9%). 6. In June this year, the valorization of pensions and disability benefits was performed. As a result of the valorization, the average pension and disability benefit in nominal terms was bigger by 14.5% than a year before and its purchasing power increased by 8.1%. The situation in the real sector of the economy indicates a small threat of a considerable inflation impulse in the nearest period. However, there can be expected an increase of demand as a result of a considerable increase of the purchasing power of pensions and disability benefits and the payoffs of compensations and reparations. As compared to June this year, the industrial enterprises' evaluations of the future demand and production got improved and trade enterprises reported a considerable decrease of sales reductions. VI. Situation in public finance sector. 1. In July this year, the budget deficit increased by PLN 672 million up to PLN 19.4 billion (94.3% of the plan for this year before the amendment to the act on the state budget). The Sejm approved the amendment to the act on the state budget, increasing the deficit by PLN 8.6 billion (up to PLN 29.1 billion). 2. The uncertainty concerning the revenues from privatization is maintained. Within the period January-July, they amounted to only PLN 2.1 billion what constitutes 11.8% of the planned PLN 18 billion. The economic deficit this year is supposed to amount to approximately 4% of GDP. Therefore, it will be considerably higher than it was originally planned and higher than last year. VII. Decision of the Monetary Policy Council. 1. In July this year, the favorable for inflation lowering tendencies were enhanced and forecasts were confirmed: o Consumer goods and services prices lowered as compared to June this year - what combined with the fact that in July last year instead of a seasonal drop the prices rose - resulted in a significant lowering of the twelve-month consumer price index. o All measures of base inflation decreased. o A lower growth of sold industrial output prices and the situation in the real sector of the economy indicate a small threat of a considerable inflation impulse in the nearest period. There can be expected, however, an increase of demand as a result of a considerable increase of purchasing power of pensions and disability benefits and payoffs of compensations and reparations. As compared to June this year, the industrial enterprises´ evaluations of future demand and production got improved and trade enterprises reported a considerable decrease of sales reductions. o The situation in the external circumstances of the Polish economy this year supports the inflation lowering and the risk of an inflation impulse coming from the fuel market is small. o A strong tendency to save by households is maintained. 2. The main source of uncertainty is the situation in public finance sector connected with the budget for 2002. This uncertainty was partially decreased by the decision of the Council of Ministers that the state budget deficit in 2002 will not exceed PLN 40 billion and by considering this amount as the deficit border level by the representatives of the opposition. However, only a fast introduction of a pack of structural changes in the economy and public finance will enable the accomplishment of these declarations. In the Council's opinion, changes in public finance should be based, first of all, on the rationalization of expenses and not the increasing of a tax burden. According to the Council, a clearly lower level of the state budget deficit would be more favorable for the macroeconomic stability and the development of the economy. The Monetary Policy Council states that the assumptions to the budget for 2002 presented by the Ministry of Finance in a generally appropriate way present the scale of threats in the public finance sector and define the directions of the necessary actions for their improvement. In opinion of the Monetary Policy Council, after considering the uncertainty connected with the budget, the situation in the real sector of the economy and favorable tendencies in the area of monetary factors set the conditions for the interest rates cut. In this connection, the Council decided to lower the basic interest rates of the NBP by 1 percentage point and maintain its neutral position in monetary policy. VIII. Setting the short-term inflation target for 2002 at the level 5% (with tolerance limits +/- 1%). The Monetary Policy Council will tend to achieve in 2002 the inflation target at 5%- consumer goods and services price growth as compared to the end of 2001. The tolerance limits for the inflation deviation from the target set by the Council amount to +/- 1 percentage point. The inflation target for 2002 has been set as a punctual target with defined tolerance limits. The change of the way to set the target is a result of the view that when the inflation level gets lower, it gets more important to set explicitly the inflation level that the Monetary Policy Council intends to achieve. The definition of tolerance limits applied at the punctual target setting results from the existing inevitable uncertainty related to the conditions for the inflation target achievement that are independent from monetary policy. The inflation target set for 2002 is coherent with the mid-term monetary policy target set at the level below 4% until the end of 2003. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Council will be held on September 25-26th, 2001."

September. October. November. December. 27 August 2001 Monetary program for September 2001 The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for September 2001, according to which its interest rate will remain atits present level of 6.3 percent. The Bank of Israel explains that estimates of inflation for the next few years obtained from inflation expectations in the capital market, private forecasters' assessments, and inflation estimates based on macroeconomic models developed in the Bank of Israel are currently within the target range for 2001, at the upper limit of the target range for 2002, and at the upper limit of the long-term target range. Thus, the absence of change is consistent with the achievement of the target for 2001 and the next few years. As is known, the Bank of Israel's monetary policy strivesto attain the inflation targets set by the government, as the essential basis of sustainable growth and in order to continue strengthening the financial stability which the economy has demonstrated in the money, capital and foreign currency markets. This stability has been achieved as a result of monetary policy and fiscal restraint, among other things. Maintaining and cultivating stability is of special importance in the conditions of uncertainty caused by the domestic and external forces to which Israel's economy has been exposed in the last year. The Bank of Israel notes that there is no direct connection between the decision regarding the interest rate for September 2001 and the proposal to increase the budget deficit in 2002. As is known, the decisions regarding the interest rate are intended to preserve price stability, and it is too early to tell to what extent, and when, next year's budget deficit will affect inflation. However, the proposal should be viewed in the light of the marked and rapid real growth-double than that originally planned-in government expenditure, and the significant departure from thedeficit target in 2001. This has two consequences which could have a weakening effect onthe economy: First, the increase in the government's interest expenses, not only because of the more rapid rise in the government's debt but also because the long-term interest-rate trend- which tended downwards in the first half of the year but has stopped in the last two months-has been checked and there are apprehensionsthat it will rise once again because of the need to borrow caused by the growing deficit. A rise in the price of capital, if this occurs, will not stop at the government's doorstep. The interest rate on government bonds is the benchmark for all long-term interest rates in Israel, including that on mortgages. Second, in the context of the budget proposal for 2002, the implementation of the budget in 2001, which has departed from its plannedlevel, does not appear to be a one-off event, and could create the impression that fiscal discipline is relaxing. If this impression becomes entrenched this will affect the cost of thecapital which the government and the private sector borrow abroad, as well as the foreign-exchange market in Israel, financial stability, and inflation expectations. Thus, additional measures are required that will afford credibility to the government's decision regarding a return to the downward path of the deficit and the government debt in 2003 and the following years. The Bank of Israel adds that since the beginning of 2000 the rate of interest has been reduced by 4.4 percentage points (from 10.7 percentto 6.3 percent), and real short-term interest, i.e. the Bank of Israel's interest rate <i>minus inflation expectations derived from the capital market, has come down even more rapidly, bymore than 5.1 percentage points, and is currently 3.5 percent, its lowest level for three years. On the other hand, the decline in long-term interest, as measured by the yield on government bonds, has been checked, and has even risen slightly, to 4.5 percent. This was in part the result of the increase in capital raised by the government in the last few months dueto the need to finance this year's expansion in the budget deficit. The Bank of Israel points out that the decline in interest rates since January 2000 could contribute to moderating the economic slowdown thathas characterized Israel in the last year. However, it should be stressed that interest-rate changes cannot offset the main causes of the economic slowdown, chief among them the cumulative influence of security incidents and the global slump, especially in the US, and particularly in the high-tech industry. The Bank adds that the risk premium which international capital markets ascribe to Israel's economy is currently estimated at 0.7 of a percentage point (for half a year) and 1.6 percentage points (for 10 years), similar to last month's level. The interest-rate differential against the dollar is currently about 2.8 percentage points, compared with 5.2 percent in January 2000 and 2.0 percent in January 2001. Note that the risk premium is characterized by volatility which is sometimes caused by factors related to Israel's economy, and sometimes by global events. ** The Open Market Committee of the US Federal Reserve is set to convene on October 2 nd for its regular review of interest-rate policy. The current Federal Reserve rate of interest, prior to the review, is 4.0 percent.

Thailand,2001-08-29,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 29 August 2001 Mr. Thirachai Puvanat naranubala. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand announced that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to determine the monetary policy stance appropriate to the recent development in economic conditions. In this meeting, the MPC assessed that the slowdown in Thailand's trading partner economies, particularly the US and the regional countries, would be more prolonged than previously expected. The Thai export performance is thus unlikely to recover quickly, restraining economic growth. However the government's fiscal stimulus measures should lessen the impact of such pressure on the economy. Contingent on the continuous fiscal impetus to stimulate domestic demand, the Thai economy has a high probability to grow between 15-20 per cent this year. Price pressure remained minimal, and core inflation was expected to remain below 20 per cent in 2001 and within the target range for the next 8 quarters. In the light of all the factors, the MPC considered the current low levels of interest rates sufficient to support the economic recovery. Therefore the MPC decided to maintain the 14-day repurchase rate at 25 per cent per annum. Bank of Thailand 29 August 2001."
Euroarea,2001-08-30,"Ladies and gentlemen. I am here to report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB, which was also attended by Mr. Reynders. President of the EU Council, and Mr. Solbes from the European Commission. Following its regular examination of monetary and economic developments and analysis of their implications for the maintenance of price stability in the euro area, the Governing Council decided to lower the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. The Governing Council considers that the available evidence points to an improvement in the outlook for price developments. This is particularly apparent from the information under the second pillar of the ECB's monetary policy strategy, while that related to the first pillar remains consistent with a favourable outlook for price stability in the medium term. Let me elaborate somewhat on the assessment provided under the two pillars of the monetary policy strategy of the ECB. With regard to the first pillar, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 was 5.9% in the period from May to July 2001. However, this figure needs to be corrected for holdings of money market paper and short-term debt securities by non-residents of the euro area, which, according to preliminary estimates, have contributed around three-quarters of a percentage point to annual M3 growth. The increase in the rate of growth of M3 over the past few months must be interpreted carefully. It reflects the relatively flat yield curve and the recent weakness in stock markets, both of which made the holding of short-term deposits and marketable paper included in M3 attractive. As it also reflects the fact that consumers needed a higher level of transaction balances to finance the past rise in energy and food prices, recent increases in M3 growth may be transitory and, hence, do not necessarily have implications for price stability in the medium term. In addition, the annual rate of growth of loans to the private sector, although still high, has continued to decline over recent months. Regarding the second pillar, there are clear signals of lower inflationary pressures from the demand side. Recent data on economic activity indicate that real GDP growth in 2001 will most likely be lower than was expected a few months ago. This is due in part to external demand, which has remained weak and below expectations, owing to slow growth in economic activity in the United States and persistent economic weakness in Japan, which have spilled over to other regions of the world. In addition, consumption growth in the euro area has been dampened by losses in real disposable income related to past increases in consumer prices. This notwithstanding, over time, the expected decline in consumer price inflation, to which the strengthening of the exchange rate has contributed, should support the growth of domestic demand. Further positive effects on euro area economic growth should stem from the full impact of tax reductions in several euro area countries and from the fact that financing conditions in the euro area are favourable. A concern with regard to the outlook for price stability in the coming years has been the possible emergence of second-round effects, via wages, of past increases in consumer price inflation. The information available shows that wage moderation prevailed in the first quarter of 2001. It is essential that this trend continues and, at the current juncture, two factors support the view that this should indeed be the case. First, the slowdown in economic activity which I just mentioned may contribute to containing inflationary pressure stemming from the labour market. Second, there are encouraging signs, such as those coming from data on consumer and producer prices, which confirm that the increase in consumer price inflation was temporary and that, in the absence of further unfavourable shocks, it is likely that price stability will be restored in the not too distant future. The downward movement in import prices which has gradually been taking place over the past few months should support this process. The falling trend in consumer price inflation will contribute to containing inflation expectations of economic agents, thereby influencing price and wage-setting behaviour. This view is confirmed by bond yields, which indicate that financial markets expect inflation developments to be well in line with price stability in the medium term. Overall, as several indicators are pointing to an abatement of inflationary pressures, the new level of interest rates is compatible with the maintenance of price stability over the medium term, which, in turn, is essential to create a favourable environment for sustainable economic growth. At this juncture. I should like to express concern about the impact that slower growth may have on the determination of the governments of some countries to adhere strictly to the Stability and Growth Pact in the context of their existing stability programmes. Under the present circumstances, the automatic stabilisers should only be allowed to work fully in those countries whose budget positions are close to balance or in surplus. Let me emphasise that a medium-term perspective is essential for the conduct of fiscal policies in all euro area countries. Short-term discretionary measures aimed at strengthening domestic demand risk having an unwelcome impact on the economy, not least on account of time lags. In addition, if such measures are not consistent with the Pact, they may undermine the credibility of the consolidation process. In their efforts to set the conditions for further expanding the production potential of the euro area, governments should also give more impetus to the implementation of structural reforms. Selective fiscal reforms, including those related to pension reforms, should provide the correct incentives to economic agents. Labour and product market reforms will be beneficial to employment growth in the euro area and improve the resilience of the euro area economy to adverse shocks in the future. Finally. I should like to draw your attention to a press release that was issued today on the ECB Decision on the denominations, specifications, reproduction, exchange and withdrawal of euro banknotes. After this question and answer session we will proceed with the unveiling of the security features of the euro banknotes and the launch of the Euro 2002 Information Campaign."
Chile,2001-09-06,"Santiago. September 6, 2001 Press Release At its monthly monetary policy meeting held today, the Board of the Central Bank decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at an annual 6.5% and that liquidity credit lines would also remain unchanged at the levels prevailing since the previous meeting. The inflationary outlook for the next 12 to 24 months remains within the target range although inflation might rise in two or three quarters and then drop back to around 3% in the second quarter of 2003. There are also signs that growth will improve towards the fourth quarter of this year, compared to the first half, despite the unfavorable external environment. External accounts should remain sound this year and the following years, even though terms of trade are worse. The marked depreciation of the peso in recent months, caused by the financial situation of neighbouring countries as well as the world economic downturn, will tend to push prices up and this will transitorily affect inflation. However, in any case, inflation is expected to stay within the target range and should converge on 3% in less than 18 months. The Bank will watch inflation closely in the coming months to see that expectations of medium-term inflation remain anchored around the centre of the target range. The Bank will be attentive to all developments in relevant markets so as to use its policy instruments to maintain price stability."
South Korea,2001-09-06,"The economy has slowed down more rapidly than had been anticipated while the uncertainties over a recovery of the world economy including that of the United States have persisted. Exports have continued to decline steeply and both industrial production and facilities investment have contracted significantly. The inflationary pressures that had been generated by rising costs, such as currency depreciation, oil price rises and higher public service charges, are gradually subsiding. However, real estate prices have continued to rise and consumer prices rose more rapidly than expected in August due to increases in prices of farm products following a drought succeeded by torrential rainfall. In the financial markets, despite the mounting uncertainties surrounding the restructuring of some debt-ridden large corporations, corporate sector fund-raising conditions have continued to improve. Market interest rates, as well as bank lending and deposit rates, declined considerably following the two rate cuts in July and August. Corporate bonds issued by corporations with low credit-ratings have kept their net issuance position. The target for the overnight call rate has already been lowered substantially to counter the anticipated slowdown of business activity and stimulating fiscal measures including enlarged fiscal spending are being taken to assist an economic recovery. It is judged appropriate to keep a close eye on the effects of these measures on the various sectors of the economy for a little longer. The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea, therefore, today decided to maintain its benchmark overnight call rate at around its current level in September. In order for the monetary and fiscal measures taken in response to the economic slowdown to translate into an economic recovery, it is essential to carry out the corporate sector restructuring as soon as possible, as this will serve to dispel the financial markets' latent uncertainty."
Peru,2001-09-06,"BANCO CENTRAL DE RESERVA DEL PERU Monetary Program for 2001- Information Note: September 2001 The BCRP reduces its reference interest rate from 9,0 to 8,5 percent in domestic currency and from 6,0 to 5,5 percent in foreign currency and set the operating target range at 130 - 140 million For the month of September, the Board maintained the range for its operating target at 130 - 140 million as a daily average. In August, the said balance was 132 million, which fell within the announced range (130  140 million). The Central Bank Board of Directors also established that the following interest and commission rates would be used in domestic-currency Central Bank operations since September 7: For monetary regulation credits in domestic currency, the effective interest rate would be the weighted average of the interbank interest rates, or 8,5 percent, whichever is highest. It should be noted that this is the fourth consecutive month in which the Bank reduced this rate. In August, the said rate was 9,0 percent. For overnight deposits in domestic currency held by banks at the Central Bank, the effective interest rate will be 4,0 percent. This rate is effective since March For foreign exchange temporary purchase operations (swap operations), the commission will be 0,0134 percent, equivalent to an effective 8,5 percent annual cost. This cost is lower than that effective since August 3 (9,0 percent). The following interest rates will be used in foreign-currency operations: The effective annual rate for monetary regulation credits will be 5,5 percent. This rate implied a reduction with respect to the rate effective since August 3 (6,0 percent). For overnight deposits held by banks at the Central Bank, the rate is equivalent to the average obtained by the Central Bank for similar deposits abroad. The Central Bank grants monetary regulation credits in domestic and foreign currency on a regular basis. If justified by financial conditions, the values mentioned above could be modified in order to ensure the attainment of the objective to preserve monetary stability."
South Korea,2001-09-19,"this month. In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11, there is an increased likelihood that the economic slowdown will be both serious and prolonged. Underlying factors such as the heightened possibilities of higher international oil prices following the terrorist attacks may push up prices. Demand-side inflationary pressures, however, appear to be low. In the financial markets, there are concerns over the worsening of profitability and cash-flow in the corporate sector due to the delay in economic recovery, both domestically and internationally. This could increase corporate credit risk and deepen a ""flight-to-quality"", possibly bringing about a contraction in both bank lending to the corporate sector and the corporate bond market. Taking these factors into account, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea today decided on several monetary policy measures in order to minimize the impact of this worsening of the external environment, which had not been anticipated, on the real economy and financial markets. The MPC lowered the target level of the overnight call rate by 0., 5 of a percentage point from 4., 5 percent to 4., 0 percent ; reduced the lending rate on Liquidity Adjustment Loans by 0., 5 of a percentage point from 4., 25 percent to 3., 75 percent ; increased the Aggregate Credit Ceiling by 2 trillion won from 9., 6 trillion won to 11., 6 trillion won ; and lowered the lending rate on Aggregate Credit Ceiling Loans by 0., 5 of a percentage point from 3., 0 percent to 2., 5 percent. In order to minimize the negative effects of the worsening external environment, it is essential to dispel the uncertainties surrounding the financial markets by carrying out corporate restructuring swiftly while pursuing fiscal policy measures to counter the economic slowdown. At the same time, the impact on domestic price levels should be contained, keeping a close eye on the movements of oil prices."
South Africa,2001-09-20,"The Monetary Policy Committee evaluated the monetary policy stance at a meeting on 20 September 2001. After carefully analysing the current and likely future economic and price developments, the Committee decided to lower the repurchase rate by 50 basis points to 9,5 per cent effective from 21 September 2001. 1.1 The international economic outlook has been overshadowed by the tragic events of 11 September 2001 in the United States. Although it is still too early to tell what the longer-term impact will be, it is expected to have a negative effect on consumer confidence in the United States over the short term, that will intensify the economic slowdown and delay its recovery. The current extent of the slowdown in economic activity was underlined by the revised growth figure of just 0,2 per cent in the gross domestic product of the United States in the second quarter of 2001. In addition, employment figures for August showed that unemployment in the United States had risen to its highest level in four years. Macroeconomic data for Europe and Japan also remained disappointing, while economic strains in Argentina. Brazil and Turkey adversely affected sentiment towards emerging-market economies. 1.2 The downward movement of global interest rates has continued since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee. Official interest rates were reduced in the United States. Japan, the United Kingdom, the euro area. Denmark. Canada and Australia. The emerging-market economies that relaxed monetary policy included South Korea. Taiwan and Poland. The negative growth outlook for the world economy is likely to reinforce or prolong this trend. It is also expected that the major central banks will provide sufficient liquidity to financial markets to alleviate any systemic pressures which may arise from the impact of the abovementioned tragic events. In reaction, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to reduce the federal funds rate by a further 50 basis points to 3 per cent on 17 September 2001. This was followed by downward adjustments in interest rates by the European Central Bank and a number of other central banks. 1.3 International oil prices, which had already begun to rise since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, rose sharply in the wake of the events in the United States. Subsequently, they fell back somewhat after assurances from OPEC that it is committed to ensuring stable oil supplies to the market. However, the oil price is expected to remain relatively firm following the OPEC supply cut in early September and the onset of winter in the northern hemisphere. World inflation rates nevertheless still seem to be contained. 1.4 The atrocity in the United States also led to increased pressure on exchange rates in a number of economies, including South Africa. The rand immediately depreciated against all the major currencies. As a result, the trade-weighted value of the rand on 20 September 2001 was 11,5 per cent below its level at the beginning of the year. 2.1 Despite the deepening of the slowdown in the world economy, the growth in real gross domestic product in South Africa rose from 2 per cent in the first quarter of 2001 to 2½ per cent in the second quarter. Moreover, a better growth performance was discernible in most of the main economic sectors, with the exception of electricity generation and financial services. A further, albeit smaller, decline in agricultural output was recorded in the second quarter, while output growth in mining, manufacturing, construction and commerce improved somewhat. 2.2 In contrast to these developments in production, real gross domestic expenditure declined by 2 per cent in the second quarter of 2001. In the first quarter of 2001 it had still increased by 2½ per cent. The decline in total domestic spending was caused by a reduction in inventories. Aggregate real final demand remained relatively buoyant, even though growth in consumption expenditure and fixed capital formation declined slightly. 2.3 Despite continued weakness in the employment numbers of the formal non-agricultural sectors, the incidence of strikes and work stoppages rose markedly in the second and third quarters of 2001. These actions led to relatively higher wage settlements which could detrimentally affect nominal unit labour cost if they are not countered by continued high productivity gains. 3.1 The broadly defined money supply (M3) accelerated considerably from a year-on-year increase of 9,2 per cent in January 2001 to 17,8 per cent in July. Quarter-to-quarter growth in M3 has also been strong since the last quarter of 2000, amounting to successive annualised figures of 14,7 per cent, 19,2 per cent and 16,5 per cent in the three quarters respectively. This rise in the broad money supply can mainly be attributed to an increase in the demand for longer-term deposits by the private sector which is normally not associated with an acceleration in domestic spending. Growth over twelve months in the narrower monetary aggregate M1A, however, started to pick up from a negative 1,1 per cent in March 2001 to 6,7 per cent in June and 15,9 per cent in July. 3.2 Growth in total domestic credit extension over twelve-month periods slowed down from 10,1 per cent in March 2001 to 7,0 per cent in June and 8,3 per cent in July. This slowdown in total domestic credit extension was essentially caused by a decline in the net use of bank credit by the government sector and the increased foreign financing of the fiscal deficit. Growth in bank credit extension to the private sector remained below 10 per cent in the first seven months of 2001, with twelve-month growth in both June and July amounting to 9,5 per cent. Instalment sale credit, leasing finance and mortgage advances gained momentum over this period, reflecting the relative strength of private households' demand for durable goods and supporting the solid performance of the property market. 3.3 Government finance remained sound and continued to support monetary policy. Government revenue in the first four months of fiscal 2001/02 was 16,9 per cent more than in the corresponding period of fiscal 2000/01. This higher-than-expected increase in revenue can be ascribed to greater administrative efficiency and higher collections of taxes on international trade and transactions. Revenue growth exceeded the growth in government expenditure. As a result, the public-sector borrowing requirement narrowed from R6,7 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2000/01 to R2,2 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2001/02. 4.1 Lively trading conditions prevailed in the bond market in the first eight months of 2001. The seasonally adjusted monthly value of turnover in the secondary bond market increased by 39 per cent from a recent low in May 2001 to an all-time high in June 2001, before declining by 12 per cent to a still relatively high level in August. Non-residents, on balance, were net sellers of domestic bonds. The cumulative net sales of bonds by non-residents in 2001 amounted to R15,6 billion on 19 September 2001. 4.2 The yield on long-term government bonds declined from a monthly average of 12,1 per cent in April 2001 to 10,7 per cent in August - its lowest level since 1983. Profit taking, mounting concerns about macroeconomic stability in some emerging-market economies and unfounded negative perceptions of unlawful threats to property rights in the country, introduced some volatility in the market at times. 4.3 Turnover in the secondary share market remained high. This can be attributed to volatile price movements throughout the first eight months of 2001 and the takeover of the De Beers mining company by Anglo American. Despite the volatility in the market, the average monthly all-share price index rose by 8 per cent from December 2000 to August 2001. The tragedy in the United States brought the all-share price index sharply down in September. This was consisted with most other markets. Non-residents stepped up their acquisition of shares to the amount of R21,2 billion from the end of 2000 to 19 September 2001. 4.4 The liquidity requirement in the money market has hovered around the R10 billion mark since June 2001. Money-market interest rates have remained relatively stable since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee and increased only moderately for a few days following the events in the United States. The repurchase rate was reduced by one percentage point on 5 September 2001 to administratively narrow the margin between this rate and the interbank call rate. 5.1 The current account of the balance of payments, which had moved to a surplus in the fourth quarter of 2000, continued to perform well in the first half of 2001. The depreciation of the rand dampened the demand for imports while stimulating exports. These developments, together with a decline in domestic expenditure and a decline in the price of imported crude oil, contributed to an increase in the trade balance during the second quarter of 2001. This increase, however, was offset by a widening of the deficit on the services and income account because of higher net dividend payments to the rest of the world. As a result, the surplus on the current account of the balance of payments declined slightly from a seasonally adjusted and annualised value of R6,9 billion in the first quarter of 2001 to R6,3 billion in the second quarter. 5.2 A deficit of R3,8 billion on the financial account of the balance of payments in the first quarter of 2001 was turned into a surplus of R5,6 billion in the second quarter. This change in the second quarter was mainly brought about by the restructuring of the shareholding in the De Beers mining company. This transaction resulted in a large net inflow of direct investment capital, which was partly neutralised by an outflow of portfolio and other investments. 5.3 The joint effect of the surpluses on the current and financial accounts of the balance of payments was an increase of R8,0 billion in the gross gold and other foreign reserves of the country in the second quarter of 2001. These strong inflows of capital and the government's bond issue in the Samurai market in July, allowed the Reserve Bank to reduce its net oversold position in foreign currency further from US$9,4 billion at the end of March 2001 to US$4,8 billion at the end of July 2001. Further increases in the country's gross international reserves during August can be attributed to the proceeds of the US$1,5 billion syndicated loan of the Reserve Bank and National Treasury, the proceeds of which were delivered in the foreign-exchange market. This led to a reduction in the Bank's oversold forward book. Should the National Treasury decide to assume the role of borrower of this facility, the Bank's net oversold position in foreign currency will decrease further. 6.1 South Africa has been able to withstand the inflationary consequences of rising international oil prices and a sharp depreciation in the external value of the rand. Despite these developments, inflation in consumer prices moderated meaningfully in the first half of 2001. The year-on-year rate of increase in the consumer price index for metropolitan and other urban areas excluding mortgage cost (CPIX) declined from 8,2 per cent in August 2000 to 6,0 per cent in August 2001. This favourable outcome was largely related to, low increases in unit labour cost, no signs of excess aggregate demand, surplus production capacity in the economy, fiscal prudence, moderate credit growth, sound monetary discipline and recent declines in petrol prices. 6.2 In contrast to the moderation in consumer price inflation, production price inflation has accelerated in recent months and remains stubbornly high. The year-on-year rate of increase in the all-goods production price index rose from a recent low of 8,1 per cent in April 2001 to 8,6 per cent in May. June and July. When omitting the moderating effect of relatively low rises in food prices, other production prices increased by 8,9 per cent in the year to July 2001. The year-on-year growth in the prices of imported goods slowed down from 15,0 per cent in December 2000 to 9,2 per cent in July 2001. The acceleration in production prices was therefore due to a rise in the prices of domestically produced goods from a year-on-year rate of 6,9 per cent in April 2001 to 8,2 per cent in July 2001. 6.3 An acceleration in domestic production prices could lead, after a while, to a more rapid increase in consumer prices if these prices are not neutralised by lower import prices or tighter retail margins. The recent attacks on the United States and the further depreciation of the rand seem to suggest that it is highly unlikely that import price inflation will continue to slow down. As already indicated, it is generally feared that international oil prices will remain firm in the coming months, which could place pressure on import prices. Despite the fact that the Reserve Bank's projections indicate that the rate of increase in the CPIX should fall within the target range of 3 to 6 per cent if all other things remain the same, there are also other important risks for inflation. These include an acceleration in the growth of money supply, continued high rates of increase in administered prices, and greater pressure from the trade union movement for wage increases in excess of the current inflation rate."

September. October. November. December. 24 September 2001 Monetary program for October 2001<br> The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for October 2001, according to which its interest rate will remain at its present level of 6.3 percent. The Bank of Israel explains that underlying the interest-rate decision were two main developments: * Future estimates of inflation-as derived from inflation expectations in the capital market, private forecasters' assessments, and inflation estimates based on macroeconomic models developed in the Bank of Israel-have continued to rise in recent months, and are currently deviating upwards to some extent from the target range for the next few years. In addition, there has been more rapid local-currency depreciation than in the past, and this may affect inflation in the near future. * On the other hand, the assault on the US and its repercussions in world capital markets, as well as fears of the exacerbation of the global recession, could prolong Israel's economic slowdown and contribute to the moderation of the rate of price increases. Against this backdrop, and view of increased uncertainty, the Bank of Israel's decision not to change the interest rate now is consistent with attaining the government's target. As is known, monetary policy aims to attain the inflation target set by the government, providing the necessary infrastructure for sustainable growth and bolstering the financial stability of the money, capital, and foreign-currency markets. This stability withstood the test of recent events in world capital markets in the wake of the attack on the US, and it is important to continue fostering it in view of increased uncertainty resulting from the domestic and external factors to which Israel is exposed. The Bank of Israel points out that, subject to the preservation of price stability, monetary policy serves to uphold real economic activity in Israel in 2001 in two ways: * Real short-term interest has been gradually reduced from 7 percent in January to 3.2 percent in the first half of September. * There was real depreciation when the NIS exchangerate declined by 7-8 percent against both the dollar and the euro from the beginning of the year. This was made possible when nominal depreciation was not accompanied by a significant increase in the rate at which prices rose. Only by maintaining price stability, the Bank of Israel stressed, will export- and investment-led growth, i.e., sustainable growth, beencouraged. Undermining price stability by an interest-rate policy that is not consistent with the economic conditions prevailing in Israel will have an adverse effect oninvestment and increase the balance-of-payments deficit, primarily in view of the larger government budget deficit this year, as well as that expected next year too. The increase in the budget deficit and balance-of-payments deficit could make it more expensive for the government and the business sector to borrow abroad. In contrast with the decline in the real short-terminterest rate, the slow rise in real long-term interest is continuing, as measured by the yield on government bonds, which is currently 4.6 percent (compared with short-term interest of 3.2 percent). Long-term interest is affected inter alia byincreased net borrowing by the government due to the increase in the government deficit this year, constituting the basis for the interest rates on long-term loans, including mortgages and the financing of long-term projects. The risk premium which international capital markets ascribe to Israel's economy remained essentially unchanged and is currently estimated at 0.7 of a percentage point (for half a year) and 1.6 percentage points (for 10 years). Note that because of the low level of tradability, it is not yet possible to obtain new indications from the markets in this respect. The interest-rate differential against the dollar is currently about 3.3 percentage points, compared with 5.2 percent in January 2000 and 2.0 percent in January 2001.

Poland,2001-09-26,"Information on the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council on September 25-26, 2001 The Monetary Policy Council meeting on September 25-26th, 2001 was held in special circumstances. The Monetary Policy Council analyzed the factors affecting future inflation in conditions of even bigger than usual uncertainty. First, it is connected with possible consequences of terrorist attacks in the USA to the world economy. Second, it results from the fact that the meeting was held directly after parliamentary elections and due to this the uncertainty about the shape of a future economic policy, mainly including the state budget for 2002. I. Inflation processes. 1. In August this year, consumer goods and services prices lowered, as a year before, by 0.3% as compared to July this year. Similarly to June and July, this price drop mainly resulted from: o Drop of foodstuff prices (by 1.4%), especially prices of vegetables (by 15.6%), o And drop of fuel prices (by 0.6%). The twelve-month consumer price index lowered to the level 5.1% from 5.2% a month before. 2. All base inflation measures calculated on the twelve-month scale dropped: o 15%-cut average from 5.5% to 5.0%; o inflation after the controlled prices are excluded from 5.2% to 4.8%; o inflation after the most variable prices are excluded from 4.5% to 4.2%; o inflation after the most variable and fuel prices are excluded from 5.4% to 4.9%; o ""net"" inflation (after the foodstuff and fuel prices are excluded) from 6.7% to 6.5%. 3. The sold industrial output prices rose in August this year by 0.5% as compared to July(a month before they rose by 0.3%). It was the biggest monthly rise of industrial output prices since October 2000 and bigger than expected. The prices in industrial processing rose by 0.5% (as compared to the drop by 0.1% a month before). In August this year, for the first time since July 2000, the twelve-month producer price index rose, but it is still at a very low level (0.8% as compared to 0.6% a month before). In industrial processing sector prices dropped by 1.3% as compared to August 2000 (as compared to 1.5% drop a month before). 4. In September this year, the structure of answers to questions of a survey of inflation expectations of individuals did not explicitly change. The inflation rate for December 2001 expected by bank analysts lowered and now it amounts to 5.6% (as compared to 5.9% a month before). Inflation expectations of bank analysts in the 11-month horizon also lowered by 0.3 percentage point and amounted to 5.4%. In August this year, the same as last year and according to expectations, consumer goods and services prices dropped as compared to July. As in June and July, the price drop mainly resulted from the drop of foodstuff and fuel prices. The twelvemonth consumer price index lowered insignificantly. The decrease was also noted in case of all the measures of base inflation calculated on the twelve-month scale and inflation expectations of bank analysts. It is worth noting, however, that in spite of the drop, the ""net"" inflation index at the level 6.5% is materially higher than the current inflation rate. It indicates that the considerable decrease of consumer price index observed within previous months mainly results from positive developments, i.e. the drop of petroleum and foodstuff prices. However, these factors can be temporary and they can affect the inflation rise in future. In August this year, the higher than expected and the highest since October 2000 monthly rise of the sold industrial output prices was noted. The twelve-month producer price index rose for the first time since July last year. However, it is still at a low level and output prices in industrial processing on the twelve-month scale lowered (although the scale of this drop was smaller than a month before). II. Money supply, loans, interest rates. 1. The total growth of money supply in August this year as compared to the end of July this year amounted to PLN 3.9 billion. One of the elements of this growth was over 90%-growth of deposit value. A part of deposit growth resulted from the increase of the value in zlotys of foreign currency deposits as a result of the depreciation of the zloty. A nominal pace of money supply growth on the twelve-month scale increased to 14.6% from 13.5% a month before. 2. The total PLN-denominated deposits placed by individuals rose in August this year as compared to July this year by PLN 1.6 billion and as compared to August 2000 by PLN 29.1 billion (i.e. 20.3% as compared to the rise by 20.2% a month before). 3. In August this year, total loans to individuals and businesses rose by PLN 4.5 billion as compared to July this year. The increase of the value in zlotys of foreign currency loans as a result of changes of the exchange rate of the zloty constitutes approximately 35% of the total loan growth. The dynamics of total loans on the twelve- month scale rose from 11.6% in July to 12.1% in August this year. Loans to households rose as compared to July this year by PLN 1.3 billion of which PLN 0.4 billion resulted from the exchange rate changes, and the growth pace of loans to individuals on the twelve-month scale was maintained at the level observed a month before (20.3%). In case of loans to businesses the growth amounted to PLN 3.3 billion of which PLN 1.3 billion resulted from the depreciation of the zloty, and a dynamics of loans to businesses on the twelve-month scale rose to 9.8% (as compared to 9.2% in July and 7.1% in June this year). 4. A scale of adjustments of interest rates on loans and deposits in commercial banks was smaller than the change of basic interest rates of the NBP. Bigger changes were noted in case of deposit than loan interest rates. However, further cuts of interest rates in commercial banks are possible, especially as a result of the NBP interest rate cut in August. A high growth pace of PLN-denominated deposits placed by individuals is maintained. In August this year, the lending dynamics increased. An essential reason for this increase were changes of the exchange rate of the zloty. In August this year, the money supply dynamics on the twelve-month scale increased. The main element of this increase was the growth of term deposits placed by individuals. III. External conditions. 1. Within the last period, the uncertainty about the future situation of external conditions of the Polish economy that are related to the possible results of terrorist attacks in the United States increased considerably. 2. Even before the attacks the IMF published a revised forecast of economic growth worldwide. It provided for economic growth in the USA this year at the level 1.5% (as compared to 4.1% a year before) and for the euro zone 1.9% (as compared to 3.4% in 2000). Within the last period, considerable uncertainty related to possible consequences of terrorist attacks in the United States to the world economy appeared. Economic growth forecasts for both the USA and the euro zone indicated a clearly smaller pace of economic growth in 2001 than a year before and smaller than it was forecasted earlier. The latest events can even deepen these unfavorable tendencies. Such a scenario would mean the weakening of external demand for Polish goods, i.e. the worsening of external conditions for the growth of Polish economy, but, at the same time, it would be a factor that affects the inflation pressure decrease. On the other hand, in the present situation it is not possible to exclude the rise of petroleum prices that would adversely affect the development possibilities of the economy and the inflation in Poland. IV. Balance of payments, exchange rate. 1. In July this year, the current account deficit based on payments amounted to USD 296 million (as compared to USD 956 million in June this year and USD 690 million in July 2000). The trade deficit amounted to USD 798 million and was smaller than in June this year (USD 902 million) and smaller than in July last year (USD 1,040 million). The current account deficit in the period January-July amounted to USD 4,679 million and as compared to the same period last year it decreased by USD 1,622 million. 2. The observed increase of export resulted from the increase of export of highly processed goods what may be the evidence for a growing capability of the Polish economy to compete on foreign markets. 3. In August this year, the average exchange rate against the dollar amounted to PLN 4.25 (PLN 4.19 a month before) and against the euro PLN 3.82 (PLN 3.60 in July). The variability of the exchange rate of the zloty in August and at the beginning of September this year considerably decreased as compared to July. During last few days the exchange rate of the zloty was affected by the increase of the euro exchange rate against the dollar as a result of the events in the USA and the information (inflation drop, industrial output growth in August this year) encouraging foreign investors to invest in Poland. In July this year, the situation in the area of the external balance of the Polish economy improved. Both the trade and current account deficits decreased. As compared to June this year, the income deficit decreased considerably too, and the surplus of unclassified transactions on current account increased. V. Supply, demand, situation on labor market and income. 1. The gross domestic product in the 2nd quarter this year increased by 0.9% as compared to the 2nd quarter of 2000 (in the previous quarter this year the increase amounted to 2.3%) and the domestic demand decreased by 1.2% in this period (in the 1st quarter this year the domestic demand dropped by 1.4%). 2. The sold industrial output in August this year was bigger by 0.7% than a year before (in July this year it increased by 0.9%, and after adjusting the difference of business days, it was at the level close to July 2000). It should be added that in August last year the industrial output increased by 7.8%, i.e. it constituted a relatively high basis for the output growth calculations this year. 3. In August this year, the retail sales were bigger by 3% than in August last year (as compared to the increase by 1.5% a month before). The retail sales in real terms in August this year increased on the twelve-month scale by approximately 1.5% (in July this year they were at the level close to July 2000). 4. In August this year, average employment in the enterprise sector dropped as compared to the previous month by 0.5% (as in July this year). The reduction of employment calculated on the twelve-month scale amounted to 3.7% (in July this year the drop amounted to 3.5%). The unemployment rate in August increased to 16% from 15.9% a month before. 5. In August this year, average wages in the enterprise sector increased by 6.9% as compared to August 2000 (by 1.7% in real terms). Within the period January-August 2001, the wage growth amounted to 7.4% (1% in real terms) as compared to the same period last year. 6. Within the period January-August, the average pension and disability benefit was bigger by 9.2% than a year before (the growth in real terms was 2.7%). In general, the results of the 2nd quarter confirmed the earlier forecasts of a drop of the development dynamics of the economy. However, faster growth of industrial output with a considerable share of consumer goods sold on the domestic market in August this year, growth of retail sales, further decrease of sales reductions signaled by trade enterprises and better than a month before assessments of the current demand and production by industrial enterprises can signal the beginning of a gradual stimulation of the domestic demand leading to the acceleration of economic growth. The situation on labor market should still support the reduction of pressure for the increase of wages and inflation. VI. Situation in public finance sector. 1. In August this year, the state budget deficit increased to the level PLN 20.9 billion and constituted 71.9% of the plan for this year after the amendment introduction (102.1% of the plan before the amendment introduction). As compared to the situation of the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Council, the level of uncertainty about the shape of the budget for 2002 did not lower. On the contrary, additional areas of uncertainty connected with the amount of the deficit and possible increase of taxes appeared. The Monetary Policy Council will present its opinion on the project of the budget for 2002 after its next meeting. VII. The accumulated internal problems (situation in public finance sector, increase of unemployment and slower economic growth) and possible worsening of external conditions for Poland´s economy strengthen the need for structural reforms, systematically signaled by the Monetary Policy Council, such as: Labor market reform. Rationalization of public spending. Completion of privatization and strengthening of a market mechanism in the areas where it is limited. VIII. Decision of the Monetary Policy Council. 1. In general, the previous month forecasts were confirmed and the observed earlier tendencies in both monetary and non-monetary areas of Poland´s economy were maintained. There appear some signs of a possible stimulation of demand and growth of the economy, however the situation on labor market should prevent from a material wage increase that could result in the inflation impulse. 2. Within the last period, there appeared a considerable uncertainty about possible consequences of terrorist attacks in the United States to the world economy. On one hand, a further slowdown of the economic growth worldwide is possible. It would mean the weakening of the external demand for Polish goods, i.e. the worsening of external conditions for the growth of Poland´s economy, but, at the same time, it would be a factor affecting the decrease of inflation pressure. On the other hand, in the present situation, it is not possible to exclude the rise of petroleum prices that would adversely affect the growth possibilities of the economy and inflation in Poland. At the moment, it is not possible to give an explicit assessment of he probability and eventual scale of these changes and, in this connection, their joint impact on the future inflation in Poland. 3. At the same time, the uncertainty connected with the situation in public finance sector increased. In the Council´s opinion, a permanent recovery of public finance should be mainly focused on the reduction of budget expenses as a result of the acceleration of structural reforms in public finance and the economy. Increasing tax burden imposed on enterprises and the population will be the factor that halts the development of the economy and it may increase the inflation pressure. The Council wishes to emphasize that it will evaluate the plan of public finance recovery by observing the economic deficit of the public finance sector. Accepting the amount of PLN 40 billion as a border level of the budget deficit in 2002 was connected with the planned reduction of the economic deficit. 4. Considering all the above-mentioned paragraphs, the Monetary Policy Council decided to maintain the monetary policy parameters at the existing level, i.e. maintain the basic interest rates of the NBP and its neutral position in monetary policy. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Council will be held on October 3rd, 2001 and it will be focused on the assessment of the project of the state budget for 2002."
Chile,2001-10-09,"Santiago. October 9, 2001 Press Release At its monthly monetary policy meeting held today, the Board of the Central Bank decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at an annual 6.5% and that liquidity credit lines would also remain unchanged at the levels prevailing since the previous meeting. The events of September aggravated the recession setting in the United States and heightened the uncertainty about the speed and timing of world economic recovery. There are a great variety of forecasts but the general consensus is that trend growth of Chile's trading partners will drop around one percentage point by the end of 2002. This new reality means that there will be far less demand for Chile's export products and the terms of trade will be worse than had been foreseen in September's Monetary Policy Report. Although international interest rates fall, which is favorable to Chile's cost of foreign financing, this can only partly compensate for the negative effects of a world growth slowdown. The Board thus estimates that Chilean economic growth will be affected this year and more so in 2002, reaching a range of 3% to 4% but returning to higher growth rates in 2003. Apart from the rather dismal world situation, neighbouring economies have also become financially more vulnerable in recent weeks, putting greater pressure on the Chilean peso which had already dropped in value because of the international outlook. If it continues this way, the depreciation already suffered in the past thirty days threatens to push prices up and raise inflation, particularly next year. However, this risk is offset by the projected reduced growth of domestic demand and low oil prices. The Board therefore envisages inflation remaining around the level forecast in September's Monetary Policy Report, converging towards the centre of the target range (3%) within a horizon of eight quarters. The Board confirms its commitment to price stability and to the inflation target of 2% to 4% and centering on 3%. It will continue to keep monetary policy flexible in order to anticipate and face any threats to achieving the inflationary target. Finally, the Board will continue the policy of intervention in the exchange market and trading indexed dollar securities, announced on August 16, to facilitate foreign-currency liquidity and to provide hedging instruments."
Euroarea,2001-10-11,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank met today for the fourth time outside Frankfurt. Let me first of all thank our host. Governor Liebscher, and the staff of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank, for the invitation to Vienna and for the generous hospitality offered to us. As usual, the Governing Council conducted its examination of monetary and economic developments and analysis of their implications for the maintenance of price stability in the euro area. Based on its assessment under both the first and second pillar, the Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The level of the key ECB interest rates at the current juncture is therefore seen as consistent with maintaining price stability over the medium term. Given the high level of uncertainty in the international environment, we will continue to monitor developments very closely and thoroughly, and we will assess new information in the context of our medium-term-oriented monetary policy strategy aimed at delivering price stability in the euro area. Let me elaborate somewhat on the assessment provided under the two pillars of the monetary policy strategy of the ECB. Looking at the first pillar, we have seen a strong increase in M3 growth over the past few months. However, a number of temporary factors play an important role in explaining recent monetary developments. Notably the uncertainty in stock markets and the relatively flat yield curve until August have led to portfolio shifts by private investors from longer-term assets to short-term assets included in M3. Furthermore, the growth of credit to the private sector continued to slow down in August. For these reasons, we do not judge that monetary developments signal risks to price stability at this juncture. This notwithstanding, the developments of M3 will have to be monitored carefully in the coming months. As regards the second pillar, the assessment is currently surrounded by a particularly high degree of uncertainty. Last month's terrorist attacks had a negative impact on economic activity and confidence, which could delay the resumption of higher economic growth. Against this background, it was important that policy-makers in the United States, the euro area and in other countries around the world acted with measures to support confidence. A further positive feature is the recent fall in oil prices, which should be helpful in containing inflationary pressure and supporting the real disposable income of households, thereby sustaining consumption in many countries. With regard to economic growth in the euro area, it would be premature to offer a firm assessment of the macroeconomic impact of the tragic events in the United States and current activities to combat global terrorism. At present, there are no major imbalances in the euro area which would require a longer-term adjustment process. On account of policies aimed at price stability, fiscal consolidation, wage moderation and structural reform, the euro area fundamentals remain very positive. Financing conditions are favourable and inflation is declining. The mere existence of the euro has sheltered the countries of the euro area from adverse intra-European exchange rate tensions, which had typically plagued many countries when external shocks occurred in the past. Taken together, all these elements should provide a much better base than in the past for a recovery in the course of next year once the initial shock has been absorbed. However, notwithstanding all these positive aspects, we will continue to monitor downside risks to the current situation. Against this background, we are confident that inflation in the euro area will continue to decline to a level consistent with price stability. Receding external price pressures, combined with the expected continuation of wage moderation, underpin this expectation. For the time being, we thus see a confirmation of our earlier assessment, which led us to reduce the key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points on 17 September. In fact, the recent events strengthened tendencies towards lower rates of inflation that were already prevailing before. Given their nature and their expected economic consequences, the terrorist attacks clearly warranted a prompt, flexible and appropriate response by the Governing Council, in the context of the medium-term-oriented monetary policy strategy of the ECB. Regarding fiscal policies, there have been very encouraging signs of firm fiscal consolidation in a significant number of euro area Member States over past years, whereas, in a few other countries, progress towards balanced fiscal positions has been slower. It is natural for an economic slowdown to have adverse effects on member countries' budget positions, and there is no need for immediate countervailing actions. However, a short-lived slowdown should not drastically change the scope for reaching the targets set in the countries' stability programmes. For countries with a budget position still not close to balance or in surplus it is important to adhere to their medium-term consolidation plans. Turning to the long-term prospects, in order to raise the rate of potential economic growth in the euro area, structural reforms in the size and composition of public revenue and expenditure, as well as in product and labour markets, have to continue. Advances have been made in times of high real GDP growth, although in many areas, including in labour markets, more could have been achieved. As adjustment needs are likely to become more visible in periods of less vigorous economic growth, policy-makers must now intensify the acceleration of reforms rather than allow efforts to abate. Moving forward the reform agenda decisively will enable the euro area economy to respond flexibly in future and thereby underpin our confidence that external shocks can be more easily absorbed than in the past."
South Korea,2001-10-11,"The economy maintained its sluggishness: both facilities investment and exports continued to decline and industrial production contracted for the third month in a row. Consumer price inflation eased to a level of below 4 percent on a year-on-year basis in September, mainly due to declines in the prices of farm products and petroleum-based products. The depth of the uncertainty over the external and domestic environments and the future course of the real economy will vary according to the way the U S., military actions evolve. Financial markets appear to be maintaining overall stability. Market interest rates, as well as bank lending and deposit rates, have declined considerably following the rate cuts undertaken so far. With ample liquidity in the market, financial institutions have increased credit supply. There is, however, the possibility that a limited credit squeeze may occur in corporate bonds and commercial paper markets as concerns over corporate credit risk are rising due to expectations of a delay in economic recovery. The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea today decided to maintain its target for the overnight call rate at its current level in October. The overnight call rate target had already been lowered considerably to minimize the impact of worsening external environment on September 19, following the two rate cuts in July and August. At this point, it is necessary to watch carefully the impact of the U., \xc2S., military actions on the domestic and international economies. In order to avoid any further slowdown of domestic economy owing to the deceleration of the world economy and U S., military action, it is desirable to enlarge the role of fiscal policy. Fiscal policy measures already taken to counter the economic slowdown should be carried out as planned. At the same time, monetary policy should be on the alert in order to soothe financial market apprehensions."
Peru,2001-10-15,"Monetary Program for 2001- Information Note: October 2001 For the month of October, the Board increased the range for its operating target at 132 - 142 million as a daily average. In September, the said balance was 136 million, which fell within the announced range (130  140 million). The Central Bank Board of Directors also established that the following interest and commission rates would be used in domestic-currency Central Bank operations since October 5: For monetary regulation credits in domestic currency, the effective interest rate would be the weighted average of the interbank interest ratse, or 7,5 percent, whichever is highest. It should be noted that this is the fourth consecutive month in which the Bank reduced this rate. In August, the said rate was 8,5 percent. For overnight deposits in domestic currency held by banks at the Central Bank, the effective interest rate will be 3,0 percent. The latter rate was 4,0 percent. For foreign exchange temporary purchase operations (swap operations), the commission implies an effective annual cost of7 ,5 percent. The latter cost was 8,5 percent. The following interest rates will be used in foreign-currency operations: The effective annual rate for monetary regulation credits will be5 ,0 percent. The latter rate was 5,5 percent. For overnight deposits held by banks at the Central Bank, the rate is equivalent to the average obtained by the Central Bank for similar deposits abroad. The Central Bank grants monetary regulation credits in domestic and foreign currency on a regular basis. For domestic currency operations, the Central Bank Board approved a new facility regarding temporary purchase of CDBCRP and Public Treasury bonds in domestic currency, besides the usual auction mechanisms, which holds maturities and interest rates of regulation credits. For the current year, the rate of inflation falls below the range announced in the 2001 Monetary Program, reflecting a lower than expected economic activity. It should be noted, that the Central Bank has been widening banking liquidity and reducing its operations' interest rates. If justified by financial conditions, the values mentioned above could be modified in order to ensure the attainment of the objective to preserve monetary stability."
Thailand,2001-10-20,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 17 October 2001 Mr. Thirachai Puvanat naranubala. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand announced that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to determine the monetary policy stance appropriate to the recent economic conditions. The MPC viewed that the impact of the terrorist attacks in the United States on the economies of Thailand's trading partners would restrain Thai economic growth in the foreseeable future. Nevertheless the government's fiscal measures should stimulate domestic demand, while debt restructuring under the Thai Asset Management Corporation should facilitate a more efficient functioning of the financial system. These factors should dampen the adverse external pressures. Inflationary pressure was not evident and core inflation was expected to remain within the target range for the next 8 quarters. As for the direction of monetary policy, the MPC viewed that under the floating exchange rate system Thailand would be able to pursue monetary policy in response to its own economic conditions and independent of other countries. The MPC also considered the impact that various policy stances may have on depositors and international capital flows. The recent interest rate cuts in the United States and in major industrial and neighbouring countries did narrow the differential between domestic and foreign interest rates and should contribute to external stability. he MPC deemed it necessary to continue the accommodative monetary policy stance to resolve existing difficulties in the Thai economy. However the MPC viewed that real interest rates were at about 1 per cent, a level sufficiently low and conducive to the economic recovery, while preserving a healthy international reserve position and stable currency. Core inflation also stayed within the target range. The MPC thus decided to maintain the 14-day repurchase rate at 25 per cent per annum. Further details regarding the assessment of the economy and risks, together with the output and inflation projections, will be released during the October 2001 Inflation Report press conference at the end of October. Bank of Thailand 17 October 2001."
Poland,2001-10-25,"Information on the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council on October 24-25, 2001 The Monetary Policy Council held its meeting on October 24-25, 2001. The Council was submitted the materials prepared by the Management Board and departments of the NBP and information and analytical materials prepared by the Ministry of Finance, banks and research institutes. On this basis, before starting the decision-making part of the meeting, the Council discussed inflation; tendencies in the area of money supply, lending and interest rates; external conditions and the situation in the balance of payments, real sector of the economy and in public finance sector. I. Inflation, inflation expectations. 1. In September this year, consumer goods and services prices rose by 0.3% as compared to August this year - a considerably smaller number than in the previous years and than it was expected. Among other things, it resulted from a considerably smaller rise of foodstuff prices. Such low rise of prices in September this year resulted in a considerable drop of the twelve-month consumer price index to 4.3% from 5.1% a month before. 2. All base inflation measures calculated on the twelve-month scale have also significantly dropped: o 15%-cut average from 5.0% to 4.6%; o inflation after the controlled prices are excluded from 4.8% to 4.1%; o inflation after the most variable prices are excluded from 4.2% to 3.6%; o inflation after the most variable and fuel prices are excluded from 4.9% to 4.3%; o ""net"" inflation (after the foodstuff and fuel prices are excluded) from 6.5% to 5.8%. 3. According to the initial data published by GUS , the sold industrial output prices in September this year rose by 0.4% as compared to August (a month before the prices rose by 0.8%). The twelve-month producer price index amounted to 0.6%. The acceleration of the growth pace of sold industrial output prices within recent months should be noted. 4. In October this year, the structure of answers to questions of a survey of future inflation expectations improved what indicates that the expectations of individuals at the present moment are more optimistic than a month before. In October this year, inflation expectations of bank analysts also decreased. In September this year, consumer goods and services prices, as compared to August this year, grew slower than expected. The twelve-month consumer price index lowered to 4.3% from 5.1% in August this year. Since the last meeting of the Council, the future inflation expectations of both individuals and bank analysts have improved. All the measures of base inflation calculated on the twelve-month scale significantly dropped as well. The so- called ""net"" inflation index higher than CPI (by 1.5 percentage point) indicates a favorable impact on inflation by the groups of goods excluded from this index, i.e. foodstuffs and fuels. However, the decreasing tendency of the remaining base inflation measures indicates that the observed inflation drop is related to the majority of consumer goods and services groups and it is not caused only by temporary factors. The acceleration of growth pace of sold industrial output prices within recent months should be noted. II. Money supply, loans, interest rates. 1. In September this year as compared to the end of August this year, the total money supply (M2) increased by PLN 2.8 billion. A nominal pace of money supply growth on the twelve-month scale amounted to 14.5% (as compared to 14.6% a month before). 2. PLN-denominated deposits placed by individuals rose by PLN 1.3 billion as compared to the end of August this year and by PLN 28 billion as compared to September last year. The pace of deposit growth on the twelve- month scale, although lower than a month before, is maintained at a high level 19.3% (19.9% in August this year). 3. In September this year, the total loan dynamics dropped to 10.8% from 11.7% a month before. The drop of the dynamics has been noted in case of both the loans to households (to 18.9% from 20.4% in August this year) and to businesses (to 8.5% from 9.2% a month before). 4. As a reaction to two last NBP interest rate cuts in June and August this year (by 2.5 percentage points), commercial banks made a bigger cut of interest rates on deposits (by approximately 2 percentage points) than loans to businesses (by approximately 1.2 percentage point). The average interest rate on loans to households even insignificantly rose. The banks' behavior diminishes the threat of a considerable growth of consumer loans. The data that have appeared since the last meeting of the Council indicate that there is no visible threat to future inflation by monetary factors. III. External conditions. 1. Since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Council, the forecasted data for the economic growth worldwide have been decreased again. According to the latest forecasts, in Germany, the economic growth will amount to approximately 0.7% GDP (as compared to 1.6%-2% planned earlier and as compared to 3% in 2000). It is possible that the GDP drop will be noted in the 4th quarter in the USA (during the whole year GDP will grow by 1% as compared to 4.1% in 2000). According to the latest analyses, a boom in the world economy can be expected only in the 2nd half of 2002. 2. The fuel market reaction to terrorist attacks and their military effects was quieter than expected. The stabilization and even a drop of petroleum prices are probable. Since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Council, the forecasts for the economic growth worldwide have been lowered what decreases the risk of inflation impulse of the demand nature by the export sector and of the supply nature related to changes of the world prices for petroleum and other raw materials. IV. Balance of payments, exchange rate. 1. Within the period January-August, the current account deficit amounted to USD 5.0 billion and was lower by approximately USD 2.2 billion than last year. It mainly resulted from a big increase of exports (by over 12% as compared to the same period of 2000) and a low dynamics of imports (3% as compared to the period January- August 2000). 2. The average exchange rate of the zloty against the dollar amounted to PLN 4.22 in September this year (as compared to PLN 4.25 a month before) and against the euro to PLN 3.85 (as compared to PLN 3.82 in August this year). A considerable improvement of the current account balance indicates the strengthening of the macroeconomic balance. V. Supply, demand, situation on labor market and income. 1. In September this year, the sold industrial output was smaller by 3.8% than a year before. After adjusting the difference of business days, the production drop in September this year amounted to approximately 2%. The construction and assembling production was smaller by 11% than a year before (in August this year, the drop amounted to 13.9%). 2. In September this year, the retail sales in real terms were on the level similar to the one noted in September 2000. 3. The employment in the enterprise sector dropped by 0.3% in September this year as compared to August this year and it was lower by 4% than a year before. The unemployment rate increased to 16.3% from 16.2% a month before. 4. Within the period January-September this year, average wages in the enterprise sector were bigger by 7.2% in nominal terms and by 1% in real terms than within the same period last year. The average pension and disability benefit, within the period January-September this year, were bigger by 9.8% in nominal terms than within the same period in 2000, and their purchasing power increased by 3.5%. The data on production and retail sales that were obtained between the meetings of the Council indicate that a low level of economic activity is maintained and there is a little inflation threat resulting from the demand growth. VI. Situation in public finance sector. 1. In September this year, the budget deficit increased by PLN 0.8 billion and after 9 months it amounted to PLN 21.7 billion (i.e. 74.7% of the plan after the amendment introduction). As compared to the situation a month before, two new elements appeared: The Government's decision to block the budget expenses in 2001 at the amount of PLN 8.5 billion. The Finance Minister's declaration that the ceiling of the state budget expenses in 2002 will amount to PLN 183 billion and the deficit will not exceed PLN 40 billion. The Council assumes that these declarations will be accomplished. The Monetary Policy Council wishes to emphasize that the problems accumulated in Poland, first of all, the drop of employment and the increase of unemployment, and the drop of the economic growth pace mainly result from: 1. Blocking of some structural reforms o Labor market reform, o Deeper rationalization of public expenses, o Bigger arrangement of taxes, 2. Insufficient pace of other reforms o Privatization, especially in such areas as power engineering, natural gas, transport, mining, metallurgical engineering, o Introduction of competition where it is not sufficient (fuel sector, telecommunications). More difficult external conditions than it could have been forecasted before September 11th additionally increase the need to unblock a big development potential of the Polish economy through the mentioned structural reforms. The monetary policy is not able to replace these reforms. It also has to consider the threats to price stability that are made by the situation in public finance. The Council will closely observe the Government actions aimed at the improvement of public finance condition and the trends in the dynamics of budget revenues and expenses. Without a clear improvement of the budget situation, the monetary policy instruments will not be able to deliver impulses that will stimulate the economic growth. The recovery of the situation in public finance requires structural reforms that will permanently reduce the state budget expenses. In this connection, the Monetary Policy Council thinks that the introduction of savings income tax is not the appropriate way of solving budget problems. The introduction of this tax would be an anti-development action. It would decrease the substantive profitability of placing money at banks, and, additionally, it would have a negative psychological impact on households' tendency to save. Both factors could lead to the drop of savings in the situation where the economy needs the increase of savings in order to be able to finance its investments in a safe way. IX. Decision of the Monetary Policy Council. Since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Council, the balance of factors affecting inflation has been clearly improved. The observed earlier favorable for future inflation tendencies in the monetary area (a big dynamics of households' deposits) have been maintained. The situation on labor market and a small income dynamics reduce the inflation threat resulting from the demand increase. Additionally, as compared to the situation a month before, new, positive for the future inflation, information, appeared, although some of them mean the worsening of conditions for economic growth: A considerable drop of CPI and all base inflation measures which indicates that the drop of inflation does not only result from temporary factors. Improvement of expectations by individuals and bank analysts concerning future inflation. Lowering of economic growth forecasts worldwide what means a smaller risk of the inflation impulse of demand nature. Improvement of forecasts concerning petroleum prices. Data on production and retail sales which indicate that a low level of demand pressure is maintained. Government decision to block budget expenses in 2001 at the amount of PLN 8.5 billion. Finance Minister's declaration that the ceiling of the state budget expenses in 2002 will amount to PLN 183 billion and the deficit will not exceed PLN 40 billion. In this situation, the Monetary Policy Council decided to cut the interest rates of the NBP by 1.5 percentage point and maintain its neutral position in monetary policy. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Council will be held on November 27-28, 2001."
Israel,2001-10-29,"29 October, 2001 Monetary program for November 2001 The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for November 2001, according to which its interest rate will be reduced by 0.2 percentage points to 6.1 percent. The Bank of Israel explains that most assessments of inflation for the next few years-those derived from the capital market, assessments by private forecasters, and those obtained from some of the models developed in the Bank-fall within the long-term target range. The cut in the rate of interest is thus consistent with the achievement of the target in the coming years. The concern regarding future inflation in Israel which was evident following the terroristattack on the US, reflected by a rise in inflation expectations in the markets and the development of the exchange rate in September, was not realized. In October the assessments went down again to within the target range, and fluctuations in the foreign-exchange market moderated. The Bank of Israel considers that at this stage, despite indications of increases in the budget deficits this year and next, the short-term rate ofinterest can be cut, to provide support for real economic activity without jeopardizing theattainment of the long-term inflation target. As is known, monetary policy aims to maintain the target of price stability set by the government, providing the necessary infrastructure for sustainable growth and bolstering the financial stability of the money, capital, and foreign-currency markets. This stability withstood the test of recent events in world capital markets in the wake of the attack on the US, and it is important to continue fostering it in view of increased uncertainty resulting from the external and domestic factors to which Israel is exposed. The Bank of Israel stressed that the only way to encourage export- and investment-led growth, i.e., sustainable growth, isby maintaining price stability. Undermining price stability would have an adverse effect on investment and increase the balance-of-payments deficit, particularly in view of the rise in the budget deficit this year and that expected next year too. The rise in the deficit pushes up the cost of raising capital in Israel, and is likely to increase the cost of government and business-sector borrowing abroad, thereby harming investment and growth. The Bank of Israel adds that there is a serious lack of clarity regarding the government's budget policy for next year, and thereis concern about the size of the deficit in 2002 in the event that growth does not reach the forecast figure on which the budget is based. Fiscal expansion and the rise in the deficit and in the government's domestic borrowing in 2001 and 2002 will be reflected by a further increase in its already high interest-payment burden, and this would be incurred to finance the rise in current expenditure. The risk premium which international capital markets ascribe to Israel's economy rose in October and is currently estimated at 1.1 percentage points (for half a year) and 2.0 percentage points (for 10 years). The rise in the risk premium is related to increased uncertainty in Israel and world wide following the terrorist attack on the US, and runs counter to the downward trend evident in the previous months. The interest-rate differential against the dollar is currently 3.8 percentage points, following the reduction of 0.5 of a percentage point in the US interest rate in October.

Chile,2001-11-08,"Santiago. November 8, 2001 Press Release At its monthly monetary policy meeting held today, the Board of the Central Bank decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at an annual 6.5% and that liquidity credit lines would also remain unchanged at the levels prevailing since the previous meeting. Recent data confirms the diagnosis of a sharp deterioration of the world economic scenario. On the domestic front, inflation stays on the path and at the level foreseen in September's Monetary Policy Report. Pressures that result from the depreciation of the peso are countered by the low growth of domestic demand and oil prices even lower than had been predicted a couple of months ago. Inflation is thus expected to converge towards the mid- range target of 3% within a horizon of eight quarters. The Board reiterates its commitment to price stability and to keeping inflation between 2% and 4%, centering on 3%, and will therefore continue with a flexible use of monetary instruments."
Euroarea,2001-11-08,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here to report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. The Governing Council conducted a comprehensive and in-depth examination of monetary and economic developments. Against the background of the available evidence, it analysed the implications for the maintenance of price stability in the euro area, taking a forward-looking and medium-term perspective. As a result, the Governing Council decided to lower the key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points. At this new level, the key ECB interest rates continue to be appropriate to ensure a favourable outlook for price stability over the medium term. In assessing the information which has accumulated over the past few weeks we concluded that inflationary pressures have further diminished. This was particularly apparent from the information under the second pillar of the ECB's monetary policy strategy, while information relating to the first pillar was also judged consistent with today's decision. The Governing Council considered today's assessment to be in line with available forecasts and its view of economic developments in the period ahead. It is expecting these views to be broadly confirmed by further incoming information on the economic situation. The ECB will publish its own projections in the December issue of the Monthly Bulletin. Let me elaborate somewhat on the assessment provided under the two pillars of the monetary policy strategy of the ECB. With regard to the first pillar, after having grown at a strong pace over the previous few months. M3 growth increased further in September. However, the recent evolution needs to be seen as a reflection of an increased liquidity preference of investors in an environment of a relatively flat yield curve until August, developments in global stock markets and a surge in financial market uncertainty following the terrorist attacks of 11 September. In addition, the growth of credit to the private sector has continued to decline over recent months. Overall, despite the acceleration in M3 growth, current monetary developments do not signal risks to price stability in the medium term. We will continue to closely examine the underlying dynamics of monetary growth. Regarding the second pillar, much clearer signals of a further reduction of inflationary pressures from the demand side have accumulated over recent weeks. Euro area real GDP growth will be weak in the second half of 2001. This is to be seen against the background of the ongoing weakness of the world economy, which depresses the demand for euro area exports. As a consequence, and also taking into account the high degree of uncertainty following the terrorist attacks of 11 September, the current environment is likely to lead to delays in investment activity and, to some extent, also to negatively affect private consumption growth in the euro area. Real GDP growth in the euro area is expected to remain below potential growth also for part of next year. Further ahead, however, the conditions exist for a recovery to take place in the course of 2002 and economic growth to return to a more satisfactory path. The uncertainty currently overshadowing the world economy should diminish, and there are no major imbalances in the euro area which would require longer-term adjustment. Economic policies in the euro area as a whole remain geared towards price stability, the objectives of the Stability and Growth Pact, wage moderation and structural reform. Further positive effects on economic growth should stem from the impact of tax reductions in several member countries and from the fact that financing conditions are favourable. As regards the outlook for prices in the euro area, recent developments confirm our earlier expectation of a gradual decline in inflation rates, resulting from the unwinding of the previous increase in energy prices and the absence of further shocks to food prices. In addition, and crucial for the medium term, two factors support the view that wage developments are less of a risk than was previously the case. First, the slowdown in economic activity should contribute to containing inflationary pressure stemming from the labour market. Second, there is now sufficient evidence that the increase in consumer price inflation was temporary, and this will help to keep inflation expectations low. Looking forward, inflation rates over the next few months will probably show some volatility, on account of base effects resulting from previous price movements. However, such short-term fluctuations should not distract from the medium-term trend. We can now expect that price stability will be safely restored in 2002. This view is confirmed by bond yield developments, which are consistent with financial markets expecting inflation rates in the euro area to be clearly below 2% over the medium term. Overall, as our assessment now points to a further abatement of inflationary pressures, this allowed us to reduce the key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points. This follows three previous interest rate reductions this year, bringing the total decrease to 150 basis points. The new level of interest rates is appropriate to maintain price stability over the medium term. This, in turn, will favour an environment conducive to restoring higher economic growth in the euro area. Interest rates across the entire yield curve are now very low by all measures and liquidity conditions are supportive to economic growth. At this juncture. I should like to recall our position as regards the impact of slower economic growth on the euro area countries' fiscal positions. While it is natural for an economic slowdown to have adverse effects on Member States' budgets, it is important that especially those countries with a budget position still not close to balance or in surplus and/or with high public debt-to-GDP ratios adhere to their medium-term consolidation plans. The current slowdown should not substantially change the scope for reaching the medium-term commitments they made under the Stability and Growth Pact and in the context of their stability programmes. Let me again emphasise that a medium-term perspective and continuous consolidation are essential for the conduct of fiscal policy in all euro area countries. This would give a firm signal to investors and consumers, thereby supporting confidence and contributing to a recovery. In their efforts to further expand the production potential of the euro area, governments should also give greater impetus to the implementation of structural reforms. Fiscal reforms, including those related to pension systems as well as to the level and composition of public revenue and expenditure, would provide the correct incentives. Labour and product market reforms will be beneficial to employment growth in the euro area and will improve the resilience of the euro area economy to adverse shocks in the future. While it may be perceived as more difficult to advance in these areas in an environment of weaker economic activity, the need to properly address rigidities should be much more obvious now than at times of buoyant growth. The current weakness should therefore be taken as a challenge to be met by stepping up reforms rather than allowing efforts to abate. Finally. I would like to inform you that the Governing Council has decided that, as from today, it will  as a rule  assess the stance of the ECB's monetary policy only at its first meeting of the month. Accordingly, interest rate decisions will normally be taken during that meeting. At the second meeting of the month, the Governing Council will deal for the most part with issues related to other tasks and responsibilities of the ECB and the Eurosystem. After the second meeting of the month, a press release on the ECB's monetary policy decisions will no longer be issued. Obviously, if warranted by the circumstances, the Governing Council can still decide to change the key ECB interest rates at any time, regardless of previously scheduled meetings (as was recently demonstrated by the decision to lower interest rates on 17 September 2001)."
South Korea,2001-11-08,"The economy showed signs of slight improvement during September, being led mainly by domestic demand : industrial production shifted to an increase, while the growth of both private consumption and construction investment turned upward and the contraction of facilities investment moderated. Nevertheless, uncertainty still remains. Consumer prices rose 3.6 percent on a year-on-year basis in October mainly due to the relatively high rises in service charges including housing rents despite a decline in the prices of farm products. Although concerns over corporate credit risk have been heightened due to the aggravation of corporate sector profitability stemming from the prolonged economic slowdown, financial markets appear to be maintaining overall stability. Overall balance has been maintained between the supply and demand for funds in the corporate sector while market liquidity is ample. Stock prices have shown an upward tendency and the won has firmed slightly against the dollar. The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain its benchmark overnight call rate at around its current level in November. Although the economic outlook is still uncertain, it is necessary to keep a close eye on the effects of the policy measures already taken to boost the economy for the time being. Taking into consideration the fact that uncertainties surrounding the domestic and external environments remain high, notably the possibility of a move into recession by economies worldwide including the U. S, economy, monetary policy will be conducted flexibly, while a careful watch will be kept on the status of business activity, price movements and the financial markets."
Peru,2001-11-08,"Monetary Program for 2001- Information Note: November 2001 For the month of November, the Board increased the range for its operating target at 135 - 145 million as a daily average. In October, the said balance was 140 million, which fell within the announced range (132  142 million). The Central Bank Board of Directors also established that the following interest and commission rates would be used in domestic-currency Central Bank operations since November 9: For monetary regulation credits in domestic currency, the effective interest rate would be the weighted average of the interbank interest rates, or 6,0 percent, whichever is highest. It should be noted that this is the fourth consecutive month in which the Bank reduced this rate. Formerly, the said rate was 7,5 percent. For overnight deposits in domestic currency held by banks at the Central Bank, the effective interest rate will be 2,5 percent. The latter rate was 3,0 percent. For foreign exchange temporary purchase operations (swap operations), the commission implies an effective annual cost of 6,0 percent. The latter cost was 7,5 percent. The following interest rates will be used in foreign-currency operations: The effective annual rate for monetary regulation credits will be 4,5 percent. The latter rate was 5,0 percent. For overnight deposits held by banks at the Central Bank, the rate is equivalent to the average obtained by the Central Bank for similar deposits abroad. The Central Bank grants monetary regulation credits in domestic and foreign currency on a regular basis. Besides, the Central Bank operations will be oriented to reduce volatility in the exchange market. If justified by financial conditions, the values mentioned above could be modified in order to ensure the attainment of the objective to preserve monetary stability."
South Africa,2001-11-15,"1.1 Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee it has become apparent that the tragic events in the United States on 11 September 2001 have exacerbated the economic downturn in most countries. After this incident, consumer and business confidence deteriorated considerably in the United States and Europe while economic conditions remained depressed in Japan. International tourism declined and most airlines suffered major losses. The generally negative sentiment heightened the risk of a more prolonged downturn in the world economy. 1.2 In the United States, production contracted for the first time since 1993 at an annualised rate of 0,4 per cent in the third quarter of 2001 and an even more severe decrease is expected for the fourth quarter. Consumer confidence in October dropped to its lowest level in almost 8 years, while unemployment continued to rise. In the euro area, the growth in real gross domestic product was down in the second quarter of 2001, with a substantial further downturn in industrial production. In contrast to these developments, the real gross domestic product of the United Kingdom is estimated to have grown at a seasonally adjusted and annualised rate of 2,4 per cent in the third quarter, up from the 1,8 per cent recorded in the second quarter of 2001. 1.3 The economic downturn in the United States and the continued poor performance of the Japanese economy had a negative effect on the East Asian economies. Countries such as Hong Kong. Malaysia. Singapore and Taiwan are experiencing negative growth rates. On top of this the Argentina debt problems continue to impact negatively on Latin America in particular, and emerging markets in general. The attack on the United States resulted in reduced access to global financial markets and a deeper decline in international commodity prices. In contrast to what had at first been expected, the downturn also led to a significant decline in the demand for crude oil, and international oil prices reached a two-year low. The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is finding it increasingly difficult to keep the oil price between its chosen band of US$22 and US$28 per barrel, despite indications of a further cut in the production quota. 1.4 In reaction to the international slowdown, most countries have adopted a more lenient fiscal and monetary policy stance. Many countries have announced tax reductions, increased government expenditure and reduced their interest rates. The Federal Funds rate in the United States has been lowered to only 2 per cent, its lowest level in forty years. If the inflation rate is taken into account, the real federal funds rate is negative. Other central banks that have lowered official rates since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee include those of the United Kingdom, the euro area. Canada. Switzerland. Australia. New Zealand. Hong Kong. Taiwan. Hungary and Poland. 2.1 At first the downturn in economic activity hardly affected the South African economy. In fact, growth in the real gross domestic product rose from an annualised rate of 2 per cent in the first quarter of 2001 to 2½ per cent in the second quarter. However, a sharp decline in exports has led to a considerably lower estimate for growth in the third quarter. The slowdown in real economic activity was broadly based. Output in the primary sectors and manufacturing declined, and slower growth was recorded in the real value added by almost all the major sectors in the economy. 2.2 Despite the slowdown in aggregate production, real gross domestic expenditure increased in the third quarter of 2001, following a decline of 2 per cent in the preceding quarter. The driving force behind the increase in domestic spending in the third quarter was a strong performance in real domestic final demand and a more modest decline in inventories. Household consumption expenditure and gross fixed capital formation continued to increase strongly. However, lower increases in the operating surpluses of business enterprises led to a further decline in the domestic saving ratio. 2.3 On the labour front, there were tentative signs of a bottoming out in the rate of decline in employment in the formal non-agricultural sectors of the economy. This seems to be confirmed by the more stable official unemployment rate recorded over the past year. Although work stoppages and industrial stayaways affected production, increases in labour productivity continued to moderate the increase in labour costs. On average, nominal unit labour cost rose by about 3½ per cent in the first half of 2001 compared with the same period in the preceding year. 3.1 Growth in the broadly defined money supply remained brisk in the third quarter of 2001. Quarter-to-quarter growth has been in the double-digit range since the fourth quarter of 2000, and amounted to a seasonally adjusted and annualised rate of 17,0 per cent in the third quarter of 2001. Twelve-month growth in M3 also accelerated considerably from 9,2 per cent in January 2001 to 17,9 per cent in August, but then receded somewhat to 14,5 per cent in September. Moreover, the recent strong rise in the supply of money occurred in long as well as shorter-term deposits, the latter normally being associated with a rise in domestic expenditure. 3.2 The growth in total domestic credit extension by the banking sector slowed down from a twelve-month rate of increase of 10,4 per cent in December 2000 to 6,7 per cent in September 2001. This mainly reflected a rise in government deposits with banks, together with a decline in the gross claims of the government over the past 18 months. Credit extension to the private sector was less subdued, recording twelve-month rates of increase straddling the 10 per cent level over the past year and registering 9,6 per cent in September 2001. Growth in mortgage advances, installment sale credit and leasing finance remains brisk, while the increase in other loans and advances is also starting to pick up. The recent increases in private-sector credit extension by the banks are probably related to the financing of international trade. 3.3 The government's Medium Term Budget Policy Statement of 30 October 2001, reaffirmed the prudent principles adhered to by the fiscal authorities. Although higher increases in social and infrastructural expenditure have been projected, strong growth in government revenue collection is forecast to maintain low deficits. The national government deficit for 2001/02 is now estimated at 2,3 per cent of gross domestic product, i.e. somewhat lower than an earlier budget projection of 2,5 per cent in February 2001. This deficit is then expected to increase slightly to 2,6 per cent in the fiscal year 2002/03, before receding again somewhat. The total public-sector borrowing requirement is also estimated at a magnitude of less than 2,5 per cent of gross domestic product in the current and each of the next three fiscal years. Moreover, the financing of these deficits should not present any problems. All budget parameters therefore remain conservative and supportive of the inflation target path. 4.1 Turnover in the bond market remained high with record transactions of R3,3 trillion in the third quarter of 2001. The market was characterised by strong demand from domestic investors and net sales by non-residents. Foreign sales started in early 2000 and persisted in 2001, with market sentiment strongly influenced by concerns about emerging-market stability, political events in other parts of Africa and the protracted weakness of the rand. At the same time, bond yields moved to eighteen-year lows in October and early November 2001, with the R153-bond, for example, trading at 10,10 per cent on 14 November 2001. 4.2 Activity in the secondary share market remained brisk in the first ten months of 2001 and foreign investor sentiment was bullish. Reflecting their underlying optimism about future economic prospects, non-residents' net purchases of shares totaled R25,8 billion over this period, compared with R17,4 billion in 2000 as a whole. As a result, domestic share prices rose by 4,5 per cent from the beginning of 2001 up to 10 September, in contrast to the poor performance of most other stock exchanges. Following the World Trade Center attacks, share prices fell by nearly 15 per cent until 21 September 2001. Subsequently they recovered again by about 24 per cent up to 14 November 2001. 4.3 After following the lowering of the repo rate by 50 basis points, money market rates have been fairly stable. The SAONIA rate currently fluctuates at a level of 60 to 80 basis points below the Bank's repo rate, whereas other interbank funding fluctuates between about 100 and 125 basis points below the repo rate. 4.4 Turnover in the real-estate market slowed somewhat in the first seven months of 2001, but was firmer in August and September. This brought the estimated value of transactions in the first nine months of the year to a level that was 15 per cent higher than in the corresponding period of 2000. Year-on-year increases in nominal house prices moved down, but remained in the double-digit range in the third quarter of 2001. BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND EXCHANGE RATE DEVELOPMENTS. 5.1 The current account of the balance of payments (seasonally adjusted and annualised) changed from a surplus of R6,3 billion in the second quarter of 2001 to a provisionally estimated deficit of just more than 1 per cent of gross domestic product in the third quarter. This deterioration in the current account balance was mainly the result of a substantial decline in exports, related to weak international demand and lower international commodity prices. 5.2 Despite considerable leads and lags in foreign payments and receipts and speculation against the exchange rate of the rand, a surplus was nevertheless recorded on the financial account of the balance of payments in the third quarter of 2001. Capital inflows during the third quarter could mainly be attributed to non-residents' net purchases of domestic equities listed on the share market, foreign direct investments and the government's borrowing on international capital markets. 5.3 The deficit on the current account was fully offset by a surplus on the financial account, leaving the net international reserves of the country nearly unchanged in the third quarter of 2001. Revaluation gains resulting from the depreciation of the rand and a syndicated loan of the central bank and government caused the gross gold and other foreign reserves to increase sharply. Import cover therefore improved from about 16 weeks' worth of imports of goods and services at the end of June 2001 to 20 weeks at the end of September 2001 - its highest level ever recorded. 5.4 This relatively sound overall balance-of-payments position notwithstanding, since 11 September the rand has depreciated from R8,54 against the dollar to R9,70 on 14 November 2001. The decline in the nominal effective exchange rate of the rand since the beginning of the year is approximately 19 per cent as at 14 November 2001. 6.1 The global economic slowdown and lower oil and other international commodity prices have helped to subdue domestic inflationary pressures in recent months. As a result, inflation has moderated meaningfully in all the broad measures of price change. 6.2 Over periods of twelve months, overall consumer price inflation in metropolitan and other urban areas, excluding interest cost on mortgage bonds, i.e. CPIX, declined from 8,2 per cent in August 2000 to 5,8 per cent in September 2001. Calculated from quarter to quarter and expressed at seasonally adjusted and annualised rates, the rate of increase in CPIX rose from 4,5 per cent in the second quarter of 2001 to 5,8 per cent in the third quarter. This rate still falls within the target range of between 3 and 6 per cent set for 2002 and 2003. Food prices contributed materially to the acceleration in CPIX inflation in the third quarter of 2001, but there was a modest acceleration in price growth even when omitting food prices from the index. 6.3 Production price inflation has also slowed down in recent months. The twelve-month rate of increase in the all-goods production price index declined from 10,0 per cent in December 2000 to 7,8 per cent in September 2001. The recent slowdown in production price inflation resulted mainly from lower international prices of crude petroleum. If energy is excluded, the twelve-month rate of increase in production prices fluctuated around 8 per cent in the first nine months of 2001. This was largely due to stable rates of increase in the prices of domestically produced goods over this period. 6.4 Most of the factors favourable for the containment of inflation in the coming months, which were outlined in the previous Monetary Policy Statement, still apply. Downward pressure on price increases is largely related to low increases in unit labour cost, subdued inflation in trading-partner countries, surplus production capacity in the economy, continued adherence to fiscal and monetary discipline, moderate credit growth and the recent decline in oil prices. Moreover, the deterioration in the current account of the balance of payments in the third quarter of 2001 was not due to excess demand conditions but rather to a weaker international demand for South African goods. The Reserve Bank projections therefore indicate that the inflation target for 2002 will be met. 6.5 The risk of higher inflation has, however, increased since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee. The weighted exchange rate of the rand against a basket of currencies has now declined substantially. To a large extent the effect of the depreciation of the rand has been absorbed by reduced labour costs and lower profit margins. The growth in operating surpluses of business enterprises has declined considerably in the third quarter of 2001. An expected lower demand for goods and services might lead to a further squeeze on profit margins. In the recent round of wage negotiations, wage settlements were higher than the inflation rate. In the event that wage growth exceeds productivity gains, pressure will be exerted on inflation. 6.6 Following the recommendations of the Joint Technical Committee on Inflation Targeting composed of officials of the South African Reserve Bank and the National Treasury, agreement was reached between the South African Reserve Bank and the Government on inflation targets for the period 2003 to 2005. For 2003 the inflation target is to remain at 3 to 6 per cent, while for 2004 and 2005 it is to be lowered to 3 to 5 per cent. These targets will be taken into account in all future monetary policy decisions."
Israel,2001-11-26,"26 November, 2001 Monetary program for December 2001 The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for December 2001, according to which its interest rate will be reduced by 0.3 percentage points to 5.8 percent. The Bank of Israel explains that assessments of inflation for the next few years: those derived from inflation expectations in the capital market, assessments by private forecasters, and those obtained from some of the models developed in the Bank: have declined again, and are currently within the long-term target range, and some of them are even lower than the target for 2002. The cut in the rate of interest for December is thus consistent with the achievement of the target for 2002 and the next few years. In the light of these developments, the Bank of Israelconsiders that at this stage, despite the significant deviation of the budget deficit from its target this year and that expected in 2002, the short-term rate of interest can be reduced, to continue providing support for real economic activity as the recessions takes deeper hold, without jeopardizing the attainment of the long-term inflation target. As is known, monetary policy aims to maintain the target of price stability set by the government, providing the necessary infrastructure for sustainable growth and bolstering the financial stability of the money, capital, and foreign-currency markets. This stability, which contributes to the strength of the economy, withstood the test of recent events in world capital markets in the wake of the terrorist attacks on the US, and makes it necessary to persist in maintaining fiscal and monetary discipline. The Bank of Israel advises that due to the turnaround in the economic situation arising from the worldwide slowdown and the realityof the security situation in Israel, it supports the formulation of a coordinated economic policy to encourage growth and employment. In this context it is important to change the composition of the budget by increasing the infrastructure investment element and the incentive to work rather than increasing transfer payments. This must be done while reverting to a downward budget-deficit path to enable the process of lowering the rate of interest to continue. Related to this is the need to change the wages structure in the public sector, adjusting wage drift to the low-inflation environment, to reduce the real burden imposed on the budget especially at a time of economic slowdown. It is therefore recommended that the minimum wage be adjusted according to the Consumer Price Index, plus a certain additional rate which will reflect the rise in productivity, and that the Law be enforced. The number of foreign workers should be reduced, inparticular those who are in Israel illegally. These steps, together with the maintenance of stability and the implementation of structural changes in the financial markets, will make it easier for the economy to get through the period of recession in domestic and foreign demand, and will place it in a more favorable position for renewed, sustainable, investment- and export-oriented growth. The Bank of Israel stresses that the rate of interest has been reduced by more than 5 percentage points in the last two year (from 11.2 percent to 5.8 percent), and it is now at its lowest level for many years. The real short-term rate of interest, i.e., the Bank's interest rate minus inflation expectations derived from the capital market, has also declined, and in October it stood at 4 percent, compared with 8 percent two years ago. In contrast, long-term real interest (i.e., the real yield on 10-year government bonds) has fallen relatively slowly in the last two years (from 5.2 percent to 4.7 percent). One relevant factor is the increase in government borrowing via tradable bonds in 2001 (about NIS 11 billion, compared with a planned amount of less than NIS 4 billion), due to the rise in the government deficit. This interest serves as a basis for interest on long-term loans, including mortgages and the financing of long-term projects, and is therefore an important element in economic growth. The risk premium which international capital markets ascribe to Israel's economy remained at the same level of about 1.1 percentage points for half a year and the premium for 10 years declined to 1.75 percentage points. The dip in the risk premium is apparently related to reduced uncertainty regarding the future worldwide and in Israel following the heightened uncertainty in the wake of the terrorist attacks on the US. The short-term interest-rate differential against the dollar is currently 4.0 percentage points, following the reduction of 0.5 of a percentage point in the US interest rate in October. The interest differentialfor 10 years is lower: interest on US government bonds is currently 4.6 percent, while the yield on unindexed Israel government bonds for the same period is 6.8 percent.

Thailand,2001-11-27,"Monetary Policy Committee Decision on 27 November 2001 Mr. Bandid Nijathaworn. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand announced that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to determine the monetary policy stance in view of the rapid economic changes, especially in regard to the external economies. The meeting today discussed the latest global economic developments and assessed the implications for Thailand's growth outlook for the next year. The MPC is of the view that the probability of the world economy moving into deep recession is now smaller, as major countries have progressively adopted an easing monetary and fiscal policy stance. In the case of Thailand, fiscal measures and disbursement in the early part of fiscal year 2002 will help cushion the impact of the global slowdown and should help support growth of 13-18 per cent in 2001 and 1-3 per cent in 2002 as previously forecasted. Core inflation, projected to be around 15-25 percent in 2002, remains well within the targeted range. With regard to the current monetary policy stance, the MPC views that this has supported external stability. The interest rate gap between Thailand and overseas has narrowed, with the resultant impact on capital flows, currency stability, and international reserves—which currently stands at around 138 percent of total private short-term debt and Bank of Thailand debt. The MPC assessed that under current economic conditions, the overall monetary policy stance will need to remain supportive. The country's real interest rate level remains relatively low compared to those in other countries, and is consistent with the need to support growth and stability. The MPC therefore decided to maintain the 14-day repurchase rate at 25 percent per annum but will closely monitor future developments with a view to moving to a more accommodative stance should the economic recovery turn out to be weaker than expected. Bank of Thailand 27 November 2001."
Poland,2001-11-28,"Information on the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council on November 27-28, 2001 The Monetary Policy Council held its meeting on 27-28 November 2001. The Council was submitted the materials prepared by the NBP Management Board and the departments as well as the information and analytical materials of the Ministry of Finance, banks and research institutes. On this basis, the Council discussed the development of the inflation rate; trends in the money supply, lending and interest rates; external conditions and the situation in a balance of payments, real sector of the economy and the public finance sector. I. Inflation rate, inflation expectations. 1. The annual growth rate of the consumer price index decreased to 4.0% in October 2001 from 4.3% in the previous month. 2. All measurements of the 12-month core inflation also decreased: o 15% average cut down from 4.6% to 4.2%; o the inflation rate excluding the controlled prices from 4.1% to 3.9%; o the inflation rate excluding the most fluctuating prices from 3.6% to 3.2%; o the inflation rate excluding the most fluctuating prices and fuels from 4.3% to 4.0%; o the ""net"" inflation rate (excluding prices of food and prices of fuels) from 5.8% to 5.5%; 3. According to the initial data of the Central Statistical Office (GUS), after the growth by 0.3% in July, 0.8% in August and 0.5% in September 2001, the prices of the industrial sales decreased by 0.4% in October 2001 compared with the previous month. In comparison with October 2000, the industrial sales prices decreased by 0.3%. 4. In November 2001, expectations of the individuals pertaining to the inflation rate in the future were considerably improved. A group of the most pessimistic individuals anticipating that the prices would grow faster than at present decreased by 3.2 percentage points and achieved the lowest level in the history of this survey (13.8%). On the other hand, the percentage of the respondents expecting that the prices would be the same as at present grew by 1.8 percentage points and reached the highest level in the history of the Demoskop´e survey (7.8%). A number of the individuals expecting that the growth rate of prices will be lower than at present was also considerably increased (by 2.6 percentage points to the level of 15.7%). The inflation rate anticipated by the bank analysts at the end of 2001 decreased to 4.2% from 5.2% a month before. The inflation expected within an 11-month perspective decreased by 0.3 percentage points and was 4.8%. In October 2001, the consumer price index and all the measurements of the 12-month core inflation decreased. Maintenance of the so called net inflation rate above the consumer price index [CPI] (by 1.5 percentage points) is the evidence of a positive impact of the groups of goods i.e. food and fuels excluded from this index. Declining trends in other measurements of the core inflation show that the observed decline of the inflation pertains to the majority of consumer goods and services and it is not caused only by the temporary factors. The industrial sales prices were lower than in the previous month and lower than a year before. The expectations of individuals pertaining to the future inflation were significantly improved. The future growth rate of prices anticipated by bank analysts was subject to further decline. II. Money supply, lending, interest rates. 1. An annual nominal growth rate of the total money supply (M2) was 13.1% (compared with 14.3% in the previous month) in October 2001. 2. The annual momentum of PLN deposits held by individuals dropped to 16.8% from 19.0% in September 2001. The decline of the PLN deposit growth in banks, however, was followed by the growth of individuals´ interest in other forms of savings investments e.g. savings bonds. 3. In October 2001, the annual momentum of the total lending decreased to 8.5% from 10.7% in the previous month. The momentum declined both in terms of household loans (to 16.4% from 18.7% in September 2001), and business loans (to 6.2% from 8.4% in the previous month). Compared with September 2001, the growth rate of monetary aggregates decreased which indicates further decline of the inflation pressure. Introduction of the savings income tax may result in negative effects in the savings tendencies. III. External conditions. 1. Since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Council, a number of forecasts indicating the deterioration of the world economy situation compared with the previous expectations has increased. Activation of the world-wide economy is likely to take place no sooner than in the second half of 2002. 2. In relation with the deterioration of the forecasts of the economic growth in the world, since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Council, the expectations pertaining to the future development of the oil prices have lowered. The likelihood that the economic growth rate in the world in 2001 and 2002 will be smaller than previously anticipated has increased. It means worse perspectives for the Polish export. Simultaneously, it is a limiting factor for the inflation pressure. Since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Council, the expectations pertaining to the future development of the oil prices have lowered. IV. Balance of payments, exchange rate. 1. In January-September, the Current Account Deficit was US$ 5.4 billion and was almost US$ 2.5 billion lower compared with the corresponding period in the previous year. Export was 10.2% higher than in January- September 2000, whereas the import momentum was 1.9%. 2. In October, the PLN exchange rate was reinforced relative to EURO (average exchange rate was PLN 3.74 compared with PLN 3.85 in September 2001), as well as US dollar (PLN 4.13 compared with PLN 4.22 last month). A considerable improvement of the current balance of payments proves the reinforcement of the macroeconomic equilibrium. V. Supply, demand, situation in the labour market and income. 1. In October 2001, the industrial sales was 1.4% higher than last year. The level of production in the comparable worktime, however, was approximately 0.8% lower than in October 2000. The construction output was 11% lower than last year (in September, the drop was 11.1%, and in August 2001 - 13.9%). 2. In January-September 2001, financial results of enterprises deteriorated. A net profit was PLN 2.7 billion compared with PLN 6.4 billion last year. Private enterprises recorded a net profit at the level of PLN 3.8 billion (5 billion last year), and the companies within the public sector made a loss of PLN 1.1 billion (compared with PLN 1.4 billion profit last year). 3. The employment in the enterprise sector declined in October by 0.3% compared with September 2001 and was 4.4% lower than last year. The unemployment rate grew to 16.4% from 16.3% last month. 4. In January-October 2001, an average salary in the enterprise sector was 7.3% higher in nominal terms and 1.4% higher in real terms compared with the corresponding period in 2000. Due to the decrease of staff numbers, the salary fund was, in real terms, lower than last year. An average old-age and disability pension in nominal terms was 10.3% higher in January-October compared with the corresponding period in 2000, and its purchasing power grew by 4.3%. A low level of economic activity remained unchanged. A situation in the labour market should continue to be favourable for the limitation of the salary pressure. Therefore, there is a small inflationary risk derived from the increase of demand. VI. Situation in the public finance sector. The Government approved a 2002 draft state budget that generally confirms earlier announcements that the state budget expenditure would be approximately PLN 183 billion, and the deficit would not exceed PLN 40 billion. In the area of public finance, there is still, however, a high uncertainty about the ultimate 2002 budget related to the course of Parliament´s work on the budget neighbouring laws. Even in the present format, the 2002 draft budget evokes some concern about its impact on a future economic growth and the possibility of improving the fiscal and monetary policy arrangement. The rate of real growth of the expenditure of the total public finance sector is only slightly lower than that in the draft prepared by the former government; some limitation of the state budget expenditure in 2002 was achieved by postponing some expenditure or allocating it to other parts of the public finance sector, an economic deficit was assumed at the higher level than it was in the former draft budget. VII. Decision of the Monetary Policy Council. 1. The 2002 draft Budget Law generally confirms the former announcements of the government pertaining to a format of the budget. This information was taken into account in the decision to reduce interest rates at the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Council and it does not constitute any reason to mitigate the monetary policy. 2. The economic data, however, that have occurred since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Council indicate further decrease of the inflation policy: o In October 2001, all measurements of the core inflation decreased; it indicates that the decline of the inflation rate does not derive only from the impact of the temporary factors but pertain to the majority of goods and services groups. o The industrial sales prices decreased; it indicates that their growth in July-September was likely to be temporary. In comparison with October 2000, the industrial sales prices decreased. It means lower pressure on the growth of consumer prices in the future. o The individuals´ expectations pertaining to the inflation in the future have clearly improved. The inflation expectations of bank analysts were further reduced. o The monetary factors developed more favourably for the future inflation: ▪ The growth rate of the total money supply per year decreased to 13.1% from 14.3% last month. ▪ The total lending momentum in 12 months decreased to 8.5% from 10.7% in September 2001. o The expectations concerning the future development of the oil prices have lowered. o Financial results of enterprises in January-September were worse compared with the corresponding period in 2000 which may mean lower investment demand in the future. 3. During the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Council some signals occurred confirming earlier trends favourable for the future inflation: o The economic growth rate in the world in 2001 and 2002 will be lower than expected. It means rougher conditions for the Polish export. It is simultaneously a limiting factor for the inflation pressure. o The situation in the labour market should reduce the salary pressure. 4. In this situation, the Monetary Policy Council made a decision to reduce the NBP interest rates by 1.5 percentage points and maintain a neutral attitude to the monetary policy. The Monetary Policy Council would also like to emphasise that it made the aggregated interest rate reductions by 7.5 percentage points in 2001. The minimum rate on the 28-day transactions in the open market was reduced from 19% to 11.5%, a bank discount rate from 21.5% to 14%, and a lombard rate from 23% to 15.5%. The ultimate effects of these reductions have not become visible yet. Simultaneously, there continues to be a serious uncertainty about the situation in the public finance sector in 2002 and 2003, the impact of the savings income tax on the savings behaviours and the scale of the necessary structural reforms that will be implemented. It should not be expected that this uncertainty be relieved in the nearest future. Both factors: a large scale of the total NBP interest rate reductions in 2001 and incomplete disclosure of their effects and maintenance of significant sources of uncertainty will be a major reason for further decisions of the Monetary Policy Council. National Bank of Poland and the Monetary Policy Council consider an option to undertake steps (conversion of the NBP bonds issued in reference to the reduction of the obligatory reserve reduction in 1999 into bonds of a market value) aimed at mitigation of a negative impact of the funds-based income tax on the bank deposit rates. In compliance with the 2001 Monetary Policy Guidelines. National Bank of Poland introduces a central bank deposit rate as of 1 December 2001. The deposit rate will determine a price that the central bank will offer to banks for making a short-term deposit. This instrument was introduced to reduce fluctuations of short-term interest rates in the interbank market. Introduction of the deposit rate is also a step to adapt the NBP instruments to the European Central Bank standards. The principles for deposit processing and servicing are defined by the resolution of the NBP Management Board on the terms and conditions for opening and maintaining of bank accounts by NBP and agreements concluded with banks. This instrument will be available to all banks holding current accounts in the Payments System Department (DSP). There will be a possibility to make an unsecured deposit before the end of a business day, the return date will be a beginning of the next day. The amount of the accepted deposits will not be limited. A deposit rate determined by the Monetary Policy Council (a deposit rate) will be lower than a reference rate (minimum rate on the open market transactions with a 28-day maturity). The Council assumes functioning of a symmetrical band of the central bank interest rates which means that the difference (expressed in percentage points) between the deposit rate and the reference rate will equal a difference between a lombard rate and the reference rate level. Moreover, this difference will depend on the NBP interest rates; it may be reduced when interest rates are lower. Thus, it will be possible to adapt a width of NBP rates band gradually depending on the changes in the reference rate level. Maintaining a symmetrical band of interest rates around the reference rate level will require a higher change of the lombard rate and a lower change of a deposit rate compared with the changes in the reference rate. This adaptation will be of a technical nature and will not mean a change of a general direction and the extent of the monetary policy restrictiveness. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Council will be held on 18-19 December 2001."
Peru,2001-12-05,"Monetary Program for 2001- Information Note: December 2001 For the month of December, the Board increased the range for its operating target at 150 - 160 million as a daily average. In November, the said balance was 146 million, which fell slightly above the announced range (135  145 million), as a consequence of a higher liquidity requirement reflected in higher temporary purchase of CDBCRP on November 30 The Central Bank Board of Directors also established that the following interest and commission rates would be used in domestic-currency Central Bank operations since December 6: For monetary regulation credits in domestic currency, the effective interest rate would be the weighted average of the interbank interest rates, or 5,0 percent, whichever is highest. Formerly, the said rate was 6,0 percent. For overnight deposits in domestic currency held by banks at the Central Bank, the effective interest rate will be 2,0 percent. The latter rate was 2,5 percent. For foreign exchange temporary purchase operations (swap operations), the commission implies an effective annual cost of 5,0 percent. The latter cost was 6,0 percent. The following interest rates will be used in foreign-currency operations: The effective annual rate for monetary regulation credits will be 4,5 percent. This rate rules since November For overnight deposits held by banks at the Central Bank, the rate is equivalent to the average obtained by the Central Bank for similar deposits abroad. The Central Bank grants monetary regulation credits in domestic and foreign currency on a regular basis. Besides, the Central Bank operations will be oriented to reduce volatility in the exchange market. If justified by financial conditions, the values mentioned above could be modified in order to ensure the attainment of the objective to preserve monetary stability, which mean avoiding inflationary or deflationary pressures."
Euroarea,2001-12-06,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here to report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. The Governing Council conducted a comprehensive examination of recent monetary and economic developments in order to assess the prospects for the maintenance of price stability in the euro area over the medium term. It concluded that the information which has become available since the Governing Council meeting of 8 November confirmed our expectations and thereby also the forward-looking decisions taken over the past few months by the Governing Council. Against this background, the Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The Governing Council continues to consider the current level of key ECB interest rates appropriate. Starting with the analysis under the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 rose to 6.8% in the period from August to October 2001. This was significantly above the medium-term reference value for annual M3 growth of 4 ½%. We confirmed this value of 4 ½% today in our annual review of the reference value. This decision was taken on the grounds that the evidence continues to support the medium-term assumptions underlying the derivation of the reference value, namely those for trend potential output growth of 2-2 ½% per annum and for a trend decline in M3 income velocity of ½-1% per annum in the euro area. We will issue a separate press release today providing further background to the confirmation of the reference value. In comparing current developments with the reference value we have to keep in mind that the reference value is a medium-term concept. Short-run movements of M3 may stem from a number of temporary factors and do not necessarily have implications for future price developments. For this reason the Governing Council made it clear already in 1998 that the announcement of the reference value does not entail a commitment on the part of the ECB to correct mechanistically deviations of monetary growth from the reference value. Rather, developments of M3 are thoroughly analysed by the ECB, in conjunction with other monetary indicators and information from the second pillar, in order to ascertain their implications for the risks to price stability over the medium term. The recent strong M3 growth confirmed our previous assessment that, in the phase of relatively high financial market uncertainty after the terrorist attacks on the United States, investors have shifted their portfolios towards liquid and relatively safe short-term assets included in M3. Such shifts should be temporary and should not be seen as indicating future inflationary pressures. This assessment of current monetary developments is also underpinned by the fact that credit growth to the private sector has been continuously falling over recent months. However, we will need to continue analysing developments in M3 closely. Should the current economic and financial market uncertainties subside, any persisting excess liquidity in the economy should be carefully reassessed with respect to whether it signals risks to price stability. Regarding the second pillar, recent information confirmed our earlier assessment that economic activity in the euro area has been weak in the second half of 2001 and will probably remain so in early 2002. This reflects the lower export demand resulting from the current slowdown in global economic activity and the fact that consumption and investment decisions in the euro area are being adversely affected by the current climate of economic uncertainty. However, the conditions are there for economic growth to improve in the course of 2002. There are no major imbalances in the euro area which would require a lengthy correction process. At the same time, financing conditions are very favourable in the euro area. Furthermore, the recent fall in oil prices and, more generally, the expected further decline in consumer price inflation will lead to higher growth in real disposable income and should thereby support domestic demand. Developments in financial markets over the past few weeks signal a more optimistic assessment by market participants of the economic growth prospects in the euro area. All available forecasts indicate an improvement of the euro area economy in the course of next year. In the current economic environment we should not expect medium-term upward pressures on inflation. The need to sustain employment growth in an environment of price stability will call for a continuation of the process of wage moderation. In the coming months, movements in annual inflation rates may be somewhat erratic on account of base effects relating to the relatively volatile pattern of price increases in late 2000 and early 2001. However, annual inflation rates are clearly on a downward trend and, barring any unforeseen volatility in components of the HICP, they should fall to safely below 2% next year. At the current juncture, it is important that fiscal policies maintain a medium-term orientation in order to support the credibility of the Stability and Growth Pact, thereby strengthening the confidence of consumers and investors. Government budget balances in 2001 are, on average for the euro area as a whole, expected to worsen for the first time since 1993, owing to the macroeconomic slowdown and the lack of expenditure restraint in countries which implemented significant tax cuts. The current slowdown presents a particular challenge for countries which have not yet attained budgetary positions close to balance or in surplus or which have high public debt-to-GDP ratios. Countries without structural fiscal imbalances can contribute to macroeconomic stability by letting automatic stabilisers fully operate. However, there is no case for fiscal activism, as this has often proven ineffective in the past and risks reintroducing imbalances. A key remaining challenge for the euro area is to strengthen the productive forces in the economy by providing the proper incentives for economic agents. The Governing Council believes that the potential upward impact on trend output growth from structural reforms and technological innovation could be large. However, while some progress has been made in the field of structural reform, significant further steps  especially in the labour and goods markets  need to be taken in order to achieve a permanent and significant increase in potential output growth in the euro area. Furthermore, in the fiscal area, governments should pursue determined structural expenditure reforms in order to create room for further tax cuts, and for absorbing the fiscal costs associated with the ageing of populations. Such reforms would enhance the effectiveness of the fiscal environment in supporting employment, investment and economic dynamism. Finally, let me say a few words on the forthcoming cash changeover. First of all, owing to the careful preparations by both the Eurosystem and the other parties involved in the logistics, the changeover is well on track. I gratefully acknowledge the efforts of all the staff of the Eurosystem as well as of banks, retailers, cash-in-transit companies, the vending machine industry and all others who are working hard to make this changeover a success. In economic terms, we expect the cash changeover to have no noticeable direct effects on the average price level in the euro area. This is largely due to the vigilance of consumers and the strong competition in the retail sector, but also reflects the commitment of governments not to increase the average level of administered prices in the context of the cash changeover. In addition, the effects of the cash changeover on M3 growth should remain very limited. Although we have seen a significant decline in currency in circulation over recent months, currency only represents a small fraction of M3 and a large part of its decline has been reflected in higher holdings of short-term deposits with banks. As regards liquidity in the euro area money market, the Eurosystem's operational framework will facilitate a successful cash changeover, as it ensures maximum flexibility in the implementation of monetary policy. Lastly, the model chosen by the Eurosystem to debit the banks for the frontloaded euro cash will help to smooth this process: the banks will not be debited on one single date, but rather one-third at a time on the settlement dates of the main refinancing operations on 2, 23 and 30 January. To conclude, we expect this event to run smoothly and look forward to a good start to the relationship between European citizens and their new currency. Let me now give the floor to the Vice-President, who will inform you about some other issues addressed by the Governing Council. First. I should like to mention that tomorrow the third seminar with high-ranking officials from the central banks of the EU accession countries will be held in Berlin. The seminar, organised by the ECB in co-operation with the Deutsche Bundesbank, will focus in particular on the structures and functioning of the financial sector in the accession countries. It will be followed by a press conference scheduled to begin at 4 p.m. tomorrow. It includes a staff increase of about 3%, which will bring the number of ECB staff members to slightly below 1,150 by the end of 2002. Third, the Governing Council has adopted Decisions on the issue of euro banknotes and the allocation of monetary income. These two Decisions and a related press release will be published in all 11 official Community languages on the ECB's website this afternoon. Finally, as the euro banknotes and coins will become a reality for all citizens of the euro area in less than one month. I should like to invite you to join the ECB for a special event in Frankfurt on the eve of the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins. During the morning of 31 December the President of the ECB will award prizes to the 24 children, two from each euro area country, who are the winners of the ""Be a Euro SuperStar"" competition. This competition, which was organised by the ECB and the 12 national central banks of the euro area, attracted more than 300,000 entries."
South Korea,2001-12-06,"The economy showed signs of improvement during October, led mainly by domestic demand. Although industrial production declined due to the Chuseok factor, both consumption and construction investment continued to grow steadily and the contraction of facilities investment moderated further. Consumer price inflation eased to 3.4 percent on a year-on-year basis(-0.5 percent on a month-on-month basis) in November owing to declines in the prices of farm products and petroleum-based products, keeping its downward trend evident since June. The core Consumer Price Index, though, rose 4.0 percent on a year-on-year basis(0.1 percent on a month-on-month basis), slightly more than in the previous month, due to rises in service charges including housing rents. Financial markets appear to remain largely stable. Long-term interest rates and stock prices rose while the won appreciated on expectations of economic recovery. The volatility of these variables increased substantially and the inflow of funds into the bond market declined with the rise of market interest rates. There was little difficulty in corporate financing, however, thanks mainly to the ample market liquidity. The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain its benchmark overnight call rate at around its current level in December. The economic outlook is still uncertain, but the external environment has improved to a certain degree and the effects of the policy measures already taken to boost the economy are now gradually making themselves felt. Monetary policy will continue to be conducted in a flexible manner, keeping a careful watch on the status of business activity, price movements and the financial markets."
Poland,2001-12-19,"Information on the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council on December 18-19, 2001 The Monetary Policy Council held its meeting on December 18-19, 2001. The Council was submitted the materials prepared by the Management Board and departments of the NBP and information and analytical materials prepared by the Ministry of Finance, banks and research institutes. On this basis, the Council discussed inflation; tendencies in the area of money supply, lending and interest rates; external conditions and the situation in the balance of payments, real sector of the economy and in public finance sector. I. Inflation, inflation expectations. 1. The consumer price index on the twelve-month scale lowered from 4.0% a month before to 3.6%. However, 58% of this drop are justified by the factors that may be temporary, i.e. changes of foodstuffs and fuel prices. 2. In November this year, the sold industrial output prices were lower by 0.4% than in October this year (a month before they lowered by 0.6%). The biggest price drop has been noted in the production of coke and the petroleum refining products (by 5.6%). As compared to November 2000, the industrial output prices lowered by 0.8%. 3. In the survey made at the beginning of December this year, the future inflation expectations of individuals worsened. The percentage of the most pessimistic individuals forecasting that the prices will grow faster than currently increased by 6.2 percentage points (to 20.0%). The remaining groups of the surveyed with more optimistic expectations decreased. The inflation rate expected by bank analysts at the end of the year lowered from 4.2% a month before to 4.0%. The inflation expected in the 11-month horizon lowered by 0.1 percentage point and amounted to 4.7%. In November this year, the growth pace of consumer goods and services prices decreased on the twelve-month scale. However, it mainly resulted from factors that may be temporary - changes of foodstuffs and fuel prices. The sold industrial output prices were lower than a month before and lower than a year before. In December this year, the future inflation expectations of individuals worsened. The inflation expectations of bank analysts were subject to further decrease. II. Money supply, loans, interest rates. 1. The nominal growth pace of total money supply (M2) on the twelve-month scale lowered from 13.1% in October to 11.9% in November this year. 2. In November this year, the total amount of household savings at banks decreased by PLN 1.8 billion as compared to October this year. PLN-denominated deposits placed by businesses increased by PLN 4.1 billion. The dynamics of PLN-denominated deposits placed by individuals on a twelve-month scale lowered from 19.0% in September and 16.8% in October to 13.4% in November this year. 3. In November this year, the annual dynamics of total lending lowered from 8.7% a month before to 8.1%. The drop of the dynamics has been noted in case of both the loans to households (from 16.4% to 15.9%) and to businesses (from 6.4% to 5.9%). For the first time since 1997 a monthly drop of PLN-denominated deposits of individuals has been noted. First of all, it is a result of the introduction of bank placements income tax. In order to escape from the taxation, individuals transferred their resources to the other forms of saving (bonds and investment funds). As a result of banks' actions to counteract the money outflow from the banking system, the savings placed at banks have been shifted to long-term placements. In November this year, the total amount of funds held by businesses at banks increased. The demand for loans is still at a low level. In November, the dynamics of total money supply decreased. III. External conditions. 1. There are maintained the forecasts indicating that the boom in the world economy will probably take place in the second half of 2002. In the 4th quarter this year the GDP drop is possible for both the United States and the euro zone. 2. The forecasts for the petroleum prices on the world markets did not change. There are maintained the forecasts indicating that the boom in the world economy will take place in the second half of 2002. It means worse outlooks for the Polish exports. At the same time, it is a factor that reduces the inflation pressure. Since the last meeting of the Council, stable are also forecasts for petroleum prices on the world markets. IV. Balance of payments, exchange rate. 1. Within the period January-October this year, the current account deficit amounted to USD 6.0 billion and was lower by USD 2.7 billion than in the same period last year. Exports were bigger by 10.5% than within the period January- October 2000, while the dynamics of imports amounted to 2.6%. 2. In November this year, the exchange rate of the zloty strengthened against both the euro (the average exchange rate amounted to PLN 3.64 as compared to PLN 3.74 in October this year) and the dollar (PLN 4.09 as compared to PLN 4.13 a month before). The improvement of the current account balance indicates the strengthening of the external balance of the Polish economy. The observed strengthening of the exchange rate of the zloty mainly results from the inflow of foreign capital invested in Treasury securities. V. Supply, demand, situation on labor market and income. 1. In the 3rd quarter this year, the Gross Domestic Product was lower by 0.8% than in the 3rd quarter last year. In real terms, the domestic demand was lower by 2% than a year before what was mainly caused by the drop of gross investments in fixed assets by 13.6%. Faster than in the 2nd quarter was the growth of individual consumption (2.1% as compared to 1.6%). The negative net export decreased to PLN 4.8 billion from PLN 7.7 billion in the 2nd quarter and PLN 10.1 billion a year before. 2. In November this year, the sold industrial output was lower by 0.8% than a year before. The construction and assembling production was lower by 9.8% than a year before. 3. The employment in the enterprise sector lowered in November this year by 0.5% as compared to October this year and it was lower by 4.3% than a year before. 4. Within the period January-November this year, average wages in the enterprise sector were bigger by 7.3% in nominal terms and by 1.6% in real terms than within the same period last year. A low level of economic activity has been maintained. Within latest months, due to the drop of inflation, the growth pace of wages in real terms in the enterprise sector accelerated. VI. Situation in public finance sector. The economic deficit of public finance sector in 2001 will be bigger than it was forecasted before and it will amount to approximately 5.2% GDP. Since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Council, the evaluation of the situation in public finance sector in 2002 has not been changed: the project of the budget for 2002 raises concern about its impact on a future economic growth and the possibility of the improvement of fiscal and monetary policies scheme. Some legal solutions contained in the budget-related acts which decide on the final shape of the budget for 2002 constitute a step in the right direction. However, their scale is not sufficient for a permanent solution of public finance sector problems. The enactment of budget-related acts by the Sejm should be treated as a confirmation of earlier information on the shape of the state budget for 2002. VII. Decision of the Monetary Policy Council. 1. The Monetary Policy Council wishes to remind that in 2001 it cut the interest rates by 7.5 percentage points in total. The full results of cuts, especially these made in October and November by 3 percentage points in total, have not been revealed yet. 2. At the same time, there are maintained sources of uncertainty: o Situation in public finance sector in 2002 and 2003. The enactment of some budget-related acts by the Sejm increases the probability that the budget for 2002 will be consistent with the project of the government. However, this information has already been taken into consideration by the Monetary Policy Council. o Savings income tax impact on the tendency to save. The introduction of tax on bank placements income will put the level of deposit interest closer to the level of inflation what may lead to a drop of tendency to save. o The scale of necessary structural reforms that will be made. 3. The new data that appeared since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Council are of different nature. On one hand: o Consumer price index lowered to 3.6%, however, a considerable part of this drop is justified by factors that may be temporary, i.e. changes of foodstuffs and fuel prices; o Sold industrial output prices were lower than a month before and lower than a year before; o The dynamics of money supply and lending decreased; o The forecasts of economic situation worldwide and petroleum prices did not change; o A low level of economic activity is maintained. 4. On the other hand: o Future inflation expectations of individuals worsened; o For the first time since 1997, a monthly drop of PLN-denominated deposits of individuals took place that mainly resulted from the enactment of the act introducing bank placements income tax; the decline of deposits was not prevented by banks offering long-term placements; o The economic deficit of public finance sector in 2001 will be bigger than it was expected earlier. Considering the 3 mentioned above reasons, the Monetary Policy Council decided to maintain the parameters of monetary policy at the actual level, i.e. maintain the basic interest rates of the NBP and the neutral position in monetary policy. According to the Guidelines of Monetary Policy for 2002, the Monetary Policy Council made a decision to lower the obligatory reserve ratio from the level of 5% to 4.5%. This decision will not result in the increase of banking sector liquidity as very soon the Management Board of the NBP will make a decision on the liquidation of possibility to hold the obligatory reserve in vault cash by banks. This decision constitutes an element of adjustment to the standards of the European System of Central Banks. At the same time, the Council adopted the Financial Plan of the National Bank of Poland for 2002 that provides for the exchange of NBP bonds issued due to the cut of obligatory reserve ratio in 1999 into market interest bonds. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Council will be held on January 29-30, 2002."
Israel,2001-12-23,"Changes in the Bank of Israel's Monetary Program December 2001 and January 2002. The Bank of Israel today announced changes in its monetary program (for December 2001 and January 2002), according to which its interest rate will be reduced by 2.0 percentage points to 3.8 percent, effective from Tuesday, 25 December, 2001. The Bank of Israel explains that this exceptional change in interest-rate policy is being made against the background of the government's decision to revert to a path of fiscal discipline, i.e., the cutback in budget expenses, and the decisions leading to improvements in the financial and foreign-currency markets, as set out below. The Bank adds that maintaining fiscal discipline in accordance with the government's decision will place the government debt/GDP ratio back onto its downward path, and will contribute toa reduction in medium- and long-term interest rates, while protecting Israel's rating in international markets. This, together with the cut in the short-term interest rate, will encourage investment and support the creation of new jobs. The Bank of Israel explains that this exceptional change in the interest rate is intended to help the economy emerge from the slowdown which it is experiencing due to external factors, and to boost employment while maintaining price stability. As mentioned above, this amounts to a change in the mix of economic policy, with the maintenance of fiscal discipline over the next few years by setting a downward path for deficit targets from 2002 onwards on the one hand, and expansionary monetary policy on the other. The Bank stresses that it continues to adhere to a policy that supports the stability of both prices and the financial markets and institutions. These policy changes were formulatedagainst the background of the joint decision of the Minister of Finance and the Governor of the Bank of Israel, in conjunction with the Prime Minister, to introduce the following structural changes in the financial markets: 1. The abolition of the ceiling on theissuance of Treasury bills, making it possible to replace bank deposits in the Bank of Israel, which are not negotiable, with Treasury bills, which are traded on the stock market. This will create the infrastructure that is needed for the development of the money market. 2. Increasing the share of investmentswhich institutional investors (provident funds, pension funds, and life insurance funds) are permitted to invest abroad, from the current 5 percent to 20 percent, to be followed by the complete removal of the limit by the end of 2002. 3. Making the exchange-rate regime more flexible, following several similar adjustments made since 1989, whereby the slope of the lower limit of the crawling band is reduced to zero (i.e.,the lower limit is made horizontal) and that limit is lowered by 1 percentage point to a constant rate of NIS 4.1 to the exchange-rate basket. The Bank of Israel notes the great importance of continuing with the structural changes in the money and foreign-currency markets. The removal of the ceiling on Treasury bills will lead to the development of the market and increase competition between nonbank channels and the banking system by offering a tradable alternative, which will help reduce the banking margin in the local-currency segment. This step will also create an infrastructure for the development of unindexed privatesecurities markets as well as expanding the markets for derivatives in theunindexed local-currency segment. The increase in the share of investment abroad permitted to provident funds, life insurance companies and pension funds from 5 percent to 20 percent and the total removal of the limit at theend of 2002 will enable investments abroad of long-term savings to be spread more widely, to the benefit of the saver, and make the NIS a convertiblecurrency, like the currencies of the developed countries. These measures, which contribute to the development and greater flexibility of the financial markets, will enable the inflation target to be attained at lower rates of interest. 1. The abolition of the ceiling on theissuance of Treasury bills, making it possible to replace bank deposits in the Bank of Israel, which are not negotiable, with Treasury bills, which are traded on the stock market.

Philippines,2001-12-25,"The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) is formally adopting inflation targeting as the framework for monetary policy beginning January 2002. Under the new framework, the BSP will be committed to achieve the Government's average annual inflation target of 5.0-6.0 percent for 2002 and 4.5-5.5 percent for 2003. These targets have been set in coordination with the Development Budget and Coordination Committee consisting of the Department of Finance(DOF), the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) and the Office of the President (OP) as well as the BSP. The adoption of the new framework of monetary policy is being supported by the members of the DBCC. Since 2000, the BSP has been conducting nationwide public consultations with various groups including the Government, the academe, the banking community, the private sector and the media. These public consultations will continue in 2002. Inflation targeting is envisioned to strengthen the BSP's ability to deliver on its mandate of promoting price stability conducive to sustainable and balanced economic growth. This framework commits the BSP to sound fundamentals in the formulation and implementation of monetary policy. The important elements of the new framework are as follows:. Formal announcement of the inflation target. The new framework involves the announcement of a specific quantitative inflation target which the BSP— with the support of the Government—commits to achieve through appropriate adjustments in the various monetary policy instruments. Greater transparency and accountability. Inflation targeting will also promote greater transparency and accountability—two important features of good governance. The announcement of a specific quantitative target will allow the public to judge the performance of the BSP vis-à-vis its primary mandate by comparing actual inflation against the inflation target. The BSP will also publish a quarterly inflation report in addition to other reports that it has been regularly providing the market. The quarterly inflation report will contain a review of economic and financial developments and their effects on inflation, an assessment of monetary conditions, an analysis of the demand and supply conditions affecting future inflation, an explanation of the motivations for the BSP's recent monetary policy actions, and a discussion of the inflation outlook over the policy horizon. The intention is to communicate clearly to the public the Government's inflation target as well as the BSP's policy intentions and actions and the reasons behind them. In addition, the minutes of the discussion of the Monetary Board on monetary policy issues will also be published with some time lag in order to provide the public with an account of the grounds for monetary policy decisions. In the event that actual inflation deviates from the inflation target, the BSP will issue an open letter to the President explaining the reasons behind such deviation along with the measures to be adopted to bring inflation back to target. Overall, the new framework is expected to strengthen the BSP's strategic role in promoting sustainable economic growth by keeping inflation low, stable and predictable and the banking system safe and sound."
Thailand,2001-12-25,"Monetary Policy Board's Decision on 25 December 2001 Mr. Pakorn Malakul na Ayudhya. Deputy Governor. Bank of Thailand announced that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to determine the appropriate stance of monetary policy in light of recent developments in the domestic and global economy. The MPC agreed that Thailand's external position has improved satisfactorily. In particular, the stability of the Baht together with the high level of international reserves has strengthened investor confidence both domestically and abroad. However the outlook for economic growth remains weak. he latest data from abroad continue to indicate an uncertain global economic outlook, one in which a further retrenchment of world demand cannot be ruled out. Downside risks stem from the possibility of continued slowdown in the US and Japanese economies, as well as in other major trading partners of Thailand with important repercussions for export growth and the recovery process in Thailand. Moreover the lower trend for inflation is exerting upward pressure on real interest rates which may hamper the recovery process. With core inflation projected to remain contained in the range of 15-25 percent for 2002 and external stability remaining strong, there is scope for an easing of monetary policy. To support the economic recovery, the MPC has therefore decided to reduce the 14-day repurchase rate by 025 percent from the current 25 percent per annum to 225 percent per annum. Bank of Thailand 25 December 2001."
