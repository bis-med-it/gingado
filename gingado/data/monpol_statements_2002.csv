Euroarea,2002-01-03,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I will report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB, which was also attended by the President of the ECOFIN Council. Mr. Rato, as well as by Commissioner Solbes. As usual, we examined recent monetary, financial and economic developments. The Governing Council concluded that recent developments are in line with the interest rate decisions taken in the course of last year. We have therefore decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We also confirmed that the current level of key ECB interest rates remains appropriate for the maintenance of price stability over the medium term. Starting with the analysis under the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 rose to 7.4% in the period from September to November 2001, from 6.7% in the period from August to October. These high levels of the growth rate of M3 over the past few months reflect a particularly marked preference for liquid holdings by euro area investors in an economic and financial environment characterised by exceptionally high uncertainty worldwide. However, this should remain a temporary phenomenon which does not indicate future inflationary pressures. This judgement notwithstanding, the continued acceleration of M3 and the ongoing process of building up liquidity will require a thorough analysis of monetary developments in the months to come. Regarding the second pillar, recent information has confirmed our earlier assessment that economic activity in the euro area was weak in the second half of 2001 and will probably remain so in early 2002. However, there are signs which point to a gradual recovery in the course of this year, as reflected, for example, in financial market developments or in recent survey data which indicate that the decline in confidence may have bottomed out. There are no fundamental imbalances which would require a longer correction process, and the general positive conditions for an improvement in economic activity remain in place. Financing conditions, in particular, are very favourable, and the expected further decline in consumer price inflation will lead to higher growth in real disposable income which should support domestic demand. All in all, available data remain in line with a recovery of the euro area economy this year, while the timing and strength of this upturn remain uncertain. Continued close monitoring of further incoming information is thus warranted. In the current economic environment we do not expect medium-term upward pressures on inflation. However, as has been stated several times in the past, annual inflation rates for the months to come may be somewhat erratic on account of base effects as a consequence of the unwinding of past increases in energy prices and, albeit to a lesser extent, in food prices. In this connection, the possibility of some short-lived upward movements in the annual rate of inflation cannot be ruled out, but this should not be a cause for concern. Likewise, downward shifts resulting from such base effects later in the spring should not signal a change in the longer-term outlook for price stability. As regards the cash changeover, we do not expect any noticeable effect on the price level, largely due to strong competition in the retail sector, continued awareness on the part of consumers and the commitment of governments not to increase the average level of administered prices; however, we will of course remain vigilant. Beyond short-term developments, we expect that wage moderation in the euro area will continue and that demand pressure on prices will remain subdued, although there are some grounds for concern about forthcoming wage negotiations. It is therefore particularly important to point to the indispensable role of continued wage moderation in fostering employment and maintaining a favourable outlook for price stability. On the basis of current information, annual inflation rates should fall safely below 2% this year and thereafter remain at levels consistent with price stability over the foreseeable future. Any factor which might alter this assessment in either direction will be carefully examined. Let me also stress today how important it is for fiscal policies to maintain a medium-term orientation within the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact. The current weakness in economic growth undoubtedly presents a particular challenge for those countries which have not yet attained budgetary positions close to balance or in surplus or which have high public debt-to-GDP ratios. However, rather than being detrimental to a return to sustainable economic growth, their adherence to their medium-term objectives will strengthen consumer and investor confidence. Countries without fiscal imbalances can, of course, allow automatic stabilisers to operate fully. Finally. I should like to reiterate our views on structural reform  particularly following the successful introduction of the euro banknotes and coins. The key challenge for the euro area, now more than ever, is to continue to strengthen the forces of production and expand the trend output growth of the economy in a decisive manner. This will require a deepening of structural reform in the labour and goods markets, as well as technological innovation. Likewise, governments should pursue determined reforms with regard to the size and structure of public expenditure and revenue, also in order to create room for further tax cuts and to absorb the fiscal costs of population ageing. Together with continued wage moderation aimed at sustaining recent labour market gains, these reforms will foster employment and investment. With the ECB pursuing its primary objective of price stability, with governments willing to foster structural reforms and conduct stability-oriented fiscal policies, and with wage developments consistent with job creation and price stability, the euro  which is now also available in the form of banknotes and coins  will represent an economic area characterised by macroeconomic stability and economic dynamism."
South Korea,2002-01-10,"The economy showed signs of improvement during November last year. Industrial production increased while there was sustained growth of both consumption and construction investment and, notably, a shift of facilities investment to positive growth. Consumer prices rose 3., 2 percent on a year-on-year basis(0., 2 percent on a month-on-month basis) in December owing to increases in the prices of farm-livestock-fishery products and housing rents, whose effects offset a decline in those of petroleum-based products. Core consumer prices, meanwhile, rose 3., 9 percent on a year-on-year basis(0., 4 percent on a month-on-month basis). Financial markets continued to remain largely stable. Although the volatility of price variables such as interest rates, stock prices and the exchange rate increased substantially and corporate bonds continued to record a net redemption, conditions for corporate financing appeared to be relatively favorable, thanks mainly to the weak demand for funds from the corporate sector amid ample market liquidity. Although there remains uncertainty over the external and domestic environments, conditions in the real sector have continued to improve. Therefore, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain its benchmark overnight call rate at around its current level in January. Monetary policy will continue to be conducted in a flexible manner, keeping a careful watch on the status of business activity, price movements and the financial markets. Inflation Target Following consultation with the government, the inflation target for the year 2002 has been set at 3\xc2\xb11 percent, based on the annual rate of increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) after stripping out non-cereal agricultural products and petroleum-based products. The mid-term inflation target will, meanwhile, be kept at 2., 5 percent on an annual average basis in order to stabilize inflationary expectations among the general public and maintain the credibility of monetary policy. The utmost efforts will be exerted to stabilize consumer prices as soon as possible toward a level consistent with the mid-term inflation target from next year onwards. Monetary Policy in the Year 2002 \xc2 < Basic Stance > The Bank of Korea will conduct monetary policy flexibly in line with the developments of internal and external environments in order to boost the economy, paying keen attention to the development of inflationary pressures., 1. Interest Rate Policy The Bank of Korea will adjust the overnight call rate flexibly in line with the state of prices and of the real and financial sectors and changes in the international environment with a view to assisting the economic recovery on the basis of price stability. It will also endeavor to slow the level of price increases to converge on the mid-term inflation target as soon as possible, extending the policy horizon to next year and beyond. Careful watch will be kept on the movements of real asset prices so that the low interest rate policy does not translate into heightened volatility of real asset prices, thereby generating inflationary expectations among the general public. This year the government intends to carry out fiscal policy with a focus on early economic recovery, while increased volatility of price variables including interest rates, stock prices and foreign exchange rates is anticipated in accordance with the developments in the external environment. Therefore, there should be close coordination between interest rate, exchange rate and fiscal policies. In addition, due to the enlarged transaction volume of financial markets and the improvement of the financial system, changes in financial asset prices have become more useful as an information variable for the establishment of monetary policy. Therefore, the Bank of Korea will monitor and analyze them more closely and will take appropriate steps so that call rate adjustments are transmitted more effectively to the real and financial sectors. Money Supply This year\'s monitoring range for annual M3 growth rate has been set at 8 to 12 percent, a little higher than that of last year. The private sector\'s demand for money is expected to expand over the year as the economy moves into a recovery phase while it is anticipated that money supply through the foreign channel will be maintained thanks to inflows of foreign investment funds. A careful watch will be kept on the movements of monetary indicators including those newly compiled. New monetary indicators are to be introduced from this year, which are based on the degree of liquidity of financial products offered by financial institutions as a whole from this year. It is anticipated that the usefulness and promptness of monetary indicators will be correspondingly heightened. Credit Policy The allocation of the Aggregate Credit Ceiling will be changed to encourage banks to expand their supply of funds to firms and credit-based lending. The Aggregate Credit Ceiling system will be operated to support the constant amelioration of settlement practices in commercial transactions and the scale of loans allocated to the bank activities concerned will be well balanced within the current ceiling (11., 6 trillion won). The Bank of Korea stands ready to provide timely ""Liquidity Adjustment Loans"" to banks facing temporary liquidity shortages arising from the enlarged portfolio shifts among financial institutions in the process of restructuring. Other Activities The Bank of Korea will analyze the transmission mechanism of monetary policy thoroughly and reflect the outcome in establishing its policy. Its information-gathering capacity will be augmented in the financial markets, through which the effects of monetary policy are transmitted, in line with the rapid changes of the financial environment including the move to develop large-sized banks, and its findings will be taken into account in the establishment and conduct of monetary policy."
South Africa,2002-01-15,"Issued by Mr T T. Mboweni. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, at a meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee in Pretoria. A special meeting was called today of the newly constituted Monetary Policy Committee to discuss the appropriate monetary policy stance in view of the effects of recent economic developments on the outlook for inflation. The steep depreciation of the rand has altered inflationary expectations in South Africa which endangers the attainment of the inflation targets. To counter second round effects of the depreciation on inflation, the Monetary Policy Committee decided to increase the repo rate by 1 percentage point to 10,50 per cent with effect from 16 January 2002. It is envisaged that this decision will lead to corresponding increases in the lending rates of domestic private banks. This decision should not have a material effect on domestic economic activity because of the stimulatory impact of the currency depreciation during the second half of 2001. Note to editors: The repo rate was last changed on 21 September 2001, when it was reduced from 10,0 per cent to 9,5 per cent."
Philippines,2002-01-16,"The Monetary Board decided today to reduce by 25 basis points the Bangko Sentral's overnight borrowing and lending rates to 7.5 percent and 9.75 percent, respectively, effective Friday, 18 January 2002. At 7.5 percent, the BSP's overnight RRP rate is the lowest since 1 September 1995. This brings the cumulative reduction in the BSP's policy rates to 750 basis points since December 2000. This decision marks the first action of the Monetary Board under the inflation targeting framework. Expectations of a tame inflation outlook consistent with the inflation target for the year have provided the BSP with leeway to further ease monetary policy. The Monetary Board also considered the decline in foreign interest rates in its decision to cut the policy rates. The reduction in interest rates is expected to help stimulate domestic demand, which should counter the slack posed by still weak global economic conditions. The Monetary Board also approved another two -percentage point reduction in the liquidity reserve requirement on deposits and deposit substitute liabilities, common trust funds (CTFS) and trust and other fiduciary liabilities (TOFA) of commercial banks and non-banks with quasi-banking functions (NBQBs), also effective 18 January 2001. This move effectively restores the liquidity reserves to the pre-July 2001 level at 7.0 percent. This measure is expected to free up liquidity of about P26.0 billion over time as banks eventually transform the “free liquidity” into loans for productive activities. Greater liquidity could lead to a further downtrend in market interest rates, which could help enhance the repayment capability of firms and provide a boost to the fiscal position. Altogether, these factors could raise market sentiment, and spur economic growth. The Monetary Board also approved a change in the structure in the tiering scheme on the BSP's overnight RRP window as follows: 7.5 percent for placements of up to P5 billion, 4.5 percent for the next P5 billion, and 1.5 percent for placements in excess of P10 billion. This measure is expected to induce banks to shift the additional liquidity due to the easing of the monetary policy settings into lending for productive activities. Going forward, the Bangko Sentral will continue to closely monitor factors that could affect the inflation outlook to ensure that price stability consistent with the economy's growth objective is achieved. The Monetary Board is scheduled to deliberate on the appropriate stance of monetary policy on 12 February 2002, four weeks from now. However, this does not preclude the Monetary Board from meeting before this date if the situation calls for it."
Thailand,2002-01-21,"Monetary Policy Board's Decision on 21 January 2002 Mr. Pakorn Malakul na Ayudhya. Deputy Governor. Bank of Thailand announced that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments, both domestically and abroad, in order to determine the appropriate course of monetary policy going forward. The MPC assessed the impact of the reduction in the 14-day repurchase rate, the BOT's policy rate, on 25 December 2001 from 25 percent per annum to 225 percent per annum and deemed that the effects so far have been favourable. In particular, financial markets have moved in line with the monetary policy stance and the baht has remained stable. Preliminary data on the last quarter of 2001 point to signs of economic recovery in some areas, including domestic production and consumption, on the back of the accelerated disbursement of the fiscal stimulus package. At the same time, inflation continues to follow a downward trend, while external stability remains strong with further reduction in foreign debt and a strong foreign reserves position. Although economic growth in 2002 is set to improve following a more rapid disbursement of government expenditures in line with the 2002 budget and an improved export performance, the MPC agreed that the projected recovery of the world economy in the second half of this year remains clouded by significant uncertainties. Therefore the MPC is of the view that monetary policy should be eased for the following main reasons: 1. To help ease the burden on fiscal policy of stimulating the economy and thereby facilitating a reduction in the growth of public debt. 2. The inflation rate remains low, allowing monetary policy to be expansionary without creating inflationary pressures. To facilitate adjustments in the exchange rate that will not hamper exporters. For the reasons outlined above, and in order to create monetary conditions favourable to the revival of private business activities as well as economic recovery, the MPC has decided to reduce the 14-day repurchase rate by another 025 percent from the current 225 percent per annum to 200 percent per annum. Bank of Thailand 21 January 2002."
Israel,2002-01-28,"The Bank of Israel's Monetary Program for February 2002. The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for February 2002, according to which its interest ratewill remain at its present level of 3.8 percent. The Bank of Israel explains that although inflation expectations for the next few years-those derived from the capital markets, private forecasters' predictions, and inflation estimations derived from some of the models developed in the Bank of Israel-have risen, most of them are at the upper limit of the target ranges of 2-3 percent for 2002 and 1-3 percent from 2003 onwards. Despite the evident rise in thedegree of uncertainty in the financial markets, there are indications thatagainst the background of the reduced level of economic activity, the changes in the exchange rate are likely to result in a one-time rise in prices,and not a return to a path of inflation. At this stage, therefore, it is possible to maintain price and financial stability without changing the interest rate. Monetary policy is aimed at preserving price stability set by the government as its target-a sine qua non for sustainable economic growth and for strengthening financial stabilityin the money, capital and foreign-currency markets. This stability, which adds to the soundness of the economy, requires the maintenance of fiscal and monetary discipline. The Bank of Israel reduced the interest rate at the end of 2001 by an exceptional two percentage points as partof a change to the mix of economic policy, which included a government decision to revert to a tight fiscal policy and a declining path for the budget deficit and government debt in the next few years. The importance of reducing the deficit and government debt and their effect on long-term interest rate and on the stability of the financial and foreign-currency markets must be emphasized. The budget deficit decided upon for 2002, three percent of GDP, must therefore be adhered to, otherwise uncertainty-which has risen recently due to the worldwide recession and the security situation-will increase further, and will make it more difficult to recover from the recession and boost employment even when the external conditions are more favorable. Moreover, if stability in the foreign-currency market is not achieved, and if medium- and long-term interest rates rise as a result of the budget deficit exceeding the level set for it and expectations that the deficit willcontinue to increase, then the short-term interest rate will have to be adjusted in order to preserve price stability. The Bank adds that the change in economic policy at the end of 2001 has so far led to a relatively moderate adjustment in the public's assets portfolio, and this took the form mainly of purchases by households of mutual funds specializing in foreign-currency investments. This reaction is natural in the light of the change in the differential between interest on the NIS and that on the dollar, and was reflected, among other things, by the 7-8 percent rise in the NIS/$ exchange rate.As the exchange rate rose, so did its volatility, and the standard deviation-derived from the prices of Bank of Israel options-rose from 5.0 percent to 7.0 percent. Note, however, that higher standard deviations than this are normal on foreign-currency markets abroad. The Bank of Israel adds that the rise in the exchange rate took place with a high level of trade, which indicates the market's increased sophistication. Israel's risk premium, measured via government bonds traded abroad, fell slightly; it is difficult to use this as a guide to foreign investors' assessments of Israel's risk, however, dueto the heavy involvement of Israeli investors in these markets and the lowlevel of tradability.

Poland,2002-01-30,"Information on the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council on January 29-30, 2002 The Monetary Policy Council held its meeting on January 29-30, 2002. The Council was submitted the materials prepared by the Management Board and departments of the NBP and information and analytical materials prepared by the Ministry of Finance, banks and research institutes. On this basis the Council discussed inflation; tendencies in the area of money supply, lending and interest rates; external conditions and the situation in the balance of payments, real sector of the economy and in the public finance sector. I. Inflation, inflation expectations. 1. The consumer price index on the twelve-month scale amounted to 3.6% in December 2001, i.e. it was maintained at the level observed a month before. 2. In December 2001, the following core inflation measures calculated on the twelve-month scale lowered: o 15%-cut average from 3.9% to 3.7%; o inflation excluding the controlled prices from 3.5% to 3.2%; o inflation excluding the most variable and fuel prices from 3.8% to 3.7%; o ""net"" inflation (excluding the foodstuff and fuel prices) from 5.3% to 5.1%. Only inflation excluding the most variable prices rose insignificantly (from 3.0% to 3.1% in December 2001). 3. In December 2001, the sold industrial output prices were lower by 0.3% than a year ago. The biggest drop (by 19.5%) was noted in case of the production of coke, petroleum refining products and its derivatives what was related to the petroleum prices drop on the world markets. 4. The data on the future inflation expectations of individuals are not explicit. In the survey made in January 2002, the rate of future inflation expected by individuals lowered, although the percentage of individuals forecasting that the prices will grow faster than now increased (to 21.8%). The inflation rate expected by bank analysts in the 11-month horizon was maintained at the level noted a month before (4.7%). In December 2001, the growth pace of consumer goods and services prices on the twelve-month scale was maintained at the level noted in November (3.6%). The sold industrial output prices were lower than a month before and lower than a year before. The index of the so-called net inflation over the CPI confirms the proposition of a favorable influence on inflation of such groups of goods as foodstuffs and fuels that are excluded from this index. In December, the difference between the ""net"" inflation and the CPI decreased from 1.7 to 1.6 percentage point (a positive influence of foodstuff and fuel prices was insignificantly smaller than a month before). The decreasing tendency of the remaining core inflation measures and their formation at the level close to the CPI indicates, however, that the observed drop of inflation is related to all major groups of consumer goods and services and it is not caused by potentially temporary factors only. II. Money supply, loans, interest rates. 1. The nominal growth pace of total money supply (M2) on the twelve-month scale increased from 12.1% in November to 13.6% in December 2001. The increase of the money supply dynamics was a result of a growth of cash in circulation and foreign currency deposits of individuals that was connected with the introduction of the euro. 2. The twelve-month dynamics of PLN-denominated deposits placed by individuals lowered from 24.1% in December 2000 and 13.7% in November 2001 to 11.7% in December 2001. On the other hand, the growth pace of PLN-denominated deposits placed by businesses increased from 5.7% in October and 8.6% in November to 12.1% in December 2001. 3. The annual dynamics of loans to individuals dropped from 31.7% in December 2000 and 16.1% in November 2001 to 14.6% in December 2001. The annual growth pace of loans to businesses lowered from 13.5% in December 2000 and 6.1% in November 2001 to 5.0%. During the year 2001 the dynamics of PLN-denominated deposits placed by individuals dropped on the twelve- month scale. It was caused by the drop of interest rates on deposits at commercial banks and the announcement of the introduction of bank placements income tax. The dynamics of loans to both businesses and individuals continues to lower. III. External conditions. 1. Since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Council there has been released the data that the period of the drop of the economic growth pace in the United States can get closer to its end (the consumer optimism index improved, the results of retail sales appeared to be better than expected). On the other hand, the forecasts that the growth pace of the economy of Germany - the biggest Poland's trade partner - will remain at the low level. 2. The forecasts for the petroleum prices on the world markets did not change. As a month before, a certain growth of prices for this raw material in the 2nd half of 2002 is forecasted. A boom in the world economy should take place in the 2nd half of 2002. However, a low growth pace of Germany's economy will impede the growth of Polish exports. It is a factor that reduces the inflation pressure. Since the last meeting of the Council the forecasts for the petroleum prices are stable. IV. Balance of payments, exchange rate. 1. Within the period January-November 2001, the current account deficit amounted to USD 6.4 billion and was lower by USD 2.8 billion than in the same period last year. Exports were bigger by 8.9% than in the period January-November 2000, while the dynamics of imports amounted to 2.4%. However, in November 2001, the trade deficit was higher than a year before. 2. In December 2001, the exchange rate of the zloty strengthened against both the dollar (the average monthly exchange rate amounted to PLN 4.01 for a dollar as compared to PLN 4.09 a month before) and the euro (PLN 3.58 for a euro as compared to PLN 3.64 in November 2001). In January 2002, after a temporary strengthening to a maximum level against the dollar for 2.5 years, the zloty weakened and its exchange rate is within the range PLN 4.10-4.15 for a dollar and PLN 3.54-3.60 for a euro. A visible in the consecutive months of 2001 improvement of the current account balance is the evidence for the strengthening of the external equilibrium of the Polish economy. Within the latest period, however, it is possible to observe some signs meaning a possible reversal of this favorable tendency. V. Supply, demand, situation on labor market and income. 1. In December 2001, the sold industrial output was lower than expected. As compared to December 2000, it decreased by 4.8%. Within the whole year 2001, the sold industrial output lowered by 0.2% as compared to the year 2000. The construction and assembling production was lower by 10.6% than in December 2000. 2. The employment in the enterprise sector lowered in December 2001 by 1.4% as compared to November and it was lower by 4.7% than a year before. The unemployment rate increased from 16.8% a month before to 17.4% in December. 3. In 2001, average wages in the enterprise sector were bigger by 7.1% in nominal terms and by 1.5% in real terms than a year before. The average pension and disability benefit were bigger by 11% than in 2000 and their purchasing power increased by 4.7%. A low level of economic activity has been maintained. The increasing drop of the sold industrial output is the evidence for a low demand pressure in the economy. Also a difficult situation on labor market should - reducing the wage pressure - be an anti-inflation factor. VI.Situation in public finance sector. The economic deficit of public finance sector in 2001 was bigger than it was forecasted yet in December and, according to the preliminary data, it amounted to 5.4% of GDP. The available information signalizes that the deficit of the public finance sector, even assuming the reduction of the growth pace of the budget expenses to 1% in real terms, will be maintained at the high level within the period 2002-2004. From the point of view of an improvement of macroeconomic policy scheme and development conditions for enterprises, it is necessary to take firm actions aimed at lowering of the economic deficit. The maintaining of a big deficit of public finance sector together with small revenues from privatization will result in a further increase of loan needs of the budget. It will contribute to maintaining high interest rates on loans by banks and reduce possibilities to finance the development of enterprises. VII. Decision of the Monetary Policy Council. 1. The observed drop of inflation is related to all major groups of consumer goods and services and it is not only caused by potentially temporary factors. 2. Since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Council the data indicating a low inflation pressure in the economy have been confirmed. A high and still growing unemployment, a lack of wage valorization in the budget sector and a low lending dynamics should reduce the pace of price growth. Also the forecasts for the situation in the external conditions of the Polish economy indicate a low risk of the inflation impulse. 3. Considering these arguments, the Monetary Policy Council decided to: o Cut the minimum yield on 28-day open market operations by 1.5 percentage point (to 10%); o Cut the rediscount rate by 2 percentage points (to 12%); o Cut the lombard rate by 2 percentage points (to 13.5%); o Cut the deposit rate by 1 percentage point (to 6.5%); o Maintain its neutral position in monetary policy. 4. Since February 2001 until this meeting, the Monetary Policy Council has cut the reference rate from 19% to 10%, i.e. almost by half. The majority of results of these profound cuts will be revealed this year. This basic fact should be taken into consideration in making the analysis of the current and forecasted future level of interest rates of the NBP. 5. The Monetary Policy Council wishes to emphasize, in particular, that after considering today's cut and the influence of the introduced taxation of income from savings, the real interest rates on deposits will be formed at a very low level. This fact will be taken into consideration in a future monetary policy. VIII.Introduction of modifications into the system of open market operations. According to the Guidelines of Monetary Policy for 2002, since February this year the National Bank of Poland introduces changes in the system of open market operations. The National Bank of Poland will perform the following open market operations: 1. basic ones based on a regular (once a week) issuing of money market bills of the National Bank of Poland of 28-day maturity; 2. fine-tuning ones performed in particular cases (without setting regular dates) based on: o issuing money market bills of the National Bank of Poland of 1 to 7-day maturity, o providing the banking system with liquidity in a form of purchasing (on a tender basis) treasury securities for the periods of 1 to 7 days (""repo"" transactions), o ahead of time redeeming the money market bills of the National Bank of Poland. The principles of performing open market operations are set forth in the resolution of the Monetary Policy Council of January 29, 2002. The operations will be still available to banks that perform a function of a money market dealer. The yield on both basic and fine-tuning operations will not be lower than the level of a reference rate that is defined by the resolution of the Monetary Policy Council. The introduction of regular issuing of 28-day money market bills that are the basic type of open market operations is a step towards the adjustment of the system of monetary policy instruments to the standards of the European Central Bank. The regularity of open market operations introduces an element of predictability what should stimulate liquidity planning by commercial banks and support the improvement of inter-bank market effectiveness. In case of considerable liquidity fluctuations, the NBP can perform additional fine-tuning operations. The purpose of fine- tuning operations is smoothing the impact of liquidity disorders on market interest rates. Such a possibility is also at the disposal of the European Central Bank. So far, fine-tuning operations in the euro zone have been made four times. As far as the principle is concerned, fine-tuning operations will be used in exceptional situations when deposit and credit operations of the NBP available to banks will - according to the central bank - be insufficient in eliminating liquidity disorders. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Council will be held on February 26-27, 2002."
South Korea,2002-02-07,"Although exports maintained their decline, the economy as a whole showed signs of improvement. During December last year, industrial production increased for the second consecutive month and the growth rates of consumption and construction investment accelerated while the increase in facilities investment continued. Consumer prices rose 2., 6 percent on a year-on-year basis(0., 6 percent on a month-on-month basis) in January this year due mainly to increases in the prices of farm-livestock-fishery products and housing rents. Core consumer prices rose 2., 9 percent on a year-on-year basis(0., 3 percent on a month-on-month basis). Financial and foreign exchange markets appear to remain largely stable as conditions for corporate financing were favorable with ample market liquidity. Meanwhile, price variables such as interest rates, stock prices and the exchange rate fluctuated during January in accordance with the evolution of expectations over the recovery of the domestic and foreign economies, the in- and out-flows of foreign portfolio investment funds and the movements of the Japanese yen against the dollar. Although there still remains uncertainty surrounding the Korean economy, it is anticipated that the trend of improvement in the real sector and the stability of the financial markets will likely continue. Taking these factors into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain its benchmark overnight call rate at around its current level in February. Monetary policy will continue to be conducted in a flexible manner, keeping a careful watch on the developments of the external environment, the status of business activity, price movements and the financial and asset markets."
Philippines,2002-02-13,"The Monetary Board decided today to reduce by 25 basis points the Bangko Sentral's overnight borrowing and lending rates to 7.25 percent and 9.5 percent, respectively, effective Friday, 15 February 2002. This marks the second cut for the year. The Monetary Board believes that the generally benign inflation outlook for the year—given expectations of favorable food supply conditions and stable oil prices—provide support for monetary easing. In addition, the differential between domestic and foreign interest rates which remains comfortable even with a 25-basis point cut and the broadly stable foreign exchange market also support the rate cut. The monetary authorities believe that the rate reduction will help sustain the country's growth objective without endangering the inflation target for 2002. At the same time, a lower interest rate environment should help ease debt servicing costs of corporates and the National Government, and set the conditions for the resumption of briskier loan activity. The Monetary Board also approved an adjustment in the interest rates on banks' overnight RRP placements with the BSP under the tiering scheme as follows: 7.25 percent for placements of up to P5 billion, 4.25 percent for the next P5 billion, and 1.25 percent for placements in excess of P10 billion. The tiering scheme shall also cover placements in special deposits and will be applied on a consolidated basis. Going forward, monetary policy will proceed on a cautious footing. The BSP believes that while the risks to the inflation outlook have lessened, they nonetheless still exist. To this end, the monetary authorities will continue to monitor carefully the inflationary developments in the coming months to guard against incipient risk factors."
Israel,2002-02-25,"The Bank of Israel's Monetary Program for March 2002. The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for March 2002, according to which its interest rate will rise by 0.6 percentage points to 4.4 percent. The Bank of Israel explains that inflation expectations for the next few years-derived from the capital markets, private forecasters' predictions, and inflation estimations derived from the models developed in the Bank of Israel-have risen above the upper limitof the target ranges of 2-3 percent for 2002 and 1-3 percent from 2003 onwards. The rise in inflation assessments, together with the greater degree of uncertainty in the financial markets against the background of both the slack which is evident in fiscal discipline and the security situation necessitate a rise in the Bank of Israel's interest rate in order to return to an environment of price stability and to maintain financial stability. This increase in the interest rate-given the level of real interest, which is atan all-time low, and the real depreciation of the NIS to date-can continueto support growth and employment only if there is no undermining of price stability, and if financial stability, which is especially important at times of increased uncertainty, is preserved. The Bank notes that although the CPIrose in January mainly as a result of rises in components which are more sensitive to depreciation, it is reasonable to assume that the increase was not a one-time occurrence restricted just to that month. Future developments depend on the extent to which the NIS continues to weaken and the effect of such weakening on the general price level. The Bank adds that fiscal policy for 2002 is not carried out by a specific cut in expenditure relative to a sumpreviously approved by the government, but by achieving the budget deficittarget of 3 percent of GDP, which will credibly lead towards the target deficit of 2 percent of GDP in 2003-targets also decided upon by the government. The scepticism regarding the government's ability to achieve this downward path for the deficit is reflected by the interest rates it must pay on bonds it has to sell to the public to finance the deficit, interest rates which determine the cost of capital for the whole economy. Nominal interest rates on unindexed government bonds did not come down despite the significant cut in the Bank of Israel's short-term interest rate, while real interest rates fell only slightly, and that was due to the rise in inflation expectations (see Table 2). The purpose of the change in economic policy announced on 23 December 2001 was to lower interest rates for all periods in orderto encourage investment and boost employment. This did not happen. The Bank reiterates that it is not possible to maintain a low level of short-term interest and simultaneously maintain price stability if long-term interest does not decline or if it actually rises. The Bank of Israel notes that the aim of the policy of lowering the budget deficit is to cut the government-debt/GDP ratio in order to reduce interest payments in the budget. This ratio rose, for the first time in many years, from 90 percent in 2000 to 96 percent in 2001, and it will continue to climb if the government does not meet the deficit targets it has set. The change in economic policy at theend of 2001 resulted in an adjustment in the public's asset portfolio, as the NIS depreciated by 8-10 percent against the dollar. As the exchange rate rose, so did its volatility, and the standard deviation-derived from the prices of Bank of Israel options-rose from 7.0 percent to 9.0 percent. Note, however, that higher standard deviations than this are normal on foreign-currency markets abroad. The Bank of Israel adds that the rise in the exchange rate took place with a high level of trade, which indicates the market's increased sophistication. Israel's risk premium, measured via government bonds traded abroad, edged up; it is difficult to use this as a guide to foreign investors' assessments of Israel's risk, however, due to the heavy involvement of Israeli investors in these markets and the low level of tradability. In short, the Bank will continue to adjust the interest rate to the extent required to return the economy to, and keep it on, the path of price stability, which is an indispensable condition for sustainable growth. Only thus can low short-term real interest rates and real depreciation-which support economic growth-be maintained. The stronger the proof provided by fiscal discipline that the government is standing by its decision to revert to a downward budget-deficit path, to 3 percent of GDP in 2002 and 3 percent of GDP in 2003, the more the reduction in long-term interest rates will contribute to the attainment of the goal, andwill enable lower short-term interest rates too. The openness of the financial, foreign-currency and bond markets enables the public to show continuously how it rates the success and credibility of policy in this field.

Poland,2002-02-27,"Information on the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council on February 26-27, 2002 The Monetary Policy Council held its meeting on February 26-27, 2002. The Council was submitted the materials prepared by the Management Board and departments of the NBP and information and analytical materials prepared by the Ministry of Finance, banks and research institutes. On this basis the Council discussed inflation; tendencies in the area of money supply, lending and interest rates; external conditions and the situation in the balance of payments, real sector of the economy and in the public finance sector. I. Inflation, inflation expectations. 1. The consumer price index on the twelve-month scale lowered in January to 3.5% as compared to 3.6% a month before. 2. According to estimated calculations, in January 2002 the index of the so-called net inflation (excluding foodstuff and fuel prices) was on the twelve-month scale lower by 0.4 percentage point than in December last year and amounted to 4.7%. Within the period December 2001 - January 2002 the difference between ""net"" inflation and CPI decreased from 1.5 to 1.2 percentage point. Although the level of foodstuff and fuel prices - groups of goods that are excluded from the net inflation index still favorably affects inflation, this positive impact is getting smaller. The inflation reduction results from the drop of growth pace of prices for a big part of goods and services groups. The remaining measures of core inflation will be presented by the National Bank of Poland after the respective data are made available by the Central Statistical Office. 3. In January 2002, the decreasing tendency of the sold industrial output prices - that lasted for three months - was halted. They were formed at the level noted a year before and as compared to December last year they increased by 0.1% (in December 2001 the sold industrial output prices were lower by 0.4% than a year before and by 0.3% than a month before). 4. In February this year, the future inflation expectations of individuals improved. After a 2-month growth, the percentage of individuals forecasting that the prices will grow faster than now decreased (to 16.6%). Inflation expectations of natural persons, however, considerably depend on current inflation. The inflation rate expected by bank analysts in the 11-month horizon slightly lowered and amounted to 4.6% as compared to 4.7% in a survey made a month before. In January 2002, the growth pace of consumer goods and services prices on the twelve-month scale slightly lowered. It amounted to 3.5% as compared to 3.6% in December last year. The index of the so-called net inflation maintained over CPI (by 1.2 percentage point) reflects a favorable impact on inflation of groups of goods excluded from this index, i.e. foodstuffs and fuels. However, the decreasing of the difference between net inflation and CPI proves that the reduction of inflation is not only a result of potentially temporary factors but it is also combined with a drop of the growth pace of prices for a big part of goods and services groups. The improvement of future inflation expectations was noted in case of both natural persons and - although slightly - bank analysts. The decreasing tendency of sold industrial output prices - that lasted for three months - has been halted. They were formed at the level noted a year before and as compared to December last year they increased by 0.1%. II.Money supply, loans, interest rates. 1. The nominal growth pace of total money supply (M2) on the twelve-month scale lowered from 13.7% in December 2001 to 12.0% in January this year. So, it is still maintained at a quite high level. 2. In January this year, an annual dynamics of cash in circulation increased again. On the twelve-month scale the growth pace of cash in circulation amounted to 15% as compared to 12% in December and -4.6% in January 2001. 3. At the same time, a further decrease was noted in case of the twelve-month growth pace of PLN-denominated deposits placed by individuals. In January this year, it amounted to 9.6% as compared to 11.7% in December 2001 and 22.5% a year before. One of the factors that caused the decrease of the dynamics of PLN- denominated deposits of households was the lowering of interest rates on deposits. Also a future taxation of interest income from bank placements adversely affects the tendency of the public to place free funds at banks. However, the dynamics of foreign currency deposits placed by individuals increased. In January this year, it amounted to 16.1% on the twelve-month scale as compared to 13.7% in December and 6.4% in January 2001. Also the increase was noted in case of the assets of households that are held outside the banking sector - in Treasury securities and open investment funds. 4. Within the latest months, a tendency to stabilize the lending dynamics at a low level appeared. In January this year, an annual dynamics of lending to non-financial sector was at the level of 7.2% (as compared to 7.6% a month before). The dynamics of lending to households amounted to 14.4% (as compared to 14.7% a month before) and the dynamics of lending to businesses was 5.0% (as compared to 5.4% in December last year). 5. Since October last year, a very high annual dynamics of the budget sector net debt has been maintained. In January this year, the net debt was bigger by 41.1% than in the same month in 2001. Within the latest months, relevant changes in the structure of money supply appeared that might pose a threat to inflation processes in future. On one hand, a clear drop of the dynamics of PLN-denominated deposits of individuals is observed, on the other hand, however, a relevant increase of the dynamics of cash and demand deposits is noted. At the same time, a low dynamics of lending to businesses and households is accompanied by a very fast growth of the budget sector net debt what is not favorable for the increase of economic activity. III. External conditions. 1. Since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Council the forecast of economic situation worldwide improved a little. Especially it is related to the American economy. In January this year, in the United States, inflation still lowered, a growth of unemployment was halted, and the retail sales volume increased considerably more than expected by the market. Actually, investment banks forecast that the GDP growth in the United States in 2002 can amount to 1.3 to 1.9% (as compared to forecasts 0.1-1.5% in January this year). A slight improvement has also been noted in forecasts of a growth pace of Germany's economy - Poland's biggest trade partner. However, they are still at a low level 0.5-0.9% (as compared to 0.2-0.9% in January this year). 2. Due to the upward verification of the economic growth forecasts - especially in the United States, higher prices for oil are expected. In the first six months a stabilization of prices for this raw material at the current level should be expected. However, since the 3rd quarter this year, together with the expected decrease of oil reserves, its prices can start rising. Since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Council there have appeared signals that the boom in the world economy, which may be expected in the second half of 2002, can be stronger than expected a month before. It is also related to Germany's economy - Poland's biggest trade partner. Since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Council the forecasts for oil prices have been verified upward. In the second half this year a probable rise of prices for this raw material can contribute to the increase of inflation pressure. IV. Balance of payments, exchange rate. 1. In 2001, the current account deficit amounted to USD 7.0 billion and was lower by USD 2.9 billion than a year before. The revenues from exports were bigger by 7.2% than a year before. The dynamics of imports amounted to 1.3%. The growth pace of both export and import weakened during the year. In December 2001, for the second month in a row the revenues from exports lowered as compared to the same month last year. This drop amounted to 7.7% (as compared to 3.7% a month before). The trade deficit in December 2001 decreased as compared to December 2000 as a result of a drop of import expenses by 9.5%. 2. In January 2002, the appreciation tendency of the Polish currency reversed. The exchange rate of the zloty weakened against both the dollar and the euro. In January and February (to February 26) an average monthly rate amounted to PLN 4.06 and 4.19 for a dollar (as compared to PLN 4.01 in December last year) and PLN 3.60 and 3.64 for a euro (as compared to PLN 3.58 in December 2001), respectively. A visible in the consecutive months of 2001 improvement of the current account balance is the evidence for the strengthening of the macroeconomic equilibrium. However, there is a considerable uncertainty about the current account balance in future. The increase of the domestic demand can, in conditions of a weak economic situation in the world, contribute to a repeated growth of external imbalance. V. Supply, demand, situation on labor market and income. 1. In January this year, the sold industrial output decreased as compared to the same period last year by 1.4%. The construction and assembling production was lower by 21.3% than in January 2001. The bigger drop of construction output was affected by a more severe winter than in January last year. 2. In January 2002, the employment in the enterprise sector decreased by 0.2% as compared to December 2001 and it was lower by 4.7% than a year before. The biggest drop of employment during the whole year took place in the construction sector (by 11.8%). The unemployment rate rose from 17.4% a month before to 18.0% in January. The number of the unemployed increased by 4.4% as compared to December 2001 and by 14.7% as compared to January 2001 and it amounted to 3.253 million. 3. In January this year, average gross wages in the enterprise sector were higher by 5.7% in nominal terms than in the same period last year. After taking into account the inflation the rise of wages in the enterprise sector amounted to 2.1% in the whole year, i.e. the most since January 2001. However, as a result of the drop of employment, the wage fund was lower in real terms than a year before. The average pension and disability benefit in January this year was bigger by 14.6% than a year before. Its purchasing power increased in the whole year by 10.7%. A high valorization of pensions and disability benefits in 2001 will result in a high dynamics of these payments until June 2002, i.e. the next valorization of pensions and disability benefits. There have been maintained a low level of economic activity and a low demand pressure. The real growth of wages in the enterprise sector by 2.1% on the twelve-month scale, although the highest since January last year, was concentrated in several sectors and big enterprises. VI. Situation in public finance sector. 1. In February, the Parliament enacted an Act on the State Budget for 2002. Despite the position of the Ministry of Finance, it provides for revenues higher by PLN 1.2 billion than the Government intended in the project. The expenses have been increased by a similar amount. This way a principle of increasing the state budget expenses by 1 percentage point over inflation that was declared in the economic strategy of the Government has been broken. According to the Act on the State Budget, this year they can be increased in real terms by 2.4%. If the average annual pace of price growth appears lower than it has been assumed by the Government in the construction of the budget, then this growth will be even higher. The amount of expenses set forth in the act will not include the payment of arrears to OFE (Open Pension Funds). 2. Due to the delay in implementing some of the Government proposals increasing tax revenues, the budget revenues may appear lower than set forth in the act. In January this year, they were lower than a year before. Budget deficit in January 2002 was bigger by over 34% than in the same month last year. Last year, the state budget received extraordinary foreign revenues at the amount of PLN 1 billion. It should be noted, however, that for the second year in a row the tax revenues in January are lower than the ones noted a year before. 3. Even though the state budget expenses were increased at the pace of 1% in real terms a year, the public finance sector deficit would be maintained in the period 2002 - 2004 at a very high level. Meanwhile, a forecasted acceleration of the growth pace of the economy should be accompanied by a bigger reduction of public expenses and deficit. A big deficit while the revenues from privatization are small will result in a further increase of lending needs of the budget. It will cause a strong reduction of lending to enterprises. The public finance area is connected with a high uncertainty. In the Act on the State Budget there have been set forth revenues higher by PLN 1.2 billion than originally assumed by the Government. The planned expenses have been increased by a similar amount. As a result, despite the principle of forming the budget expenses that has been accepted in the economic strategy of the Government, this year, they may be in real terms higher than a year before not by 1% but by 2.4%. The forecasted in the Act on the State Budget a very big deficit of public finance sector may appear even bigger. Big lending needs of the budget will result in a strong reduction of lending to enterprises. VII. Decision of the Monetary Policy Council. 1. Since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Council the data indicating a low demand pressure in the economy have been proved. These data is within the range of forecasts that constitute the basis for the last decision of the Monetary Policy Council about interest rates. On the other hand, however, unfavorable changes in the structure of money supply advanced that may constitute a threat to inflation processes in future. There was also maintained a big uncertainty related to the public finance area. 2. Since February 2001 to January 2002, the Monetary Policy Council has cut the reference rate from 19% to 10%, i.e. by almost a half. After inflation is taken into account, so in real terms, the reference rate lowered from 11.6% to 6.3%, i.e. by 5.3 percentage points. So far neither banks nor enterprises fully reacted to these cuts. Especially it is related to the last cut made in January this year. The monetary policy this year has been additionally eased by the depreciation of the exchange rate of the zloty. 3. As a result of, inter alia, the drop of interest rates on deposits, the dynamics of PLN-denominated deposits of individuals on the twelve-month scale lowers. This negative phenomenon got stronger after it has been announced that the bank placement income will be taxed. However, the growth has been observed in case of households' assets held in Treasury securities and open investment funds. Considering these arguments, the Monetary Policy Council decided not to change interest rates of the NBP and to maintain its neutral position in the area of monetary policy. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Council will be held on March 26-27, 2002."
Thailand,2002-03-04,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 4 March 2002 Mr. Bandid Nijathaworn. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand announced that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments, both domestically and abroad, in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance. The MPC deemed that financial markets had moved in line with the previous two reductions in the policy rate as reflected in the fall in deposit and lending rates. This helped to ease the cost of capital for the corporate sector, create an environment favourable to investment, and support the economic recovery. At the same time, inflationary pressures continued to remain subdued. The MPC assessed the latest economic data as indicating that the Thai economy continued to recover, with improvement in certain indicators. Positive economic factors included a pick-up in the US economy, monetary and fiscal measures to support the economy, as well as continued revival in investor confidence. The MPC, therefore, decided to maintain the 14-day repurchase rate at 2 percent per annum. Bank of Thailand 4 March 2002."
Euroarea,2002-03-07,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. First of all, we were pleased to see that the euro cash changeover went so smoothly  more smoothly in fact than we could have hoped. The European public very quickly became familiar with the new banknotes and coins, as is shown by the fact that national banknotes were largely withdrawn well before the final deadline of their ceasing to be legal tender. The Governing Council wishes to express its gratitude once more to all those who helped to make the euro cash changeover such a success. As usual, at today's meeting we examined recent monetary, financial and economic developments. The Governing Council concluded that the information which had become available in recent weeks confirmed that the current level of key ECB interest rates remains appropriate for the maintenance of price stability over the medium term. Against this background, the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Starting with the analysis under the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 stood at 8.0% in the period from November 2001 to January 2002, compared with 7.8% in the period from October to December 2001. The high level of the annual growth rates of M3 is very much related to portfolio shifts to liquid positions, most of which occurred in the autumn of 2001 in an economic and financial environment characterised by high uncertainty. While many investors still seemed to be ""parking"" some of their assets in M3 in early 2002, some moderation in the short-term dynamics of M3 could be observed around the turn of the year. The Governing Council continues to hold the view that the information from the first pillar thus far does not indicate risks to price stability, as the portfolio reallocations which drove M3 growth in 2001 should remain temporary. In addition, the slowdown in the rate of growth of loans to the private sector has been continuing over the past few months. However, we will need to analyse monetary developments closely in the coming months. As regards the second pillar, there are further signs that the trough in economic activity may have been reached at the end of last year. Coincident and forward-looking indicators increasingly point to improvements in economic conditions. A similar picture is reflected in financial market expectations, especially those embedded in bond yields. The economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound and there are no major imbalances that would require a lengthy process of adjustment. The expectation of a recovery in the euro area in 2002 is furthermore supported by favourable financing conditions and by real disposable income benefiting from past and expected future declines in inflation. There is also increasing confirmation that economic activity outside the euro area is picking up, which should lead to a gradual strengthening of the external demand for euro area products and services. While the strength of the recovery remains uncertain, there are good reasons to expect a return of economic growth to levels in line with potential towards the end of the year. Turning to short-term price developments, annual consumer price inflation picked up substantially in January. Part of this increase was expected, as it related to base effects stemming from falling energy prices in early 2001 and to higher indirect taxes in some euro area countries. Furthermore, the increase reflected a considerable rise in unprocessed food prices due to adverse weather conditions in parts of Europe. Part of the latter effect seems to have been reversed in the meantime, as preliminary data for February indicate. Some increases have also been observed in oil prices and in the rate of growth of services prices in January. While there might have been an impact on specific service categories in January, overall there is no evidence that the euro cash changeover has had a significant upward effect on the average price level in the euro area or that the declining trend in annual inflation rates has been affected recently. In the coming months, the effects of past increases in energy and food prices should gradually subside and annual inflation rates should fall to below 2%. The recent behaviour of producer prices also points in this direction. Beyond that horizon, we expect little upward pressure on prices from aggregate demand and, barring unforeseen developments, inflation rates to be in line with price stability. However, the current favourable outlook for inflation fundamentally rests on the assumption of a continuation of wage moderation. As I already noted last month, there is some cause for concern with regard to ongoing wage negotiations. A continuation of wage moderation in the euro area is crucial not only to foster employment growth but also to support monetary policy in its task to maintain price stability. With regard to fiscal policy in the euro area, the Governing Council welcomes the reaffirmed commitments of the governments of euro area countries with fiscal imbalances to adhere to the objective of achieving balanced budgets by 2003-2004. The confirmation of the political will to continue along the path of fiscal consolidation is most appropriate. The Governing Council supports the actions taken by the European Commission in the context of the Stability and Growth Pact and the subsequent outcome of the ECOFIN Council meeting last month. It is now necessary to remain vigilant in order to ensure strict adherence to the medium-term plans and rigorous implementation of the procedures of the Stability and Growth Pact. In order to further improve the fundamentals of the euro area and to put the expected recovery on a broad and sustainable basis, euro area countries must strengthen their efforts to implement comprehensive structural reforms. Over the past few years progress has been made with regard to enhancing the flexibility of euro area product and capital markets. Euro area countries have also made some headway in terms of improving the way their labour markets operate. These reforms, together with moderate wage developments, have contributed to the strong employment growth and the considerable reduction in unemployment witnessed in many euro area countries in the last cyclical upswing. However, it is worth noting that despite the continued high unemployment in the euro area, firms continue to report difficulties in terms of recruiting suitably qualified workers. This suggests that further improvements in the functioning of euro area labour markets and their ability to match labour supply and demand are needed. Evidence gathered in a recent Eurosystem analysis, which will be published shortly, supports this view. In this context I would also like to stress that structural reforms in different markets should not be seen in isolation. The more efficiently euro area product and capital markets function, the greater the success of labour market reforms will be in creating employment opportunities."
South Korea,2002-03-07,"The signs of economic recovery became more visible, although exports maintained their decline. During January, industrial production continued to be quite good and both consumption and construction investment grew steadily while the increase in facilities investment was maintained. Consumer prices rose 2., 6 percent on a year-on-year basis(0., 5 percent on a month-on-month basis) in February due mainly to increases in the prices of farm-livestock-fishery products and industrial products. Core consumer prices rose 3., 0 percent on a year-on-year basis(0., 3 percent on a month-on-month basis). In the financial and foreign exchange markets, long- and short- term market interest rates and exchange rate of the Korean won against dollar showed largely stable movements while conditions for corporate financing became more favorable. In the meantime, the concentration of funds at the short end of market and rises in asset prices such as those of real estates have persisted as the household credits have continued to increase substantially and anticipation of economic recovery has been building up. Although the trend of economic recovery led mainly by domestic demand is expected to continue, uncertainty still remains over the export environment. Therefore, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain its benchmark overnight call rate at around its current level in March. It was also noted that monetary policy would be conducted in a flexible manner, keeping a careful watch on the pace of economic recovery, price movements and changes in the external conditions. Along with this, it was considered desirable to take various measures to stabilize real estate markets, in order to prevent the recent rise of real estate prices from leading to heightened inflationary expectations among the general public."
Chile,2002-03-12,"Santiago. March 12, 2002 Press Release At its monthly monetary policy meeting held today, the Board of the Central Bank decided to lower the monetary policy interest rate by 75 basis points from an annual 5.5% to 4.75% and to lower the rates on liquidity credit lines by the same amount each. The Board bases its decision on the low inflationary pressures over recent months that continue without change. There is no substantial improvement of Chile's trading partners as a whole but there are indications of economic growth in the United States. Nevertheless, emerging economies' financial markets are showing stronger signs of stability and this has been reflected in key financial prices of the Chilean economy. On the domestic front, all the data gathered, including national accounts based on 1996, confirms that domestic demand continues below what had been forecast. These factors together conform a scenario of low inflationary pressures during the policy horizon and this is confirmed by the effective trend of prices and market expectations. The decision to lower the monetary policy interest rate is thus coherent with inflation converging towards an annual 3% during the 12 to 24 month horizon period. Moreover, the monetary impulse generated, supposing that the world growth trend is substantiated, should help to boost domestic economic activity. The Central Bank will continue to use monetary policy to avoid any deviation from the inflation target."
Philippines,2002-03-13,"The Monetary Board decided today to reduce by another 25 basis points the Bangko Sentral's overnight borrowing and lending rates to 7.0 percent and 9.25 percent, respectively, effective Friday, 15 March 2002. This move marks the third policy rate cut since the beginning of the year for a cumulative reduction of 75 basis points. This brings the BSP's policy rates to a ten-year low. The last time the overnight RRP rate reached 7.0 percent was in 1992. The Monetary Board believes that, on balance, the inflation outlook remains generally subdued, given favorable food supply conditions and broad stability in the exchange rate combined with continued softness in demand and spare capacity in manufacturing. The Monetary Board believes that this policy move would help create conditions for promoting increased bank lending activities and propelling domestic demand. In particular, the reduction in the BSP's policy rate cut could pave the way for further decline in bank lending rates, which would enhance the repayment capabilities of corporates. It may be noted that the successive monetary easing has influenced the downtrend in bank lending rates, with bank lending rates declining by a total of 856 basis points compared with 775 basis points decline in the BSP's policy rates for the period December 2000-February 2002. The decline in interest rates, in turn, would help ease pressures on banks' NPLs and create conditions for more vigorous bank lending. A further reduction in the BSP's policy rates could, therefore, be viewed as growth spurring. The Monetary Board also approved an adjustment in the interest rates on banks' overnight RRP placements with the BSP under the tiering scheme as follows: 7.0 percent for placements of up to P5 billion, 4.0 percent for the next P5 billion, and 1.0 percent for placements in excess of P10 billion. Looking forward, monetary policy will continue to be on a cautious footing. While inflationary risks have lessened, they are still present. In the months ahead, the BSP will continue to monitor closely factors affecting the inflation outlook—particularly the trend in oil prices and power rates and any impact of the El Niño weather phenomenon on food supply at the latter part of the year—to ensure that inflationary risks are addressed appropriately, in line with the BSP's mandate of maintaining price stability as the economy builds up momentum."
South Africa,2002-03-14,"Inflationary pressures began to build up during the fourth quarter of 2001, activitated by the first round-effects of the depreciation in the value of the rand and steep increases in food prices. This became clearly reflected in the quarter-to-quarter change in the all-goods production price index (PPI) which rose from a seasonally adjusted and annualised rate of 6,4 per cent in the third quarter of 2001 to 11,3 per cent in the fourth quarter. The twelve-month rate of increase in this index also accelerated from 7,8 per cent in September 2001 to 8,3 per cent in December and 11,5 per cent in January 2002. As could be expected. CPIX inflation was not immediately affected to the same extent because of the lag between producer and consumer price increases. The quarter-to-quarter increase in the CPIX index nevertheless rose from an annualised rate of 5,9 per cent in the third quarter of 2001 to 6,8 per cent in the fourth quarter. Measured over periods of twelve months. CPIX inflation accelerated from below the psychologically important level of 6 per cent in September 2001 to 6,5 per cent in December and 7,1 per cent in January 2002. This increase in consumer price inflation was mainly due to changes in food prices. The CPIX inflation excluding food rose by only 5,6 per cent in January 2002 when compared with the same month in the preceding year. The steep increase in food prices, in turn, was largely the result of a depreciation in the external value of the rand. On a trade-weighted basis the exchange rate of the rand declined by more than 34 per cent in the last half of 2001. Import and export parity pricing have become common practice in the now largely deregulated agricultural sector. Despite relatively good crops in 2001, food prices accordingly increased substantially. In particular, a rise in the maize price was the main driver of food price inflation because of its effect on the prices of other agricultural produce. The depreciated value of the rand also began to affect the prices of other commodities towards the end of 2001. The weakness of the rand was probably related to a number of factors, such as domestic spending in excess of national disposable income, unfounded expectations of an immediate abolition of exchange control, leads and lags in foreign payments and receipts and negative socio-political perceptions of the region. Although changes in monetary policy will have little impact on the first-round price effects of the depreciation of the rand, it is nevertheless important that measures be taken to prevent a continuation of upward price adjustments. The timely response of monetary policy is intended to help prevent second-round price increases, making the attainment of the inflation target far less onerous. A tighter monetary policy stance is also indicated by other developments, including:. The survey conducted by the Bureau of Economic Research of the University of Stellenbosch, released today, clearly indicates that inflation expectations in South Africa have increased. This is confirmed by other indicators of inflation expectations such as the higher and steeper yield curve and the increase in the monthly average implied or break-even inflation rate since December 2001. (This rate equates the nominal return on government's conventional long-term bonds with the real yield on inflation-linked bonds.). Domestic spending in excess of national disposable income. Growth in domestic expenditure accelerated during the second half of 2001. This was the combined result of an increase in inventory investment and real domestic final demand. The consumption expenditure of households and government as well as gross fixed capital formation continued to increase at a steady pace. The higher rates of growth in domestic spending than in income were reflected in deficits on the current account of the balance of payments in the third and fourth quarters of 2001. These deficits, which were still relatively small, mainly reflected a strong demand for imports and a decline in the volume of exports which were neutralised somewhat by an improvement in the terms of trade. Projections show that the current account will remain in deficit during most of 2002. It is also disconcerting that the rise in domestic spending was accompanied by a substantial increase in credit growth. The quarter-to-quarter growth in the credit extension of banks to the private sector accelerated considerably from an annualised rate of 2,8 per cent in the first quarter of 2001 to 14,2 per cent in the third quarter and 17,9 per cent in the fourth quarter. A rising trend in nominal unit labour cost. Unit labour cost picked up from an average rate of 2,9 per cent in 2000 to a year-on-year rate of 4,3 per cent in the first nine months of 2001. The unit labour cost in the manufacturing industry rose even more sharply from a year-on-year rate of 1,6 per cent in the first quarter of 2001 to 7,1 per cent in the third quarter. This development reflects a slower pace of increase in productivity than in nominal compensation of labour. The high growth in money supply. Although the quarterly growth in the broadly defined money supply slowed down in the fourth quarter of 2001, growth over twelve months remained high at levels of 17,0 per cent in December 2001 and 19,3 per cent in January 2002. Moreover, the narrowest monetary aggregate (MIA) continued to increase at exceptionally high quarter-to-quarter rates in the second half of 2001. This may merely reflect a strong preference for liquid assets, but it could also indicate a positioning to step up future spending. Although the effects of these developments can be neutralised to some extent by the excess production capacity in the economy and continued fiscal discipline, the Monetary Policy Committee is of the opinion that they warrant a more restrictive monetary policy stance. The committee has therefore decided to increase the repo rate by 100 basis points to 11,50 per cent per annum with effect from 15 March 2002. It is expected that this will lead to similar adjustments in deposit and lending rates in the domestic market. The Monetary Policy Committee realises that this increase might have a negative effect on domestic economic growth over the short term in an international environment characterised by a hesitant and apparently slow economic recovery. Monetary discipline is, however, essential for price stability and sustainable high economic growth. The negative effect of higher interest rates on short-term growth may also be neutralised to a large extent by the very competitive external value of the rand, which will in all likelihood lead to substantially higher exports when the world economic recovery gathers momentum."
Israel,2002-03-25,"The Bank of Israel's Monetary Program for April 2002. The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for April 2002, according to which its interest rate will not be changed and will remain 4.4 percent. The Bank of Israel explains that following the 0.6 percent interest-rate hike in March, which helped to stabilize the foreign-currency markets, inflation expectations for the next few years-derived from the capital markets, private forecasters' predictions, andinflation estimations derived from the models developed in the Bank of Israel-declined to within the target ranges of 2-3 percent for 2002 and 1-3 percent from 2003 onwards. Indications that the effect on inflation of the depreciation evident since the beginning of the year has concluded reinforce the view that price rises at the beginning of the year will not develop into an acceleration of the inflation rate. Consequently, it is possible to maintain price stability without changing the interest rate. The Bank of Israel stresses that monetary policy aims to maintain price stability as an essential element of sustainable growth, as well as to reinforce the financial stability of the money, capital, and foreign-exchange markets. This stability, which contributes to economic robustness, requires adherence to fiscal and monetary discipline. The Bank adds that in 2002, too, thegovernment deficit is expected to be higher than planned. This increase requires a rise in net borrowing by the government in order to finance the deficit, thereby increasing its debt-servicing costs. Thus, for example, the interest on unindexed 10-year government (Shahar) bonds sold to the public rose again, to stand at 6.9 percent, and is now slightly higher thanthe cost of net borrowing by the government before the change in economic policy announced in December 2001. The object of that change was, as noted,to lower interest rates for all terms in order to encourage investment andboost employment. This response of the markets is inter alia the outcome of the expected deviation in the 2002 deficit, and embodies negative repercussions for the following aspects:. a. The government debt/GDP ratio, constituting a present and future burden on the economy that consigns budget resources to debt repayment and interest servicing at the expense of allocating resources to growth-stimulating objectives and other crucial purposes. b. The stimulation of investment andemployment, in view of the effect of the rise in long-term interest on business-sector investment and on home-buyers' mortgages, which are related togovernment-debt interest rates. c. The Bank of Israel's ability to keep short-term interest low over time while maintaining price stability. The Bank of Israel explains that adhering to a budget framework that ensures low long-term interest rates and a declining government debt/GDP ratio is anecessary condition for maintaining price stability in the long run. The change in economic policy at theend of 2001 resulted in the adjustment of the public's asset portfolio, asthe NIS depreciated by 8-10 percent against the dollar. This depreciation was checked during February, and according to various indications (including the cessation of purchases and even redemptions from the mutual funds specializing in foreign-currency-indexed channels) the current stage of the process of portfolio appears to have been concluded. The rise evident since the beginning of the year in the implied volatility of Bank of Israel dollaroptions, indicating the fluctuations in the market, has also stopped, constituting a further indication of stability. Israel's risk premium, measuredvia government bonds traded abroad, dipped slightly; it is difficult to use this as a guide to foreign investors' assessments of Israel's risk, however, due to the heavy involvement of Israeli investors in these markets and the low level of tradability. The Bank of Israel also points out that in the context of the debate on amending the Bank of Israel Law, the Bank continues to support the government's objectives of stimulating economicgrowth and employment, subject to the maintenance of price stability. In this framework, the commitment to price stability is a long-term one and should not be examined in terms of a calendar year. This approach enables allowance to be made for factors that cause temporary deviations from the path of prices at various points during the year but do not permanently undermine price stability. In this way, too, the decision on the short-term interest rate supports a policy whose aim is sustainable growth. This statement can assume added significance in 2002 if it transpires that the price increase at the beginning of the year is indeed nonrecurring. Changes in NIS and dollar interest rates. ISRAEL.

Poland,2002-03-27,"Information on the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council on March 26- 27, 2002 The Monetary Policy Council held its meeting on March 26-27, 2002. The Council was submitted the materials prepared by the Management Board and departments of the NBP as well as information and analytical materials prepared by the Ministry of Finance, banks and research institutes. On this basis the Council discussed the external conditions of the Polish economy, the situation in the real sector of the economy and tendencies in the area of wages and social benefits, in public finance sector, money supply, lending and interest rates and the formation of prices and inflation expectations. I. External conditions. 1. Within the recent period there appeared data indicating that the boom in the world economy will come faster and it will be stronger than it was expected earlier. It is good information for the outlook of Polish exports and the development of the economy, but the anti-inflationary impact of the external economic situation may be weaker than it was expected earlier. 2. In the United States, the purchasing managers index (PMI) in industry rose in February this year to 54.7, the highest level since April 2000, and the index of new orders exceeded 60. Joined with the biggest since June 2000 rise of industrial production noted last month, the increased level of manufacturing capacity utilization in industry (to 74.8% from 74.5% in January and 74.4% in December) and the fact that capital goods flows in January this year were significantly bigger than on average in the 4th quarter last year - it increases the chances of bigger capital investments in the American economy. Due to these data, even though the consumer confidence index dropped, a high level of household indebtedness and the current account deficit maintained, in March this year the economic growth forecasts in the United States were increased to 1.3 - 2.6% GDP (from 1.3 - 1.9% a month before). According to the latest data, the consumer confidence index in the United States rose from 95 a month before to 110.2 in March this year. In 2003, the growth is expected to be at the level 3.5 - 4.4% GDP. 3. Despite still poor economic results, in the recent period there have been released the data indicating a future improvement of the economic situation in the euro zone. After a clear rise in February this year (to 88.5), the German business climate index (IFO) increased significantly again in March (to 91.8) and it reached the highest level since April 2001. In February this year, the improvement was also noted in case of the purchasing managers index for the euro zone (to 48.6 from 46.3 a month before and 42.9 in October 2001) and the European consumer confidence index. The current forecasts indicate that the growth pace in the European economy will increase during the year (from the level close to zero in the 1st quarter to approximately 2.5% in the 4th quarter this year). During the whole year. GDP in the euro zone will grow this year by 1.1% and in 2003 by 2.9%. 4. In connection with the improvement of the economic situation outlook, as compared to the previous month, the probability of interest rate raises in Poland's external conditions in the second half of the year increased. Due to the decreasing interest rates difference, the foreign investors' tendency to place their portfolio capital in Poland may be reduced what would contribute to the weakening of the exchange rate of the zloty or at least counteract its appreciation. The Swedish Riksbank, at its last meeting, was the first to make a decision to tighten monetary policy. 5. In March this year - as a result of the increase of forecasts of the demand for oil connected with better outlook of the economic growth worldwide, the increase of tension between the United States and Iraq and the OPEC decision to maintain the production on the actual level - oil prices on world markets rose to the level of USD 25 per barrel. This situation prompts to verify upward the actual forecasts of oil prices. The insofar forecasts indicating that the oil price in the first six months will amount to USD 18 per barrel (now, according to the market forecast average, it will be USD 21) appear to be not actual. This will probably mean the increase of fuel prices on the domestic market and the reverse of the observed so far halting impact of fuel prices on inflation. II. Production, economic growth. 1. In 2001, the economic growth pace amounted to 1.1%. The GDP dynamics decreased in subsequent quarters (from 2.3% in the 1st quarter to 0.3% in the 4th quarter). The domestic demand decreased by 2% and the demand drop increased in the subsequent quarters (from 1.3% in the 1st quarter to 2.9% in the 4th quarter). Individual consumption increased in the whole year 2001 by 2.1% and the dynamics of this category grew from quarter to quarter (from 1.5% in the 1st quarter to 3.2% in the 4th quarter). The main factor that halted the GDP growth was the drop of gross investments in fixed assets that amounted to 10.2% last year. 2. In February this year, the sold industrial output was bigger by 0.4% than a year before while its drop by approximately 0.8% was forecasted. 3. Better than expected data on the sold industrial output joined with: o The results of the research of the economic situation in March this year indicating the improvement of both current and expected in the nearest period demand and production and the sales of goods by trade enterprises (in March this year, the sales forecasts are not negative for the first time since June 2001); o The data on retail sales (rise by 4.7% in January and by 7.7% in February this year as compared to the same months last year); o Bigger than in February last year revenues from indirect taxes and income tax from legal entities that are the most sensitive to the economic situation; o Better outlook of the economic situation worldwide; o And the fact that full results of interest rates cuts have not been revealed yet can suggest that a gradual economic boom should take place. However, drawing firm conclusions is premature and one should wait for the confirmation of positive trends in subsequent months. III. Wages, social benefits. 1. The situation on labor market is getting worse constantly - in February this year the unemployment rate rose to 18.1%. In the economic situation survey, entrepreneurs announced further employment reductions within next months, however, clearly smaller than it resulted from assessments expressed in January this year. The Government's adoption of the project to make the labor law more flexible gives hope for a gradual improvement of the situation on labor market. It is a very important positive part of the Government's program. 2. Within the period January - February this year, average gross wages in the enterprise sector were higher by 5.7% than in the same period last year, and the growth in real terms amounted to 2.2%. 3. The employment in the enterprise sector lowered in February this year by 0.2% as compared to January. As compared to the period February - January 2001, the average employment was lower by 5% what in conditions of the increase of average real wages by 2.2% means the drop of purchasing power of total income generated from the work in enterprises. 4. The average pension and disability benefit in the period January - February this year was bigger by 14.6% than in the same period of 2001 and its purchasing power increased by 10.8%. The increase on a similar scale is also related to pensions and disability benefits in agriculture. However, joined with: o A drop of the number of pension and disability benefits recipients, o The fact that in the same period last year a single adjusting payment for too low valorization of benefits in 2000 was made, in the 1st quarter this year a drop of total income generated from pensions and disability benefits is expected. 5. The above mentioned data suggest that in the 1st quarter this year real income at disposal can be decreased. In this situation, a probable relatively high increase of individual consumption will mean a drop of households' tendency to save. In the next quarters of 2002, a gradual acceleration of the growth pace of income at disposal is forecasted. IV.Situation in public finance sector. 1. In February this year, the revenue situation of the state budget improved - tax revenues were higher by 12.7% than a year before. Within the period January - February, the budget revenues were at the level close to the observed in the same period of 2001 and tax revenues were higher by 3.2%. The budget deficit accomplishment after February amounted to 34.3% of the limit planned in the enacted Act on the State Budget for the Year 2002. 2. However, according to present forecasts, the economic deficit in 2002 will be maintained at a very high level (5% of GDP) that is close to the level noted in 2001. 3. A big supply of Treasury securities that is necessary to finance lending needs of the budget - a result of a big deficit and small revenues from privatization: o Contributes to maintaining a high level of long-term market interest rates; o Reduces possibilities of financing the development of enterprises; o Results in the inflow of a foreign portfolio capital placed in Government bonds through which it contributes to the appreciation of the exchange rate of the zloty without the strengthening at the same time of the competitiveness of the economy - unlike direct foreign investments. That is why it is necessary to take firm actions to lower the economic deficit of the public finance sector. V. Money supply, loans, interest rates. 1. The growth pace of total money supply (M2) on the twelve-month scale lowered to 11.4% from 12.3% in January this year. According to the analyses made at the NBP, the money supply dynamics exceeding 10% in countries where inflation is low was a very rare phenomenon. 2. Cash in circulation (except the banks cashiers desks) increased in February this year by PLN 1.2 billion (by 3.2%) as compared to the amount at the end of January. The annualized dynamics increased from 15% in January this year to 16.7%. The reasons of this phenomenon and its possible impact on inflation require a further detailed recognition. 3. A further drop (from 9.6% in January this year to 7.9%) was noted in case of an annual growth pace of PLN- denominated deposits of individuals. In January and February this year, a monthly growth pace of PLN-denominated bank deposits is decidedly smaller than in the same periods in previous years. The available information indicates that a lower dynamics of bank deposits this year is not connected with putting the funds into alternative forms of saving - the growth of investment funds assets and the volume of sold bonds returned to the level noted before November last year. The dynamics of foreign currency deposits of households increased to 16.8% from 16.3% a month before. However, the growth of foreign currency deposits amount converted into PLN took place while there was noted a drop of these accounts balance as converted into USD and it resulted from the depreciation of the exchange rate of the zloty. 4. In February this year, the dynamics of lending to individuals increased from 14.4% in January this year to 14.7%. The growth pace of lending to businesses on the twelve-month scale lowered from 5.2% to 4.7% in February this year. 5. A big shortage of budget revenues with small revenues from privatization results in the increase of lending needs of the public sector. In February this year, the budget sector net debt in the banking system increased by 3.2% and the twelve-month dynamics amounted to 50%. February was the consecutive month of the increasing role of the budget sector in total money creation. The relationship of the net debt of the budget sector and M2 increased from 15.4% in February 2001 and 20.3% in January this year to 20.7%. 6. In February this year, as a reaction to the cut of basic interest rates of the NBP in January, banks made considerable adjustments of interest rates on deposits and loans. An average interest rate on PLN- denominated deposits of individuals was reduced from 7.7% in January this year to 6.6% (the smallest changes were made in case of the interest rate on savings and settlement accounts - ROR). The interest rates on consumer loans to individuals were considerably reduced - on average by 1.6 percentage point and it was the biggest cut since the beginning of 2001. The scale of reduction of an average interest rate on loans to businesses was close to the one noted in January this year and it amounted to approximately 0.5 percentage point. During recent year, the differentiation of interest rates on loans offered by commercial banks increased: in February 2001 the interest rate of a one-year loan to businesses was within a range 19.4 - 24.4%, while in February this year from 10.9 to 20.7%. 7. The recently observed tendencies in monetary aggregates: o Maintained high growth pace of money supply, o Drop of a deposit dynamics, o Growth of the dynamics of cash in circulation, can make it difficult to stabilize and lower inflation further in future. VI. Prices, inflation expectations. 1. The consumer price index on the twelve-month scale in February this year amounted to 3.5%, i.e. slightly above the amount noted last month (3.4%). The CPI growth was affected the most by the growth of prices connected with the apartment lease and energy carriers, and halting impact on inflation was made by prices for clothes and footwear and mainly dropping prices for fuels. 2. During next several months, a further drop of consumer price index is probable. The lowest level should be achieved in May this year what will result from the so-called base effect, i.e. an exceptionally big growth of prices in May 2001 that mainly resulted from the disturbances in the seasonal nature of fruit prices and a considerable increase of prices for medicines and phone subscription fees. The actual forecasts provide for a gradual growth of the consumer price index in the further part of the year. 3. In February 2002 - as compared to January - the majority of annualized core inflation measures lowered and the ""net"" inflation (excluding foodstuff and fuel prices) was maintained at the level observed a month before (4.7%): o 15%-cut average from 3.5% to 3.2%; o inflation excluding the controlled prices from 3.2% to 3.1%; o inflation excluding the most variable prices from 2.9% to 2.8%; o inflation excluding the most variable and fuel prices from 3.4% to 3.3%. The formation of the ""net"" inflation measure over the CPI confirms the statement of a favorable impact on inflation of groups of goods that are excluded from this index, i.e. foodstuffs and fuels. A tendency to drop of the remaining core inflation measures indicates, however, that the observed drop of inflation is related to all major groups of consumer goods and services and it is not caused only by potentially temporary factors. 4. In February this year, the sold industrial output prices were higher by 0.1% than a year before. In the 4th quarter 2001, a decreasing tendency of the sold industrial output prices was maintained, but in January 2002, these prices remained at the same level as in January last year. 5. Changes that took place in the structure of answers to the questions of Demoskop survey in March this year indicate a further, although very slight, improvement of individuals expectations concerning the future inflation. On one hand, after a clear drop a month before, the percentage of individuals forecasting that the prices will grow faster than now slightly increased. On the other hand, a group of people expecting that in 12 months' time prices will be lower than now increased. It should be remembered, however, that the observed improvement and then stabilization of a favorable structure of inflation expectations took place in the situation of a gradual drop of inflation. There is a risk that if inflation impulses appear they can lead to a fast reversal of this favorable tendency for future inflation. The inflation rate expected by bank analysts both in December this year and in the 11-month horizon was maintained at the level noted a month before (4.6%). VII. Decision of the Monetary Policy Council. 1. Within a recent period: o Inflation is maintained at a relatively low level; o Core inflation measures lowered further indicating that a lower inflation does not only result from a favorable formation of potentially temporary prices, however, indisputable is a positive impact of a smaller growth of foodstuff prices and a drop of fuel prices; o Favorable for future inflation is a stabilization of inflation expectations of both bank analysts and individuals; in case of the latter, it should be remembered that favorable changes in the structure of expectations took place in the situation of decreasing inflation and the reversal of this tendency is possible at the moment when inflation impulses appear. 2. In favor of prudence in monetary policy are the following: o The fact that full results of interest rates cuts by 9 percentage points in total made since February 2001 to January 2002 have not been revealed yet; o The formation of monetary aggregates, especially the drop of the dynamics of deposits, the increase of the dynamics of cash in circulation, maintained high pace of money supply growth what may make it difficult to stabilize and lower inflation further in future; o A risk of conducting of a too loose fiscal policy and an unfavorable impact of this situation on future economic processes, including inflation processes; o An improvement of the outlook of the economic situation worldwide, which, although favorable for Polish exporters and the economic growth, means a smaller than earlier forecasted anti-inflation impact; o Information that may suggest a gradual boom in the economy; o The observed in March this year increase of oil prices on the world markets and the improvement of forecasts for these prices formation what will probably lead to the increase of fuel prices on the domestic market. Considering these arguments, the Monetary Policy Council decided not to change interest rates of the NBP and to maintain its neutral position in monetary policy. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Council will be held on April 24-25, 2002."
Euroarea,2002-04-04,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. As usual, we examined recent monetary, financial and economic developments. The Governing Council concluded that the current level of key ECB interest rates remains appropriate for the maintenance of price stability over the medium term and, accordingly, decided to leave them unchanged. Starting with the analysis under the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 stood at 7.8% in the period from December 2001 to February 2002, compared with 8.0% in the period from November 2001 to January 2002. The high level of the annual growth rates of M3 continues to reflect the past portfolio shifts to liquid positions. These shifts primarily occurred during autumn 2001, when the economic and financial environment was characterised by high uncertainty. However, in the meantime, some normalisation in the development of M3 has taken place. This is indicated by a significant slowdown in the short-term dynamics of M3 in early 2002, a period in which the annual rate of growth of loans to the private sector has also continued to decline. However, the period of moderation in monetary growth has as yet been too short to allow a definitive assessment. Against this background, the Governing Council continues to hold the view that the information from the first pillar does not thus far point to risks to price stability. Nevertheless, the persistence of excess liquidity in the economy could become a concern once the economic recovery in the euro area gathers pace. As regards the second pillar, the trough in economic activity was in all likelihood reached at the end of last year. Further information received over the past few weeks, i.e. surveys, financial market and leading indicators, strengthened the expectations of a recovery in the course of this year. While some uncertainty remains as regards the precise pattern of the recovery, not least in the context of a substantial increase in oil prices, the latest evidence has reinforced our previous assessment. Real GDP growth rates in the euro area should again be in line with potential growth later this year. First, a reversal of the past inventory drawdown is under way and real disposable income growth is expected to benefit from lower rates of inflation. We also expect the stronger international environment to play an important role in stimulating euro area exports, and both domestic and external factors should foster investment. Finally, the positive outlook for the euro area economy is very much supported by sound fundamentals and the absence of major imbalances. Turning to price developments, let me first recall that, over recent months, annual rates of consumer price inflation have been affected by several factors of a special or temporary nature. However, annual inflation rates are currently somewhat higher than was expected a few months ago, with early estimates for March pointing to a figure of 2.5%. This is mainly because oil prices have again risen significantly in the more recent period. If sustained, higher oil prices would also have an impact on inflation rates in the remainder of 2002. While inflation rates are expected to fall to below 2% later in the coming months, this decline may possibly be less pronounced than was foreseen, and inflation rates during this year could turn out to be somewhat higher than previously expected. Beyond the shorter term, upward pressure on prices from aggregate demand should, in the light of current projections of a gradual economic recovery in the euro area, remain contained. In addition, the outlook for inflation is fundamentally dependent on wage moderation. Such moderation is important not only in order to contain risks to price stability but also to foster employment growth. As I have already noted on earlier occasions, there is some cause for concern with regard to ongoing wage negotiations. Fiscal policies in the euro area can also contribute to the maintenance of a favourable outlook for non-inflationary growth. It is vital that the commitments made to achieving balanced budgets by 2003-04 be firmly followed up in the Member States concerned. A continuation along the path of fiscal consolidation is essential, as is vigilance in ensuring strict adherence to the medium-term plans and rigorous implementation of the procedures of the Stability and Growth Pact. Equally, the expected recovery should be seen as an ideal opportunity to strengthen efforts towards implementing comprehensive structural reforms  in public expenditure and revenues and product, labour and financial markets. Heads of State and Government confirmed this objective during their recent meeting in Barcelona. If implemented vigorously, such reforms could increase the growth of real GDP and employment on a sustainable basis. Past improvements in the functioning of markets, together with wage moderation, have contributed to strong employment growth and a considerable reduction in unemployment. It is therefore clearly in the interest of all countries to continue to rigorously implement the agenda agreed in Lisbon and recently confirmed in Barcelona."
South Korea,2002-04-04,"The economic recovery has been maintained thanks to strong consumption and construction investment. With facilities investment and exports still sluggish, however, it is still uncertain whether sufficient momentum exists for a sustained recovery. Consumer prices remain subdued. Taking these factors into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain its benchmark overnight call rate at around its current level in April. Nevertheless, loans to the household sector expanded significantly and asset prices including those for stocks and real estate have continued to rise. Considering recent unstable movements of international oil prices and other factors, it is feared that inflationary pressures may increase once exports and facilities investment pick up. Therefore, the MPC noted that close attention would be paid to the pace of recovery of exports and facilities investment, the evolution of asset prices and price movements in carrying out monetary policy in the future."
Peru,2002-04-04,"BANCO CENTRAL DE RESERVA DEL PERU Press release MONETARY PROGRAM APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF THE BANK FOR APRIL 2002 a The Board of the Bank decided to rise the average balance of the banks' current account and to maintain the Central Bank interest rate in domestic currency In March, the daily average balance of the banks' current account was 205 million, higher than the range announced for that mont h (185 million to 195 million) due to greater reserve requirements. Considering this higher demand of current account funds, the Bank rose the disposal of banking liquidity with respect to the March Monetary Program announce in order to avoid interbank interest rates rising pressures. Thus, the average interbank interest rate in domestic currency was 2,5 percent in March, compared with 2,6 percent in February. The Board of the Bank assessed the April monetary policy and established the following: The targeted range for the banks' current account balance held at the Central Bank on a daily average basis will be 205 million to 215 million. For monetary regulation credits and temporary purchase of CDBCRP and Treadury bonds out of auctions, the effective interest rate would be the weighted average of the interbank interest rates, or 3,0 percent, whichever is highest. For overnight deposits in domestic currency held by banks at the Central Bank, the effective interest rate remained at 1,9 percent. For foreign exchange temporary purchase operations (swap operations), the commission which implies an effective annual cost of 3,0 percent is maintained. The following interest rates will be used in foreign-currency operations: The effective annual rate for monetary regulation credits will be 2,75 percent. For overnight deposits held by banks at the Central Bank, the rate is equivalent to the average obtained by the Central Bank for similar deposits abroad. The Central Bank grants monetary regulation credits in domestic and foreign currency on a regular basis. Besides, the Central Bank operations will be oriented to reduce volatility in the exchange market. If justified by financial conditions, the values mentioned above could be modified in order to ensure the attainment of the objective to preserve monetary stability, which mean avoiding inflationary or deflationary pressures."
Chile,2002-04-09,"Santiago. April 9, 2002 Press Release At its monthly monetary policy meeting held today, the Board of the Central Bank decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at an annual 4.75% and leave liquidity credit lines unchanged at the levels prevailing since the previous meeting. The outlook for growth of most of Chile's trading partners is tending to improve even though the situation in Latin America continues weak and oil prices have risen because of the trouble in the Middle East. On the domestic front, most macroeconomic indicators are weak as regards year-on-year growth. However, data show that domestic demand reached its lowest level during the second half of last year and thus the Board maintains its outlook for moderately rising demand in the coming quarters and inflation well in the centre of the target range. Nevertheless, it does not dismiss the possibility of further changes to the monetary policy rate if the future situation so requires. The Central Bank reiterates its commitment to a flexible use of monetary policy to avoid deviations from the inflationary target."
Philippines,2002-04-11,"The Monetary Board decided today to keep the BSP's policy rates steady at 7.0 percent for the overnight RRP rate and 9.25 percent for the overnight RP rate. In its assessment of prevailing economic conditions, the Monetary Board noted that inflation has been generally tame over the last few months due to favorable food supply conditions, broad currency stability and restrained demand. However, the Monetary Board believes that there are downside risks to the inflation outlook heading toward 2003. These risks stem from the adverse impact on food prices of the anticipated El Niño weather phenomenon combined with the observed uptrend in world oil prices and the possible power rate adjustments. At the same time, signs of a US-led global economic turnaround and strengthening demand at home, point to demand-side price pressures going forward. These factors suggest the need for a cautious monetary policy stance that will ensure a timely response to a possible build-up in inflationary pressures. The Monetary Board likewise believes that monetary policy should focus on allowing previous policy rate reductions to work their way through the economy. As of 15 March 2002, the policy rates have declined by 800 basis points since the BSP started to ease policy rates in December 2000. In fact, the current environment of declining market interest rates and quiescent inflation has led to lower real interest rates in the Philippines across time as well as relative to most Asian countries. In particular, the average real lending rate of 5.1 percent for the period 1-3 April 2002 was lower than the rates for Hong Kong. India. Singapore. Taiwan. Thailand and Malaysia, and was below the real lending rates that prevailed in the Philippines since February 1999. The decline in the real interest rate is expected to help create the conditions for increased bank lending, bolstering the economic growth momentum. Going forward, the BSP will continue to conduct monetary policy in a pre-emptive fashion to guard against emergent risks to the price stability objective."
Israel,2002-04-22,"The Bank of Israel's Monetary Program for May 2002. The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for May 2002, according to which its interest rate will be raised by 0.2 percentage points to 4.6 percent. The Bank of Israel explains that the rise in the interest rate is intended to restrict the insinuation of the rise in prices in the last few months intoan ongoing increase in the rate of inflation for next year to over 3 percent, the upper limit of the long-term target. The decision was taken in the light of the rise in the last month of expected inflation over the next few years; the increase in the budget deficit which is likely to deviate significantly again this year from the norm in advanced countries, and which will continue to increase the public debt; the concern thatdepreciation of the NIS may continue, with its implications for the rate of inflation; the surge in the money supply and the rise in the liquid part of the public's asset portfolio; the rise in interest rates in the moneyand capital markets due to the increase in the budget deficit and in the level of uncertainty; and the recent deterioration in foreign investors' and rating companies' assessment of Israel's economy. The Bank of Israel stresses that monetary policy aims to maintain price stability asan essential element of sustainable growth, as well as to reinforce the financial stability of the money, capital, and foreign-exchange markets. This stability, which contributes to Israel's economic robustness, requires adherence to fiscal and monetary discipline. Although inflation assessments for the next few years obtained from inflation expectations in the capital market, private forecasters' assessments, and inflation estimates based on models developed in the Bank of Israel indicated a decline in March into the target range, they have risen from the beginning of April to date and are above the long-term target range. The Bank also notes that these assessments, which are derived from the rise in the exchange rate in the last month, among other things, all assume that the Bank's interest rate will rise during the year and prevent inflation from reaching higher levels. In addition, the change in the money supply, which increased by 26.4 percent in 2001, as well asthe rise in the liquid components of the public's asset portfolio, indicate a higher level of uncertainty and the possibility that this moneymay be diverted into other channels, a move which could translate into a rapid rise of the exchange rate, and which would eventually become a higher rate of inflation. The Bank explains that in 2002, too, the government deficit is expected to be higher than planned, even if the entire change in the budget which has yet tobe approved is passed. The size of the deficit is beyond that considered acceptable in the advanced countries (even using to Israel's specific lenient definition of the deficit), and will oblige the government to increase its borrowing to finance it, which will result in a risein the rate of interest it will have to pay on its debt. In April interest rates on unindexed 10-year government bonds rose to 7.6 percent, about one percentage point higher than at the beginning of the year, and interest on indexed debt rose by a similar amount in that period to 4.8 percent. The increases in these interest rates cause a parallel rise in other interest rates and depress investment and employment. The budget deficit is also reflected in the interest on one-year Treasury bills, which rose from 1.5 percent at the beginning of the year to 5.7 percent; in the light of these rises in all interest rates in the capital market, the Bank of Israel is unable to maintain the short-term interest rates which it sets other than by printing money at an ever faster rate, which is already reflected in the rapid rise in the money supply, and which would eventually boost the rate of inflation. The Bank also explains that even in an economy experiencing a recession a situation could arise in which prices start rising again and stability becomes undermined. Although the threat of price rises in an economy in recession is somewhat less acute, accepting an increase in the rate of inflation is likely to lead the economy into the unfortunate combination of inflationand high unemployment. In this context it is relevant to note that the Bank of Israel's short-term real rate of interest since the beginning of 2000 was 1.5 percent, its lowest level for 8 years, and the Bank's policy thus supports the government's policy of stimulating growth and employment. Israel's risk premium as reflected in the yield on Israel government bonds traded abroad rose for both the short term (by 35 basis points, to 1.15 percentage points) and the long term (by 25 basis points, to 1.65 percentage points). This rise, despite the difficulty in drawing conclusions regarding therisk premium due to the involvement of Israeli investors and the low tradability in this market, do indicate an increase in uncertainty regarding Israel's economy. It should also be noted that for the first time since external companies started rating Israel's economy, one of the rating companies has recorded a negative change in its assessment, due mainly to Israel's fiscal weakness against the background of the deterioration in the security situation.

Poland,2002-04-26,"Information on the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council on April 25- 26, 2002 I External conditions. 1. The data that have been released since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Council indicate more clearly than a month ago that the boom in the world economy begins: o In the United States, in March this year, the biggest increase since May 2000 of the sold industrial output was noted (by 0.7%), the manufacturing capacity utilization in industry increased, the consumer confidence index increased; the average forecast for the economic growth in the United States in 2002 increased as compared to March this year by 0.5 percentage point (to 2.2% GDP); o An insignificant increase (by 0.1 percentage point) was noted in case of the average growth forecast in the euro zone (to 1.2% GDP); in case of Germany it remained on the level 0.9%. 2. Within the recent period the risk of oil prices rise on world markets increased what would adversely affect future inflation and economic boom worldwide. As a result of a bigger political risk in Middle East and Venezuela, oil prices in March and April this year significantly rose. This situation led to the subsequent rise of the forecasted oil price. At present, according to the average market forecast, in 2002 a price per barrel will amount to USD 23 on average (by USD 1.5 more than a month before). It should be emphasized that the present oil price forecasts are very uncertain and they are within a range from USD 19.5 to USD 40 per barrel. II. Production, economic growth. 1. Signals coming from the Polish economy are not explicit. Some data indicate that a gradual economic boom should take place. 2. An improvement of the situation is signalized by: o Strengthening of the growth tendency of retail sales that has been lasting for several months; after the annualized rise by 4.7% in January and by 6.7% in February this year, in March the noted rise amounted to 9.9% (in a way it resulted from the shifting of the Easter shopping from April to March this year); o An increase - a second moth in a row - of consumer loans dynamics (from 14.4% in January and 14.6% in February to 15.1% in March this year); o Higher than a year before were tax revenues of the budget within the period January-March (by 6.2%), including especially income tax from legal persons (by 13.7%) and indirect taxes (by 6.0%) which are the most sensitive to the economic situation; o A further improvement of the economic situation survey results in April this year: ▪ In the industrial processing the assessments of the current production and forecasts for the future demand and production are positive; better than a month ago - although still negative - are the assessments of the current demand; ▪ As compared to March this year, the improvement was also noted in case of the general indicators of the situation in construction (to +7) and in retail sales (to -16), although they are lower than in the same month of 2001. 3. The prudence in forecasting the boom is prompted by: o The sold industrial output that in March this year was lower by 3.2% than a year before; although it should be remembered that this year there was one business day less than last year; o The construction and assembling production that was lower by 14.4% than in March 2001 (a month ago the drop scale amounted to 13.9%). III. Wages, social benefits. 1. The situation in the area of employment should reduce the wage pressure in the economy. In March this year, the unemployment rate maintained on the level observed a month before at 18.1%. The average employment in the enterprise sector in March this year was lower by 0.1% than a month before and as compared to the period January-March 2001 it lowered by 4.8%. In the economic situation survey the entrepreneurs forecasted further reductions of employment within the next months, however, smaller than they forecasted in March this year. 2. Within the period January-March this year, average gross wages in the enterprise sector were higher by 5.3% than in the same period last year and the increase in real terms amounted to 1.8% (as compared to the increase by 5.7% in nominal terms and 2.2% in real terms within the period January-February this year). 3. The March data on employment and wages are convergent with the assumptions that constitute the basis for the forecast of income at disposal according to which in the first quarter this year this income can be smaller in real terms. IV. Situation in public finance sector. 1. The insofar state budget accomplishment, a forecasted gradual improvement of the economic situation and additional revenues resulting from tax changes that come into force indicate that there is no visible bigger threats to the accomplishment of the Act on the State Budget for the Year 2002. 2. However, it does not change the fact that the public finance deficit will be maintained in 2002 at a very high level (approximately 5% GDP). It will adversely affect the economy. In the situation of a big deficit and small revenues from privatization the Government - in order to finance high lending needs - has to issue a considerable amount of Treasury securities. In the first quarter this year, the total of new issues of Treasury bills amounted to PLN 6.7 billion (by 116.1% more than in the same period of 2001), and of Treasury bonds - PLN 12 billion (by 128.7% more than in the 1st quarter of 2001). This situation contributes to the maintaining of a high level of long-term market interest rates and limits the possibilities to finance the development of enterprises. Moreover, the inflow of foreign portfolio capital invested in Government bonds is a factor that affects the strengthening of the zloty exchange rate without the strengthening of the economy competitiveness at the same time. 3. There is maintained uncertainty concerning the shape of the state budget and of other parts of the public finance sector in 2003. The basic task while constructing the budget should be the reduction of expenses in order to enable a considerable decrease of the public finance deficit and - thanks to this - reduce the intensity of the unfavorable impacts for the development of the economy that have been mentioned above. V. Money supply, loans, interest rates. 1. As compared to the situation of the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Council, the scale of threats to the future inflation by monetary factors decreased: o The annualized growth pace of money supply (aggregate M3) lowered from 7.2% in February to 3.1% in March this year; the decrease was also noted in case of the dynamics of the insofar basic measure of money supply (M2) (from 11.5% to 8.6%); o The annualized dynamics of cash in circulation dropped as well (from 16.7% a month before to 15.6%); o The growth pace of lending to businesses on the twelve-month scale lowered from 4.4% a month before to 2.0%. 2. At the same time, a decreasing tendency of the annualized dynamics of deposits placed by households is maintained (from 5.4% in February this year to 3.5%). Moreover. March was the second month in a row when the annualized dynamics of loans to individuals increased (from 14.4% in January and 14.6% in February to 15.1%). 3. In March this year, in reaction to the interest rate cut by the Monetary Policy Council in January banks made further cuts of interest rates on loans. With the simultaneous maintaining of interest rates on deposits at the level noted a month before it means the reduction of commercial banks' margins. An average interest rate on loans to businesses was decreased by 0.5 percentage point as compared to February this year. Significantly - by 1.2 percentage point as compared to February this year and by 2.8 percentage points since December 2001 - banks also lowered interest rates on consumer loans to individuals. An average interest rate on PLN- denominated deposits placed by individuals did not change. Since February 2001, in total, in reaction to the cut of the reference rate by 9 percentage points by the Monetary Policy Council, banks cut the average interest rates: On deposits placed by individuals by 7.7 percentage points to 6.7%; On loans to individuals by 4.9 percentage points to 18%; On deposits placed by businesses by 6.8 percentage points to 7.1%; On loans to businesses by 6.8 percentage points to 14.1%. VI. Prices, inflation expectations. 1. The annualized consumer price index in February this year amounted to 3.3%, i.e. by 0.2 percentage points less than a month before. Within the next months a further drop of consumer price index is probable. The lowest level should be reached in May this year. In the remaining part of the year, a gradual increase of the consumer price index is forecasted that will result from, inter alia, the rise of controlled prices. 2. The role of potentially temporary factors in the drop of inflation is getting smaller. The evidence for this is the fact that in March this year all the annualized core inflation measures lowered, with the ""net"" inflation measure the most: o ""net"" inflation (excluding foodstuff and fuel prices) from 4.7% to 4.1%; o inflation excluding the most variable and fuel prices from 3.3% to 2.9%; o 15%-cut average from 3.2% to 2.9%; o inflation excluding the most variable prices from 2.8% to 2.6%; o inflation excluding the controlled prices from 3.1% to 3.0%. 3. In March this year, the sold industrial output prices were higher by 0.4% than a year before. In the 4th quarter of 2001, a decreasing tendency of the sold industrial output prices maintained, and since January 2002 a slight increasing tendency of the PPI has been observed. 4. Prices in industrial processing were still lower than a year before (by 1.0%), but the scale of the drop decreased (in November 2001 the drop amounted to 3.1%). A still high increase of prices takes place in the provision of electric energy, natural gas and water (by 6.4%) and in mining (by 5.2%). These are sections where the wages constitute the highest in the enterprise sector (in the 1st quarter this year they amounted to PLN 3501.7 in mining and PLN 2933.7 in production and provision of electric energy, natural gas and water as compared to the average in all enterprises at the level PLN 2211.0). Additionally, in the 1st quarter this year, the annualized dynamics of wages in these enterprises was higher than the average in enterprises in general (7.5% in mining and 6.4% in the provision of electric energy, while the average wage increase in enterprises amounted to 5.3%). It results from the fact that in these sections a state ownership dominates and there is no competition. Instead of the effectiveness improvement, the enterprises shift the excessive and growing costs onto clients. Such actions result in the increase of costs in enterprises what weakens their competitiveness. Moreover, they reduce consumers' spending on the purchase of other goods and services. Both are not favorable for a permanent development of the economy. 5. Changes that took place in the structure of answers to the questions of the survey made by Demoskop in April this year indicate a further improvement of individuals' expectations about the future inflation. A percentage of individuals who expect the prices to grow slower than now increased (by 0.5 percentage point) or that they will be maintained on the existing level (by 2.3 percentage points). The number of people in the remaining groups of the surveyed decreased, including those most pessimistic who expect that prices will grow faster than so far (by 0.8 percentage point). The observed improvement and then the stabilization of a favorable structure of inflation expectations took place in the situation of a gradual decrease of inflation. There is a threat that if the inflation impulses appear they may lead to the reverse of this favorable tendency for future inflation. The inflation rate expected by bank analysts both in December this year and in the 11-month horizon lowered by 0.2 percentage point (to 4.4%) as compared to the situation observed a month before. VII. Decision of the Monetary Policy Council. 1. As compared to the situation noted a month before, the following signals indicating the weakening of inflation threats appeared: o The consumer price index lowered further; o All core inflation measures lowered, and the ""net"" inflation measure the most what indicates that the role of potentially temporary factors in inflation drop decreases; o An improvement of inflation expectations by both bank analysts and individuals took place; o A scale of threats to future inflation posed by monetary factors decreased: the dynamics of money supply decreased significantly and the growth pace of cash in circulation and lending to businesses decreased; o A difficult situation on labor market is maintained that should reduce the wage pressure. 2. Signals concerning the growth of Poland's economy are not explicit. For a long-term development of basic importance is the improvement of public finance condition, restructuring of the existing sector of public enterprises, and a labor market reform. 3. The prudence in monetary policy is prompted by: o An increase of oil prices on the world markets and further increase in the forecasts about the prices for this raw material; o A drop of dynamics of deposits; o An increase - the second month in a row - of the dynamics of lending to individuals; o A strengthening of - lasting for several months - growth tendency in retail sales; o A risk of the maintaining of a too lax fiscal policy and unfavorable impact of this situation on future economic processes, including inflation ones; o An improvement of the outlook for the economic situation worldwide, which - although favorable for the Polish exporters and economic growth - will affect the inflation less favorably than was forecasted earlier. It should be also remembered that full results of the interest rate cuts by 9 percentage points in total made since February 2001 to January 2002 have not been revealed yet. Considering these arguments, the Monetary Policy Council decided to: Cut the minimum yield on 28-day open market operations from 10% to 9.5%; Cut the rediscount rate from 12% to 11%; Cut the lombard rate from 13.5% to 12.5%; Maintain the deposit rate on the same level (6.5%); Maintain its neutral position in monetary policy. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Council will be held on May 16, 2002 in order to accept the Report on the Performance of Monetary Policy Guidelines in 2001 and the Report on NBP Operations in 2001, and the next one on May 28-29, 2002."
Thailand,2002-04-30,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 22 April 2002 Mr. Pakorn Malakul na Ayudhya. Deputy Governor. Bank of Thailand announced that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments, both domestically and abroad, in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance. The MPC saw signs of improvement in several indicators on both the production and consumption sides, while the external financial position remained stable with respect to both foreign debt and international reserves. At the same time, the recent rise in oil prices did not exert significant inflationary pressure. Looking forward, the MPC assessed that the impact of higher oil prices on the global and Thai economic recovery should be small so long as tensions in the Middle East are resolved. In addition, clear signs of recovery in Thailand's main trading partners should help to strengthen the Thai economy in the near future. The MPC, therefore, decided to maintain the 14-day repurchase rate at 2 percent per annum. Details of the MPC's latest growth and inflation forecasts will be announced on 30 April 2002 in conjunction with the release of the April 2002 Inflation Report. Bank of Thailand 22 April 2002."
Euroarea,2002-05-02,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. The Governing Council comprehensively examined monetary, financial and economic developments and also considered the accumulated changes in the economic outlook since its decision to lower the key ECB interest rates in November 2001. We concluded that the prospects for price stability appear to be somewhat less favourable than they were towards the end of last year. At the same time, we recognised that the economic outlook remains subject to uncertainties and that price developments partly reflect the influence of specific temporary factors. Accordingly, we decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Starting with the analysis under the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 decreased to 7.5% in the period from January to March 2002, down from 7.8% in the period from December 2001 to February 2002. The high annual growth rate of M3 continues to reflect the portfolio shifts to liquid positions which occurred last autumn. In the meantime there has been some normalisation in the development of M3, as indicated by the slowdown in its short-term dynamics in early 2002. The annual rate of growth of loans to the private sector also continued to decline in March. However. M3 growth has only slowed relatively recently and, for the time being, the reversal of built-up liquidity is proceeding only slowly. As regards the second pillar, our expectations for a rebound in real GDP growth in the euro area have been confirmed by recently published forecasts of international organisations, which all paint a similar picture. While the recovery in 2002 is expected to initially proceed at a gradual pace, real GDP growth rates in the euro area should again be in line with potential growth later this year and solid growth rates should be attainable by 2003. Business confidence has considerably improved in the euro area over the past few months and the conditions for a sustained upswing in domestic demand continue to be in place, including favourable financing conditions. The more positive international environment should also help stimulate euro area exports, thereby fuelling aggregate demand in the euro area. Finally, sound fundamentals and the absence of major imbalances support the positive outlook for the euro area economy. However, there are still a number of uncertainties surrounding the strength of the current upswing, such as those related to the future development of oil prices and to the impact of existing imbalances elsewhere on the world economy. Turning to price developments, trends in inflation  with annual HICP increases of 2.7% in January falling to 2.2% in April, according to Eurostat's early estimate  have been less satisfactory than expected a few months ago, not least as a result of higher oil prices. As stated on previous occasions, price developments in both 2000 and 2001, and again in recent months, have been shaped by a sequence of adverse but rather specific shocks to prices. These should unwind sooner or later and, in principle, such shocks should not affect the medium-term outlook for price stability. However, it is essential that past upward tendencies in prices  even though they partly resulted from a clustering of specific factors  do not become entrenched. Recently published forecasts of price developments in the euro area, developments in indicators of inflation expectations and recent trends in wage settlements neither clearly confirm nor entirely contradict the risk of such entrenchment. At this juncture, it is therefore particularly important to remain vigilant with regard to the further evolution of the key factors determining the outlook for prices. On the basis of current information, it is still possible that annual HICP inflation rates will fall below 2% in the coming months. However, the outcome is highly dependent on oil price developments. The rather protracted upward trend in services prices is also a factor to be taken into account. For next year, projections for price developments depend largely on the assumption of continued wage moderation. The outcome of the ongoing wage negotiations in some regions of the euro area could become a matter of concern. Excessive wage increases could create additional cost pressure with potential consequences not only for prices but also  to an even greater extent  for employment creation and real GDP growth. Regarding fiscal policies in the euro area, let me reiterate the views previously expressed. It is vital that those Member States that have not already done so manage the transition to budgetary positions in balance or in surplus so that the Stability and Growth Pact can operate smoothly and effectively in future. Commitments made to achieving balanced budgets by 2003-4 must therefore be honoured by the Member States concerned. The Governing Council calls upon Member States to make faster progress in implementing comprehensive structural reforms  in public expenditure and revenues and product, labour and financial markets. The forthcoming finalisation of the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines for 2002 will be an opportunity both to take stock of the unfinished agenda following the agreements of Lisbon and, more recently, of Barcelona and, in particular, to accelerate the implementation of reforms. As we have said on numerous occasions, such reforms are needed to increase the growth of real GDP and employment on a sustainable basis. Past experiences both inside and outside the European Union indicate that measures to promote the efficiency and integration of markets, the encouragement of entrepreneurship and the fostering of a knowledge-based economy are clearly working in this direction and are thus in the interest of all member countries."
Peru,2002-05-02,"BANCO CENTRAL DE RESERVA DEL PERU Press release MONETARY PROGRAM APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF THE BANK FOR MAY 2002 In April, the daily average balance of the bank' scurrent account was 206 million, within the range announced for that month (205 million to 215 million). hte average interbank interest rate was 2,5 percent in April, similar to the previous month. The Board of the Bank assessed the May monetary policy and established the following : The targeted range for the banks' current account balance held at theC entral Bank on a daily average basis will be maintained at 205 million to 215 million. For monetary regulation credits and temporary purchase of CDBCRP an d Treadury bonds out of auctions, the effective interest rate remains a sthe weighted average of the interbank interest rates, or 3,0 percent, whichever is highest. For overnight deposits in domestic currency held by banks at the Central Bank, the effective interest rate remained at1 ,9 percent. For foreign exchange temporary purchase operations (swap operations), the commission which implies an effective annual cost of3 ,0 percent is maintained. The following interest rates will be used in foreign-currency operations: The effective annual rate for monetary regulation credits willb e 2,75 percent. For overnight deposits held by banks at the Central Bank, the rate is equivalent to the average obtained by the Central Bank for similar deposits abroad. If justified by financial conditions, the values mentioned above could be modified in order to ensure the attainment of the objective to preserve monetary stability, which mean avoiding inflationary or deflationary pressures."
South Korea,2002-05-07,"The economic recovery has become more evident as exports have shifted to positive growth and facilities investment has shown signs of improvement along with the continued strength of both consumption and construction investment. Although consumer prices remain subdued so far, inflation is expected to be higher in the second half due to the presence of potential destabilizing factors, including rises in international oil prices and real estate prices, and a gradual increase in demand-side inflationary pressures stemming from the economic recovery. In particular, there is concern over a future excess of liquidity, given the current rapid growth of the monetary aggregates, which is led mainly by a steep increase in household lending at low interest rates. Taking the current economic situations into consideration, it is believed that the fine-tuning of monetary policy is necessary in order to avoid excessive liquidity and to strengthen the basis for price stability. Therefore, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise its target for the overnight call rate from 4., 0 percent to 4., 25 percent."
Philippines,2002-05-07,"In its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to keep the BSP's policy rates unchanged at 7.0 percent for the overnight borrowing rate and 9.25 percent for the overnight lending rate. Based on the assessment of prevailing economic and financial information that bear on the inflation outlook and the economy's growth prospects, the Monetary Board believes that the inflation path will generally be in line with the average 5-6 percent target for 2002. The broadly quiescent inflation picture for the rest of the year is based on expectations of favorable food supply conditions, continued stability in the exchange rate, and still soft—though improving—domestic demand. Meanwhile, there are increasing signs of a rebound in the world economy and favorable developments in domestic demand such as the rise in capacity utilization in manufacturing, the expansion in domestic liquidity, as well as the improvement in bank lending and exports performance. However, uncertainty over the impact of the El Niño weather phenomenon on agricultural crop production as well as the direction of world oil prices and power rates point to possible upside pressures on inflation in 2003. Given these considerations, the Monetary Board believes that the effects of monetary easing measures undertaken in the past should be allowed sufficient time to feed through the economy. Since the BSP started to ease policy rates in late 2000, banks' lending rates have declined by about 10.6 percentage points during the period November 2000-April 2002 while the benchmark 91-day Treasury bill rates have dropped by 11.1 percentage points. The sustained downtrend in domestic interest rates amidst a broadly subdued inflation environment has also contributed to a marked decline in real interest rates (interest rates after deducting inflation) in the Philippines relative to historical levels and to most countries in the region. In particular, the real lending rate in the Philippines at 4.14 percent for the period 25-30 April 2002 was lower than those in Hong Kong. India. Malaysia. Singapore. South Korea. Taiwan and Thailand. A timely and well-calibrated monetary policy response would also help provide stimulus to the country's growth objective while keeping inflationary pressures at bay. The current neutral stance of the US Fed has also provided the BSP some scope for maintaining its policy rates. Going forward, monetary policy will continue to monitor carefully the unfolding domestic and global developments so as to ensure the attainment of the BSP's objective of promoting price stability while helping maintain the impetus for the economy's growth momentum."
United States,2002-05-07,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate unchanged at 1 3/4 percent. The information that has become available since the last meeting of the Committee confirms that economic activity has been receiving considerable upward impetus from a marked swing in inventory investment. Nonetheless, the degree of the strengthening in final demand over coming quarters, an essential element in sustained economic expansion, is still uncertain. In these circumstances, although the stance of monetary policy is currently accommodative, the Committee believes that, for the foreseeable future, against the background of its long run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are balanced with respect to the prospects for both goals. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan. Chairman; William J McDonough. Vice Chairman; Susan S Bies; Roger W Ferguson. Jr.; Edward M Gramlich; Jerry L Jordan; Robert D McTeer. Jr.; Mark W Olson; Anthony M Santomero, and Gary H Stern. Voting against the action: none."
Chile,2002-05-09,"Santiago. May 9, 2002 Press Release At its monthly monetary policy meeting held today, the Board of the Central Bank decided to lower the monetary policy interest rate by 75 basis points from an annual 4.75% to 4% and to lower the rates on liquidity credit lines by the same amount each. The decision is based on the outlook for low inflation in the medium term because economic growth continues slower than expected. The outlook for world growth is more positive than a few months ago although there is only cautious optimism regarding the strength of industrialized countries' recovery. The complex regional situation, although it has not brought financial contagion, has generated adverse effects on trade and output. The first-quarter economic indicators show domestic spending recovering from the very low levels at end-2001 but more slowly than expected. Output reached its lowest levels in the first months of this year and is now showing signs of gradual expansion. These circumstances are in line with continuing low inflationary pressures. The reduction of the monetary policy rate thus hopes to maintain inflation on course, converging on 3% a year within the 12 to 24 month horizon and to help to boost economic activity. The Central Bank confirms its commitment to using monetary policy with the necessary flexibility to avoid any deviation from the inflation target."
Israel,2002-05-27,"The Bank of Israel's Monetary Program for June 2002. The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for June 2002, according to which its interest rate will be raised by 1 percent to 5.6 percent. The Bank of Israel explains that the rise in the short-term interest rate is essential to restore the development of inflation to the realm of price stability, and in order to bolster financial stability in the context of increased uncertainty following the ongoing relaxation of budgetary discipline, the increase in long-term interest, and the security incidents. The interest-rate hike is made necessary by the acceleration of inflation expectations for the next few years-as derived from the capital market, private forecasters, and the Bank of Israel's models-beyond the 3 percent rate which constitutes theupper limit of the range defined as price stability. As will be recalled, the Bank of Israel reduced the interest rate by 2 percentage points at the end of 2001 within the framework of a program involving a change in the overall economic policy mix, and in which the government decided to return to a policy of fiscal restraint and a declining path for the deficit and the public debt in the next few years. The avowed intention of the policymakers was that this policy should also lead to the lowering of the long-term interest rate, thereby serving to stimulate economic growth and employment without imperiling price stability. This was in addition to the structural changes in the money and foreign-currency markets agreed upon within that framework, ad which were intended in themselves to make it enable pricestability to be maintained with a lower interest rate. Additional important components of that program were supposed to have been an understanding with the General Federation of Labor (Histadrut) about changing the path of wages in the public services to bring it into line with price stability, and dealing with the problem of private legislation in a framework consistent with national priorities. The assessment of the Bank of Israel-assuming that the program would be implemented in full-was that once the public's assets and liabilities portfolio had been adjusted, alongside some local-currency depreciation and a far lower one-offprice increase, the foreign-currency market would stabilize and the inflation rate revert to within the range of the long-term target. In this way, real short-term interest should have declined and there should have been real depreciation-factors which serve to boost employment and growth. Depreciation did in fact halt towards the middle of February 2002, in the wake of the Bank of Israel's assertion of its determination to act to maintain pricestability and reminder to the public of the risks inherent in exchange-rate-indexed investments, followed by the 0.6 percentage-point interest-rate hike at the end of February. Due to the continued laxness of the government's fiscal policy and the deterioration ofthe security situation, however, the stability of the financial markets has been undermined of late, inflation expectations have risen beyond the range of the target defined as price stability, and there are apprehensions ofcontinued local-currency depreciation and the exacerbation of these negative processes. Moreover, the interest rate on long-term Treasury bonds, which constitute a benchmark for long-term and mortgage interest rates in Israel, rose once more by more than one percentage point-outstripping their level at the end of 2001-and the interest-rate spread from unindexed 10-year Treasury bonds to short-term interest rates widened at the end of May to over 4 percent (about 9 percent in issues of Shahar, compared with less than 5 percent on short-term interest). This increase is connected with thelack of confidence in the government's ability to maintain fiscal discipline in the long run, and is directly affected by the increase in government borrowing needs in order to finance the rise in the deficit, leading to a rise in the public debt and its future debt-service. The Bank of Israel reiterates its view that in the wake of the rise in interest rates in the capital market it is unable to maintain the low level of short-term interest without resorting to E 28098 printing money,' doing so at an ever-increasing rate, which would ultimately be expressed in the acceleration of inflation. Referring tothe government's recent decision to amend the budget, the Bank of Israel pointed out that the main aim of macroeconomic policy is to stop the rise inunemployment and help restore the economy to a path of sustainable growth.Consequently, neither the continued expansion of the deficit, which causeslong-term interest to rise and investment to be suppressed, nor an increase in the tax burden can be countenanced. Instead, adjustments and reductions should be made in the extent of the government's current expenditure, including bringing public-sector wage changes into line with a low-inflation environment. Thus, in the absence of an appropriate budget cut and acceptance of a deficit of 4 percent of GDP (which, according to cautious estimates and as measured in accordance with internationally-accepted definitions, will exceed 6 percent), it is necessary at this point to adjust monetary policy. Note that even after the interest-rate hike, real short-term interest rates will be lower than those that prevailed in the last few years and, together with the containment of the erosion due to real depreciation, monetary policy will serve to stimulate investment, employment, and growth. Israel's risk premium, as reflected in the yield on Israel government bonds traded abroad, dipped slightly after rising in May. It is difficult to draw conclusions from this regarding the risk premium, due to the involvement of Israeli investors and the low tradability in this market. Note that the possibility of lowering Israel's credit rating was mooted by one of the rating companies, which reduced Israel's rating outlook in May. This was due mainly to Israel's fiscal weakness against the background of the deterioration in the security situation, and could increase the cost of net borrowing by the government and the private sector, serving to reduce foreign investment in Israel. The Bank of Israel calls on the Knesset to carefully consider the proposed amendment tothe Bank of Israel Law that was brought before the House at the beginning of the month. The Bank is in favor of establishing a professional Monetary Policy Council which is unbiased and not subject to conflicts of interest, but the proposed law does not guarantee this. Furthermore, the proposal will bring inflation back, undermine financial stability, constitute a retreatfrom the government's commitment to foreign-currency liberalization, and prevent the central bank from acting independently to attain price stability. In this context, the Bank of Israel explains, adopting the law in its present form will have a deleterious effect on Israel's country rating in the long run, causing it to be classified among those countries whose economic future is questionable and from which it is advisable to remain as far awayas possible.

Poland,2002-05-29,"Information on the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council on May 28-29, 2002 The Monetary Policy Council held its meeting on May 28-29, 2002. The Council was submitted the materials prepared by the Management Board and departments of the NBP as well as information and analytical materials prepared by the Ministry of Finance, banks and research institutes. On this basis the Council discussed the external conditions of the Polish economy, the situation in the real sector of the economy and tendencies in the area of wages and social benefits, in public finance sector, money supply, lending and interest rates and the formation of prices and inflation expectations. *** In reply to the Government proposals, the Monetary Policy Council discussed the principles of the exchange rate system performance in Poland. The Council declared itself for maintaining the exchange rate system without changes. *** I External conditions. Since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Council the economic growth forecasts worldwide have not changed. External conditions should be favorable for the economic boom in Poland. The symptoms of a boom in the American economy are already visible. The probability of the sustained improvement of the economic situation is enhanced by the data on the increase of orders for durable goods and a better outlook for companies´ earnings in April. As a month before, the economic growth in the United States is assessed at 2.2% in 2002 and 3.5% in 2003. A boom in the economy of the euro zone will be weaker and slower than in the United States. The economic growth in the euro zone is assessed at 1.2% this year and 2.9% in 2003, and in Germany 0.9% and 2.8%, respectively. II. Production, economic growth. A general evaluation of the outlook for the economic activity increase has not changed since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Council. A lot of information indicate a growing probability of the economic boom: ▪ A clear improvement has been noted in case of the earnings of enterprises. In the 1st quarter this year, they generated net profit of PLN 1.7 billion as compared to PLN 15.8 million worth of net loss a year before. The earnings of enterprises can be used for investment financing. ▪ In the 1st quarter this year, the inventories of final goods in enterprises decreased by 6.7% as compared to the same period last year. ▪ After a 5-month drop, the revenues from export in April this year were bigger by 9.4% than a year before what may confirm the opinions on a growing external demand expressed by entrepreneurs in the economic situation survey. The increase has also been noted in case of payments for import by 7.9% what, in turn, would signal the increase of domestic demand. ▪ The growth tendency in retail sales has been maintained. In April this year, retail sales were bigger by 3.1% than a year before and within the period January-April 2002, they were bigger by 5.2% than in the same period in 2001. ▪ Within the period January-April this year, tax revenues were higher by 8.3% than a year before. The indirect tax revenues increased by 9.7% (and in April by 21.2% - what, in part, resulted from the implemented systemic changes, especially excise on electric energy), and the income tax revenues from legal persons rose by 14.1%. ▪ In April this year, the drop scale of construction and assembling production clearly decreased. After removing seasonal factors, it was lower by 4.8% than a year before as compared to the drop by 13.8% in February and by 13.5% in March this year. ▪ In May this year, the results of the economic situation survey were subject to a further improvement. A general evaluation of the economic situation in industrial processing is close to the one expressed in April and better than a year before (although still negative). The assessments of the current production and forecasts for future demand and production are positive. The atmosphere of the economic situation in construction is evaluated positively, better than in April, and in retail sales less pessimistic than a month ago. At the same time, the data on the sold industrial output indicate that the economy in this sector has not turned to the boom phase yet. In April this year - when the work time was longer by one business day - the industrial production was higher by 0.2% than a year before. After eliminating seasonal factors, a drop of production by 0.9% has been noted. The stabilization of the sold industrial output trend that has been observed for 13 months is maintained. Moreover, a drop of wage dynamics - although favorable for future inflation - can contribute to the reduction of the growth pace of consumer demand. III. Wages, social benefits. 1. As compared to the situation observed a month ago, the annualized growth pace of wages in enterprises decreased what may signal a drop of wage pressure in the economy. In April this year, average gross wages in the enterprise sector were higher by 2.3% than a year before and, in real terms, a drop of 0.6% was noted. Within the period January-April 2002, average wages in enterprises were higher by 4.5% than in the same period last year, and in real terms this increase amounted to 1.2%. 2. The average employment in the enterprise sector decreased in April by 0.3% as compared to March and it was lower by 4.8% than in April 2001. In April this year, a seasonal drop of the number of the registered unemployed was noted. The unemployment rate dropped from 18.1% to 17.8%. IV. Situation in public finance sector. Since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Council, there was no information that would induce to the change of the evaluation of the public finance situation both this and next year. The data on the state budget accomplishment indicate that there are no visible bigger threats to the accomplishment of the Act on the State Budget for the year 2002. The economic deficit of the public finance sector in 2002, however, will be maintained at a very high level (approximately 5% GDP) what adversely affects the economy. A result of a big deficit and small revenues from privatization is a big supply of Treasury securities that is necessary for financing lending needs of the budget, which results in: ▪ a limitation of possibilities to finance the development of enterprises; ▪ an inflow of foreign portfolio capital that is invested in Government bonds by which it contributes to the appreciation of the exchange rate of the zloty without strengthening at the same time - as opposed to direct foreign investments - the competitiveness of the economy. Moreover, the delay in transferring the due contributions to Open Pension Funds by ZUS (within the period January-April this year, only 24.2% of the plan was accomplished, and ZUS announced additional delays in summer) and the situation of the Labor Fund can lead to the increase of the economic deficit this year. There is maintained uncertainty concerning the public finance, including especially the scale of the deficit in 2003. The basic task in the construction of the budget should be the reduction of expenses so it would be possible to decrease considerably the public finance deficit. V. Money supply, loans, interest rates. As compared to the situation a month before, the evaluation of monetary factors´ impact on future inflation has not been subject to explicit changes. In April this year, a further drop of the annualized money supply dynamics was noted. The growth pace of money supply (aggregate M3) lowered from 3.5% in March to 3.4%. The dynamics of the aggregate M2 dropped from 8.4% to 7.8%. In April this year, the PLN-denominated deposits of households decreased by PLN 0.8 billion. The annualized dynamics of deposits placed by households dropped from 3.2% a month before to 2.2%. The reasons for this phenomenon are the decreasing growth pace of the people´s income and a lowering profitability of placing funds in the banking system resulting from the reduction of the interest rates on deposits and the introduction of taxation of bank interest income. The amount of cash in circulation increased in April this year by PLN 1.2 billion as compared to March, and the annualized dynamics rose from 15.6% to 16%. There is maintained uncertainty concerning the inflation reasons and results of a high dynamics of cash. The annualized dynamics of lending to households, after a significant increase in March this year from 13.9% to 17.7% lowered in April to 15.5%. The growth pace of lending to businesses remains negative the second month in a row. In April this year, the drop on the 12-month scale amounted to 1.3%. The data on lending are probably distorted by banks´´ errors in loan classification connected with the introduced change of the methodology and they do not fully reflect the economic phenomena. VI. Prices, inflation expectations. 1. A monthly increase of consumer goods and services prices in April this year was lower than a year before (0.5% as compared to 0.8% a year before). It mainly resulted from a three times lower growth pace of prices for foodstuffs and non-alcoholic beverages (0.5% as compared to 1.5% a year before). A big increase was noted in case of fuel prices (by 3.1% as compared to no changes a year before). An annualized consumer price index lowered in April this year from 3.3% to 3.0%. Its further, deep drop is forecasted to take place in May. It is possible to expect that in the further part of the year a gradual increase of inflation will take place to the level close to the lower limit of the range of the inflation target for 2002. The sold industrial output prices in April this year were higher by 0.4% than a year before. 2. All core inflation measures lowered: o 15%-cut average from 2.9% to 2.6%; o inflation excluding the most variable prices from 2.6% to 2.5%; o inflation excluding the most variable and fuel prices from 2.9% to 2.7%; o inflation excluding the controlled prices from 3.0% to 2.6%; o ""net"" inflation (excluding foodstuff and fuel prices) from 4.1% to 4.0%. 3. Since the previous meeting of the Council, the forecasts for oil prices have not changed. It is forecasted that in the 2nd quarter this year an average oil price will amount to USD 25 per barrel, and during the whole year 2002 - USD 23. As compared to the situation a month before, a smaller increase of foodstuff prices is forecasted now. 4. Since the last meeting of the Council, the individuals´ expectations about the future inflation improved considerably. A significant drop was noted in case of the percentage of the most pessimistic individuals who expect the price growth to be faster than at present. A group of individuals forecasting that the prices will grow at the same pace as so far has also decreased. The increase has been noted in case of the percentages of individuals who are the most optimistic expecting the following: a drop of the price growth pace, that the prices in a year´s time will be the same as now and that the prices will be lower than at present. In May this year, the inflation rate expected by bank analysts lowered. The inflation expected by them at the end of December this year should be at the level 4.1% (drop by 0.3 percentage point as compared to April), and, in April 2003, they expect inflation at the level 4.2% (less by 0.2 percentage point than a month before). VII. Decision of the Monetary Policy Council. 1. As compared to the situation observed a month before, the following signals indicating the enhancement of factors that are favorable for low inflation appeared: o A clear improvement of inflation expectations of individuals took place and the inflation forecasted by bank analysts lowered; o According to the forecasts, the consumer price index lowered; o All core inflation measures decreased, and the annualized dynamics of the sold industrial output prices is maintained at a low level; o The dynamics of wages decreased what may signal a drop of wage pressure in the economy; o Forecasts of foodstuff prices growth lowered. 2. A general evaluation of the economic activity growth outlook has not changed since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Council. A lot of information indicate a growing probability of the economic boom: o A clear improvement of earnings of enterprises; o A drop of inventories; o Maintaining of forecasts indicating that the external conditions should be favorable for the economic boom in Poland; o An improvement of the dynamics of export and import payments in April this year; o Maintaining of the growth tendency of retail sales; o Higher than a year before tax revenues of the budget, especially from indirect taxes and income taxes from legal persons; o A clear decrease of the drop scale in construction; o A further improvement of the results of the economic situation research. At the same time, the data on the sold industrial output indicate that the economy in this sector has not turned to the boom phase yet. Moreover, the drop of wage dynamics - although favorable for future inflation - can contribute to the reduction of the growth pace of consumer demand. 3. The prudence in monetary policy is prompted by: o Uncertainty concerning the scale of the economic deficit of public finance sector in 2002 and 2003; o Uncertainty concerning the oil prices; o A drop of the dynamics of deposits placed by households; o Maintaining of a high dynamics of cash and the monetary aggregate M1. It should be also remembered that full results of interest rate cuts by 9.5 percentage points in total made since February 2001 have not been revealed yet. 4. Considering these arguments, the Monetary Policy Council decided to: o Cut the minimum yield on 28-day open market operations from 9.5% to 9%; o Cut the rediscount rate from 11% to 10.5%; o Cut the lombard rate from 12.5% to 12%; o Cut the deposit rate from 6.5% to 6%; o Maintain its neutral position in monetary policy. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Council will be held on June 25-26."
Thailand,2002-06-03,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 3 June 2002 Mr. Bandid Nijathaworn. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand announced that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments, both domestically and abroad, in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance. The MPC observed that economic activity had strengthened since the last meeting, as reflected in further improvements in indicators on both the production and consumption sides, as well as investment. However despite stronger exports in April, uncertainty regarding the momentum of the US recovery and depressed export prices continue to pose downside risks to the export outlook. The external financial position remained strong with continued reductions in foreign debt and a high level of international reserves. At the same time, both headline and core inflation remained low. With inflation well contained, the MPC assessed that monetary policy needs to remain supportive of Thai economic growth, and that previous reductions in the policy rates have been sufficient in signalling the stance of monetary policy to the market. Adjustments in market interest rates have been in line with the direction of policy and have reflected liquidity conditions of each individual bank. The MPC, therefore, decided to maintain the 14-day repurchase rate at 2 percent per annum. Bank of Thailand 3 June 2002."
South Korea,2002-06-05,"The real economy is showing strong signs of upswing. The recovery of both exports and facilities investment has become more visible, while both consumption and construction investment have continued buoyant. Consumer prices rose 3., 0 percent on a year-on-year basis in May. This was higher than the 2., 5 percent of previous month, mainly due to irregular factors including supply shortage of agricultural products. Core inflation remained at 3., 0 percent on a year-on-year basis in May(month-on-month increase rate was 0., 3 percent), which was the same as the previous month. Demand-side inflationary pressures are expected to build up gradually in accordance with the continued economic recovery in the near future. Cost-push pressures, however, are anticipated to be lower thanks to recent developments including the marked appreciation of the Korean won against the U S., dollar and stable movements of international oil prices. In addition, there still remain uncertainties over the outlook for the pace of the U S., economic recovery and international semiconductor prices, both of which could affect exports. Taking the current economic situations into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain its benchmark overnight call rate at around its current level in June."
Philippines,2002-06-05,"In its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the BSP's policy rates at 7.0 percent for the overnight borrowing rate and 9.25 percent for the overnight lending rate. The Monetary Board's decision to stay its hand was based on the assessment of a comprehensive set of economic information on the inflation outlook and the economy's growth prospects. Expectations of good agricultural output, continued broad stability in the exchange rate combined with relatively soft though resilient domestic demand and the continued presence of spare capacity all point to a generally favorable inflation outlook for the rest of 2002. At the same time, the Monetary Board noted some headwinds in price movements such as the uncertainty over the impact of the El Niño weather phenomenon on agricultural production in 2003, uptrend in world oil prices as well as possible adjustments in utility and transport charges. These could pose downside risks to future inflation and inflationary expectations. Such considerations argue for caution in monetary policy and for allowing past monetary easing measures to flow through the economy. Moreover, recognizing the lags in monetary policy, the Monetary Board noted that it would like to have a firmer indication of how its recent policy moves all play out. In this regard, the BSP will continue to monitor carefully evidence of the sustainability of the growth process while seeing to it that inflationary pressures are not stoked up."
Euroarea,2002-06-06,"Ladies and gentlemen. Mr. Papademos, the new Vice-President of the ECB, and I will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. The Governing Council undertook a comprehensive examination of monetary, financial and economic developments and considered the evidence that has become available since its last meeting on 2 May 2002. Notwithstanding the recent decline in inflation, the outlook for price stability in the medium term remains less satisfactory than expected a few months ago. However, the economic outlook is still subject to uncertainty. Further evidence is needed before we can fully assess the upward risks to price stability over the medium term. Against this background, the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Starting with the analysis under the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 decreased to 7.4% in the period from February to April 2002, down from 7.6% in the period from January to March 2002. While the high annual growth rate of M3 still partly reflects the portfolio shifts to liquid positions which occurred last autumn, and there was some normalisation in the development of M3 in early 2002, this trend towards moderation has recently been interrupted. In addition, annual rates of growth of loans to the private sector have stabilised over recent months. As regards the second pillar, our expectations for a gradual recovery in real GDP growth in the euro area have been confirmed by Eurostat's recently published first estimates for real GDP growth. These preliminary estimates show an improvement of quarter-on-quarter growth rates from -0.3% in the last quarter of 2001 to moderately positive rates in the first quarter of this year. Moreover, business and consumer confidence has strengthened again more recently, as reflected in the data published by the Commission. Looking ahead, available forecasts all point to a continued strengthening in both domestic and foreign demand, relating to a more favourable external environment, sound domestic fundamentals and the absence of major imbalances within the euro area. Overall, they suggest that real GDP growth in the euro area should again be in line with potential growth later this year, with a further increase expected in 2003. Despite this rather positive outlook, the assessment of the short-term dynamics of real activity is still surrounded by uncertainty. Moreover, future oil price developments and economic imbalances elsewhere in the world economy remain elements of risk. Turning to price developments. Eurostat's early estimate indicates that annual HICP inflation fell from 2.4% in April to 2.0% in May. However, this decline is mainly due to a base effect relating to the spike in HICP inflation in May 2001. Moreover, in the first months of this year HICP inflation excluding the more volatile items of energy and unprocessed food prices has remained stubbornly high, reflecting in particular trends in services prices. While a further decline in the annual inflation rate is possible in the short run, the medium-term outlook remains less satisfactory than expected a few months ago. Over recent weeks the exchange rate of the euro has appreciated. This will contribute to containing inflationary pressures, but it is still too early to assess the impact of exchange rate developments on the outlook for prices. As stated on a number of occasions, the less satisfactory picture in the short term is due partly to a sequence of adverse but rather specific shocks to prices, including recent oil price increases. In principle, such shocks should unwind over time and therefore not affect the medium-term perspectives for price stability as long as past upward tendencies in prices do not become entrenched. The outcome of recent wage negotiations in some regions of the euro area is a cause for concern, especially in view of the negative impact this could have on continued employment creation. High wage increases must not spread across the euro area given that inflationary pressure, which would have unfavourable consequences for competitiveness, employment growth and consumption, is to be avoided. At this juncture it is therefore particularly important for monetary policy to remain vigilant with regard to the further evolution of the key factors determining the outlook for prices. Regarding fiscal policies in the euro area, it is vital that all Member States maintain a medium-term perspective in compliance with the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact. Maintaining such a perspective will lead to a successful transition to budgetary positions close to balance or in surplus and to a smooth functioning of automatic stabilisers in all member countries. Let me therefore reiterate that the Member States concerned must honour the commitments made to achieve balanced budgets by 2003-4. Moreover, governments are encouraged to push ahead with reforms relating to the size and structure of public expenditure and revenue, which will also create room for further tax cuts and absorb the fiscal costs of population ageing. This reform agenda, as well as the urgent structural reforms relating to product, labour and financial markets, will be addressed in the forthcoming Broad Economic Policy Guidelines. Overall, such reforms reflect the key challenge for the euro area to expand its potential for non-inflationary growth and to reduce its high level of unemployment. The Governing Council calls upon Member States to make faster progress in accelerating and deepening structural reforms in order to provide economic agents with the proper incentives to enhance efficiency and entrepreneurship and to progress towards a knowledge-based economy as proclaimed in the Lisbon agenda and confirmed in Barcelona."
Peru,2002-06-06,"BANCO CENTRAL DE RESERVA DEL PERU Press release MONETARY PROGRAM APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF THE BANK FOR JUNE 2002 In May, the daily average balance of the banks' current account was 196 million, below the range announced for that month (205 million to 215 million). This figure was explained by the lower demand of bank's reserve funds due to the privatization of public companies in a higher amount. The average interbank interest rate was 2,5 percent in May, similar to the previous month. The Board of the Bank assessed the June monetary policy and established the following: The targeted range for the banks' current account balance held at the Central Bank on a daily average basis will be maintained at 195 million to 205 million. For monetary regulation credits and temporary purchase of CDBCRP and Treadury bonds out of auctions, the effective interest rate remains as the weighted average of the interbank interest rates, or 3,0 percent, whichever is highest. For overnight deposits in domestic currency held by banks at the Central Bank, the effective interest rate remained at 1,9 percent. For foreign exchange temporary purchase operations (swap operations), the commission which implies an effective annual cost of 3,0 percent is maintained. The following interest rates will be used in foreign-currency operations: The effective annual rate for monetary regulation credits will be 2,75 percent. For overnight deposits held by banks at the Central Bank, the rate is equivalent to the average obtained by the Central Bank for similar deposits abroad. The previous framework is consistent with the current annual inflation forecast and that it finish above the lower inflation range. If justified by financial conditions, the values mentioned above could be modified in order to ensure the attainment of the objective to preserve monetary stability, which mean avoiding inflationary or deflationary pressures."
Israel,2002-06-09,"Update of the Bank of Israel's Monetary Program for June 2002. The Bank of Israel today announced an update of its monetary program for June 2002, according to which its interest rate will be raised by 1.5 percent to 7.1 percent. The change will go into effect on Tuesday, 11 June 2002. Thus, the overall interest-rate hike in June amounts to 2.5 percent. The Bank of Israel explains that in the last few months there has been a rise in inflation expectations for a year ahead, and for some time now this has deviated from the upper limit of the price stability target, which is 3 percent, and has even recently reached 5 percent. The 2002 inflation rate is assessed at twice the upper limit of the price stability target, and even expectations for a year ahead indicate no convergence to the sphere of price stability. The Bank of Israel adds that the purpose of the decision to raise the interest rate is to help restore inflation to the region of price stability and reinforce financial stability. The decision to raise the interest rate outside the usual timetable was reached as a result of the accumulation of indications attesting to a departure from the framework of price stability, among them the rise in inflation expectations for the next few years as derived from the capital market and predicted by private forecasters, the rapid and ongoing local-currency depreciation, and the increase in uncertainty as a result of the deterioration in thesecurity situation, as well as rising long-term interest rates, which attest to the relaxation of fiscal restraint. The Bank of Israel points out that the amendment to the 2002 budget which was passed by the Knesset a few days ago is based on a deficit target of 4 percent of GDP-the third upwards adjustment of the target this year. Using accepted international definitions, this target is equivalent to 7 percent of GDP: which gives rise to concern by any standard. The Bank of Israel notes that while the rise in the short-term interest rate could to some extent lead to a higher real interest rate, its current level is far lower than the one that has prevailed in recent years and, together with the real depreciation that has emerged (which will be maintained only if the inflation rate is prevented from accelerating), supports growth and employment. The Bank of Israel explains that the attainment of stability in itself serves to moderate the emerging trend of deepening recession, thereby buttressing the economic robustness which is so vital at a time of uncertainty. The Bank of Israel reiterates its intention of continuing to do all that is necessary to restore the economy toan environment of price and financial stability. In this context, the Bankstresses several factors which must be taken into consideration when addressing economic stability, namely, the failure to return to a fiscal policy of declining budget deficits and the reduction of the government debt, the proliferation of security events, and the proposed amendment to the Bank ofIsrael Law, as brought before the Knesset, which annuls the Bank'sability to act independently and in a determined manner to maintain price stability. .06.02 Update of the Bank of Israel's Monetary Program for June 2002 The Bank of Israel today announced an update of its monetary program for June 2002, according to which its interest rate will be raised by 1.5 percent to 7.1 percent."
Chile,2002-06-13,"Santiago. June 13, 2002 Press Release At its monthly monetary policy meeting held today, the Board of the Central Bank decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at an annual 4% and leave liquidity credit lines unchanged at the levels prevailing since the previous meeting. The regional situation has turned more uncertain and this is reflected in some countries' currencies and sovereign risk premiums. However, the better outlook for the world economy continues and there is a gradual improvement of terms of trade. The latest figures on domestic economic activity are in general coherent with the scenario presented in May's Monetary Policy Report. Inflationary pressures continue low, with slight ups and downs during the coming months but underlying inflation reamining well centered within the target range. The Central Bank reiterates its commitment to a flexible use of monetary policy to avoid deviations from the inflationary target."
South Africa,2002-06-13,"Inflationary pressures increased sharply in the first few months of 2002 largely as a result of the depreciation in the external value of the rand in the last half of 2001 and rising expectations of price increases. The change in price expectations was clearly reflected in a considerable increase in households' purchases of durable consumer goods in the last quarter of 2001. As the depreciated rand impacted on prices, the year-on-year increase in consumer prices excluding the interest cost on mortgage bonds (CPIX) rose from 5,8 per cent in September 2001 to 8,8 per cent in April 2002. The quarter-to-quarter rate of increase in CPIX inflation was even more pronounced, rising from a seasonally adjusted and annualised level of 6,8 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2001 to 11,6 per cent in the first quarter of 2002. Apart from the weaker currency, food price increases were at first the main factor contributing to the acceleration in inflation. These food price increases were partly related to the depreciated value of the rand because domestic prices are charged at levels approximating those determined internationally. Shortages of certain types of food produced in the Southern African region also brought about higher food prices. Later the increases in consumer prices became more broadly based. The CPIX inflation excluding food prices rose from a year-on-year rate of 5,3 per cent in December 2001 to 6,9 per cent in April 2002. Moreover, the quarter-to-quarter seasonally adjusted and annualised inflation rate of non-food products increased from 3,9 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2001 to 9,0 per cent in the first quarter of 2002. Higher international oil prices expressed in dollars and rand were a further important element in the acceleration in inflation. The average monthly price per barrel of Brent crude oil rose from US$18,60 in December 2001 to US$25,38 in May 2002, while the rand price per barrel increased from R217,40 to R257,83 over the same period. All these factors also had a hand in an acceleration in production price inflation. The quarter-to-quarter and annualised rate of increase in the all-goods production price index rose strongly from 11,3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2001 to 27,3 per cent in the first quarter of 2002. When measured over periods of twelve months, production price inflation accelerated from 8,2 per cent in November 2001 to 14,8 per cent in April 2002. Consumer and production price inflation both accelerated during the first four months of 2002, and the risks of slightly exceeding the inflation target in 2003 are still rather high. Moreover, a number of recent developments could impact on the inflation outlook in the period ahead. The nominal effective exchange rate of the rand rose by nearly 15 per cent from the end of 2001 to 13 June 2002. The rand therefore recouped a significant part of the decline in its weighted value of just more than 34 per cent during 2001. This appreciation in the external value of the rand has already brought about and may in future result in actual price reductions of products such as fuel, or food where import or export parity pricing methods are applied. In addition, the stronger rand may also dampen price increases in other products. However, it is important to take account of the fact that the weighted exchange rate of the rand is still 19 per cent below its level at the beginning of 2001. The current account of the balance of payments, seasonally adjusted and annualised, changed from a deficit of R2,7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2001 to a surplus of R4,2 billion in the first quarter of 2002. A steep decline in dividend payments to non-residents was primarily responsible for this change. The surplus trade balance in the first quarter of 2002 remained virtually unchanged from its level in the preceding quarter. In addition, a substantial surplus was recorded on the financial account of the balance of payments. The conversion of a reserve-related loan of US$1,5 billion of the Reserve Bank into a liability of the National Treasury was largely responsible for this favourable outcome in the financial account. A reversal of the leads and lags in payments and receipts arising from foreign trade, was also responsible for the net inflow of capital. This is substantiated by a reduction in the average remittance period of exporters' proceeds from customer foreign currency accounts at authorised dealers from 116 days in the last two months of 2001 to 79 days in April 2002. The balance of payments outlook at present seems promising. The depreciated external value of the rand, the increase in gold and other international commodity prices and a recovery in the world economy should lead to higher export values and prevent excess demand conditions from recurring during 2002. A more positive sentiment by non-residents indicates a greater willingness to invest in South Africa. These developments could support the external value of the rand and dampen price increases, provided that they are not disrupted by international political and economic events or other exogeneous shocks. There is considerable surplus production capacity in the South African economy. This is confirmed by the index of the utilisation of production capacity which amounted to 80,6 per cent in the first quarter of 2002. In addition, economic growth at just more than 2 per cent is clearly below the potential growth rate of the economy. At present there seems to be little danger that supply constraints could arise in the economy. The government applies continued fiscal discipline which has led to an exceptionally low fiscal deficit before borrowing and net repayments on domestic debt. The medium-term projections of the government indicate that this fiscal discipline will be maintained in the coming years. Slowdown in but still high rate of increase in monetary expansion. The month-to-month rate of increase in both the broadly defined money supply and total bank credit extension slowed down considerably during 2002. In fact, bank credit extension declined somewhat in absolute terms from the high level that it had reached in January 2002. Towards the end of 2001 and the beginning of the current year the credit extended by banks was affected by the pre-emptive buying of durable consumer goods in anticipation of price increases. Despite the recent slower pace of growth in monetary expansion, the level of growth in both money supply and bank credit extension is still too high. Measured over a period of twelve months, the money supply increased by 17,5 per cent and total bank credit extension by 10,7 per cent in April 2002. The year-on-year rate of increase in nominal unit labour cost picked up from 2,7 per cent in the second quarter of 2001 to 6,8 per cent in the fourth quarter (latest available information). This is a concerning development because there is a close relationship between consumer price inflation and changes in unit labour cost. Moreover, the recently announced increases in salaries and wages in the private and public sector do not bode well for inflation if they are not neutralised to some extent by a rise in productivity. According to a survey undertaken by the Bureau for Economic Research of the University of Stellenbosch, the inflation expectations of the business sector, financial analysts, the trade union movement and households continued to increase in the second quarter of 2002. Higher inflation expectations were also reflected in a continued decline in the real yield on government's inflation-linked R189 bond from a monthly average of 5,1 per cent in November 2001 to 4,1 per cent in May 2002. At present there are still considerable risks that may prevent the attainment of the inflation target for 2003. The risks that the Reserve Bank cannot disregard are in particular the high salary and wage increases, developments in the oil price and the exchange rate of the rand, the continued high level of growth in money supply and bank credit extension, high inflation expectations and the uncertainties about political and economic developments in some parts of the world. Econometric projections based on a number of different scenarios also show that the average inflation rate in CPIX in the year 2003 will be close to the upper level of the inflation target. In view of these risks, the Monetary Policy Committee has decided to increase the repurchase rate of the South African Reserve Bank by a further 100 basis points to 12,5 per cent with effect from 14 June 2002."
Israel,2002-06-24,"The Bank of Israel's Monetary Program for July 2002. The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for July 2002, according to which its interest rate will be raised by 2 percentage points to 9.1 percent. Together with the two rises in the interest rate in June, the cumulative rise in this period amounts to 4.5 percentage points. The Bank of Israel explains that the rise in the short-term interest rate is intended to bring inflation back down into the range of price stability. This step istaken against the background of the indications that financial stability is being undermined due to increased uncertainty in the financial markets caused by the ongoing looseness of budgetary discipline and by the security situation, expressed in the marked rise in long-term interest which recentlyresulted in a rise in short-term interest rates too. The interest-rate hike was made necessary because, due to the rise in actual inflation since the beginning of the year and the depreciation of the NIS, inflation expectations for the next few years: as derived from the capital market, private forecasters, and the Bank of Israel's models: have alsorisen beyond the 3 percent rate which constitutes the upper limit of the range defined as price stability. Despite the two increases in the Bank of Israel's interest rate in June, inflation expectations for one year ahead have risen recently and reached 5 percent. The Bank of Israel explains that to restore price stability and to stabilize the financial markets, the government must take immediate and determined steps to correct its fiscal policy so that it reverts to a downward sloping deficit path, while at the same time reducing the government debt. The exceptional rise in the interest on government bonds in the last few weeks (which brought the rate to more than 11 percent on Shahar nine-year bonds), reflects the markets' scepticism regarding the extent of the government's resolve to deal with the budget deficit at a fundamental level. It is therefore vital to change direction and institute the necessary changes in the budget immediately. Government success in passing the 'market test' will enable the economy to revert to a path of stability, which is essential for a return to growth and increased employment. The Bank notes that the amendment to the budget for 2002 which was approved by the Knesset at the beginning of the month accepts a deficit target of 4 percent of GDP, the third upward revision to the target in the past year. In terms of the accepted international definition of the deficit this is equivalent to 7 percent of GDP, a truly worrying figure by any standard. To prevent a repetition of the persistent deviations in the deficit which occurred in the last year and a half, the budgets for 2002 and 2003 must be reduced substantially, the composition of expenditure altered so that it supports growth, and the appropriate changes made to procedures which will enable the constant monitoring of the deficit and thus its achievement. The Bank of Israel points out that although raising the short-term interest rate may indeed bring about a certain increase in real interest, the current level of real interest is lower than that which prevailed during the last few years. The Bank expects that a return to price stability will provide a firm basis for the real depreciation that has occurred, so that this step will encourage growth and employment. Achieving stability will per se help to modify the indicated trends that the recession is deepening further, and improve Israel's economic robustness which is of such importance at times of uncertainty. In this regard the Bank notes that as a result of the cumulative increase of 4.5 percentage points in the interest rate in the last month, the differential between the Bank's rate of interest and the dollar interest rate has widened from 2.85 percentage points to 7.35 percentage points. As is known, in the current situation short-term capital flows are affected by the interest-rate differential, and they in turn, together with other factors, affect the exchange rate. The Bank expects these measures to contribute to a lowering of the degree of uncertainty in the foreign currency market which is reflected in the rise in the price of exchange-rate options issued by the Bank and in a rise in the volatility of the exchange rate. The Bank of Israel also advises that it will continue to act as necessary to bring the economy back into an environment of price stability and financial stability. In this context the Bank observes that other factors that should be considered when relating to economic stability include the need for fiscal policy to revert to a downward budget deficit path and a downward trend of government debt in the light of the further deterioration in the security situation, and the proposed amendment to the Bank of Israel Law brought before the Knesset which would limit the Bank's ability to act in an independent anddetermined manner to maintain price stability.

Poland,2002-06-26,"Information on the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council on June 25- 26, 2002 The Monetary Policy Council held its meeting on June 25-26, 2002. The Council was submitted the materials prepared by the Management Board and departments of the NBP as well as information and analytical materials prepared by the Ministry of Finance, banks and research institutes. On this basis the Council discussed the external conditions of the Polish economy, the situation in the real sector of the economy and tendencies in the area of wages and social benefits, in public finance sector, money supply, lending and interest rates and the formation of prices and inflation expectations. The Monetary Policy Council decided to set the inflation target for the year 2003 at the level 3% (with tolerance at +/- 1 percentage point). It is the specification of the medium-term monetary policy target set in September 1998: lowering inflation to the level below 4% in 2003. It is also the level that is coherent with the inflation index accepted by the Government in Guidelines of the state budget draft for the year 2003. 2. Moreover, the Monetary Policy Council informs that in the second half of this year the guidelines of the medium-term strategy of the monetary policy will be published within the framework of which the next medium- term inflation target will be defined. The Monetary Policy Council assumes that the basis for these guidelines will be the strategy of Poland´s accession of the Economic and Monetary Union prepared in consultation with the Government. 3. The conditions for the accomplishment of the inflation target in 2002 appeared to be considerably more favorable for the inflation reduction than it was forecasted at the moment of its setting in August 2001. Unexpectedly positive were the supply-driven factors, especially in relation to foodstuff and fuel prices. Smaller than forecasted will be the growth of prices subject to administrative regulation. The domestic demand dynamics has been established at a lower level. 4. Due to the above mentioned, it is possible to expect that inflation - if there is no unexpected and unfavorable supply shocks in the second half of this year - will the most likely be clearly lower than 4% what constitutes the bottom limit of the range of the inflation target announced in August 2001. This will be the case despite the cutting of interest rates of the NBP since August 2001 to May this year by 6.5 percentage points in total. 5. Considering these circumstances and aiming at the primary target of the monetary policy that is the stabilization of inflation on a low level and also considering the need to preserve transparency about the priorities of the carried out monetary policy, the Monetary Policy Council decided to lower the level of the inflation target for the year 2002 to 3% with a permissible fluctuation range +/- 1 percentage point. *** The Monetary Policy Council discussed and approved the Balance of payments of the Republic of Poland for the 1st quarter 2002 and Inflation Report in the 1st quarter 2002 and was submitted The Evaluation of the Economic Situation of Banks in 2001 and The Evaluation of the Impact of Monetary.

Since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Council signals indicating that the external conditions should support a gradual economic boom in Poland have been maintained. The economic growth in the United States is still expected. Visible are the signs of the economic situation improvement in the euro zone economy where the economic growth at the moment is assessed at 1.3% (1.2% a month before). In Germany, similarly to the situation in May this year, this indicator is assessed at 0.9%. II. Production, economic growth. 1. A general evaluation of the economic situation indicates that the growth pace of the economic activity will probably be a little slower than it was indicated by the earlier macroeconomic data. In the 1st quarter this year. Gross Domestic Product increased in real terms by 0.5% as compared to the same period last year and as compared to 0.2% in the 4th quarter 2001. The domestic demand was maintained at the level noted a year before while in the 4th quarter 2001 it dropped by 2.8%. Individual consumption increased by 3.5% as compared to the increase by 3.3% in the 4th quarter last year, and gross investments in fixed assets lowered by 13.3% as compared to the drop by 13.5% in the 4th quarter of the previous year. 2. The economic situation should begin to improve gradually in the 2nd half this year. It may be indicated - besides a favorable impact of external conditions - by: o An improvement of earnings of enterprises in the 1st quarter this year that is favorable for the increase of investment activity. o A higher than forecasted by the NBP increase of income from employment and income at disposal of households in the 1st quarter of this year. The NBP assessment of the nominal growth of income at disposal of households in 2002 has been increased from 3.3% to 4.3%. o In May this year, the economic situation indicator set by the Institute of Economic Development of SGH increased by 3 points. May was the fourth month in a row where the economic situation in processing industry improved. Enterprises expect a further improvement of the economic situation. o In May this year - for the first time since the beginning of the economic situation survey by the Gdansk Institute for Market Economics (January 2001) - the entrepreneurs positively evaluated the economic situation. The entrepreneurs expect a further improvement of economic situation. 3. The information indicating the coming boom is accompanied, however, by the data indicating that its pace will be very moderate within the next couple of months: o The growth pace of retail sales lowered from 3.1% in April to 1.8% in May this year. o Results of the economic situation survey by GUS, in general proving the possibility of the economic situation improvement, indicate the worse than a month before evaluations of the current situation and less optimistic forecasts concerning future demand and production in industry. In construction, a general atmosphere of the conomic situation is evaluated at the level close to the situation observed a month before and a year before. The evaluations of the atmosphere of the economic situation in retail sales maintained at the level noted in May this year and they are better than a year before, however, the forecasts for the next couple of months worsened. o Despite the decrease of final goods inventories in the 1st quarter this year, the entrepreneurs covered by the economic situation survey by GUS still assess that the level of inventories in industry is excessive and in retail sales - sufficient. o A recessive trend of industrial production has been maintained. In May this year, the industrial output was by 4.1% lower, and after eliminating seasonal factors (one business day less than in May 2001) by approximately 2% lower than a year before. o In May this year, the drop of construction output as compared to the same month of 2001 was bigger than in April (9.4% as compared to 6.2%), but the trend indicators confirm the observed a month before tendency to slow down the drop of construction and assembling production. III. Wages, social benefits. The latest data confirm a moderate although stable increase of income of households. As compared to the situation a month before, the assessment of a nominal growth of income at disposal of households in 2002 has been increased from 3.3% to 4.3%. A moderate level of nominal growth of average wages in enterprises has been maintained. Within the period January-May 2002, this growth in real terms amounted to 1.6% and was higher than a year before. A low level of economic activity does not enable forecasting of an essential acceleration of wage growth in the next couple of months. The drop pace of employment in enterprises insignificantly decreased. The average employment was lower by 0.2% as compared to April and by 4.6% than a year before. The unemployment rate dropped from 17.8% to 17.2%. In the 1st quarter this year, the drop of employment in the national economy was smaller than in the enterprise sector and a nominal growth of average wages was faster. Very high was also the growth of unemployment benefits and pre-retirement benefits. IV. Situation in public finance sector. 1. The data on the state budget accomplishment indicate that there are no visible bigger threats to the accomplishment of the Act on the State Budget for the year 2002. However, there is a threat that the economic deficit will be higher due to the situation of earmarked funds: low revenues from social insurance contributions, delays in transferring due contributions to Open Pension Funds, growing expenses of the Labor Fund and a possibility to borrow by the Wage Guarantee Fund. 2. In the situation of a high economic deficit, especially dangerous is the decreasing transparency of public finance due to the increase of public expenses that, according to the currently applied by the Government principles of calculating revenues and expenses of the public sector, are not reflected in the earnings of this sector. For example, the Agency for Agricultural Market that has already borrowed approximately PLN 1.5 billion intends to finance the additional intervention on the market using the resources coming from loans the repayment of which is guaranteed by the State Treasury. Such kind of debt increase should be treated as a form of increasing the deficit of the public finance sector. 3. The economic deficit of the public finance sector will be maintained in 2002 on a very high level (approximately 5% GDP), adversely affecting the economic growth perspectives. A big supply of treasury securities that is necessary to finance the borrowing needs of the budget, limits the possibilities to finance the development of enterprises and it may result in the appreciation of the exchange rate of the zloty without strengthening at the same time - as opposed to direct foreign investments - the competitiveness of the economy. 4. The Ministry of Finance presented Guidelines of the state budget draft for the year 2003 according to which the economic deficit of the public finance sector would amount to PLN 38.8 billion, i.e. 4.9% GDP, and the budget deficit is to remain at the high level of 2002. In the situation of a forecasted acceleration of the economic growth, it means a further loosening of fiscal policy. Therefore, there will be maintained the above mentioned negative impact of public finance on the economic development and, at the same time, the playing field of the monetary policy will be subject to a radical reduction. V. Money supply, loans, interest rates. As compared to the situation a month before, the evaluation of monetary situation was not subject to fundamental changes. The data still indicate that despite a low dynamics of monetary aggregates there are, in this area, some threats to future inflation: The annualized dynamics of money supply M3 is maintained at a low level, although as compared to April it increased insignificantly from 2.9% to 3.6%. The annualized dynamics of cash in circulation rose from 16.0% a month before to 17.9%. There is maintained uncertainty related to the reasons and possible inflation results of a high dynamics of cash in circulation. The deposits of households rose as compared to April by 0.6% but about 70% of this growth resulted from the depreciation of the exchange rate of the zloty. The annualized dynamics of deposits placed by households lowered from 1.9% to 1.6%. In May this year, for the first time an annualized drop of PLN denominated deposits was noted. The annualized dynamics of lending to households lowered from 16.5% a month before to 15.8%. Loans to businesses, after two months of the annualized drop (-1.8% and -1.9%, respectively), reached the level observed in May 2001. The annualized dynamics of net debt of Government institutions lowered from 14.5% a month before to 9.3%. The earlier cuts of the NBP interest rates have not been fully translated into changes of interest rates in commercial banks yet. In May this year, the average interest rates on loans and deposits at commercial banks dropped: ▪ In case of term PLN-denominated deposits of households by 0.4 percentage point to 6.6%; ▪ In case of PLN-denominated loans to businesses by 0.3 percentage point to 13.4%; ▪ In case of PLN-denominated loans to individuals by 0.2 percentage point to 18.3%. VI. Prices, inflation expectations. Unexpectedly big price drop in May was mainly caused by factors of temporary nature. Inflation at a low level, however, is favorable for the strengthening of low inflation expectations. Therefore, the results obtained in May confirm the earlier assessments indicating a sustained nature of disinflation process that gives a chance to stabilize inflation at a low level: In May this year - according to expectations connected with a non-typical big price growth in May 2001 - the annualized consumer price index lowered. May this year, however, also appeared to be non-typical. Prices for vegetables, instead of a typical for this period increase, lowered considerably. Due to this, inflation dropped by about 0.5 percentage point more than forecasted to the level of 1.9%. All core inflation measures lowered: ▪ 15%-cut average from 2.6% to 2.0%; ▪ inflation excluding the most variable prices from 2.5% to 2.1%; ▪ inflation excluding the most variable and fuel prices from 2.7% to 2.4%; ▪ inflation excluding the controlled prices from 2.6% to 1.7%; ▪ ""net"" inflation (excluding foodstuff and fuel prices) from 4.0% to 3.2%. The drop pace of core inflation measures was slower than the drop pace of consumer price index. In May this year, the majority of core inflation measures (with the exception of inflation excluding the controlled prices) were formed above the consumer price index. The net inflation measure that is at the highest level (by 1.3 percentage point above the consumer price index) illustrates the particularly strong impact of fuels and foodstuffs on the reduction of inflation. The maintained for several months drop of all core inflation measures indicates that the reduction of inflation is not a temporary phenomenon. After a significant improvement a month before, the structure of answers to the questions of a survey of inflation expectations of individuals did not change essentially. In June, the inflation expectations of bank analysts lowered significantly. Now, they forecast that inflation in December this year will amount to 3.3% as compared to 4.1% a month before, and in the 11-month period - 3.6% as compared to 4.2% a month before. The sold industrial output prices were in April this year higher by 0.5% than a year before. Since the last meeting of the Council, the forecasts concerning oil prices have not changed. It is forecasted that in 2002 an average oil price will amount to USD 23. As compared to the situation within previous months, a risk of oil price rise decreased. In conditions of demand stabilization at a low level, the oil supply increased. VII. Decision of the Monetary Policy Council. 1. As compared to the situation observed a month before, the following signals indicating the enhancement of factors that are favorable for low inflation appeared: o After a clear improvement a month before, a favorable for future inflation structure of inflation expectations of individuals was maintained and inflation forecasted by bank analysts lowered; inflation at a low level promotes the enhancement of low inflation expectations; o All core inflation measures dropped and the annualized dynamics of the sold industrial output prices is maintained at a low level; o A risk of oil price growth decreased. 2. The evaluations of the economic activity growth outlook indicate a smaller than a month before probability of a fast growth of domestic demand. It is still assessed that the improvement should begin in the second half this year, however, it will be more perceptible only in the 4th quarter. 3. The reduction of scale of interest rates cut is prompted by: o the outlook of a further loosening of fiscal policy in 2003 what constitutes a fundamental reduction of the playing field of monetary policy; o the drop of the annualized dynamics of deposits of households, and especially the drop of PLN- denominated deposits; o a high and growing dynamics of cash in circulation. It should be also remembered that full results of interest rate cuts by 10 percentage points in total made since February 2001 have not been revealed yet and their forecasts are connected with considerable uncertainty. Moreover, in conditions of lower interest rates their smaller implicit changes mean a similar respective change. 4. Considering these arguments, the Monetary Policy Council decided to: o cut the minimum yield on 28-day open market operations from 9.0% to 8.5%; o cut the rediscount rate from 10.5% to 10.0%; o cut the lombard rate from 12.0% to 11.5%; o cut the deposit rate from 6.0% to 5.5%; o maintain its neutral position in monetary policy. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Council will be held on July 18-19, 2002."
United States,2002-06-26,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate unchanged at 1 3/4 percent. The information that has become available since the last meeting of the Committee confirms that economic activity is continuing to increase. However, both the upward impetus from the swing in inventory investment and the growth in final demand appear to have moderated. The Committee expects the rate of increase of final demand to pick up over coming quarters, supported in part by robust underlying growth in productivity, but the degree of the strengthening remains uncertain. In these circumstances, although the stance of monetary policy is currently accommodative, the Committee believes that, for the foreseeable future, against the background of its long run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are balanced with respect to the prospects for both goals. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan. Chairman; William J McDonough. Vice Chairman; Susan S Bies; Roger W Ferguson. Jr.; Edward M Gramlich; Jerry L Jordan; Robert D McTeer. Jr.; Mark W Olson; Anthony M Santomero, and Gary H Stern. Voting against the action: none."
Philippines,2002-07-03,"In its meeting today, the Monetary Board of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas decided to keep the key policy rates unchanged at 7.0 percent for the overnight borrowing or RRP rate and 9.25 percent for the overnight lending or RP rate. Based on the analysis of data that have become available since the last meeting of the Monetary Board on monetary policy and a careful assessment of the balance of risks on inflation and inflationary expectations. Board members believe that inflation remains well-contained in the near term. This is based on expectations of favorable food supply in 2002, broad stability in the exchange rate, and the presence of spare capacity. In addition, domestic demand, though improving, remains relatively weak. The Monetary Board, however, pointed out that this benign inflation picture is not without risks. In particular, the Board recognizes the risks to inflation and inflationary expectations posed by the uncertainty over the full impact of the El Niño weather phenomenon on agricultural crop production, the ambiguity in the direction of world oil prices as well as the imminent adjustments in power and water rates and their expected second round effects on the prices of other commodities as well as on wages. In line with the forward-looking orientation of monetary policy, the Monetary Board underscored the need for a cautious monetary policy setting. The Monetary Board believes that the presence of downside risks to future inflation and inflationary expectations amid the lack of buoyancy in domestic demand present a case for navigating carefully monetary policy so as to maintain the stimulus for growth while guarding closely against inflationary threats."
Euroarea,2002-07-04,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank met today for the sixth time outside Frankfurt. First of all I would like to thank our host. Governor Mersch, and the staff of the Banque centrale du Luxembourg, for the invitation and for the generous hospitality offered to us. Allow me also to add that the Governing Council today held its 100th meeting since the establishment of the ECB on 1 June 1998. We have not celebrated this event in any specific way, but we are pleased to draw your attention to this fact. Finally, let me, on behalf of the entire Governing Council, pay tribute to Pierre Werner, who passed away a few days ago. He was one of the founding fathers of the single currency and for this we will always be grateful to him. At today's meeting, the Governing Council continued its comprehensive examination of monetary, financial and economic developments and assessed new evidence that has become available over the past few weeks. Our conclusion was that while risks to price stability over the medium term remain tilted to the upside, recent evidence sends mixed signals. Against this background, the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. As regards the analysis under the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 increased to 7.5% in the period from March to May 2002, from 7.4% in the period from February to April. While there was some normalisation of M3 growth in early 2002. M3 dynamics have strengthened again recently. This development may partly reflect renewed portfolio shifts into M3 instruments, related to the recent increase in overall financial market uncertainty. However, more fundamental factors, such as the low opportunity cost of holding money and the economic recovery in the euro area have also driven monetary expansion in recent months. In addition, the rate of growth of loans to the private sector has been recovering. While due caution in interpreting recent short-term monetary developments is warranted, it is a matter of concern that there is significantly more liquidity available in the euro area than would be needed to finance sustainable, non-inflationary economic growth. Concerning the second pillar, the latest data confirm that a gradual recovery in real GDP growth in the euro area is under way. Information from several surveys and leading indicators for the second quarter of this year point to somewhat higher real GDP growth rates than in the first quarter. Looking ahead, an ongoing strengthening in both domestic and foreign demand continues to be the most likely scenario. The conditions for further recovery in the euro area remain in place. There are no major imbalances in the euro area and financing conditions are very favourable. At the same time, there is continued economic growth outside the euro area. However, in view of recent financial market developments, the uncertainty surrounding the strength of the economic upturn  both outside and inside the euro area  has not diminished over recent weeks. Turning to price developments. Eurostat's flash estimate indicates that annual HICP inflation fell from 2.0% in May to 1.7% in June. However, it is too early to interpret this fall as a sign of receding upward pressure on prices, given that HICP inflation excluding the more volatile items of energy and unprocessed food prices has remained high throughout the first half of this year, reflecting in particular trends in services prices. Moreover, it is to be expected that overall HICP inflation rates will fluctuate around 2% in the coming months. The strengthening of the euro exchange rate should have a moderating effect on inflation. However, it is difficult to quantify the size and establish the timing of this effect. For price stability to be maintained on a sustainable basis it is crucial that the high wage increases resulting from recent negotiations in some regions do not spread across the euro area, not least because this would have negative consequences for competitiveness, employment growth and consumption. Overall, the strengthening of the euro exchange rate is a new factor suggesting a potential for lower inflation rates. However, other factors  in particular monetary developments and wage trends  do not indicate a moderation in price pressures. Monetary policy therefore needs to remain vigilant as regards the key factors determining the outlook for price stability over the medium term. Regarding fiscal policies in the euro area, we have seen some worrying developments in the past few months. Against this background we call upon all member countries to honour the commitments made to achieve budgets that are close to balance or in surplus by 2003-04, in compliance with the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact. This is necessary in order to maintain and further strengthen confidence in the policy framework of the euro area and to establish fiscal positions in all countries that allow automatic stabilisers to operate efficiently without endangering sound fiscal positions in the longer term. Moreover, governments are encouraged to push ahead with reforms relating to the size and structure of public expenditure and revenue, which will also create room for tax cuts and absorb the fiscal costs of population ageing. In the field of structural reforms allow me to refer briefly to the adoption of the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines. If implemented in a determined manner, structural reforms will contribute to expanding the euro area's potential for non-inflationary growth and to reducing its high level of unemployment."
South Korea,2002-07-04,"Industrial production kept its high growth rate and facilities investment continued its recovery in May. Business activities are anticipated to continue buoyant along with the recovery of exports and facilities investment, although consumption and construction investment may relatively slow down. Consumer price inflation eased to 2., 6 percent on a year-on-year basis in June from the 3., 0 percent of the previous month, as prices of farm products declined owing to a seasonal increase in shipments. Core inflation registered 2., 9 percent on a year-on-year basis in June, similar to the 3., 0 percent of the previous month. Looking ahead, the strength of the Korean won against the U S., dollar and the expected stability of international oil prices will mitigate inflationary pressures. Demand-side inflationary pressures, however, are expected to accumulate and wages seem likely to increase in line with the continued economic recovery. In the financial markets, stock prices, long-term interest rates and the exchange rate have been falling back simultaneously due largely to the turbulence in U S., and other major financial markets. It is necessary, therefore, to watch carefully how the impact of financial market instability feeds through to the real economy. Taking these into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain its benchmark overnight call rate at around its current level in July."
Chile,2002-07-11,"Santiago. July 11, 2002 Press Release At its monthly monetary policy meeting held today, the Board of the Central Bank decided to lower the monetary policy interest rate by 75 basis points from an annual 4% to 3.25% and to lower the rates on liquidity credit lines by the same amount each. The world economic growth continues as foreseen in previous months although differently in the various geographic regions. Nevertheless, the outlook for growth of Chile's trading partners has been affected by dismal results of some Latin American countries. In addition, there are considerable risks associated with the deterioration of the main stock markets. Financial turbulence in the region is also more significant than in previous months. On the domestic front, figures indicate that second-quarter spending and output were both higher than in the first quarter but still below what had been forecast in May's Monetary Policy Report, particularly with regard to spending. Their performance, together with international developments, suggest that growth rates in the coming quarters will be lower than the Report had indicated. Some of the circumstances described imply contradictory effects on inflation. However, the low level of inflation, the persistence of idle capacity, the failure of exchange depreciation to pass through to prices, all these factors point to inflation converging on the centre of the target range within the usual policy horizon and this is coherent with the measure of lowering the monetary policy rate to give a boost to economic activity. The Central Bank reiterates its commitment to a flexible use of monetary policy to avoid deviations from the inflationary target."
Peru,2002-07-15,"BANCO CENTRAL DE RESERVA DEL PERU Press release MONETARY PROGRAM APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF THE BANK FOR JULY 2002 In June, the daily average balance of the banks' current account was 196 million, below the range announced for that month (205 million to 215 million). This figure was explained by the lower demand of bank's reserve funds due to the privatization of public companies in a higher amount. The average interbank interest rate was 2,5 percent in May, similar to the previous month. The Board of the Bank assessed the June monetary policy and established the following : The targeted range for the banks' current account balance held at the Central Bank on a daily average basis will be maintained at 195 million to 205 million. For monetary regulation credits and temporary purchase of CDBCRP and Treadury bonds out of auctions, the eff ective interest rate remains as the weighted average of the interbank interest rates, or 3,0 percent, whichever is highest. For overnight deposits in domestic currency held by banks at the Central Bank, the effective interest rate remained at 1 ,9 percent. For foreign exchange temporary purchase operations (swap operations), the commission which implies an effective annual cost of 3,0 percent is maintained. The following interest rates will be used in foreign-currency operations: The effective annual rate for monetary regulation credits will be2 ,75 percent. For overnight deposits held by banks at the Central Bank, the rate is equivalent to the average obtained by the Central Bank for similar deposits abroad. The previous framework is consistent with the current annual inflation forecast and that it finish above the lower inflation range. If justified by financial conditions, the values mentioned above could be modified in order to ensure the attainment of the objective to preserve monetary stability, which mean avoiding inflationary or deflationary pressures."
Poland,2002-07-19,"Warsaw. July 19, 2002 INFORMATION ON THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL ON JULY 18-19, 2002 The Monetary Policy Council held its meeting on July 18-19, 2002. The Council was submitted the materials prepared by the Management Board and departments of the NBP as well as information and analytical materials prepared by the Ministry of Finance, banks and research institutes. The Council discussed the external conditions of the Polish economy, the situation in the real sector of the economy and tendencies in the area of wages and social benefits, in public finance sector, money supply, lending and interest rates and the formation of prices and inflation expectations and the inflation outlook. Decision of the Monetary Policy Council The latest economic data enhance a little the signals of the economic boom: Industrial production grew by 2.2%. Higher than expected were budget revenues coming from indirect taxes and CIT. The drop of employment in the enterprise sector has been halted. Higher than a year before were the revenues from export. The importance of factors indicating the need to be prudent in monetary policy has not been decreased. The most important among them are the following: An outlook of a high public finance sector deficit in conditions of the planned economic growth in 2003 constitutes a basic limitation of the playing field for monetary policy; an additional risk factor for the public finance stability are the forecasted write-offs of tax arrears, guarantees and tax allowances; A further drop of the annualized deposit dynamics and the saving tendency of households in conditions of the increased individual consumption; The maintaining of a high dynamics of cash in circulation; A considerable depreciation of the exchange rate of the zloty, especially against the euro, within the recent weeks increases the uncertainty about the exchange rate of the zloty in future; Full results of interest rate cuts by 10.5 percentage points in total made since February 2001 have not been revealed yet. Considering these arguments, the Monetary Policy Council decided not to change the interest rates of the NBP and maintain its neutral position in monetary policy. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Council will be held on August 27-28, 2002. I. Evaluation of the economic situation A general evaluation of the economic situation has not The GDP growth pace in changed since the previous meeting of the Monetary the 1st quarter 2002 was Policy Council. In the 2nd quarter the economy grows at insignificantly the pace of about 0.5% GDP and the unemployment accelerated to about growth has been halted. 0.5% According to the data by GUS, in the 1st quarter 2002 the annualized dynamics of domestic demand was at the level of 0% (as compared to 2.9% in the 4th quarter 2001) and the GDP growth pace in the 1st quarter 2002 was insignificantly accelerated to about 0.5% (0.2% in the 4th quarter 2001). In June, the sold industrial output increased by 2.2%. The In June, the sold drop of production in mining and quarrying was smaller industrial output in June than within the recent months, higher was the increased growth pace of the section production and supply with electric energy, gas and water. For several months the tendencies in particular sections of the processing industry have not been changed. Clear growth tendencies are observed in industries producing mainly consumer goods and, at the same time, with big share of exports (e.g. manufacturing of radio and TV equipment, rubber and plastic goods, metal goods). Drop tendencies are maintained in sections manufacturing consumer goods that cannot face the price competition from cheap imports (clothing, leather) and supply goods (production of metals, coke and oil refining products). After two months when the drop scale of construction output decreased, in June again the output decrease by more than 10% was noted. However, it did not change the tendency, observed in previous months, of a slow halting of a drop trend of construction and assembling production. The dynamics of the sold industrial output and the construction and assembling output within the last three months indicates that the growth dynamics of the gross added value in the economy in the 2nd quarter this year is 2 maintained at the level of about 0.5%. The forecasted acceleration of the economic growth in the euro zone will support the boom in the Polish exports. The improvement of the and then the improvement of the investment climate. economic situation Observed in April and May this year annualized exports worldwide should growth, together with the results of the economic support a gradual situation survey by the Institute of Economic economic boom in Development of SGH made in June indicating the Poland increase of export orders, proves an increasing foreign demand for Polish goods. The latest data confirm that in the enterprise sector there has been noted a moderate wage growth. Within the period January-June this year, the average wages in enterprises were higher by 4.4% than in the same period of 2001. The wage growth in real terms amounted to A moderate wage growth 1.6% and was higher than a year before. June this year is is noted in the enterprise the first month since February 2001 when the average sector employment in the enterprise sector did not decrease as compared to the previous month. The situation on the labor market indicates, however, that a material acceleration of the wage growth should not be forecasted in the next couple of months. II. Situation in public finance sector The data on the state budget accomplishment indicate that The economic deficit of there are no visible bigger threats to the accomplishment the public finance sector of the Act on the State Budget for the year 2002. will be maintained on a However, there is a threat that the economic deficit will very high level in 2002 be higher due to the situation of earmarked funds. The economic deficit of the public finance sector will be maintained on a very high level in 2002 (5% of GDP), adversely affecting the economic growth perspectives. A big supply of treasury securities that is necessary to finance the borrowing needs of the budget limits the possibilities to finance the development of enterprises and constitutes a source of the capital inflow that may result in the appreciation of the exchange rate of the zloty although it does not contribute to the competitiveness improvement of enterprises. There is maintained uncertainty about the public finance There is maintained 3 situation in 2003 and within the next years. The uncertainty about the Government has accepted the Guidelines of the state public finance situation budget draft for the year 2003 according to which the in 2003 and within the budget deficit is to grow to PLN 43 billion. In the next years situation of a forecasted acceleration of the economic growth it would mean a further loosening of fiscal policy that reduces the playing field of the monetary policy. The Monetary Policy Council positively evaluates the statements of the new Minister of Finance that he will tend to reduce the deficit in 2003 and improve the public finances within the next years. A risk factor for the public finance stability is the announced involvement of the state on the microeconomic level (tax arrears write-offs, guarantees for firms, tax allowances) and the increased financing of investments through granting guarantees and warranties. A full evaluation of the Government plans will be possible, however, after they are set forth. III. Money supply, loans, interest rates, exchange rate As compared to the situation a month before, the Despite a low dynamics evaluation of the monetary situation did not change of broad monetary fundamentally, although the depreciation of the domestic aggregates, there are risk currency led to the decrease of the monetary policy factors for future restrictiveness. The monetary data indicate that despite a inflation: an increase of low dynamics of broad monetary aggregates, there are in cash in circulation this area some threats to the future inflation. accompanying the drop of deposits The annualized dynamics of money supply M3 is maintained at a low level, and as compared to May it lowered from 3.6% to 3.0%, however, there is maintained a high growth pace of cash in circulation (17.8% in May and 17.9% in June). The increase of cash in circulation looks especially alarming at the background of the lowering saving tendency of households and the related drop of deposits by households. In June this year, there was noted a drop of total deposits by households as compared to their amount in the previous month, and the annualized growth pace of deposits lowered in June as compared to May from 1.5% to 0.3%. The acceleration of the consumption dynamics connected with the increase of cash and a drop of deposits on bank accounts is an alarming phenomenon proving the decrease of the savings rate of the sector of households what is 4 undoubtedly affected by the drop of attractiveness of bank placements. The annualized dynamics of lending to households lowered from 16.3% a month before to 15.3%. Loans to businesses after 3 months of a drop by 1.8%, 1.9% and 0.3%, respectively, in June this year, were higher by 2% than a year before what, in part, result from the depreciation of the zloty. Within the latest period, the exchange rate of the zloty Within the latest period, depreciated against the euro and dollar. The depreciation the exchange rate of the of the zloty was bigger against the euro what resulted zloty depreciated and the from the appreciation of the exchange rate of the euro that maintaining of this trend on July 15 this year exceeded the level 1:1 against the can increase prices of dollar. The exchange rate at a higher level constitutes a industrial output factor that increases domestic prices of industrial output, e.g. refineries have already raised fuel prices on the domestic market. In June this year, the sold industrial output prices were higher by 0.1% than a month before, and the annualized dynamics increased from 0.5% in May to 1.1%. For the first time since May last year, the output prices in industrial processing were higher (by 0.1%) than in the same month a year before. The growth of the output price dynamics, and especially in industrial processing, can, however, be, in part, a symptom of the demand growth: enterprises, when the production grows, try to “regain” their original profitability. If a further considerable depreciation of the exchange rate of the zloty does not take place, the observed so far depreciation of the exchange rate of the zloty should not threat the accomplishment of the inflation target for this and next years. IV. Prices, inflation expectations In June this year, as a result of a further drop of foodstuff Low inflation in June, prices and the drop of fuel prices, the annualized consistent with the consumer price index lowered from 1.9% to 1.6%. A expectations of the considerably smaller drop has been noted in case of all Monetary Policy core inflation measures. Council, is related to a seasonal drop of 5 Low inflation in June, consistent with the expectations of foodstuff prices the Monetary Policy Council, is related to a seasonal drop of foodstuff prices. Inflation on a low level supports the enhancement of low inflation expectations. In July this year, the structure of Inflation on a low level answers to the questions of the survey on inflation supports the expectations by individuals, in fact, insignificantly enhancement of low deteriorated. However, thanks to a considerable drop of inflation expectations current inflation in May, the measure of inflation expectations of households lowered. Inflation expectations of bank analysts lowered. Now, they forecast that inflation in December this year will amount to 2.8% as compared to 3.3% a month before, and in 11 months  3.4% as compared to 3.6% a month before."
Thailand,2002-07-22,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 22 July 2002 Mr. Bandid Nijathaworn. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand announced that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance. The main issues discussed were as follows: 1. After consideration of the latest data, the MPC was of the view that economic conditions continued to improve, with respect to both production and consumption. In addition, there are signs that the recovery appears to be strengthening, with the rebound in the manufacturing sector becoming more broad based, unemployment edging down, and business profitability improving. External stability has also improved with a strong international reserves position and further reductions in foreign debt. The MPC noted that the recent appreciation of the baht relative to the US dollar reflected both external factors, as well as better economic prospects in the domestic economy, with the exchange rate adjusting primarily to market conditions and moving in line with other regional currencies. In terms of internal stability, both headline and core inflation remained subdued with the latter averaging 09 percent in the first quarter, and 04 percent in the second quarter. The MPC assessed that core inflation in the next 8 quarters should remain low and within the official target of 0-35 percent per annum. The MPC believed that the continuing recovery and improved economic stability observed so far will lay a solid foundation for further growth in the latter half of the year as well as in the following year. However the MPC saw increasing risks on the external front, especially with respect to the uncertainty regarding the economic recovery in the US, volatility in world stock markets, and uncertainties in the global oil market. These factors pose risks to the world economy and may have repercussions on Thai exports. The MPC therefore saw the need to retain a monetary policy stance that is accommodative to economic recovery, and has decided to maintain the 14-day repurchase rate at 2 percent per annum."
Philippines,2002-07-31,"The Monetary Board of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas today decided to keep the key policy rates unchanged at 7.0 percent for the overnight borrowing or RRP rate and 9.25 percent for the overnight lending or RP rate. The BSP's policy rates have been on an even keel since 15 March 2002. Based on the assessment of a comprehensive set of information bearing on the inflation outlook, the Monetary Board believes that inflation will continue to be generally benign in the near term due mainly to positive supply-side factors such as expectations of adequate food supply, recent moderation in oil prices and the broad stability in the exchange rate as well as continued softness in demand conditions, although there are signs of improving economic activity. The Monetary Board, however, pointed out that, while the near-term risks to inflation have diminished, inflationary headwinds could still surface over the policy horizon. These pressures could be in the form of uncertainties concerning the full impact of the El Niño weather phenomenon on agricultural output, possible uptrend in world oil prices as well as the adjustments in power and water rates and their expected second round effects on the prices of other commodities and on wages. The Monetary Board also pointed out that the stimulus from the external sector could not be as strong as earlier anticipated, given the uncertainty about the timing and pace of the economic upturn in the US and other major economies. Based on these considerations, the Monetary Board is of the view that monetary policy should continue to focus on ensuring conditions to strengthen domestic demand. This involves keeping policy rates steady in order to foster a low market interest rate environment, one that remains supportive of the economy's growth objective while ensuring that price pressures are well contained."
Peru,2002-08-02,"BANCO CENTRAL DE RESERVA DEL PERU Press release MONETARY PROGRAM APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF THE BANK FOR AUGUST 2002 In July, the daily average balance of the banks' current account was 205 million, within the range announced for that month (205 million to 215 million). The interbank interest rate in domestic currency growth from 2,6 percent in June to 2,9 percent in July. In that month, the interest rate for monetary regulation credits was increased from 3,0 percent to 3,25 percent. The Board of the Bank assessed the monetary policy stance for August and established the following: The targeted range for the banks' current account balance held at the Central Bank will be maintained at 190 million to 200 million on a daily average basis. For monetary regulation credits and temporary purchase of CDBCRP and Treasury bonds out of auctions, the effective interest rate remains as the weighted average of the interbank interest rates, or 3,25 percent, whichever is highest. For overnight deposits in domestic currency held by banks at the Central Bank, the effective interest rate remained at 1,9 percent. For foreign exchange temporary purchase operations (swap operations), the commission which implies an effective annual cost of 3,25 percent is maintained. The following interest rates will be used in foreign-currency operations: The effective annual rate for monetary regulation credits will be the 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point. For overnight deposits held by banks at the Central Bank, the rate is equivalent to the average obtained by the Central Bank for similar deposits abroad. The previous framework is consistent with the current annual inflation forecast and that it finish above the lower inflation range. If justified by financial conditions, the values mentioned above could be modified in order to ensure the attainment of the objective to preserve monetary stability, which mean avoiding inflationary or deflationary pressures."
South Korea,2002-08-06,"Private consumption, facilities investment and industrial production slowed down in June due mainly to irregular factors such as provincial elections, the World Cup and strikes in the automobile industry. The underlying upward trend, however, is deemed to have been maintained. The growth of exports expanded in July, and the growth of manufacturing production appeared to have accelerated, notably in semiconductors and the automobile industry. Consumer price inflation continued to ease in July for the second consecutive month, owing to the steep declines in prices of agricultural products. Nevertheless, core inflation registered 3., 0 percent in July, similar to the 2., 9 percent level of the previous month. Domestic stock prices and the won/dollar exchange rate tumbled mainly because of the instability of U S., financial markets. Corporate fund- raising conditions have, however, been favorable. The recovery trend of the Korean economy is likely to continue in the forseeable future, but a considerable degree of uncertainty surrounds economic conditions at home and abroad in view of the instability emanating from the U S., financial markets. Therefore, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain its benchmark overnight call rate at around its current level in August. Looking ahead, the MPC will keep a close eye on developments in the international and domestic economies."
Chile,2002-08-08,"Santiago. August 8, 2002 Press Release At its monthly monetary policy meeting held today, the Board of the Central Bank decided to lower the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points from an annual 3.25% to 3% and to lower the rates on liquidity credit lines by the same amount each. Data gathered since the last meeting show that the growth outlook for various trading partners has deteriorated, especially the United States both for this year and next. This has already had an effect on some commodity prices in particular copper. Regional financial markets have been highly volatile over the past month but this should improve after yesterday's announcements made by Brazil and the International Monetary Fund. Nevertheless. Chile's financial indicators are standing up well. Low inflationary pressures continue, due to the evolution of various cost indicators as well as lower-than-expected growth levels over the coming quarters. This is as forecast in the previous monetary policy meeting and justifies the more expansive monetary stance coherent with controlled inflation converging on the mid-range target within the policy horizon. The Central Bank will continue to use monetary policy to avoid any deviation from the inflation target."
United States,2002-08-13,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate unchanged at 1 3/4 percent. The softening in the growth of aggregate demand that emerged this spring has been prolonged in large measure by weakness in financial markets and heightened uncertainty related to problems in corporate reporting and governance. The current accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with still-robust underlying growth in productivity, should be sufficient to foster an improving business climate over time. Nonetheless, the Committee recognizes that, for the foreseeable future, against the background of its long run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness.

Israel,2002-08-26,"The Bank of Israel's Monetary Program for September 2002. The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for September 2002, according to which the interest rate will remain unchanged at 9.1 percent. The Bank of Israel explains that in the wake of the 2 percentage-point increase in the interest rate at the endof June, there has been local-currency appreciation and a decline in yields on unindexed government bonds, while the financial markets have been calmer. Inflation expectations for the next two years, as derived from the capital market, private forecasters' predictions, and the models developed by the Bank of Israel, have declined, converging to the long-term inflation target range set by the government (1-3 percent). Nevertheless, inflation expectations for longer terms are still above the target. The Bank of Israel stresses that it is necessary to base price stability on the actual inflation data of the next few months, and not solely on the decline in inflation expectations. This is because neither the moderation of economic activity nor the deepening of unemployment have prevented inflation from rising to date (a cumulative 7 percent increase since the beginning of the year). In addition, forces are still at work that threaten both financial and price stability. These factors include the uncertainty that still prevails regarding the approval of the 2003 budget, and continued concern about the security situation. As far as the budget is concerned, the Bank of Israel stresses that a genuine return to fiscal discipline, as expressed in the commitment to a path of a declining budget deficit/GDP ratio, and a declining deficit over time, is essential in order to bring about a reduction in the long-term interest rate: which affects the government's debt-servicing payments as well as the extent of investment and mortgage interest: and in order to enable the Bank of Israel to reduce short-term interest without harming stability. Note that in the last few months interest on indexed long-term bonds (10 years) has not fallen but has risen slightly, to 5.5 percent. Thus, a change is needed in the public's assessmentof the government's commitment to budget discipline in order to attain thereduction of both long- and short-term interest that should help to revivegrowth and reduce unemployment. Although the foreign-currency markethas been calmer in the last two months, and there has been cumulative local-currency appreciation of 6 percent, the effect of the calm has not been evident in prices. In addition, the implied volatility of the NIS/dollar options issued by the Bank of Israel, which serves as an indication of exchange-rate risk, has fallen slightly, although remaining significantly higher than its level in 2001. Moreover, the expected trends of long-term capital flows and the current account in the balance of payments do not support the continuation of appreciation, but the contrary. This is because the persistence of the slump in the developed countries in general, and the US in particular, as well as the sluggish capital markets there, reduce the possibility of the renewal of raising capital abroad. The Bank of Israel points out that it will continue to monitor developments on an ongoing basis, taking the steps required to bolster financial stability and restore the actual inflationrate to the sphere defined as price stability. Subject to these conditions, the Bank will act to support the government's policy to foster employmentand shorten the recession. Changes in NIS and dollar interest rates. ISRAEL.

Philippines,2002-08-28,"In its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to keep the interest rates on the BSP's overnight borrowing or RRP rate and overnight lending or RP rate at 7.0 percent and 9.25 percent, respectively. The current policy rates have been maintained at these levels since 15 March 2002. Based on its assessment of a comprehensive set of economic and financial indicators, the Monetary Board believes that inflation will remain tame for the rest of the year owing to positive supply-side factors such as favorable food supply conditions and downward adjustment in power costs. Recent data suggest a gradual pick-up in economic activity, as indicated by the steady growth in manufacturing output as well as increases in energy sales by Meralco, cement sales and the value of building permits. Real gross domestic product (GDP) also grew stronger than expected in the second quarter, rising by 4.5 percent as industry recovered and services continued to gain strength. In addition, preliminary data show that domestic liquidity growth strengthened to 7.3 percent in July relative to the 5.1 percent expansion a month earlier. However, the presence of spare capacity indicates a generally subdued inflation picture in the near term. The Monetary Board, nevertheless, recognizes that there are still inflationary headwinds over the policy horizon posed by the uncertainties surrounding the full impact of the El Niño weather disturbance on agricultural crop production, the possible uptrend in world oil prices, deferred adjustments in utility charges, market concerns over the fiscal deficit and the recent pressures on the peso. Given the uncertainty over the robustness of the world economic upturn, the Monetary Board believes that monetary policy should continue to foster conditions that will sustain the recovery of domestic demand while keeping price pressures at bay. Thus, the Monetary Board is of the view that the current monetary policy stance is appropriately supportive of the economy's growth and price stability objectives."
Poland,2002-08-28,"Warsaw. August 28, 2002 INFORMATION ON THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL ON AUGUST 27-28, 2002 The Monetary Policy Council held its meeting on August 27-28, 2002. The Council was submitted the materials prepared by the Management Board and departments of the NBP as well as information and analytical materials prepared by the Ministry of Finance, banks and research institutes. The Council discussed the external conditions of the Polish economy and tendencies in the real sector of the economy, in the area of wages and social benefits, money supply, lending and interest rates, in public finance sector, and the formation of inflation expectations, prices and the inflation outlook. Decision of the Monetary Policy Council In August, the enhancement of a low inflation level was observed. As compared to the situation observed a month before, factors that reduce inflation growth in future have strengthened: the expected level of inflation has been subject to a further reduction; all core inflation measures lowered; the dynamics of money supply M3 dropped to the level of 1.2%; the dynamics of lending to households lowered significantly, a low dynamics of lending to businesses is maintained; a moderate growth of wages does not threaten in a form of a growth of inflation pressure; a limitation of labor market stiffening  thanks to a partial liberalization of the labor code  will support the maintaining of inflation at a low level; the outlook of an accelerated growth in the USA and the European Union got more distant. With less optimistic growth outlook for the world economy, in Poland, the signals of the economic boom got confirmed: the output in industrial processing grew in July by 7.8%; budget revenues from indirect taxes have been bigger than expected; export revenues have increased again; a material growth has been noted in newly begun investments; retail sales in current prices grew in July by 8.6%. A moderate pace of the economic boom, in the Council's opinion, does not pose a threat to the accomplishment of the inflation target at the moment. Factors that could threaten the stabilization of inflation at a low level are still observed: a drop of the annualized dynamics of household deposits takes place while at the same time a high dynamics of cash in circulation is maintained; an outlook of a high public finance sector deficit within the conditions of the planned economic growth in 2003, together with the forecasted increase of the scale of extended guarantees and allowances, means a further loosening of fiscal policy; so far there is no substantial proposals of reforms in the system of public expenses that would enable a sustained and effective reduction of a present high level of budget deficit; there is still maintained uncertainty related to the supply driven factors, especially fuel prices. Considering these arguments, the Monetary Policy Council decided to: cut the minimum yield on 28-day open market operations from 8.5% to 8.0%; cut the rediscount rate from 10.0% to 9.0%; cut the lombard rate from 11.5% to 10.5%; maintain the deposit rate at the unchanged level (5.5%); maintain its neutral position in monetary policy. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Council will be held on September 24-25, 2002. I. Evaluation of the economic situation A general evaluation of the economic situation, as in the 2nd quarter 2002, compared to the one performed a month before, has the economic situation slightly improved. improved According to the data by GUS, in the 1st quarter 2002 the annualized dynamics of domestic demand was at the level of 0% (as compared to 3.9% in the 4th quarter 2001) and the GDP growth pace in the 1st quarter 2002 accelerated to 0.5% (0.2% in the 4th quarter 2001). It is assessed that in the 2nd quarter the economy grew at the pace exceeding 0.5% of GDP what is indicated by the dynamics of the sold industrial output and construction and assembling production. A high output growth in July (by 6.0%) is the evidence of an improvement of the situation in industry. Positive in July this year, the dynamics that was noted in the two recent months led to growth pace of the overcome of a stagnation trend of production that had industrial output been maintained for 15 months. The acceleration of the accelerated growth pace in industry was related to a high dynamics of production in industrial processing (increase by 7.8%). Out of 22 sections of the processing industry, the level that was 2 lower than in July last year has been noted only in three of them. Among sections with a high production dynamics the majority are industries with a big share of exports in their sales. The improvement has been noted in the situation of those sections the considerable part of production of which is made by provision goods for construction and investment goods. Besides the improvement of the situation in construction (decrease of the drop scale, symptoms of increase of the portfolio of orders) and a considerable investment boom increase of the number of tasks and estimated value of the appeared begun investments, a gradual improvement in investment industries can be the evidence of a halted drop tendency in investment activity. Despite the expectations, in July and August this year, the more distant is the indicators of a current and expected economic situation in outlook for the the economies of the euro zone and the USA worsened improvement of the considerably. It is forecasted that the improvement of the economic situation external economic situation will take place later than it was worldwide, and, thus, assumed earlier, and its effects for Poland's economy will its stimulating impact probably be perceptible only in the 2nd half of 2003. The on the economic boom expectations concerning the increase of interest rates in Poland abroad also weakened significantly. In the enterprise sector, a moderate growth of wages is a moderate growth of maintained. Within the period January-July this year, the wages is noted in the average wages in enterprises were higher by 4.4% than in enterprise sector the same period of 2001. The real growth of wages was higher than a year before and it amounted to 1.9%. The situation on the labor market indicates, however, that a the situation on the material acceleration of the wage growth in the next couple labor market indicates of months should not be forecasted. In July this year, the no risk of a material average employment in the enterprise sector lowered by acceleration of the 0.3% as compared to the previous month and as compared wage growth to July last year it was lower by 4.2%. II. Situation in public finance sector the economic deficit of The situation of the state budget in 2002 is evaluated as the public finance stable, there is no threat of exceeding the legal level of the sector in 2002 will be budget deficit, however, the economic deficit of the public maintained at a higher finance sector will probably be at a considerably higher than planned level level than it was planned. 3 There is maintained uncertainty whether the forecasted by the Government maintaining of the limit of expenses according to the formula “inflation + 1 percentage point” does not shift the deficit to other units of the public finance sector. The pressure on the increase of expenses will result from the applicable and developed legal acts. there is maintained There are still no substantial proposals of reforms in the uncertainty about the system of public expenses that would enable a sustained situation of public and effective reduction of the present high level of budget finance in 2003 and deficit. within the next years III. Money supply, loans, interest rates, exchange rate As compared to the situation a month before, the the tendency to save in evaluation of the monetary situation did not change. The banks decreases, annualized dynamics of money supply M3 is maintained at households are less a low level, however, at the same time, a high dynamics of interested in loans cash in circulation is maintained, and the dynamics of deposits drops. Especially alarming are the deposits of households. In June this year, there was noted a drop of total deposits of households as compared to the amount observed a month before, and in July this year, their growth was minimal. The annualized growth pace of deposits lowered in July as compared to June from 0.0% to 2.2%. This drop is the evidence of a weakening tendency to save in banks as a result of a decreased attractiveness of bank placements. The annualized dynamics of lending to households lowered from 15.5% a month before to 9.8%. The dynamics of lending to businesses, however, accelerated and after 3 months when a drop was noted, in June this year it was higher by 2.1% and in July by 2.7% than a year before. In August this year, the depreciation tendency of the zloty, in August this year, especially visible against the euro, was halted. Together the depreciation with the appreciation of the American dollar against the tendency of the common European currency, the exchange rate of the zloty exchange rate of the remained stable against the euro and it slightly weakened zloty was halted against the American currency. IV. Prices, inflation expectations 4 In July this year, mainly as a result of a further drop of the annualized foodstuff prices, the annualized consumer price index consumer price index lowered from 1.6% to 1.3%. A further drop of all core lowered to 1.3% inflation measures was observed. In July this year, the sold industrial output prices rose. However, it mainly resulted from a big price growth in the section production and supply of electric energy, natural gas and water as a result of the introduction of the excise tax on electric energy. Inflation on a low level supports the enhancement of low inflation on a low level inflation expectations. In August this year, inflation supports the expectations by both individuals and bank analysts enhancement of low lowered, and the drop of inflation expectations is related to inflation expectations both the expected inflation rates in December 2002 and in the 12-month horizon. The inflation rate expected by bank analysts at the end of this year amounted to 2.3% what means its drop by 0.5 percentage point as compared to the forecasts made in July this year."
Chile,2002-09-05,"Santiago. September 5, 2002 Press Release At its monthly monetary policy meeting held today, the Board of the Central Bank decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at an annual 3% and leave liquidity credit lines unchanged at the levels prevailing since the previous meeting. The Board considers that the current expansive monetary policy, which is already gradually making itself felt, is coherent with the expected trend of inflation converging towards the mid-range target within the usual projection horizon. Data gathered since the previous meeting confirm the marked deterioration in the growth outlook for Chile's trading partners. International financial markets are highly volatile, heightening uncertainty particularly with regard to the countries of this region. The outlook for the domestic economy, evaluated in the previous meeting, is still the same. Chilean financial markets, known for their solvency and low risk, continue the process of transfering interest rate cuts towards different instruments. Underlying inflation is controlled, largely as a result of using spare installed capacity, and with some ups and downs, inflation should come towards the centre of the target range during the next few months. The Central Bank reiterates its commitment to a flexible use of monetary policy to avoid deviations from the inflationary target."
Peru,2002-09-05,"BANCO CENTRAL DE RESERVA DEL PERU Press release MONETARY PROGRAM APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF THE BANK FOR SEPTEMBER 2002 In August, the daily average balance of the banks' current account was 186 million, below the range announced for that month (190 million to 210 million). The interbank interest rate in domestic currency passed from 2,9 percent in July to 3,0 percent in August. The Board of the Bank assessed the monetary policy stance for September and established the following: The targeted range for the banks' current account balance held at the Central Bank will be maintained at 175 million to 195 million on a daily average basis. For monetary regulation credits and temporary purchase of CDBCRP and Treasury bonds out of auctions, the effective interest rate remains as the weighted average of the interbank interest rates, or 3,75 percent, whichever is highest. The former rate was 3,25 percent. For overnight deposits in domestic currency held by banks at the Central Bank, the effective interest rate remained at 1,9 percent. For foreign exchange temporary purchase operations (swap operations), the commission is raised to an implicit effective annual cost of 3,75 percent. The following interest rates will be used in foreign-currency operations: The effective annual rate for monetary regulation credits will be the 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point. For overnight deposits held by banks at the Central Bank, the rate is equivalent to the average obtained by the Central Bank for similar deposits abroad. Since September, according the new reserve requirement regulation, the average balance of funds in vault of the previous month is computed in order to determine the reserve requirement in domestic currency. The previous framework is consistent with the current annual inflation forecast and that it finish above the lower inflation range.

Thailand,2002-09-10,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 10 September 2002 Mr. Bandid Nijathaworn. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand announced that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance. The main issues discussed were as follows: 1. After consideration of the latest data, the MPC was of the view that economic growth in the first 7 months of the year had been satisfactory, with expansion in both production and domestic spending, as well as a pick-up in exports. External stability remained strong with the current account still in surplus, international reserves position sound, and continued reductions in foreign debt. The baht/US dollar exchange rate has been stable, moving in line with market conditions and other regional currencies. In terms of internal stability, both headline and core inflation remained subdued, the latter averaging 06 percent year-on-year in the first 8 months of 2002. Looking forward, the MPC assessed that core inflation in the next 8 quarters should remain low and within the official target range. The MPC was fully aware of the heightened risks to the Thai economy emanating from external factors. These included increased uncertainty regarding the US economic recovery, greater volatility in global financial markets, as well as more pronounced risks in world oil markets associated with tensions in the Middle East. The MPC felt that these developments must be monitored closely to ensure timely adjustment of policy should the threat become more apparent. The MPC therefore decided to maintain the 14-day repurchase rate at 2 percent per annum for now. Bank of Thailand 10 September 2002."
Euroarea,2002-09-12,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I will report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB, which was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup. Mr. Christodoulakis, and Commissioner Solbes. At today's meeting, the Governing Council continued its comprehensive examination of monetary, financial and economic developments and assessed new evidence that has become available over the past few weeks. Our conclusion is that risks to price stability appear rather balanced. Against this background, the current level of key ECB interest rates is appropriate. As regards the analysis under the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 was 7.3% in the period from May to July 2002, compared with 7.4% in the period from April to June 2002. Hence, there is no indication of a significant reduction in monetary growth over the last few months. The recent strength in M3 growth partly reflects both the low opportunity cost of holding money and renewed portfolio shifts into M3 in an environment of financial market uncertainty. In this context, monetary trends need to be assessed with caution. From a longer-term perspective, there is concern that more liquidity is available in the euro area than would be needed to finance sustainable, non-inflationary economic growth. However, at this juncture, there is less risk that excess liquidity will translate into inflationary pressure, given the environment of subdued demand. The trend in the growth of loans to the private sector also seems to point in this direction. Concerning the second pillar, the latest data confirm a modest recovery in real GDP growth in the euro area in the first half of this year. In the second quarter of this year real GDP growth is estimated to have grown by 0.3% quarter on quarter, following upwardly revised growth of 0.4% in the first quarter. In contrast to the first quarter, developments in demand appear to have been more broadly based, as activity was supported by private consumption, export growth and inventories. However, overall domestic demand growth remained subdued as a result of the protracted weakness of investment. Looking ahead, the most likely scenario is that of ongoing, albeit modest, growth in real GDP in the second half of this year, with growth rates in line with potential growth in 2003. This delay in the acceleration of economic activity in the euro area broadly corresponds with the world economic outlook, given that the expected pace of the recovery has been scaled down over recent months. Sharp declines in stock prices are having negative effects on consumer and investor confidence. Consequently, the strength of the upturn in economic activity has become more uncertain, both inside and outside the euro area. At the same time, however, the conditions for a stronger economic recovery in the euro area remain in place. On the domestic side, private consumption should particularly benefit from lower inflation and improved real disposable income, while investment should be supported by low nominal and real market interest rates. Finally, the gradual recovery of the global economy is also expected to continue. Nevertheless, risks to the economic outlook, both inside and outside the euro area, need to be monitored closely. Turning to price developments, in July annual HICP inflation was 1.9%, while the inflation rate excluding unprocessed food and energy fell slightly to 2.5%, its first decline in 2002. Eurostat's flash estimate for August, which indicates that annual HICP inflation increased to 2.1%, is fully in line with previous expectations that inflation rates were likely to fluctuate at around 2% for the remainder of the year. However, the short-term trend is also dependent on oil price developments, which have increased significantly over recent months. Looking further ahead, the recent appreciation of the euro exchange rate, as well as the overall economic environment, should contribute to a reduction in consumer price inflation. Moreover, services price inflation is expected to moderate somewhat, following particularly strong increases in 2002. However, for inflation rates to come down to levels below 2% in 2003, as currently projected by most forecasts, it is crucial that oil prices do not escalate and that wage moderation prevails. With respect to nominal wage growth, we have already noted an upward trend over recent years, which continued even when the economy started to slow down. While the information from the latest wage indicators does not signal a further acceleration, wage developments remain a cause for concern, despite the weak cyclical situation. With regard to the devastating floods which have hit three member countries in particular, we deeply regret the substantial loss of life. The overall macroeconomic impact of these floods should be limited and have no lasting effects. Certain food prices could temporarily rise as a result, also due to bad weather conditions in other euro area countries, and while real GDP growth could initially be dampened slightly it may subsequently be stimulated by reconstruction. Overall, subdued aggregate demand and the strengthening of the euro should contribute to lower inflationary pressure. At the same time, other factors  in particular monetary developments, but also wage trends and oil price developments  might pose risks to price stability in the medium term and therefore need to be monitored closely. Regarding fiscal policies in the euro area, flood-related costs should lead to a review of priorities and a reallocation of expenditure. In addition, against the background of recent developments, it seems to be more warranted than ever to call on member countries to remain committed to the Stability and Growth Pact. Countries with sound fiscal positions should safeguard their achievements, while countries with remaining imbalances must avoid deficits in excess of 3% of GDP and implement determined policies in order to progress towards budgets close to balance or in surplus. This is essential for maintaining and further strengthening confidence in the policy framework in the euro area and for establishing fiscal positions in all countries that allow automatic stabilisers to work efficiently without endangering sound fiscal positions in the longer term. In the field of structural reforms we continue to urge governments to implement, in a determined way, the agenda set in the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines. Structural reforms will contribute to expanding the euro area's potential for non-inflationary growth and to reducing its high level of unemployment. At the same time, they will help to foster confidence among consumers and investors in long-term growth and employment opportunities in the euro area, thereby having a positive effect on spending and investment decisions in the short and medium term. Such confidence is fostered by a determined and broadly based implementation of the reform agenda, focusing, in particular, on labour and product markets."
South Korea,2002-09-12,"The economic upswing seems to be continuing, considering that industrial production expanded in July after having slowed in June because of one-off factors, and that during August exports maintained a rapid growth. Consumer price inflation shifted to a sharp rise of 0., 7 percent following two months' decline, as prices of agricultural products rose due to torrential rains while rents and prices of personal services also showed an upward trend. Core inflation, however, registered a level similar to the previous month's. Looking ahead, prices may show unstable movements owing to the rise in real estate prices, the recent increase in international oil prices and the upward trend of wages. After measures were taken including the raising of the call rate target in May, the expansion in household credits slowed down and the money growth eased. However, with recent rise in real estate prices, the growth of household credits has again accelerated. Despite these economic and financial conditions, uncertainties still remain over external circumstances, particularly regarding the U S., economy and the damages caused by typhoon were huge. Therefore, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain its benchmark overnight call rate at around its current level in September. The MPC will take necessary action if domestic and/or external disequilibria such as a rise in housing prices and a deterioration of the balance of payment position emerge."
South Africa,2002-09-12,"The year-on-year increase in the consumer price index for metropolitan and other urban areas, excluding the influence of mortgage interest cost (CPIX), increased from 5,8 per cent in September 2001 to 9,9 per cent in July 2002. The acceleration in the quarter-to-quarter CPIX inflation rate was even more pronounced from an annualised rate of only 3,8 per cent in the second quarter of 2001 to 11,5 per cent in the second quarter of 2002. The twelve-month rate of increase in the all-goods production price index also rose from 7,8 per cent in September 2001 to the high level of 15,2 per cent in July 2002. This increase in inflationary pressures arose largely because of the sharp downward movement in the value of the rand in the last quarter of 2001. In addition, the international price of oil increased from a monthly average of about US$19 per barrel in December 2001 to nearly US$26 per barrel in July 2002. The depreciation in the external value of the rand at first mainly influenced food prices. From the beginning of 2002 the rise in prices became more widespread and inflationary expectations began to increase. When excluding food price changes. CPIX inflation picked up from a year-on-year level of 5,4 per cent in December 2001 to 7,8 per cent in July 2002. Containment of these price increases, including administered prices, is essential to reduce inflation. This requires a concerted effort by all concerned. The continued increase in year-on-year production price inflation indicates that consumer price inflation will rise further in the coming months because there is normally a lag of approximately 2 months before production price increases affect consumer prices. Although the quarter-to-quarter rate of increase in production prices declined somewhat in the second quarter of 2002, it is still very high at a seasonally adjusted and annualised level of 14,2 per cent. Moreover, this slowdown can to a large extent be attributed to a strengthening of the rand in the first five months of 2002. By contrast, the price of domestically produced manufactured goods continued to increase at annualised rates in excess of 20 per cent in the first two quarters of 2002. Taking these developments into consideration, it is not surprising that inflationary expectations have increased significantly despite efforts by the Reserve Bank to curtail price increases. According to the expectations survey of the Bureau for Economic Research of the University of Stellenbosch done for the Reserve Bank, respondents expect CPIX inflation to amount to 7½ per cent in 2003 and then to decline only slightly to 7,0 per cent in 2004. At these levels, inflation expectations are well above the upper level of the inflation target range, but they moderate over time. Nominal unit labour cost rose from 2,9 per cent in 2000 to 4,8 per cent in 2001 and 6,4 per cent in the year to March 2002. Faster growth in nominal unit labour cost is usually associated with higher consumer price inflation. According to survey results obtained from NMG-Levy Consultants and Actuaries, the average annual rate of wage settlements in the first half of 2002 amounted to about 7,5 per cent, i.e. wage increases did not accelerate in the first six months of the year. Recent wage settlement rates announced in the media are, however, considerably higher. This implies that if labour productivity does not increase commensurately, there could be further upward pressure on consumer prices. Another factor that could lead to increased inflationary pressures is the decline in the nominal effective exchange rate of the rand of 11½ per cent from the end of May 2002 to the end of August. This weakness of the exchange rate coincided with a reduction in the holdings of domestic securities by non-residents, amounting to nearly R12 billion in July and August, which almost neutralised the net purchases of securities by non-residents in the first six months of the year. This probably reflected concerns about problems in emerging markets, including Zimbabwe. Although the draft mining charter is not government policy it was nonetheless perceived negatively by foreign and domestic investors, particularly in an environment of heightened risk aversion to emerging-market assets following the crisis in Argentina and fears of a debt default in Brazil. The developments that have so far led to higher inflation are therefore mainly exogeneous or cost-push factors, which cannot be directly influenced by changes in the level of short-term interest rates. At present there are no signs of excess spending or production capacity constraints, while fiscal discipline has been maintained by the authorities. It is, however, always important to take into consideration that cost-push and excess monetary demand factors are interacting elements or different aspects of the same process, rather than totally separate causes of different processes. Autonomous cost-push or exogeneous factors cannot on their own lead to an inflationary process if they are not accommodated by a monetary expansion. When autonomous price increases occur without increases in the money supply, bank credit extension and inflationary expectations, such increases are self-terminating. But when they are supported by accommodating monetary developments, inflationary pressures will become self-perpetuating. As already indicated, inflationary expectations are already very high. Moreover, growth over twelve months in the broadly defined money supply (M3) amounted to 17,4 per cent in July 2002. Although this growth rate was lower than the 20,6 per cent recorded in May 2002, the reduction was to a large extent due to increased tax collections, which reduced the private sector's deposits with banks included in M3 while raising government deposits which do not form part of money supply. It is also true that a large part of this increase in M3 was the result of increases in long-term deposits, which are less likely to be related directly to aggregate nominal spending on goods and services. The narrower defined monetary aggregates, however, also rose significantly. To the extent that the deposits at banks could be used to purchase goods and services, they are an indication of possible spending that may exceed the economy's production potential in the future, and therefore create inflationary pressures. The growth over twelve months in bank credit extended to the private sector slowed down moderately from a high level of 15,6 per cent in January 2002 to 11,7 per cent in July. Measured from quarter to quarter, growth in credit extension to the private sector fell from 19,6 per cent in the first quarter of 2002 to only 1,9 per cent in the second quarter. This considerably decreased rate of credit expansion was mainly the result of a reversal in the leads and lags in the payments for and receipts from foreign transactions. Earlier borrowing associated with these international trade transactions was mostly repaid in the second quarter when the external value of the rand strengthened. It therefore reflected a slower rate of credit extension to the corporate sector. Credit extended to households by banks hardly seems to have been affected by the increase in interest rates during 2002 and continued to rise rapidly. In view of these accommodating monetary developments, the Monetary Policy Committee has decided to increase the repurchase rate by a further 100 basis points to 13,50 per cent with effect from 13 September 2002. It is expected that this will lead to similar adjustments in deposit and lending rates in the domestic market. Although this will mean that interest rates in South Africa have been increased by 4 percentage points from the beginning of the year, this will in fact bring the banks ' real prime overdraft rate back to approximately the level prevailing during the first few months of 2002. The banks' real twelve-month deposit rate before taxation will amount to only approximately 2 per cent if it is adjusted by this increase. The inflation-adjusted yield on long-term government bonds in July 2002 came to only 1,2 per cent. Consequently, the level of interest rates cannot be regarded as a major factor which has had or will have a significant constraining effect on production growth. This statement is supported by the fact that domestic final demand has continued to grow strongly. Moreover, export volumes increased considerably in the second quarter of 2002, as part of the lagged effect of the depreciation of the rand. Export growth contributed to maintaining a surplus on the current account of the balance of payments, which alleviated the pressure on the exchange rate of the rand mainly arising from the recent portfolio capital outflow. Export increases should further assist the economy in the attainment of healthy growth levels, while the current increase in interest rates should bring the inflation rate to within the target range."
Israel,2002-09-23,"The Bank of Israel's Monetary Program for October 2002. The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for October 2002, according to which the interest rate will remain unchanged at 9.1 percent. The Bank of Israel explains that assessments of inflation for the year ahead, as derived from the capital market, private forecasters' predictions, and the models developed by the Bank of Israel, are within the long-term inflation target range determined by thegovernment, although factors exist which imperil financial and price stability. These factors include the uncertainty that still prevails regarding the approval of the budget, continued concern about the security situation in Israel and the Middle East, and the considerable volatility in the foreign-currency market. With regard to the budget, there is a great deal of uncertainty as to whether the deficit target set for 2002 will be attained in view of the ongoing decline in tax receiptsand both the approval and implementation of the 2003 budget. The uncertainty pertaining to the budget and the government's borrowing requirements are currently reflected in the market for government bonds, whose nominal and real yields have risen in the last few months (yields on Shahar bonds reverted to 10 percent, after having been 9.3 percent in July), expressing investors' misgivingsas to the government's commitment to fiscal discipline. A return to fiscalrestraint, expressed in a downward debt/GDP path and declining long-term deficit path, is essential in order to bring about the reduction of long-term interest which will affect the government's debt-servicing costs, the extent of investment, and mortgage interest. It will also enable the reductionof short-term interest without jeopardizing stability, as a key element to economic growth and the creation of new jobs. The Bank of Israel notes that even after the local-currency apreciation evident since June, there is extensive uncertainty in the foreign-currency market. This is expressed in the relatively high volatility implicit in the NIS/$ options issued by the Bank of Israel, reflecting exchange-rate risk, as well as in the rise in the risk premium ascribed to Israel by international markets, as expressed in the spread on government bonds traded abroad. In addition, the expected trend of long-term capital flows and the current account of the balance-of-payments do not support the strengthening of the shekel but indicate the opposite. Thisis due to the continued recession in the advanced economies, and the US inparticular, and the slump in the capital markets there, reducing the possibility of raising capital abroad once more. As a result, the trend of exchange-rate shifts is influenced to a greater extent today than in the past byshort-term capital flows, which are sensitive to interest-rate spreads between Israel and abroad. Last week one of the rating agenciesreduced the rating of Israel's three largest banks, justifying this by theuncertainty in Israel's economic environment and banking sector, as well as the slump in the US and the high-tech sector. The Bank of Israel reiterates that it is crucial to adhere to a cautious macroeconomic policy, and budget policy in particular, guided by long-term considerations of economic stability. This serves to bolster the economy, is essential for reinforcing the financial system, and enables the creation of a sound basis for renewed growth once external conditions permit. The Bank of Israel points out that it will continue to monitor developments in the market, in order to bolster financial stability and restore the actual inflation rate to the sphere defined as price stability. Subject to these conditions, the Bank will act to support the government's policy to foster employment and shorten the recession. Changes in NIS and dollar interest rates. ISRAEL.

United States,2002-09-24,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate unchanged at 1 3/4 percent. The information that has become available since the last meeting of the Committee suggests that aggregate demand is growing at a moderate pace. Over time, the current accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with still robust underlying growth in productivity, should be sufficient to foster an improving business climate. However, considerable uncertainty persists about the extent and timing of the expected pickup in production and employment owing in part to the emergence of heightened geopolitical risks. Consequently, the Committee believes that, for the foreseeable future, against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan. Chairman; William J McDonough. Vice Chairman; Ben S Bernanke; Susan S Bies; Roger W Ferguson.

Philippines,2002-09-25,"The Monetary Board, the policy-making body of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), today decided to keep its overnight borrowing rate at a ten-year low of 7 percent and its overnight lending rate at 9.25 percent to help sustain a low-inflation economic growth. This is the seventh consecutive time that the Monetary Board has kept its policy rates unchanged since 15 March 2002. A low-interest rate environment benefits the economy and the public, in general, as it encourages investments and promotes access to capital and goods at cheaper rates. While there are signs of modest improvements in the economy, as reflected by higher production and exports in the second quarter, there is still a need to stimulate further domestic economic activity. In particular, the latest economic and financial indicators show that demand for credit remains weak and spare capacity in the manufacturing sector is still large. The Philippines has been enjoying record low interest and inflation rates for some time now. The inflation rate was 2.9 percent in August, well below the Government's target of 4.5-5.5 percent for 2002. The inflation rate in August last year was 6.3 percent. For 2003, average inflation is expected to be within the 4.5-5.5 percent target for the year. In deciding on policy rates (interest rates for the BSP's borrowing and lending), the Monetary Board weighs carefully all factors that affect inflation and output growth in order to achieve its primary mandate of maintaining price stability that would support balanced and sustainable economic growth. The Monetary Board will meet again on 23 October to revisit the BSP's policy interest rate settings."
Poland,2002-09-25,"Warsaw. September 25, 2002 INFORMATION ON THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL ON SEPTEMBER 24-25, 2002 The Monetary Policy Council held its meeting on September 24-25, 2002. The Council was submitted the materials prepared by the Management Board and departments of the NBP as well as information and analytical materials prepared by the Ministry of Finance, banks and research institutes. The Council discussed the external conditions of the Polish economy and tendencies in the real sector of the economy, in the area of wages and social benefits, in public finance sector, in the area of money supply, lending and interest rates, and the formation of inflation expectations, prices and the inflation outlook. Decision of the Monetary Policy Council In September, the enhancement of a low inflation level is observed. Factors that reduce inflation growth in future have strengthened: the expected within 12 months level of inflation has been subject to further reduction, the current inflation rate and all core inflation measures lowered, the dynamics of money supply M3 dropped, the dynamics of lending to households and businesses lowered significantly, a moderate growth of wages  in conditions of a high level of unemployment  does not threaten in a form of the increased inflation pressure, the growth forecasts for the world economy lowered, including, in particular, the German economy. The signals coming from the economy are still not explicit. Positive information on the increase of the estimate value of newly begun investments can forecast a coming improvement of the investment demand. We assess that the data for August on the sold industrial output, although a little weaker than it was commonly expected, confirm that the lowering trend in production has been overcome and the increase of the added value in this sector should be expected in the 3rd quarter. These signals give the evidence that the economic growth pace will increase in the quarters to come. Whether the slow economic growth accelerates considerably and whether this acceleration is permanent will be decided by the demand driven factors and mainly the demand from abroad. The growth forecasts for abroad, however, are not optimistic. The prudence in the assessment of possibilities of the investment demand dynamics acceleration is also prompted by the higher risk of a war with Iraq. A moderate pace of the economic boom, according to the Council, does not pose a threat to the accomplishment of the inflation target in 2002 and 2003 at the moment, however, it indicates the necessity to be prudent in making decisions on the pace and scale of the monetary policy loosening. Factors that could threaten the stabilization of inflation at a low level and limit the growth of production potential are still observed: the drop of the annualized dynamics of household deposits is getting deeper, there is still maintained significant uncertainty related to fuel prices, the draft Act on the State Budget for the year 2003 does not constitute the fulfillment of the Government's earlier declarations to take measures that would permanently improve the situation in public finance. The draft lacks the basic systemic solutions that would affect the reduction of the budget expenses dynamics and change their structure. The outlook of maintaining a high deficit of the public finance sector in the conditions of a forecasted faster economic growth in 2003 means further loosening of fiscal policy. The Monetary Policy Council acknowledged that, from the point of view of future inflation, factors reducing the inflation pressure have got  on the basis of present forecasts  a bigger impact than factors threatening the inflation stabilization and decided to: cut the minimum yield on 28-day open market operations from 8.0% to 7.5%; cut the rediscount rate from 9.0% to 8.5%; cut the lombard rate from 10.5% to 10.0%; cut the deposit rate from 5.5% to 5.0%; maintain its neutral position in monetary policy. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Council will be held on October 3, 2002. Evaluation of the economic situation The economic growth in the 2nd quarter this year as a slight improvement compared to the same quarter of the previous year of the economic amounted to 0.8% and at the scale of the first six months situation in the 2nd 0.6%. The improvement of the economic growth in the 2nd quarter this year quarter this year mainly resulted from the increase of private consumption (2.9%) and a lower than in the previous quarters drop of gross investments in fixed assets (-8.4%). The currently available statistical data, however, still do symptoms of a not give the reason for the explicitly positive evaluation of gradual increase of the present economic situation what prompts being the activity in the prudent about the outlook for a fast growth of the real sector dynamics of GDP in 2003. On one hand, the data on a gradual increase of the activity in the real sector  the dynamics of the industrial production, retail sales, get confirmed. On the other hand, however, the evaluations of the external demand growth that is a basic factor affecting investment decisions worsened. A high level of limited possibilities unemployment reduces both the wage demands and the of consumer demand increase of consumption. Therefore, in the next couple of growth months, a faster growth of income from hired labor should not be expected. Together with a low growth of income from social benefits, it forecasts a further weakening of consumer demand growth. The survey of the economic situation of enterprises from still negative the processing industry sector, construction and trade evaluations of a made in August did not reflect firm symptoms of the general climate of economic boom. The evaluation of a general climate of the economic the economic situation  considering seasonal fluctuations situation  is still negative, although a little better than a month before. The next month did not bring the improvement of feelings no improvement of of enterprises and households both in the USA and in the business climate of euro zone. In the American economy, the indices enterprises and illustrating both the business climate of households and households in the the activity in the manufacturing sector are getting lower. USA and in the euro In Germany, the leading for the manufacturing sector zone index of the institute Ifo lowered from 91.6 in May to 88.8 in August this year. The factor that is the most uncertain is the formation of oil 3 prices worldwide. The increase of political risk resulted in uncertainty related to the situation that in the 1st half of September 2002 an oil prices average oil price amounted to almost USD 28 per barrel, so it was higher by USD 1 than in August this year. It is estimated that at present the risk of the war affects the increase of oil prices by at least USD 5 per barrel. II. Situation in public finance sector The situation of the state budget in 2002 as compared to the situation analyzed last month did not change. In the economic deficit August, the state budget accomplishment was according to of the public finance the plan what gives the evidence that there is no threat of sector in 2002 will exceeding the defined level of budget deficit. There is a be maintained at the possibility, however, that the revenues from indirect taxes higher level than it will be smaller in the 4th quarter this year than it would was planned result from tendencies observed in previous months. It results from systemic changes that will become effective and the most important of which is enabling small businesses to file their value added taxes quarterly what will result in the shift of some of such due receivables to the year 2003. Due to the above mentioned, at the end of this year there may be a necessity to reduce expenses in order to meet the defined deficit limit what, in practice, would mean carrying forward some of the reduced expenses for the year 2003 and thus a bigger burden for the budget next year. The economic deficit of the public finance sector this year will probably be at the significantly higher level than 4.8% of GDP that is set forth in the Act on the State Budget, mainly as a result of big shortages of earmarked funds. The guidelines of the draft act on the state budget for the year 2003 presented by the Minister of Finance indicate that when cyclical factors are considered, the fiscal policy uncertainty about the would be loosened. This situation will not be supported by situation of public increased budget revenues through the assumption of too finance in 2003 and optimistic macroeconomic forecasts, as well as single in the next years is measures bringing additional revenues such as tax maintained abolition and restructuring fees. The Government did not fulfill the principle of the real growth of central budget expenses by 1% as it declared, since the expenses are to increase in real terms by 2.2% and to amount to PLN 193.5 billion. 4 III. Money supply, loans, interest rates, exchange rate The annualized dynamics of money supply M3 lowered, the tendency to save and at the same time, the dynamics of cash stabilized, but at banks decreases, the dynamics of deposits drops what is the evidence of a the households are weakening tendency to save at banks as a result of the less interested in drop of attractiveness of bank placements. lending, the dynamics of lending A low dynamics of lending to households is maintained; to enterprises its annualized pace amounted to 8.5% in August this year. weakens The data for August did not confirm the increased activity in financing the enterprises by banks as it was observed in the previous months. The annualized pace of lending to enterprises amounted to 1.8% as compared to 2.7% in July this year. In August and the 1st half of September, the tendency to the depreciation of the zloty was halted. It was mainly the depreciating related to the halted appreciation of the euro on the world tendency of the market. Due to the above mentioned, in August this year, exchange rate of the the indices of the effective exchange rates of the zloty: the zloty has been halted nominal one and the real ones practically stabilized at the level noted in July this year. IV. Prices, inflation expectations In August this year, as a result of a further drop of foodstuff prices, the annualized consumer price index lowered from 1.3% to 1.2%. All core inflation measures lowered as well, although not as much as last month. the annualized consumer price According to the expectations, in August this year as index lowered to compared to July this year the sold industrial output prices 1.2% rose. The annualized dynamics of these prices will probably be higher than in case of consumer prices within the next couple of months, and the factors affecting this dynamics will be high oil prices and a delayed effect of the zloty depreciation within the recent months. Inflation on a low level supports the enhancement of low inflation expectations. In September this year, inflation expectations by both individuals and bank analysts lowered, and the drop of inflation expectations is related low inflation to both the expected inflation rates in December 2002 and expectations 5 in the 12-month horizon. The inflation rate expected by bank analysts at the end of this year amounted to 1.8% what means its drop by 0.5 percentage point as compared to the declarations made in August this year, and the expected annualized inflation rate (August 2003) amounted to 2.9% what means its drop by 0.2 percentage point."
Peru,2002-10-03,"BANCO CENTRAL DE RESERVA DEL PERU Press release MONETARY PROGRAM APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF THE BANK FOR OCTOBER 2002 In September, the daily average balance of the banks' current account was 190 million, within the range announced for that month (175 million to 195 million). The interbank interest rate in domestic currency passed from 3,0 percent in August to 5,6 percent in September, into a context of deeper regional financial uncertainty. The Board of the Bank assessed the monetary policy stance for October and established the following: The targeted range for the banks' current account balance held at the Central Bank will be 180 million to 200 million on a daily average basis. This range considers the new methodology used for reserve requirement computation. For monetary regulation credits and temporary purchase of CDBCRP and Treasury bonds out of auction, the effective interest rate will be the weighted average of the interbank interest rates, or 4,75 percent, whichever is highest. The former rate was 3,75 percent. The disposal of these resources will be based on liabilities subject to reserve requirement in domestic currency of each bank. For overnight deposits in domestic currency held by banks at the Central Bank, the effective interest rate will be 3,0 percent. The former rate was 1,9 percent. For foreign exchange temporary purchase operations (swap operations), the commission is raised to an implicit effective annual cost of 4,75 percent. The following interest rates will be used in foreign-currency operations: The effective annual rate for monetary regulation credits will be the 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point. For overnight deposits held by banks at the Central Bank, the rate is equivalent to the average obtained by the Central Bank for similar deposits abroad. The previous framework is consistent with the current annual inflation forecast (2,5 percent with a 1-percentage point margin). If justified by financial conditions, the values mentioned above could be modified in order to ensure the attainment of the objective to preserve monetary stability, which mean avoiding inflationary or deflationary pressures."
Chile,2002-10-08,"Santiago. October 8, 2002 Press Release At its monthly monetary policy meeting held today, the Board of the Central Bank decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at an annual 3% and leave liquidity credit lines unchanged at the levels prevailing since the previous meeting. The scenario for world economic growth has not changed in recent weeks but the risk of worse scenarios has heightened and regional financial markets are yet more volatile as can be seen particularly in the pressures on various currencies. The domestic economic scenario is in general coherent with the growth perspectives described in the the latest Monetary Policy Report. The medium-term inflation outlook remains close to the mid-range target although in the short term there could be bigger variations. The Central Bank reiterates its commitment to a flexible use of monetary policy to avoid deviations from the inflationary target."
Euroarea,2002-10-10,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I will report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. Today, the Governing Council continued its in-depth examination of monetary, financial and economic developments, incorporating in its assessment the new evidence that has become available over recent weeks. Our conclusion is that risks to price stability are at present balanced. Based on our overall assessment, we have kept the key ECB interest rates unchanged. As regards the analysis under the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 was 7.1% in the period from June to August 2002, compared with 7.3% in the period from May to July 2002. Hence, monetary growth remained strong and liquidity in the euro area ample. Recent monetary developments, however, should be interpreted with care. On the one hand, monetary trends have been influenced by considerable uncertainty in financial markets and therefore partly reflect strong liquidity preferences among investors. On the other hand, the low level of short-term interest rates has tended to stimulate monetary expansion, reflected particularly in the increase in the narrow aggregate M1. At the same time, loans to the private sector appear to be stabilising at growth rates above 5%, a rate of expansion which, in real terms, is in line with the long-term average. Considering all the evidence relating to the first pillar, from a medium-term perspective, more liquidity is available than would be needed to finance sustainable, non-inflationary growth. However, given the current environment, we do not see the risk of this translating into inflationary pressure in the near future. Concerning the second pillar, the latest data and survey results confirm that economic activity in the euro area remains subdued. These data and results also suggest that real GDP growth in the third quarter of 2002 may turn out to be similar to that of the first two quarters, when quarter-on-quarter expansion reached 0.4%. Against this background, previous expectations of an acceleration in economic growth in 2002 will not materialise. At the same time, a significant degree of uncertainty has been building up over recent months owing, in particular, to the sharp decline in stock prices and their potential detrimental effects on the economy, as well as to geopolitical tensions as reflected in surging oil prices. Nevertheless, the main scenario for the euro area is a return, in the course of 2003, to economic growth rates in line with those of potential, as also reflected in forecasts by international organisations. However, the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook is high. Sources of downside risks  including oil prices, imbalances in the global economy, financial market uncertainties and their impact on consumption, investment, and thus on employment  will be monitored closely. At this juncture, it is particularly difficult to offer a precise assessment of the timing and strength of the economic upswing, both in the euro area and globally. Turning to price developments, in August annual HICP inflation was 2.1%. Eurostat's flash estimate for September indicates an annual HICP inflation rate of 2.2%. While no detailed information is as yet available for individual HICP sub-components, the recent increase is likely to reflect the rise in energy prices. These developments generally remain in line with previous expectations of inflation rates hovering at around 2% for the remainder of the year, but short-term trends could be affected by future oil price developments. Looking further ahead, the euro exchange rate, which has strengthened since early this year, and the overall economic environment should contribute towards reducing inflationary pressure. In addition, we expect rates of perceived inflation, which are currently high, to move closer to actual rates. However, the assessment that inflation rates will fall and remain below 2%, depends on the development of oil prices and the prevalence of wage moderation. In this respect, earlier this year we pointed to an upward trend in wage growth which, according to preliminary indications, may have come to a halt only recently. In the same vein we have noted the inertia of consumer price developments in the euro area, as reflected in the stubbornness of the annual rate of inflation excluding unprocessed food and energy. This rate was 2.5% in August, only marginally lower than early this year; therefore, vigilance is warranted. Overall, monetary policy will remain geared towards maintaining price stability and will continue to focus on the medium term, thereby providing a reliable anchor for consumers and investors. At the current juncture, aggregate demand and exchange rate developments should contribute towards easing inflationary pressure, while monetary developments, wage trends and oil price developments could point to risks in the opposite direction. Consequently, all factors which could influence the balance of risk to price stability will be monitored closely. Regarding fiscal policies in the euro area, the Governing Council notes with concern that there is still insufficient ambition in some countries to bring budgets to positions close to balance or in surplus over the medium term. The current fiscal problems in some countries arise from the fact that these countries did not take the opportunity to improve substantially on their fiscal positions when economic growth rates were considerably higher than is currently the case. Given that this opportunity was missed, there is now no alternative but for all countries with remaining imbalances to make firm commitments to avoid excessive deficits, in keeping with the Treaty provisions, and to attain budgetary positions close to balance or in surplus, as required under the Stability and Growth Pact. Swift, decisive action is necessary in order to set up credible adjustment paths based both on realistic assumptions on the economic environment and on well-specified consolidation measures. Such adjustment paths must entail significant yearly improvements in the cyclically adjusted budget balance, and must be followed strictly and be completed within the shortest possible time-frame. To underpin this process, the ECB calls for strict monitoring procedures for the implementation of the consolidation strategies, the full use of the excessive deficit procedure and the application of rigorous accounting rules. Fiscal consolidation is not detrimental to the outlook for economic growth. The attainment of budgetary positions in line with the Stability and Growth Pact will gradually create scope for dealing with ageing-related issues and their impact on public finances. In any case, in the short term, the Pact does not place constraints on those member countries already in compliance, although it does call for the transition to be completed in the few remaining countries. Direct effects on short-term demand are to be counteracted by higher credibility of the conduct of fiscal policy  boosting confidence and thus private spending. We also urge governments to overcome the inertia in implementing structural reforms, both within the area of fiscal expenditures and revenues and in labour and product markets. Any further delay in tackling, with greater determination, the underlying reasons for limited growth in potential output over the medium term, and for only partially exploiting the current potential, is costly. It would also make it increasingly difficult to reach the objectives set in the Lisbon Agenda. Structural reforms take time to unfold fully their benefits and should therefore be frontloaded. Under the current circumstances, frontloading is particularly needed as it would support confidence."
South Korea,2002-10-10,"The economic upswing seems to be continuing as demonstrated by the steady growth of industrial production, private consumption and exports. Consumer price inflation rose 3.1 percent on a year-on-year basis in September as against 2.4 percent in the previous month, due to steep price rises of agricultural products, following crop losses from typhoons, and increases in housing rents and industrial product prices. Core inflation also accelerated from 2.8 percent to 2.9 percent on a year-on-year basis. While the pace of real estate price rises has eased since late September, credit to the household sector showed a larger expansion in September than in the previous month. The uncertainties surrounding the external environment, however, remain high due to concerns over the delayed economic recovery in advanced countries including the U.S, and the mounting possibility of war breaking out between the U.S, and Iraq. As a result, with sharp declines in stock markets of major countries, domestic stock prices have also fallen markedly, and business and consumer sentiment has shrunk again. Taking the domestic and external environments into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark overnight call rate in October at around its current level."
Thailand,2002-10-21,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 21 October 2002 Mr. Bandid Nijathaworn. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand announced that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance. The main issues discussed were as follows: 1. After the latest data evaluation, the MPC was of the view that economic expansion had continued favourably in the first 8 months of the year, registering growth in production, consumption and investment, primarily through a pickup in the private sector. Meanwhile export continued to accelerate. The MPC also assessed that since the damage to planted areas was limited (close to that in 1999), the adverse effect of the current floods on the economy would be minor. External stability remained strong with international reserves position solid, and the current account continued to be in surplus. The MPC determined that the recent weakening of the baht relative to the US dollar was in line with market conditions and other regional currencies. In terms of internal stability, headline inflation edged up to 04 per cent year-on-year in September 2002, owing partly to rising oil prices. However core inflation remained unaffected, staying at 03 per cent year-on-year. Looking forward, the MPC assessed that core inflation in the next 8 quarters would remain low and stay within the official target range. The MPC was cognizant of the heightened external risks, relative to those during the previous meeting, to the Thai economy. Of concern, in particular, are greater volatility in global financial markets, more pronounced uncertainties in world oil markets associated with a possible war between the US and Iraq, and global terrorism. 5. In totality, the MPC assessed that the Thai economy would expand satisfactorily in 2002, putting next year's growth on a firm basis. Nevertheless the MPC, in the face of enhanced external risks to growth, would continue to monitor external economic conditions closely and stand ready to adjust the monetary policy stance in favor of growth in the event that these risks heightened further. The MPC therefore decided to maintain the 14-day repurchase rate at 2 per cent per annum for the moment. Bank of Thailand 21 Octoberr 2002."
Philippines,2002-10-22,"The Monetary Board, the policy-making body of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), voted today to leave the BSP's policy interest rates, the overnight borrowing rate and the overnight lending rate, unchanged at 7.0 and 9.25 percent, respectively. This marks the eighth consecutive time since 12 April 2002 that the Monetary Board has opted to keep the BSP's policy rates unchanged. The Monetary Board expects price conditions to remain manageable over the policy horizon despite cost-side pressures. Average inflation for 2002 is likely to fall well below the Government's target of 4.5-5.5 percent, while inflation for 2003 is expected to fall within the targeted range of 4.5-5.5 percent for the year. At the same time, there are potential upside pressures to the inflation outlook over the policy horizon emanating from supply-side factors such as the El Niño weather disturbance, the increase in oil prices and increases in power rates and water charges. However, generalized demand-side pressures on consumer prices are expected to remain quiescent given sizeable unemployment and spare capacity in manufacturing, as well as weak credit conditions. Thus, the Monetary Board believes that the largely supply-side and transient nature of foreseeable price pressures over the policy horizon, the risks to sustained economic activity posed by uneven and tentative growth in domestic demand and the uncertainties in global economic conditions argue for continued caution in the monetary policy stance and maintaining the present interest rate environment to help support non-inflationary economic growth while guarding firmly against price pressures. The Monetary Board believes that the current monetary policy stance is appropriately supportive of the economy's growth objective while maintaining price stability. Against a backdrop of low inflation, the low-interest rate environment will help ensure the appropriate liquidity conditions for the continued strengthening of real sector activity. Monetary Board decisions on the BSP's policy interest rates carefully take into account all relevant factors affecting inflation and output growth, with an eye to achieving the BSP's primary mandate of maintaining price stability consistent with balanced and sustainable economic growth. The Monetary Board is scheduled to meet again on 21 November to reexamine the BSP's monetary policy settings."
Poland,2002-10-23,"Warsaw, 23rd October 2002 INFORMATION AFTER THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL MEETING on 22-23 October 2002 The Monetary Policy Council held a meeting on 22nd and 23rd October 2002. The Council re- viewed the materials prepared by the NBP Management Board and departments as well as in- formation and analytical materials of the Ministry of Finance, banks and research institutes. The Council discussed the situation in the external environment of Polish economy and trends in the real economy, the scope of employee earnings and social benefits, within the public sector fi- nance, within the money supply, credit and interest rates and also the development of inflation and price expectations as well as inflation prospects. The Monetary Policy Council decision A low inflation level is seen to establish in October. Factors containing the inflation growth in the future continue: the current inflation rate and core inflation measures stabilised on a low level, threats to the future inflation from monetary factors remained low: annual growth rate of total money supply has clearly declined, likewise the annual growth rates of notes and coin in circulation; the pace of credits growth is also slow, inflation expectations improved, both of consumer and of bank analysts, a moderate increase in employee earnings  at a high unemployment level  does not threat with an inflation pressure, forecasts for global economy growth, of which in particular for German economy, indicate that a slower economic recovery shall be expected. The picture of macroeconomic situation is not clear. A part of data, primarily on Septem- ber industrial output and retail sales, indicates that a gradual economic recovery should occur. However, the figures on enterprises' investment activity and financial standing after three quarters are not available yet. Under such circumstances it is difficult to make a definite assessment of the scale and durability of recovery in enterprises and of prospects for eco- nomic growth acceleration in the following quarters. Factors that might endanger the inflation stabilisation on a low level and constrain the growth of manufacturing potential have been continuing: uncertainty in respect of outcomes of the National Budget this year and  indirectly  next year remains, high oil prices in global markets as well as the risk of their increase continue, the decline in households deposits at banks became deeper in September, despite a very slow pace of monetary aggregates growth it is very difficult to evaluate what will be the deferred response to already taken decisions on cutting interest rates, which as compared to 2001 are on a drastically lower level. The Monetary Policy Council considered that from the future inflation point of view the inflation pressure constraining factors continue  in the light of current forecasts  to have greater impact than factors threatening the inflation stabilisation and resolved: to reduce the lombard rate from 10.0% to 9.0% per annum; to reduce the rate on bills rediscounting from 8.5% to 7.75% p.a.; the National Bank of Poland is going to run 28-day open market operations at the yield not lower than 7.0% p.a.; the interest rate on time deposits taken from the banks by the NBP stands at 5.0% p.a.; The Council continues to hold a neutral stance in the monetary policy. The Monetary Policy Council has discussed preliminary assumptions of the medium-term monetary policy strategy for the years 2004  2006. The MPC has emphasised that it is necessary to prepare this document within the nearest few months to ensure transparency of the monetary policy as  having regard to delays in the economy responses to decisions on NBP interest rates  it will provide the basis for the monetary policy in 2003 and will affect the monetary situation in the following years. The medium-term monetary policy strategy will be based on the assump- tions of integration with the Economic and Monetary Union agreed with the government, which stipulate that in 2005 Poland shall meet the nominal Maastricht convergence criteria, including the inflation criterion. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Council is to be held on 26-27 November 2002. Economic situation assessment The trend of gradual improvement in the economic situation in industry ob- served since June this year continued in September. The industrial output in September 2002 as compared with the corresponding period of the previous Industrial out- year rose by 6.7%. A relatively high growth partly stems from a longer than put growth in in September 2001 working time. The output is estimated to rise 3.7%, hav- September ing considered seasonal factors (including the working time). A particularly 2002 favourable phenomenon is the maintenance of a much higher growth rate in the manufacturing (output rise of 8.4%, and having taken into account sea- sonal differences a rise by 5.2%). The growth was recorded in 22 out of 29 sections of the industry. Like in previous months the industries of high ex- port shares witnessed the highest output increments. September has not resulted in the improvement in businessmen and con- Lack of busi- sumer sentiment, both in the USA and in the euro area (for example, the nessmen and Michigan University index, leading for the American consumer sentiment, consumer sen- declined in October to 80.4, as against 86.1 still in September, while indices timent im- reflecting the businessmen sentiment: the American NAPM went down in provement in September to 49.5 as against 50.5 in August, and the German IFO fell to the USA and 88.2 as compared with 88.8 in August). Like in previous two months a geo- the euro area political risk remained the main reason for those trends. It is estimated that in Q3, 2002 the economic activity in the USA was sup- ported by the consumer demand, while in the euro area by net exports. The current strong deterioration of businesses sentiment in both regions is likely to slacken the growth of those economies in the fourth quarter of the current year and in Q1, 2003. Main analytical centres adjusted down their GDP growth forecasts for 2002: Decreasing for the euro area on average from about 1.0% to 0.8% (of which for Ger- forecasts for many from 0.6% to 0.4%) and for the USA from 2.5% to 2.4%. economic The growth forecasts for 2003 were also reduced: from 2.4% to 2.0% for the growth in the euro area (for Germany from 2.2% to 1.6%) and for the USA from 3.0% to USA and in the 2.8%. euro area The development of world oil prices remained to be highly uncertain. The increase in political risk made that in September 2002 the upward trend in oil High global oil prices in global markets continued. In the third quarter of 2002 the average prices price of Brent oil stood at USD 27 per barrel, i.e. nearly 2 dollars more than in Q2, 2002. Market analysts estimate that similarly high oil prices are likely to remain also in the fourth quarter of this year. II. Situation in the public finance sector The situation of the National Budget in September this year was less favourable as compared with the previous month. In the month reviewed the Situation of the tax revenue recorded a slow pace of growth connected with relatively low National revenue on indirect taxes, and also with narrowed revenue on personal in- Budget worse come tax. Revenues on indirect taxes are very likely to be much lower in the than in previ- last quarter of the current year than the average revenue achieved in previous ous month, low months. This will result from implemented systemic changes, i.e. the elonga- growth rate of tion of the VAT refunding period by revenue offices, the possibility of quar- tax revenue in terly VAT settlement by small enterprises (shifting part of revenue to 2003). September and the reduction in the excise duty on alcoholic beverages. This creates a threat that the performance of the National Budget revenue in 2002 may be lower than that stipulated in the Budget Act. The origination of deficit in the central government revenue in 2002 will imply a difficult situation on the expenditure side. This may be con- nected with the need to contain part of expenditure this year and to shift it to the next year. The financial standing of other entities in the public finance sector in Economic defi- August and September this year shows that their deficit, consistent with re- cit in the public cent NBP forecasts, will amount to 1.4% of the GDP, i.e. 0.1 pct. point finance sector higher than that predicted by the MoF. higher than According to the NBP forecasts the economic deficit of the public planned in 2002 finance sector will most likely equal 5.8% of the GDB, i.e. 0.3 point above the MoF estimates. This means that in another consecutive year the actual course of the fiscal policy will deviate from that planned at the beginning of the year. III. Money supply, credit, interest rates, exchange rate M3 broad money supply in September this year is 1.6% lower than a year ago. The M3 decline in September as against August 2002 end resulted pri- Households de- marily from a fall (by 2.76bn zloty) in household deposits. On the other hand posits at banks the value of bonds and funds units in households portfolios has been dy- continue to namically increasing, however, in September it did not offset the drop in slacken, house- savings at banks.

The growth rate for cor- rate declines porate deposits remains stable at around 10%. Counterparts to changes in money stocks witness a permanent slowdown of the pace of claims on households increase (from 8.5% in August to 7.8% in September this year), however the quarterly growth figures show a reversal in the downward trend. To the contrary, the growth rate of claims on corpo- rates seen in June and July 2002 was currently retarded. In September this year it amounted to 1.1%, against 2.1% in June and 2.7% in July this year. In September this year the zloty exchange rate slightly appreciated; this trend was most visible against the US dollar, while the zloty against euro exchange Zloty exchange rate has been continuing since July this year on a stable level: on average rate apprecia- 4.07-4.08 PLN/EUR. The weak appreciation trend has been confirmed also tion by real effective exchange rates, in particular the rate adjusted with move- ments in industrial producer prices. IV. Prices, inflation expectations In September this year the year-on-year inflation stabilised on a low level and amounted to 1.3%. In August it equalled 1.2%. A slightly faster pace of Stabilisation of annualised prices growth in September 2002 was driven by a rise in prices of year-on-year fuel for transport vehicles and  occurring after five months of decline  an CPI on a low increase in food and non-alcoholic beverages prices. level In September this year producer prices in industry, as against the correspond- ing period of the previous year, went up by 1.0%. The sections where limited market mechanisms operate: electricity, gas and water supply as well as min- ing and quarrying witness the largest price increases, by 7.0% and 0.6%, respectively. Prices in manufacturing have not changed. The manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products witnessed the high- est year-on-year price rise  by 3.3%. Inflation continuing on a low level is favourable to making low inflation expectation permanent. In October this year inflation expectations both of low inflation consumer and of bank analysts declined, where the drop in inflation expecta- expectations tions refers equally to the inflation rate expected in December 2002 and in a 12-month horizon. The annual inflation rate expected by bank analysts as at the year end was equal to 1.5%, what stood for its drop by 0.3 pct. point as compared with declarations made in September this year, while the expected rate of annual inflation (September 2003) amounted to 2.5%, what meant its decline by 0.4pct. point."
Israel,2002-10-28,"The Bank of Israel's Monetary Program for November 2002. The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for November 2002, according to which the interest ratewill remain unchanged at 9.1 percent. In the last few weeks expectations of inflation for the year ahead as derived from the capital market have risen, and are in excess of the upper limit of the long-term inflation target set by the government; private forecasters' predictions, however, although they rose slightly, are still within the target range. Assessments of inflation derived from the models developed by the Bank of Israel are not unequivocal. In addition, the great uncertainty in the foreign-currency and bond markets indicates the need to follow developments closely so that action canbe taken to prevent a deviation from price stability and damage to financial stability. In the light of uncertainty regarding the approval of the budget for 2003, there has been a continuous rise in the nominal and real yields in the government bond market in the last few weeks: yields on Shahar bonds rose to 11.5 percent, compared with 9.3 percent in July, and the real interest on government bonds rose to 5.8 percent from 5.4 percent in July. These movement express investors' doubts as to the government's commitment to maintaining fiscal discipline. The government's domestic debt was downgraded by one of the international rating agencies, another expression of concern regarding the government's commitment to fiscal discipline in the light of the upward trend in the share in GDP ofthe government debt. Fiscal discipline is a sine qua non forthe reduction of interest on long-term government bonds which affects the government's budget for interest expenses, the extent of investment, and the rate of long-term interest, including mortgage interest. The reduction inlong-term interest is a condition for the future reduction in short-term rates of interest without jeopardizing stability, and is a key for future economic growth and the creation of jobs. Such a policy will help make the economy more robust, is vital to the strengthening of the financial system, and will enable the creation of a firm basis for renewed economic growth when external conditions become more favorable. Despite the local-currency appreciation evident since June, there is extensive uncertainty in the foreign-currency market. This is expressed in the relatively high volatility implicit in the NIS/$ options issued by the Bank of Israel, reflecting exchange-rate risk in the domestic market, as well as in the continued rise in the risk premium ascribed to Israel by international markets, as expressed in the spread on government bonds traded abroad. This spread for a ten-year horizon has risen to 2.2 percentage points, from 1.7 percentage points in July. The rate of interest on government bonds abroad serves as a benchmark for private capital raising, and its rise affects the cost of credit abroad facing the private sector. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the market, in order to bolster financial stabilityand restore the actual inflation rate to the sphere defined as price stability. Subject to these conditions, the Bank will act to support the government's policy to foster employment and shorten the recession. Changes in NIS and dollar interest rates. ISRAEL.

United States,2002-11-06,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 1 1/4 percent. In a related action, the Board of Governors approved a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate to 3/4 percent. The Committee continues to believe that an accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with still-robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing important ongoing support to economic activity. However, incoming economic data have tended to confirm that greater uncertainty, in part attributable to heightened geopolitical risks, is currently inhibiting spending, production, and employment. Inflation and inflation expectations remain well contained. In these circumstances, the Committee believes that today's additional monetary easing should prove helpful as the economy works its way through this current soft spot. With this action, the Committee believes that, against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are balanced with respect to the prospects for both goals in the foreseeable future.

Chile,2002-11-07,"Santiago. November 7, 2002 Press Release At its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at an annual 3% and leave liquidity credit lines unchanged at the levels prevailing since the previous meeting. Data gathered in recent weeks does not basically modify the world growth scenario nor the main commodity prices given in the latest Monetary Policy Report for this year and for next. Moreover, risk of conflicts related to the Middle East situation persist and there is greater caution with respect to the strength of the industrialized world's recovery. Uncertainty in regional financial markets has lessened in recent weeks. On the domestic front, some natural resources sectors are less active than was foreseen and this could mean that output growth in the second half will be less than forecast. Inflation has risen to 3% and could be higher at the beginning of next year. However, underlying inflation remains controlled so the medium-term inflation outlook stays in line with the mid- range target. The Central Bank reiterates its commitment to a flexible use of monetary policy to avoid deviations from the inflationary target."
Euroarea,2002-11-07,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I will report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. We have reviewed monetary, financial and economic developments and updated our assessment in the light of the information available. In view of the high uncertainty on future growth, and its implication for medium-term inflationary developments, the Governing Council has discussed extensively the arguments for and against a cut in the key ECB interest rates. However, the Governing Council will monitor closely the downside risks to economic growth in the euro area. As regards the analysis under the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 was 7.1% in the period from July to September 2002, unchanged from the previous three-month average. The continuing strong expansion of M3 should be interpreted with caution, since it has been boosted considerably by high uncertainty in financial markets over recent months. At the same time, the low level of short-term interest rates continues to stimulate demand for the most liquid assets, which are included in the narrow aggregate M1. Loans to the private sector have stabilised at growth rates somewhat above 5%, a rate of expansion which, in real terms, is broadly in line with the long-term average. Considering all the evidence relating to the first pillar, from a medium-term perspective, more liquidity is available than would be needed to finance sustainable, non-inflationary growth. However, given the current economic environment, we do not see the risk of this translating into inflationary pressure in the near future. Concerning the second pillar, recent short-term conjunctural indicators and survey data suggest that real GDP in the euro area has continued to grow only moderately in the third quarter of this year. This is in contrast to earlier expectations that a more pronounced upswing would occur in the course of this year. Obviously, the hesitant pace of economic expansion and current, lacklustre confidence reflect the significant degree of uncertainty that has been building up over recent months. This uncertainty is associated with geopolitical tensions, the evolution of oil prices and developments in stock markets. However, for the time being, the main scenario for the euro area remains that economic growth is expected to return to rates close to potential in the course of 2003. In fact, this expectation is consistent with all forecasts published by international organisations. Private forecasters, on the whole, also seem to share the same view. Moreover, financial markets have shown signs of stabilisation in recent weeks following a period of considerable turbulence. The expectation of an improvement in economic activity in the euro area is contingent on a recovery of growth in private consumption, supported by a reduction in actual and perceived inflation rates. This expectation is also based on a projected gradual recovery of the world economy and export growth which, together with the low level of interest rates, should help to strengthen investment. Nevertheless, the uncertainty surrounding this scenario remains high. It is therefore very difficult, at this juncture, to predict the timing and strength of the economic upswing, both in the euro area and globally. Turning to recent price developments, in September annual HICP inflation was 2.1%. For October. Eurostat's flash estimate indicates an annual HICP inflation rate of 2.2%. This increase is again likely to reflect developments in energy prices, although no detailed information is available at present. Looking at price developments for the remainder of 2002 and the early part of next year, despite the recent decline in oil prices, some upward impact may occur reflecting base effects and country-specific developments  such as increases in indirect taxes or specific developments in services prices. Although difficult to anticipate, particularly due to the volatility of oil prices, a further increase in the annual rates of inflation around the turn of the year and a delay in the return to inflation rates below 2% cannot be ruled out. Beyond the very short term, we consider that both the euro exchange rate, which has strengthened since early this year, and the overall economic environment are still contributing towards reducing inflationary pressure. Moreover, there should also be a further unwinding of the indirect effects of previous increases in oil prices and other factors that have added to the stickiness of the annual rate of HICP inflation excluding unprocessed food and energy prices. However, for inflation rates to fall below 2% in the course of 2003 and to remain in line with price stability thereafter, as indicated by recent forecasts, it is crucial that oil prices do not increase sharply again and that the upward trend in labour cost indicators observed in recent years does not continue. With regard to the latter, there seems to be notable inertia, despite the subdued economic expansion; therefore, vigilance is warranted. Regarding fiscal policies in the euro area, may I expressly refer you to the Governing Council's statement of Thursday, 24 October on the Stability and Growth Pact. There is a strong consensus within the Governing Council that the principle of budgetary discipline enshrined in the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact are indispensable for Economic and Monetary Union and that the Stability and Growth Pact has been successful in promoting sound public finances and fiscal convergence, as well as in supporting the return to price stability. May I also again urge governments to implement decisively the structural reform agenda, both within the area of fiscal expenditures and revenues and in labour and product markets. Such action is needed to enhance potential output growth over the medium term. At the same time, the prompt implementation of structural reforms would contribute towards strengthening confidence in the euro area and thereby support economic growth in the short term."
South Korea,2002-11-07,"The growth rate of monthly industrial production eased in September due to the damages from typhoons and the reduction in working days caused by Chuseok holidays. Domestic demand, notably in the form of private consumption and construction investment, also slowed down. Exports(on a customs-clearance basis), however, registered double-digit growth in October. Consumer price inflation lowered to 2.8 percent on a year-on-year basis in October as against the 3.1 percent of the previous month as prices of agricultural products shifted to a sharp decline. Core inflation, for its part, rose from 2.9 percent to 3.0 percent largely owing to increases in housing rents and charges for public services. Following the government's steps to curb speculation, housing prices showed a stable downward trend and the increase in household credits narrowed somewhat from that of the previous month. In the external environment, uncertainties have deepened due mainly to the delayed recovery of the advanced economies, particularly in the U.S. Taking the domestic and external environments into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark overnight call rate at around its current level for the inter-meeting period."
Peru,2002-11-08,"BANCO CENTRAL DE RESERVA DEL PERU Press release MONETARY PROGRAM APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF THE BANK FOR NOVEMBER 2002 In October, the daily average balance of the banks' current account was 188 million, within the range announced for that month (180 million to 200 million). The interbank interest rate in domestic currency diminished from 5,6 percent in September to 4,6 percent in October, into a context of decreasing regional financial uncertainty. The Board of the Bank assessed the monetary policy stance for November and established the following: The targeted range for the banks' current account balance held at the Central Bank will be 170 million to 190 million on a daily average basis, considering the greater funds in vault of the previous month. For monetary regulation credits and temporary purchase of CDBCRP and Treasury bonds out of auction, the effective interest rate remains as the weighted average of the interbank interest rates, or 4,75 percent, whichever is highest. For overnight deposits in domestic currency held by banks at the Central Bank, the effective interest rate remains at 3,0 percent. For foreign exchange temporary purchase operations (swap operations), the commission is kept to an implicit effective annual cost of 4,75 percent. The following interest rates will be used in foreign-currency operations: The effective annual rate for monetary regulation credits will be the 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point. For overnight deposits held by banks at the Central Bank, the rate is equivalent to the average obtained by the Central Bank for similar deposits abroad. The previous framework is consistent with the current annual inflation forecast (2,5 percent with a  1 percentage point). If justified by financial conditions, the values mentioned above could be modified in order to ensure the attainment of the objective to preserve monetary stability, which mean avoiding inflationary or deflationary pressures."
Thailand,2002-11-19,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 19 November 2002 (special supplementary session) Mr. Bandid Nijathaworn. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand announced that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today in a special supplementary session to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance going forward. The main issues discussed were as follows: 1. The MPC noted that economic growth in Thailand in the third quarter continued to be robust, as acceleration in private sector activity and exports helped to sustain the pickup in production, consumption and investment. External stability remained strong while internal stability continued to be supported by a low inflation environment. Core inflation fell slightly in October compared to the previous month to 02 percent year-on-year. The MPC assessed that external uncertainties continue to persist which could have important repercussions on the Thai economy. In particular, the US economic recovery was still fragile and the effects of the recent additional monetary stimulus would not be fully felt for some time. Economic conditions in the US would, therefore, continue to impact on the world economy and Thai exports. In addition, a softening of the world economy could impart downward pressure on inflation of Thailand's trading partners, which would, in turn, feed into domestic inflation. With inflation remaining low, the MPC saw room for further easing of monetary policy to safeguard against uncertainties in external economic conditions and support the growth process in 2003. The MPC therefore decided to reduce the 14-day repurchase rate by 025 per cent from 2 per cent per annum to 175 per cent per annum, effective today. Bank of Thailand 19 November 2002."
Philippines,2002-11-20,"The Monetary Board, the policy-making body of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), decided today to leave the BSP's policy interest rates—the overnight borrowing rate and the overnight lending rate—unchanged at 7.0 and 9.25 percent, respectively. Policy rates have been on hold since 15 March 2002. In its discussion on the monetary policy stance, the Monetary Board expressed the view that, given a weaker external environment and with inflation contained, prudence would suggest monetary settings that are supportive of domestic demand. In this regard, the members of the Monetary Board consider the present policy setting to be adequately expansive for the needs of the economy. They particularly noted the indications of a turnaround in credit demand, as shown by the rise in bank lending in September, which suggests that previous reductions in BSP policy interest rates could be already having their intended effect. Given the recognized long lags in monetary policy, the stimulatory impact of past monetary easing may have yet to work itself fully through the system. Maintaining policy rates at their present levels thus allows monetary authorities sufficient time to gain a firmer indication of how recent policy moves all play out. The Monetary Board decision to stay its hand was also formed in part by its view on government debt dynamics. Given the fiscal outlook for the whole of 2002 and for 2003, the Monetary Board noted that forecasts for next year's inflation show that it is likely to settle within the 4.5-5.5 percent target range. Thus the expected budget deficits announced today by the National Government do not warrant a monetary response in the form of higher policy rates. The Monetary Board also emphasized that current monetary decisions must be thought of as part of a dynamic sequence of future policy actions. To this end, less precipitate action now enables policymakers to avoid rate increases at a later point in the policy horizon when the economy is already beginning to pick up steam. Moreover, the recent sizable policy rate reduction by the US Federal Reserve has afforded the BSP with greater room to maneuver and keep its own policy rates on hold. Dynamic and forward-looking monetary policy requires a constant and clear-eyed assessment of changing domestic and global economic conditions. Thus, monetary authorities emphasize that they will continue to closely monitor key developments in the macroeconomic environment. The Monetary Board is scheduled to meet again on 19 December to reexamine the BSP's monetary policy settings."
Israel,2002-11-25,"The Bank of Israel's Monetary Program for December 2002. The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for December 2002, according to which the interest ratewill remain unchanged at 9.1 percent. In recent weeks there has been a slight decline in inflation expectations as derived from the capital market, but their level for all terms is still above the upper limit of the long-term inflation target set by the government (3 percent). At the same time, private forecasters' predictions and assessments of inflation derived from themodels developed by the Bank of Israel are within the range, provided no financial shocks are expected. Nevertheless, the overall picture obtained from the money and bond markets indicates a high level of uncertainty, and itis for caution in implementing monetary policy so as to prevent deviation from price stability and damage to financial stability. The 2003 budget, which was passed atits first reading in the Knesset, now appears to be based on an estimate of tax receipts and an under-estimation of expenditure, which could be expressed in a larger deficit than planned, and an additional increase in the long-term interest rate. In order to prevent this, a substantial revision of the budget will be necessary once the new government is installed. Investors doubts regarding the extent of fiscal discipline, and uncertainty as to the size of the deficit this and next year, were expressed in capital marketyields on Shahar bonds, which returned to a high level of 7.11 percent, after declining to 9.3 percent in July and August. The Bank of Israel stressed that fiscal discipline and the aspiration to attain a declining budget deficit pathand debt/GDP ratio are necessary conditions for the availability of credit, a decline in long-term interest on government bonds, and consequently forthe reduction of interest on investments and mortgages, which are important for the renewal of growth and the stimulation of employment. A decline inlong-term interest could also enable short-term interest to be reduced without harming stability. Correct fiscal policy will contribute to the country's economic robustness, is essential for strengthening its financial system, and will enable the creation of a sound basis for the renewal of growth,once external conditions allow. The Bank of Israel added that despite the local-currency appreciation evident since June, there is still extensive uncertainty in the foreign-currency market. This is expressed in the relatively high volatility implicit in the NIS/$ options issued by the Bank of Israel, reflecting exchange-rate risk in the domestic market (a standard deviation of 8 percent, after 4 percent in 2001). There is also a continuedrise in the risk premium ascribed to Israel by international markets, as expressed in the spread on government bonds traded abroad (compared with theinterest rate paid by the US government). This spread for a ten-year horizon has risen to 2.5 percentage points, from 1.7 percentage points in July. As is the case in Israel, the rate of interest on government bonds abroad serves as a benchmark for private capital raising, and its rise affects the cost of borrowing for the private sector abroad. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the market, in order to bolster financial stabilityand ensure that the actual inflation rate returns to the sphere defined asprice stability. Subject to these conditions, the Bank will act to supportthe government's policy to foster employment and shorten the recession. Note that the risk premium is characterized by volatility whichis sometimes caused by factors related to Israel's economy, by developments in financial markets abroad and by changes in the degree of tradability in those markets. ** The Open Market Committee of the US Federal Reserve is due to convene on 10 November 2002 for its regular review of interest-rate policy.

Poland,2002-11-27,"Warsaw. November 27, 2002 INFORMATION AFTER THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL on November 26-27, 2002 The Monetary Policy Council held its meeting on November 26-27, 2002. The Council was submitted the materials prepared by the Management Board and departments of the NBP as well as information and analytical materials prepared by the Ministry of Finance, banks and research institutes. The Council discussed the external conditions of the Polish economy and tendencies in the real sector of the economy, in the area of wages and social benefits, in public finance sector, in the area of money supply, lending and interest rates, and the formation of inflation expectations, prices and the inflation outlook. Decision of the Monetary Policy Council In October 2002, in the economy dominant were still the developments that supported the strengthening of a low level of inflation: all core inflation measures lowered, inflation expectations of both, individuals and bank analysts, have stabilized at the same low level as a month before, the annualized dynamics of total money supply lowered visibly, the dynamics of cash stabilized, and the annualized dynamics of lending remains at a low level, a moderate wage growth  in conditions of a high level of unemployment  does not threaten in a form of the increased inflation pressure, the growth forecasts of the world economy, including, in particular, the German economy, indicate that the economic boom can be expected only in the 2nd half of 2003, and it will be much slower than forecasted a month ago. The factors that decide on the economic growth  and indirectly on inflation tendencies  in 2003 and 2004 rather confirm the earlier data on a gradual improvement of the economic activity. In the 3rd quarter this year (cid:1)(cid:2)the added value in industry increased, (cid:1)(cid:2)the drop of the volume of construction and assembling production decreased, (cid:1)(cid:2)the data on the improvement of the financial situation of enterprises got confirmed, (cid:1)(cid:2)a high sales dynamics in sections included into market services was maintained. A higher pace of the GDP growth in the 3rd quarter is a positive signal, especially at the background of the worsening economic situation in Germany. In October: (cid:1)(cid:2)the sold industrial output was bigger than in the same month last year by 3.2%, (cid:1)(cid:2)the retail sales dynamics increased, in nominal terms it was higher by 5.1% than in the same month last year. However, there is still uncertainty about the permanence of the boom: The drop of construction output got bigger (from 6.1% to 8.8%). Latest results of the economic situation research made by GUS indicate worsening of the climate in processing industry, construction, and retail sales. Despite the improvement of the financial situation of enterprises, the investments expressed in fixed prices after three quarters were  like in the 1st six months this year  lower by 15.5% than in the same period of 2001 (this drop, however, was related to enterprises that hire more than 50 employees, so in this situation it does not decide on the scale of the investment drop taken into consideration in national accounts). The latest forecasts shift in time again the moment of the economic boom in Germany what results in shifting the period of the accelerated growth of Polish exports into the second half of 2003. Summing up, it should be said that the growth pace of domestic demand within the quarters to come would gradually increase. The process of integration with the EU, especially in 2004 and in the following years, will contribute to the acceleration of the investment growth. There are still factors that can make it difficult to stabilize inflation on a low level: Despite the fact that oil prices on world markets lowered in October, the uncertainty connected with the conflict concerning Iraq makes it necessary to expect their rise again. In October, the third month in a row already, the deposits of households placed at banks dropped, in part as a result of the lower interest rates and the introduction of the tax on interest income. Despite a very low dynamics of monetary aggregates, it is difficult to assess precisely what will be their delayed reaction to the already made decisions on the interest rate cuts that as related to 2001 are at a radically lower level. There is a threat of a bigger than planned in the draft act on the state budget for the year 2003 economic deficit of the public finance sector, mainly as a result of a bigger shortage of this sector units beyond the state budget. The rise of sale prices in industry in 2002 is the evidence of these prices high sensitivity to a change of the exchange rate of the zloty. Together with the improvement of the economic growth dynamics, there should be expected the increased current account deficit of the balance of payments what would depreciate the zloty. In this situation, it cannot be excluded that in the 2nd half of 2003 and in 2004 two factors that increase the inflation pressure will be cumulated: the increase of domestic demand and the drop of the exchange rate of the zloty. 2 That is why, although now there are no serious visible threats to the accomplishment of the inflation target in 2003, the increase of inflation pressure by the end of 2003 and in 2004 cannot be excluded. The Monetary Policy Council acknowledged that, from the point of view of future inflation, factors reducing the inflation pressure have got a bigger impact than factors threatening the inflation stabilization and decided to: cut the lombard rate from 9.0% to 8.75% annualized; cut the rediscount rate from 7.75% to 7.50% annualized; cut the minimum yield on 28-day open market operations to the amount 6.75% annualized; cut the deposit rate (for term deposits placed by banks at the NBP) to the amount 4.75% annualized. The Council maintains its neutral position in monetary policy. * * * The Monetary Policy Council has approved the financial plan of the NBP for the year 2003 and has continued its discussion on a medium-term strategy of monetary policy for the period 2004-2006. The Council has also accepted the Report on Inflation in the 3rd Quarter 2002. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Council will be held on December 17-18, 2002. Evaluation of the economic situation In the 3rd quarter this year, the added value in industry Improvement of economic increased, the drop of the construction and assembling situation in the 3rd quarter production volume decreased, and a high sales dynamics this year in sections included into market services was maintained. The increase of domestic demand resulted from a further decrease of the accumulation drop and still high dynamics of individual consumption as compared to the increase of gross income at disposal of households. Despite a low dynamics of income growth, the dynamics of retail sales volume increased. At the same time, deposits dropped and lending to households grew faster. Both these phenomena at the same time are the Drop of savings rate evidence of a further drop of savings rate. The data prepared by GUS on foreign trade turnover in the 2nd quarter 2002 show that the dynamics of exports accelerated considerably. The volume of Poland's exports in the 2nd quarter 2002 grew at the pace 7.4% despite a slow economic growth in Germany (0.1% of Good foreign trade results GDP in the 2nd quarter 2002) and in the euro zone (0.7% of GDP in the 2nd quarter 2002). On the basis of the information on payments for exports it is assessed that a big growth pace of exports volume has also been maintained in the 3rd quarter what indicates the increase of the demand driven elasticity of the Polish export. It can be assumed that the strengthening of the Polish export reaction to a growth of demand from abroad is of a permanent nature and is a result of the restructuring in exporting enterprises made within the period 2000- 2001. A clear strengthening of political risk worldwide in the 3rd quarter this year resulted in a considerable worsening of consumer confidence indices in major economies. The most visible it was in the USA where the Still poor consumer Conference Board's index measuring confidence of confidence, a little better American consumers dropped in October as compared confidence of entrepreneurs to September this year by over 14 points, therefore at a in the USA and the euro similar scale as after the events of September 11, 2001 zone when this drop amounted to 17 points. The index of German consumers' confidence also declined from the level 5 in September this year to 11 in October. However, there were no big drops of indices reflecting 4 confidence of entrepreneurs. It was, inter alia, affected by such factors as good results in the area of labor efficiency and growth in the U.S. economy in the 3rd quarter, and the stabilization of the situation at stock exchanges. A positive signal for international financial markets was a bigger than expected interest rate cut by FED and the announcement of the President Bush administration about more fiscal steps in order to boost the American economy. A favorable signal for the economic situation climate in the region of accession economies was also the official approval of the date of the European Union enlargement for the next 10 countries. Still, a factor connected with a high level of uncertainty is the formation of oil prices on the world markets. Until the half of October, oil prices have been maintained at a high level of about USD 28. Since the second half of October, however, the prices for that raw material dropped what resulted from the relaxation of a direct threat of the war in the Persian Gulf. Within the price of oil, the so-called war premium has been reduced. The average oil price in October this year Drop of oil prices in amounted to USD 27.6 per barrel, so it was lower by October, in November oil USD 0.8 than in the previous month. prices rose again The price drop was also affected by the information on a further increase of oil production by OPEC member countries, despite the earlier decision on maintaining the existing limits at the unchanged level. However, the oil prices drop did not last long, in November the price rose from the level of USD 22.8 per barrel on November 14 to USD 24.85 per barrel on November 25 this year. II. Situation in public finance sector The accomplishment of the state budget after ten months this year means that there is no threat of exceeding the statutory level of budget deficit. The advanced accomplishment of the annual plan of the State budget deficit in 2002 state budget revenues indicates that it is possible to at the statutory level reach the level of budget revenues that is close to the one planned in the act on the state budget for the year 2002. The financial effects of systemic changes that became effective in the 4th quarter this year, i.e. the 5 decrease by 30% of the excise tax on alcohol products and the quarterly settlements of VAT by small and medium-size enterprises do not result  according to the information from the Ministry of Finance  in an essential decrease of the state budget revenues. It is mainly the result of a very little interest of enterprises in the new system of settlements. The dynamics of the state budget expenses in October this year was high what was, inter alia, related to high costs of the debt service, the increased subsidy for FUS, and transferring the funds for the teachers' salary rises (the accomplishment of the 3rd stage of the education reform). After ten months the state budget expenses were higher by 8.1% than in the same period last year, but the index reflecting their accomplishment as compared to the plan was not much different than the ones reached in the previous years. The outlook for achieving the planned amounts of revenues in 2002 will probably not make it necessary to reduce the budget expenses. Within the recent months, the financial situation of FUS and FP was still unfavorable. These funds will note a big excess of expenses over the revenues that is financed by bank loans. Only the financial situation of the Agricultural Market Agency looks a bit more Economic deficit of public favorable than it resulted from the forecasted finance sector in 2002 accomplishment inserted into the act on the state budget bigger than planned for the year 2003. According to the NBP forecasts, the economic deficit of the whole public finance sector in 2002 will be at the level of about 5.8% of GDP, i.e. by 1 percentage point bigger than planned in the draft act on the state budget. III. Money supply, loans, interest rates, exchange rate In October 2002, the M3 money supply increased by PLN 0.35 billion. This increase would have been bigger if there were not a strong appreciation of the zloty. After eliminating exchange rate differences, the growth of M3 would have amounted to PLN 1.7 billion. The annualized dynamics of money supply has been getting lower since May this year and it is the third month in a Low money supply, drop of row when it is negative. In October it amounted to  deposits placed by 2.5%. households at banks, little However, the annualized dynamics of cash in circulation interest in lending 6 stabilized: it amounted to 14.8% as compared to 14.6% in September and over 18% in previous months. October 2002 was the third consecutive month when a material drop of deposits placed by households was noted  it amounted to over PLN 2 billion (after eliminating exchange rate differences, this drop would be lower by PLN 0.6 billion). The annualized dynamics of deposits of households is accompanied by a strong downward trend, in October it amounted to 5.6%. In October, as compared to September this year, the drop of loans to both, businesses and households, was noted. Annualized dynamics of these categories in October this year amounted to 0.5% and 8.3%, respectively, while in September this year these amounts were 1.2% and 8.4% Appreciation of the As compared to September this year, in October  after exchange rate of the zloty a positive result of the referendum in Ireland  the zloty visibly appreciated against both the dollar by 0.7% and the euro by 0.3%. In November, the appreciation tendency of the zloty was stronger. Within the period November 1-25, the exchange rate of the zloty appreciated by 4.6% and 2.9%, respectively. IV. Prices, inflation expectations In October this year, the 12-month inflation lowered to The annualized consumer the level 1.1% as compared to 1.3% in September this price index at a record low year. The lower annualized growth pace of prices in level 1.1% October this year results from the drop of prices for alcoholic beverages what was related to the decrease of the excise tax on alcohol products and a drop of prices for tobacco products as well. In October, the foodstuffs together with non-alcoholic beverages, alcohol and tobacco products got more expensive by 0.3%, while in September by 0.6% and by 0.6% a year ago. The prices for foodstuffs and condiments dropped within a year by 2%. The annualized index of the sold industrial output prices in October amounted to 1.7%. It was affected by the price rise: in the section production and supply of electric energy, gas and water by 6.9%, in mining and quarrying by 1.0%, and in industrial processing by 0.8%. Therefore, there is still the phenomenon of the 7 biggest increases of output prices in sections with limited market mechanisms. Inflation on a low level supports the enhancement of Low inflation expectations low inflation expectations. In November this year, inflation expectations of both, individuals and bank analysts, stabilized. The 12-month inflation rate expected by bank analysts at the end of this year amounted to 1.5% as a month before, but the expected annualized inflation rate (October 2003) amounted to 2.5%. The mid-year inflation rate forecasted for 2004 amounted to 2.7%. The inflation rate expected by individuals within the year to come amounted to 0.9%, as in October this year."
South Africa,2002-11-28,"Issued by Mr T T. Mboweni. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, after the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee in Pretoria. CPIX inflation, i.e. the increase in the consumer price index for metropolitan and other urban areas excluding mortgage interest cost, accelerated from 5,8 per cent in September 2001 to 12,5 per cent in October 2002 when measured over a period of twelve months. The increase in the quarter-to-quarter CPIX index was even more pronounced from an annualised rate of 3,8 per cent in the second quarter of 2001 to 12,7 per cent in the third quarter of 2002. The acceleration in inflation from within to considerably above the inflation target range of 3 to 6 per cent was at first caused mainly by exogenous factors, such as the depreciation of the rand in the last half of 2001, rising food prices and an increase in oil prices during 2002. However, even if petrol, diesel and food prices are excluded from the CPIX index, the prices of other components rose from a quarter-to-quarter annualised rate of 1,1 per cent in the second quarter of 2001 to 5,8 per cent in the fourth quarter and 11,2 per cent in the third quarter of 2002. In October 2002 the year-on-year increase in the prices of these other components amounted to 9,5 per cent. The continued acceleration in consumer prices was mainly due to steep increases in the prices of services, whereas the rate of increase in the prices of non-food goods started to level off. Although there is still no evidence that consumer price inflation is decreasing, a number of factors indicate that we may be close to the point where inflationary pressures could start to abate, namely:. Inflation in the production prices of goods, which generally precedes changes in consumer price inflation, has slowed down significantly. The quarter-to-quarter rate of increase in the production prices of goods came down from 26,0 per cent in the first quarter of 2002 to 10,4 per cent in the third quarter. This appreciably slower growth in production prices was discernible in both domestically produced and imported goods in the third quarter of 2002. The year-on-year increase in the total production price index amounted to 14,6 per cent in October 2002, which was lower than the 15,4 per cent in the preceding month. A strengthening in the external value of the rand. The exchange rate of the rand showed a meaningful improvement from the beginning of October 2002. After a relatively weak performance during the third quarter of 2002, the rand has recovered most of its losses since the beginning of October. As a result, the weighted exchange rate of the rand on 27 November 2002 was about 22 per cent higher than at the end of last year. A decline in international oil prices. Crude oil prices dropped sharply by almost 12 per cent in dollar terms, and 23 per cent in rand terms, from the beginning of October 2002. This represents a reversal of the distinct upward trend in international oil prices that started towards the end of 2001. Slower growth in bank credit extension to households and business enterprises. The twelve-month growth rate in credit extended by the monetary sector to the private sector declined from a recent high of 15,6 per cent in January 2002 to 9,3 per cent in September 2002. This decline was not only due to a reversal in the leads and lags in foreign payments and receipts that were experienced in the last quarter of 2001, but was also evident in instalment sale and leasing finance, mortgage advances and other loans and advances to households. A deceleration in the pace of growth in the more broadly defined money supply aggregates. The quarter-to-quarter seasonally adjusted and annualised growth rate in M3 fell from 18,2 per cent in the second quarter of 2002 to 8,9 per cent in the third quarter. Moreover, hardly any growth was recorded in M1 and M2 during the third quarter of 2002, but MIA again increased at a high rate. Continued excess production capacity in the economy. The utilisation of production capacity in manufacturing amounted to about 81 per cent in both the second and the third quarter of 2002, which is still way below the level that is normally regarded as a reflection of full production capacity. The real capital outlays by private business enterprises, public corporations and general government also continued to grow rapidly during the first three quarters of 2002. No signs of excess spending in the economy. Although the current account on South Africa's balance of payments changed from a surplus in the second quarter of 2002 to a deficit in the third quarter, this deficit at less than ½ per cent of gross domestic product is small and clearly sustainable at present in view of the strong performance in the external value of the rand. Persistent fiscal discipline applied by the authorities. Further considerable increases in revenue collections from taxes on income and profits as well as from taxes on goods and services made it possible to absorb higher government expenditure and to increase the primary surplus of the government, i.e. the balance on the government's accounts excluding interest payments. The Minister of Finance accordingly indicated in the Medium Term Budget Policy Statement in October 2002 that the national government's deficit before borrowing is expected to amount to only 1,6 per cent of gross domestic product in the current fiscal year. Despite these factors favouring a slowdown in inflation, there are still significant upside risks that could prevent the increase in the CPIX index from moving towards the inflation target. Of these, the high inflationary expectations, recent increases in some administered prices and the faster growth in nominal unit labour cost are probably the most serious. Wage settlements considerably higher than productivity increases could severely hamper the containment of inflation. In addition, high increases in administered prices are clearly not desirable if we are serious about combatting inflation. The public authorities need to place this matter high on their list of priorities. Discipline is necessary if we want to reach the inflation targets. At the same time, business should realise that the advantages of the still lower external value of the rand could quickly be eroded by excessive price increases. Provided that this discipline is applied and that there are no further exogenous shocks, the CPIX inflation should start to move towards the inflation target. This is also confirmed by a number of forecasts of inflation generated by our econometric models. After careful consideration of the recent and expected future economic developments and of the underlying factors that could impact on inflation, the Monetary Policy Committee came to the conclusion that the current level of short-term interest rates is appropriate to bring the rate of inflation within the target range. The Committee therefore decided to keep the repurchase rate of the Bank unchanged at 13,5 per cent per annum."
Euroarea,2002-12-05,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. We continued our in-depth assessment of monetary, financial and economic developments and the discussions we had in early November on the appropriate stance of monetary policy, taking account of the new information. Overall, since our last meeting, the arguments in favour of a cut in the key ECB interest rates have strengthened. The evidence that inflationary pressures are easing has increased, owing in particular to the sluggish economic expansion. Furthermore, downside risks to economic growth have not vanished. As a result, the Governing Council has decided to lower the key ECB interest rates by 50 basis points. At today's meeting, we also reviewed the reference value for monetary growth, which has an important role under the first pillar of the ECB's monetary policy strategy. The Governing Council has decided to leave the current value unchanged at an annual growth rate of 4ï¿½% for the broad aggregate M3. This decision was taken on the grounds that the evidence continues to support the assumptions which have formed the basis of the derivation of the reference value since 1999, namely those relating to trend potential output growth of 2-2ï¿½% per annum and to a trend decline in M3 income velocity of ï¿½-1% per annum in the euro area. We will issue a separate press release this afternoon explaining in greater detail the background to this decision. When comparing current developments with the reference value, it is important to remember that the reference value is a medium-term concept. Short-term movements of M3 do not necessarily have implications for future price developments. Moreover, deviations of M3 from the reference value must be analysed in conjunction with other real and financial indicators in order to understand their implications for price stability. Turning to the most recent data, in the period from August to October 2002 the three-month average of the annual growth rate of M3 was 7.1%, unchanged from the previous three-month average. M3 growth has been influenced considerably by portfolio re-allocations in an environment of general uncertainty and particularly by stress in financial markets. At the same time, it also reflects the low level of interest rates in the euro area which makes the holding of liquid assets relatively attractive. However, in the light of the sluggish economic growth, it is unlikely that this excess liquidity will translate into inflationary pressures in the near future. The recent moderation of the growth in loans to the private sector, particularly to non-financial corporations, supports this assessment. Turning to the second pillar, recent information has strengthened the evidence of a decline in inflationary pressure. The sluggishness of real GDP growth in the euro area was confirmed yesterday by Eurostat's first estimate, which indicates that quarter-on-quarter growth was 0.3% in the third quarter. Recent euro area-wide survey data suggest that overall sentiment in the economy remains lacklustre, with business confidence improving somewhat but consumer confidence falling further. It is expected, therefore, that economic growth will also remain subdued in the coming months. This disappointing picture mainly reflects the persistently high degree of uncertainty. Geopolitical tensions with potential consequences for oil prices, developments in financial markets, the sluggish growth of the world economy and the persistence of global imbalances are all factors that weigh adversely on confidence. These factors also have negative effects on euro area consumption, investment and the labour markets. As it is hard to predict when this uncertainty will start to abate, it must be taken into account in the more medium-term outlook for growth. The subdued economic activity should limit potential upward risks to price stability and help to ease inflationary pressure. First, when looking back, we recognise that inflation has been rather persistent despite the economic slowdown. This persistence has partly reflected a series of transitory developments, such as the indirect effect of previous oil and food price increases and a limited changeover effect. However, structural factors in the labour and product markets have also played a role, as mirrored, in particular, in the upward trend in wage developments observed until recently. Indeed, structural rigidities have impeded an appropriate adjustment of wages and prices. As a result, annual inflation rates have remained above 2% during most of 2002, including November, as has been confirmed by Eurostat's flash estimate, which indicates an annual HICP inflation rate of 2.2%. Second, when looking forward from now until the early part of 2003, although recent developments in oil prices have lowered short-term price pressures, there are still some factors that could keep annual inflation rates above 2% for several months to come. Yet this short-term outlook is related both to base effects and to indirect taxes and administered prices, i.e. to temporary developments. Third, when looking beyond the short term, we consider that both the overall economic environment and the euro exchange rate, which has strengthened since early this year, will contribute further towards reducing inflationary pressure. Moreover, we expect the indirect effects of previous increases in oil prices and other factors to further unwind. Although wage-related risks remain in place, they are judged less likely to materialise as long as the economic environment does not change substantially. The assessment which guided today's monetary policy decision was that, overall, the prospect has strengthened for inflation to fall below 2% in the course of 2003 and to remain in line with price stability thereafter. Our decision should also help to improve the outlook for the euro area economy by providing a counterweight to some of the existing downside risks to economic growth, thereby supporting confidence. The most likely scenario is that economic growth will gradually recover in the course of 2003 towards rates more in line with potential. Falling inflation should support real disposable income and, together with a reduction in the gap between perceived and actual inflation rates, should underpin private consumption. This, and the low level of interest rates, should benefit investment. Let me point out that, with today's decision, the key ECB interest rates have reached a very low level by historical standards. The Governing Council will continue to monitor closely all factors that may affect the prospects for inflation in the euro area. The outlook for the euro area economy will also very much depend on visible progress in other policy areas. Regarding fiscal policies in the euro area. I would like to reiterate that budgetary discipline strengthens the conditions for sustainable growth of GDP and employment. Therefore, sound fiscal positions, as enshrined in the Treaty and further developed in the Stability and Growth Pact, are in the interest of all the Member States. Given the disappointing fiscal developments in some countries and the challenges which have emerged to the EU fiscal framework, we welcome the moves to correct or prevent excessive deficits, i.e. the implementation of excessive deficit procedures in the case of Germany and Portugal and the early warning issued to France. Countries with remaining imbalances are urged to prepare sufficiently ambitious consolidation plans for their forthcoming stability programmes. Emphasis should be placed on a growth-oriented consolidation policy that strengthens the productive forces of the economy. The Governing Council considers the recent Commission communication to be a good starting point for rebuilding confidence in the budgetary framework. As already reflected in the Statement on the Stability and Growth Pact of 24 October 2002, we fully support the Commission's main objective, namely to improve the implementation of the Pact within the existing framework of rules. Finally. I should like to stress again that there is still an urgent need to implement decisively the structural reform agenda. We note with some concern the slow progress in many euro area countries and call on governments to take determined action. The medium-term impact of these reforms on the economic growth potential of the euro area is likely to be substantial. A prompt implementation of structural reforms in the labour, product and financial markets is particularly important at this juncture since it would contribute to strengthening confidence in the euro area, thereby also supporting economic activity in the short term."
Peru,2002-12-06,"BANCO CENTRAL DE RESERVA DEL PERU Press release MONETARY PROGRAM APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF THE BANK FOR DECEMBER 2002 In November, the daily average balance of the banks' current account was 165 million, below the range announced for that month (170 million to 190 million). The lower demand for funds in the current account was explained by the less reserves requirement associated to lower liabilities in domestic currency in the month. The Board of the Bank assessed the monetary policy stance for December and established the following: The targeted range for the banks' current account balance held at the Central Bank will be 180 million to 200 million on a daily average basis, considering the higher liquidity requirements in the last month of the year. For monetary regulation credits and temporary purchase of CDBCRP and Treasury bonds out of auction, the effective interest rate was reduced to level equivalent to the weighted average of the interbank interest rates, or 4,5 percent, whichever is highest. In November, the reference rate for these operations was 4,75 percent. For overnight deposits in domestic currency held by banks at the Central Bank, the effective interest rate remains at 3,0 percent. For foreign exchange temporary purchase operations (swap operations), the commission is reduced to an implicit minimum effective annual cost of 4,5 percent. In November, the implicit minimum effective annual cost was 4,75 percent. The following interest rates will be used in foreign-currency operations: The effective annual rate for monetary regulation credits will be the 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point. For overnight deposits held by banks at the Central Bank, the rate is equivalent to the average obtained by the Central Bank for similar deposits abroad. The previous framework is consistent with the current annual inflation forecast (2,5 percent with a  1 percentage point). If justified by financial conditions, the values mentioned above could be modified in order to ensure the attainment of the objective to preserve monetary stability, which mean avoiding inflationary or deflationary pressures."
Chile,2002-12-10,"Santiago. December 10, 2002 Press Release At its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at an annual 3% and leave liquidity credit lines unchanged at the levels prevailing since the previous meeting. Inflation, albeit with some ups and downs, still remains around the mid-range target thanks to changes in oil price, exchange rate and prices of some perishable goods. Underlying inflation (CPIX) has fallen close to the floor of the range. Inflationary trends are controlled within the target range although they are below previous forecasts. Expectations of inflation have also been revised downwards. There are still threats hovering over the world economy as well as specific threats to various individual countries. At the same time, there are slight indications that domestic private consumption could be stirring, thanks to more favorable loan facilities and a better outlook for the labor market. However, the sluggish performance of some natural resources sectors is expected to continue for a few more quarters. The Central Bank reiterates its commitment to a flexible use of monetary policy to avoid deviations from the inflationary target."
United States,2002-12-10,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate unchanged at 1-1/4 percent. The Committee continues to believe that this accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with still robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing important ongoing support to economic activity. The limited number of incoming economic indicators since the November meeting, taken together, are not inconsistent with the economy working its way through its current soft spot. In these circumstances, the Committee believes that, against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are balanced with respect to the prospects for both goals for the foreseeable future. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were Alan Greenspan. Chairman; William J McDonough. Vice Chairman; Ben S Bernanke. Susan S Bies; Roger W Ferguson. Jr.; Edward M Gramlich; Jerry L Jordan; Donald L Kohn. Robert D McTeer. Jr.; Mark W Olson; Anthony M Santomero, and Gary H Stern."
South Korea,2002-12-12,"After a brief slowdown in September due to the one-off factors of the Chuseok holidays and typhoons, the economy has been maintaining a steady upward trend as evidenced by the significant expansion in industrial production in October and the rapid growth of exports in November. Prices were broadly stable in November and real estate prices also showed signs of calming down, owing to the government's steps to stabilize real estate markets and the seasonal decline of demand. In the financial markets, the scale of the expansion in household lending by banks narrowed markedly compared to that of the previous month. Given the ample market liquidity, however, corporate sector's fund-raising conditions remain favorable. In the external environment, uncertainty still remains over the outbreak of a war between the U.S, and Iraq, but anticipations of a U.S, economic recovery are progressively strengthening thanks to the improved showing of several economic indicators. Taking the domestic and external environments into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark overnight call rate at around its current level for the inter-meeting period."
Thailand,2002-12-12,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 12 December 2002 Mr. Bandid Nijathaworn. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand announced that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance going forward. The main issues discussed were as follows: 1. The MPC reviewed the latest data on economic conditions in Thailand and deemed that economic growth performance in the first 10 months of the year was satisfactory. The recovery had been supported by continued expansion in production, consumer spending, investment, and export. External stability remained strong with international reserves at a high level, the current account in surplus, and foreign debt on a downward trend. The baht remained stable relative to the US dollar, fluctuating in line with market conditions and trends in regional currencies. Internal stability continued to be supported by the low inflation environment with headline inflation rising slightly to 12 percent year-on-year in November, reflecting higher oil and food prices. These increases have yet to feed into core inflation, which remained subdued at 02 percent in November. The MPC expected core inflation to remain within the target range over the next 8 quarters. Overall, the MPC observed that the risks to the Thai economy emanating from external uncertainties have not increased since the previous meeting. The US economy showed signs of improvements on some fronts but uncertainties remained, while world financial markets became more stable. The risk of a war between the US and Iraq persisted and the situation warranted continued close monitoring. 5. Against the background of strengthening economic growth, continued external stability, low inflation, steadily improving economic conditions, and unchanged risks emanating from external factors, the MPC decided to maintain the 14-day repurchase rate 175 per cent per annum. Bank of Thailand 12 December 2002."
Philippines,2002-12-18,"Following its meeting today, the Monetary Board—the policy-making body of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP)—decided to keep the policy rates steady at 7.0 percent for the overnight borrowing rate and 9.25 percent for the overnight lending rate. The BSP's policy rates have been at these levels for the past nine months. Based on its assessment, the Monetary Board believes that the current monetary policy stance is appropriate given generally tame inflation and weakness in domestic demand as well as continued uncertainty in the strength of the world economic recovery. Average inflation for 2002 is expected to be well below the full-year target of 4.5-5.5 percent. However, the Monetary Board recognizes that there are possible risks to inflation due, among other things, to the impact of the El Niño weather disturbance on agricultural output and the ramifications on local oil prices of the ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, the announced cuts in oil production of OPEC members and the protracted general strike in Venezuela. Concerns about the sustainability of the country's fiscal position and its impact on debt dynamics could also have repercussions on inflation expectations. The government, however, has emphasized that fiscal prudence will be a key plank in its pursuit of greater macroeconomic discipline in 2003 and beyond. Possibly offsetting these factors are the absence of demand-side pressures, highlighted by the slowdown in manufacturing activity in the third quarter and the continued spare capacity in manufacturing of about a quarter of total output capacity. The Monetary Board also noted that the current environment of declining market interest rates has led to lower real interest rates in the Philippines over time. Based on the latest data available, the Philippines real lending rate—measured by the difference between the low-end of banks' lending rate and inflation—trended downward to 5.6 percent as of 3 December 2002 from a high of 12.9 percent prior to the easing of policy rates by the BSP in December 2000. At the same time, the country's real lending rate compares favorably with those of other Asian countries. The Philippines' real lending rate together with Singapore's rank as the fifth lowest in a sample of Asian economies, after Japan (2.5 percent). South Korea (3.9 percent). Malaysia (4.4 percent) and Thailand (5.1 percent). By contrast, the real lending rates of Hong Kong. Taiwan. Indonesia and India are higher. A low real interest rate is expected to boost business spending over time and help sustain the robust consumption spending which would contribute toward a sustainable economic recovery. Already, there are some indications of a turnaround in credit demand, as shown by the steady rise in bank lending in September and October, suggesting that previous reductions in BSP policy interest rates could be having their intended effect. Given the long lags in monetary policy, the stimulatory impact of past easing may have yet to work itself fully through the system. Maintaining the BSP's policy rates at their current levels would thus provide monetary authorities sufficient time to gain a firmer handle of how past monetary policy easing moves will play out in the real sector. Dynamic and forward-looking monetary policy requires a constant and careful assessment of evolving domestic and global economic conditions. Thus, the monetary authorities emphasise that they will continue to monitor closely key factors bearing on the overall macroeconomic environment, primarily on inflation as well as on production. The Monetary Board is scheduled to meet again to re-examine the BSP's monetary policy settings on 16 January 2003."
Poland,2002-12-18,"Warsaw. December 18, 2002 INFORMATION AFTER THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL on December 17-18, 2002 The Monetary Policy Council held its meeting on December 17-18, 2002. The Council was submitted the materials prepared by the Management Board and departments of the NBP as well as information and analytical materials prepared by the Ministry of Finance, banks and research institutes. The Council discussed the external conditions of the Polish economy and tendencies in the real sector of the economy, in the area of wages and social benefits, in public finance sector, in the area of money supply, lending and interest rates, and the formation of inflation expectations, prices and the inflation outlook. Decision of the Monetary Policy Council Within the period that passed since last meeting of the Monetary Policy Council there appeared a few data illustrating the development of the economic situation. In November, the 12-month inflation lowered to the level 0.9% from 1.1% in October. The price level in November as compared to October lowered by 0.1% what was mainly affected by the drop of foodstuffs and non-alcoholic beverages prices and the drop of alcoholic beverages prices. It should be emphasized that the mid-year inflation in Poland in October this year calculated according to the methodology used in the European Union (HICP) can be estimated at 2.4% (as compared to 2.0% in the EU). Good results of the Polish foreign trade got confirmed, but as compared to the previous year the turnover dynamics is slower. The latest survey about the economic situation by GUS indicates the climate improvement in processing industry. These data complement the estimate made a month before about a gradual improvement of the economic activity. After the decisions made at the summit in Copenhagen, finishing Poland's negotiations about the European Union accession, it should be expected that integration processes within the EU would support a further economic boom. In November 2002, in the economy there were still observed the phenomena that support the enhancement of a low level of inflation: inflation expectations of individuals and bank analysts are maintained at a low level, a low annualized dynamics of total money supply is maintained, the cash dynamics stabilized, and the annualized lending dynamics is still at a low level, a moderate wage increase does not threaten in a form of the inflation pressure growth. Considering that the effects of the interest rate cuts made so far have not been revealed yet, it is necessary to preserve caution in monetary policy. Moreover, the importance of factors that can impede the stabilization of inflation at a low level has not diminished yet: there is a threat in a form of a bigger economic deficit of public finance sector than it was planned in the draft act on the state budget for the year 2003, there is still observed a drop of deposits placed by households at banks, as a result of a persistent threat of an armed conflict with Iraq and the prolonging strike in Venezuela, oil on the world markets, after price drops in October, gets more expensive again, together with the improvement of the economic growth dynamics, the inflation pressure can appear. Considering the above mentioned conditions, the Monetary Policy Council decided to maintain the basic interest rates of the NBP at the present level and maintain its neutral position in monetary policy. The work on a medium-term strategy of monetary policy has been continued. Moreover, the Council discussed the balance of payments for 3 quarters of 2002. The Council has also adopted a resolution on principles of conducting open market operations shortening the time frame of basic operations from 28 to 14 days. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Council will be held on January 28-29, 2003. Evaluation of the economic situation In November this year, the atmosphere in the American economy visibly improved (the Conference Board's Improvement of the index measuring consumer confidence increased from atmosphere in the the level 79.6 in October to 84.1 in November, while economy of the USA the NAPM index  the purchasing managers index (PMI) increased from 48.5% to 49.2%, respectively). Favorable conditions for investing have been additionally confirmed by: growth trend on the stock market maintained since October, better than expected results in labor efficiency in the U.S. industry in the 3rd quarter this year, and a repeated boost in retail sales in November and December. However, no signs of the situation improvement in the No signs of atmosphere euro zone have been noted. In November, consumer improvement in the euro confidence indices worsened again (the European zone, especially in Commission's index for Germany increased its drop to Germany the level 17 as compared to 11 in October), while the European managers confidence did not change as compared to the results noted in October. In October this year, the drop of industrial output in Germany increased (-1.4% as compared to 0.7% in September). According to market expectations, in December this year, the ECB cut the main refinancing operations rate by 50 basis points to 2.75% - the lowest level in three years. Among the main reasons for this decision there was mentioned the weakening of the economic growth pace and a drop of inflation pressure in the euro zone. Still a factor associated with a high level of uncertainty is the formation of the world oil prices. In November 2002, the average price for Brent oil lowered by USD Repeated increase of oil 3.4 per barrel as compared to October. In the half of prices November, it reached its minimum getting below USD 23 per barrel. In the second half of November, the oil prices rose again. At the beginning of December this year, prices stabilized at a relatively high level of USD 26 per barrel. Despite the ongoing UNO inspection in Iraq, the market participants think that the war in the Persian Gulf is inevitable. A high price level is also affected by: a prolonging strike in Venezuela (this 3 country is the third big oil supplier to the American market), the attack of winter in the USA, and the uncertainty about the relationship between supply and demand that results from speculations related to decisions of the December summit of OPEC countries. The current account deficit in October this year Good foreign trade results amounted to EUR 578 million (USD 562 million) as in October compared to EUR 539 million (USD 534 million) in September this year and EUR 923 million (USD 836 million) in October last year. The trade deficit amounted to EUR 1 billion. Exports evaluated on the basis of the information on payments in EUR increased in October this year as compared to the same month last year by 4.9% and imports lowered by 2.8%. Exports denominated in USD increased by 13.6% and imports increased by 5.3%. Therefore, a big dynamics of foreign trade turnover denominated in USD has been in part achieved as a result of exchange rate changes and the appreciation of the euro against the dollar on the international currency market. Good export results are caused by a change of the geographic structure of Polish exports  less exports to Germany, the main trade partner, have been compensated by more exports to the Central and East European countries and some EU countries. The economic situation survey by GUS indicate that in November 2002 as compared to October this year the Improvement of the evaluations and forecasts for the processing industry economic situation and construction (seasonally adjusted data) improved. climate in processing The evaluations became optimistic and in forecasts a industry and construction considerable improvement of generally optimistic expectations was observed. In case of the processing industry it means a considerable improvement of the expectations related to the climate of the economic situation as compared to the same month of 2001, and in construction  reaching the level noted a year before. In sales, the climate of the economic situation is evaluated as negative, although better than a year before. II. Situation in public finance sector The NBP data on the state budget accomplishment 4 after November this year indicate that the budget deficit will be accomplished at the level planned in the act on the state budget for the year 2002, i.e. PLN 40 Budget deficit in 2002 at a billion (5.4% of GDP). Current forecasts of the state level planned in the act budget revenues are slightly below the level accepted in the act. A revenue shortage will be compensated by the adequate reduction of state budget expenses. The convergence of indices illustrating the accomplishment of the plan of both revenues and expenses of the state budget within a recent couple of months this year indicates that expenses are under control and adjusted to the revenue situation. Available information on funds and agencies do not basically change the picture of the financial situation of these entities as compared to the picture drawn within previous months. According to the NBP forecasts, the economic deficit Economic deficit of the of the whole public finance sector in 2002 will be at public finance sector in the level of approximately 5.8% of GDP and 5.4% of 2002 bigger than planned GDP in 2003. III. Money supply, loans, interest rates, exchange rate According to the interim information from commercial banks in November 2002  as compared to the Drop of money supply; situation as of the end of October this year  the M3 money supply decreased by PLN 3.1 billion. However. Drop of deposits and in fact this drop was smaller by about PLN 1-1.1 loans of households billion and amounted to about PLN 2 billion. This difference is a result of the incomplete taking into account of the resources gathered by banks due to the issue of bonds (about PLN 1-1.1 billion). After the bond issue program is completed, this amount will be finally booked accordingly and it will increase the M3 aggregate. The decrease of deposits placed by households and deposits placed by businesses by PLN 3.6 and 1.0 billion, respectively, contributed to the drop of the M3 aggregate. A considerable drop of deposits of households is a result of the matured one-year placements that were not eligible for the interest 5 income tax and were made in November last year. A Funds from anti-tax considerable part of the deposited funds (about PLN 2 placements shifted from billion) flowed out of banks to investment funds (PLN bank accounts to other 1.4 billion). Treasury bonds (PLN 0.6 billion), and forms of savings approximately PLN 1.3 billion has been placed in bank bonds (of which only PLN 0.3 billion has been reflected in M3). The annualized dynamics of cash stabilizes at the level of approximately 15% (14.9% in November this year). As far as the annualized dynamics of M3 and deposits of households are concerned, their jump growth observed in November this year (from 2.5% to 1.0% and from 5.6% to 1.6%, respectively) is exclusively a result of the statistical effect of a low base. At the same time, the base effect is a reason for a rapid drop of the annualized dynamics of deposits with maturity over 2 years from 156.7% in October this year to 15.6% in November this year. The second month in a row, a drop of loans to households is noted. However, the loans to businesses rose. The annualized dynamics of these categories in November this year amounted to 7.7% and 1.2% respectively, while in October this year it amounted to 8.3% and 0.5%. In November this year, a visible appreciation tendency of the zloty took place. The exchange rate of the Polish Appreciation of the currency appreciated against both the dollar (by 4.6%) exchange rate of the zloty and the euro (by 2.9%). A stronger appreciation of the in November zloty against the dollar resulted from the depreciation of the dollar on the world market. IV.

Israel,2002-12-23,"The Bank of Israel's Monetary Program for January 2003. The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for January 2003, according to which the interest rate will be reduced by 0.2 percentage points to 8.9 percent. In recent weeks there has been a decline in one-year inflation expectations as derived from the capital market,and their level is slightly below the upper limit of the inflation target set by the government (3 percent). Nonetheless, inflation expectations for two years forward and beyond are still above the upper limit of price stability, unlike the situation that prevailed at the beginning of 2002. Privateforecasters' predictions for next year and assessments of inflation derived from the models developed by the Bank of Israel are also within the target range, conditional on the relative calm in the foreign-exchange market prevailing. The actual rate of inflation in the second half of 2002 also stabilized within the target range, albeit with wide fluctuations in the price indices from month to month, in contrast to the acceleration in the rate in the first half of the year. These developments enable a reduction in the interest rate without undermining price stability or financial stability. Nevertheless, the overall picture still indicates a high level of uncertaintyderiving from doubts related to the budget for 2003, political uncertaintyand concern regarding the effect of war against Iraq on the economy. The 2003 budget which was passed by the Knesset is based on an over-estimate of receipts and an under-estimate of expenditure, which is likely to be reflected in a larger-than-planned deficit, a further rise in long-term interest, and a continuation of the undesirable process of a shortening of the debt. In order to prevent these fromoccurring, a substantial revision of the budget will have to be undertakenby the new government after the election. Investors' doubts regarding fiscal discipline, and uncertainty as to the size of the deficit this year and next, were expressed in the capital market by the yields on Shahar bonds, which reached as high as 10.8 percent in December, having declined to 9.3 percent in July and August. Fiscal discipline and the aspirationto attain a declining budget deficit path and debt/GDP ratio are necessaryconditions for the availability of credit and for a decline in long-term interest on government bonds, and hence for the reduction of interest on credit for the investments and mortgages needed for the renewal of growth and the stimulation of employment. The extent to which the cut in the Bank of Israel's short-term interest rate contributes to a decline in long-term interest, renewed growth and higher employment without harming stability, therefore depends to a great extent on fiscal discipline, which is essential also for strengthening the financial system. Despite local-currency appreciation evident since June, there is still great uncertainty in the foreign-currency market. Although exchange-rate volatility declined slightly in November-as is seen from the implicit standard deviation of the NIS/foreign-currency options issued by the Bank of Israel, which measures the risk which the market imputes to the domestic exchange rate-it is still higher than it was in 2001. Although the risk premium ascribed to Israel by international markets-as expressed in the difference between interest on government bonds traded abroad and that on US government bonds-also declined, its level of 2.1 percent for ten years is still high compared with its level of 1.7 percent inJuly. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the market, in order to bolster financial stabilityand ensure that the rate of inflation is maintained within the range of between 1 percent and 3 percent a year defined as price stability, which becomes the effective target from 2003 onwards. Subject to these conditions, the Bank will act to support policy aimed at fostering employment and shortening the recession. Changes in NIS and dollar interest rates. ISRAEL.
