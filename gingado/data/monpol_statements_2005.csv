Peru,2005-01-06,"Press Release MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JANUARY 2005 CENTRAL BANK KEPT REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 3.00% As of December 2004, the cumulative year inflation was 3.48 percent, thus achieving the annual inflation target for the third consecutive year, as the inflation was located inside the target range (2.5 percent with a rank of tolerance of a percentage point up or downward). In turn, the Core inflation was 2.63 percent in the 2004. In December, the Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) diminished 0.01 percent due mainly to the reduction in the price of the food (-0.2 percentage points), fuels (-0.3 percentage points) and telephone rates (-1.9 percentage points). Transitorily between June and November 2004, 12-month inflation was above the upper limit of the target range (3.5 percent) mainly due to supply shocks in food and fuels. In this period, the Central Bank increased in two opportunities the reference interest rate (August and October), passing from 2.5 to 3.0 percent in a preventive way to guarantee the convergence of the inflation toward the goal. The partial reversion of these shocks and the appreciation of the Nuevo Sol have influenced in the convergence of the inflation toward the upper limit of the goal in the 2004, according to the Inflation Report of August. Likewise, the projections of the last report of August with respect to the evolution of the inflation in the 2005, are maintained. That is, it is expected the continuity of the shocks reversion in the 2005, so the inflation will converge toward the target level (2.5 percent). The Board of the Central Bank approved to kept the reference interest rates of the monetary operations: The monetary operations regarding injection and withdrawal of liquidity by means of auctions will be made in order to place the interbank interest rate around the center of the corridor set by the reference interest rates (3.00 percent). For direct repos and monetary regulation credits, the rate is kept at 3.75 percent. For overnight deposits, the rate is maintained at 2.25 percent. In case of the interbank interest rate be higher than 3.75 percent, monetary regulation credits and direct repos will be charged with the market interbank interest rate.For January, the forecasted range for the daily average balance of banks' deposits held at BCRP is 240 - 260 million. This average balance is neither a target nor a monetary policy stance indicator, since it also reflects, among others, seasonal factors as well as liquidity demand changes. The interest rates for Central Bank's operations in dollars are: Monetary regulation credits: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point. Overnight deposits: an interest rate equivalent to the rate for similar BCRP's deposits held abroad. Swaps: the commission is maintained to a level that implies a minimum annual effective cost of 3.75 percent. The chronogram of the 2005 sessions in which the Board will approve the Monthly Monetary Program is the following: February 3th March 3th April 7th May 5th June 2rd July 7th August 4th September 1th October 6th November 3th December 1th The Central Bank will issue its Inflation Report in the following dates: February 4th June 3th September 2th."
Chile,2005-01-11,"The Central Bank of Chile Press Release* 11 January 2005 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided, by unanimous vote, to increase the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points to 2.5% (annual). The information available shows that the main trends identified in recent months have continued: subdued inflation and increasingly dynamic output. With a world economy that continues to be favorable, and markedly expansionary monetary conditions, domestic activity and spending maintain a strong growth rate. Investment and exports continue to grow at high rates, employment and the labor force have consolidated their dynamism, and private expectations are optimistic. Inflationary pressures arising from this scenario of closing output gaps make it necessary to continue with the normalization of the monetary impulse. Beyond the short-run effects of fuel prices volatility, inflation has increased slowly, particularly core measures (that exclude some goods with more volatile prices). Costs, particularly labor costs, have kept their mild increase, which has contributed to keep inflation levels low. This has favored the gradual reduction in the monetary stimulus. The Board reiterates that, in the most likely scenario, it will continue to reduce the marked monetary impulse at a measured pace, in order to maintain annual expected inflation centered around 3% in the usual policy horizon of 12 to 24 months. In case of any discrepancy or difference in interpretation, the Spanish original prevails."
Philippines,2005-01-12,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to keep the BSP's key policy interest rates unchanged at 6.75 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.0 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. The Monetary Board believes that the outlook for inflation and other economic evidence continue to support the argument for keeping present policy settings unchanged. It noted that while current inflation is on the rise, future inflation is likely to be on a downtrend, due mainly to easing conditions in the world oil market. BSP forecasts indicate that this year's average inflation (using the 2000 CPI-based series) will exceed the 4.0-5.0 percent full-year target, with monthly inflation expected to begin its downtrend at the end of the first quarter and reach 5.0 percent by the fourth quarter of the year. Inflation is then seen to stabilize within the target range of 4.0-5.0 percent throughout 2006. The Monetary Board also noted that the expected path of inflation continues to be driven mainly by supply-side pressures, the direct effects of which cannot be addressed appropriately by monetary policy. These pressures, the authorities believe, are best addressed by non-monetary intervention that would facilitate production, timely importation, distribution, and delivery of key commodities. Accordingly, the BSP continues to articulate its support for the efforts of concerned government agencies against supply-side risks to prices. These include, among other things, the intervention measures of the Department of Agriculture to enhance agricultural production and rehabilitate typhoon-damaged areas, which would help ensure adequate food supply and temper food price increases. At the same time, the Monetary Board acknowledges that the growth in domestic demand, as evidenced by the strong growth in consumption spending and merchandise trade, continues to be accompanied by indications of slack in the economy, particularly in terms of unemployment and lending activity. The outlook for economic activity is also partly dampened by evidence of reduced business and consumer optimism (as shown in the latest Business and Consumer Expectations Surveys by the BSP), as well as slower global economic activity. The chief risk to output conditions, therefore, is that of a slower pace of activity, particularly in view of the output effects of recent weather disturbances and natural calamities. On the other hand, the exchange rate is considered to be broadly stable and prevailing interest rate differentials (between the Philippine 91-day T-bill rate and the US 90-day T-bill and 90-day LIBOR rates) comfortable enough not to feed significantly into inflation and inflation expectations. Given such conditions, the Monetary Board concluded that the appropriate course of action would be to leave the present settings for monetary policy unchanged. However, the Monetary Board remains firmly committed to minimizing the unfavorable effects of ongoing supply shocks on inflation and economic growth, and therefore reasserts its continued readiness to act in order to prevent these supply shocks from having second-round effects on the public's inflation expectations and on wage and price-setting behavior. At the same time, the Monetary Board also continues to voice its support for government intervention measures to quell the supply-side risks to prices."
Euroarea,2005-01-13,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I would like to welcome you to the first press conference of 2005 and extend our best wishes to you for the new year. Let me also take this opportunity to say that all our thoughts are with the victims of the recent flood disaster and with their families in the countries concerned and around the world. I will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB, which was also attended by Mr Juncker, in his joint capacity as President of the ECOFIN Council and of the Eurogroup, and Mr Barroso. President of the European Commission. While short-term inflationary pressures persist, they have recently diminished somewhat, mainly due to the decline in oil prices from the peaks seen in October. At the same time, there is currently no significant evidence that underlying domestic inflationary pressures are building up in the euro area. Accordingly, we have left the key ECB interest rates unchanged at their historically low levels. However, upside risks to price stability over the medium term remain, and continued vigilance is of the essence with regard to those risks. I shall now explain our assessment in more detail, turning first to the economic analysis. Eurostat yesterday released a new estimate for real GDP growth in the third quarter. At 0.3% quarter on quarter, it confirmed the previous estimate. While information on the fourth quarter is still incomplete, the latest macroeconomic data and survey evidence, although mixed, appear to suggest ongoing moderate growth. Looking ahead, the conditions remain in place for economic growth to proceed. On the external side, global growth is expected to remain robust. The strength of global demand should help to sustain euro area exports. On the domestic side, investment should be supported by the very favourable financing conditions in the euro area, improved corporate earnings and greater business efficiency as firms continue to restructure. Moreover, private consumption is likely to evolve in line with the development of real disposable income. Consumption would also be supported if uncertainties surrounding the extent and pace of fiscal consolidation and structural reform in the euro area were reduced. Downside risks to the economic outlook stemming from oil price developments have diminished somewhat over recent weeks. As regards exchange rates, we confirm our position, expressed when the euro rose sharply, that such moves are unwelcome and undesirable for economic growth. Turning to prices, annual HICP inflation was 2.3% in December according to Eurostat's flash estimate, up from 2.2% in November. Annual HICP inflation rates of above 2% are likely to persist over the coming months, notwithstanding the recent oil price decline. Looking further ahead, however, the available information indicates that, barring further adverse shocks. HICP inflation will fall below 2% in the course of 2005. Moreover, the latest indicators do not suggest that underlying domestic inflationary pressures are building up in the euro area. Wage increases remain contained, against the background of ongoing moderate economic growth and weak labour markets. In the context of what is a broadly favourable outlook for price developments over the medium term, upside risks to price stability need to be taken into account. Given past oil price rises, there is a continued need to avoid second-round effects in wage and price-setting throughout the economy. Responsibility on the part of social partners remains very important. Moreover, developments in indirect taxes and administered prices require close monitoring. Turning to the monetary analysis, the latest data confirm our previous assessment. Monetary and credit growth strengthened in the second half of 2004, largely as a consequence of the prevailing low level of interest rates. Given the strength of monetary dynamics over the past few years, there remains significantly more liquidity in the euro area than is required to finance non-inflationary growth. Overall, the monetary analysis points to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. At the same time, the combination of high excess liquidity and strong credit growth could in some countries become a source of unsustainable price increases in property markets. To sum up, the economic analysis suggests that underlying domestic inflationary pressures are contained but upside risks to price stability over the medium term need to be monitored closely. In this context, it is crucial that there is no spillover from current short-term developments in consumer price inflation to long-term inflation expectations. Cross-checking with the monetary analysis supports the case for continued vigilance with regard to the materialisation of risks to price stability over the medium term. With regard to both fiscal policies and structural reforms, the governments and institutions of the European Union will have to confront many important challenges in the course of 2005. Foremost among these challenges is the need to strengthen public finances by correcting excessive deficits swiftly and returning to a path of vigorous fiscal consolidation. Moreover, throughout the European Union there is a need to address the considerable challenges that population ageing poses to existing pension and social security systems. There is also a need to now bring the ongoing discussions surrounding the European fiscal framework to a convincing conclusion which builds trust and confidence. The existing fiscal framework enshrined in the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact is a cornerstone of Economic and Monetary Union and thus of central importance for anchoring expectations of fiscal discipline. The Governing Council is convinced that improvements in the implementation of the Pact are possible. At the same time, it reiterates its position that it would be counterproductive to change the Regulations, dilute the 3% deficit limit or weaken the excessive deficit procedure. Turning to structural policies, the forthcoming mid-term review of the Lisbon agenda provides an opportunity to give renewed impetus to structural reform in the euro area, as called for by the recently published Kok Report. We strongly support a reform agenda which focuses on raising employment growth, fostering investment and stimulating innovation and productivity. Progress in this direction will not only enhance the underlying growth potential of the euro area economy over the medium term, but will also help to bolster consumer and business confidence over a shorter horizon."
South Korea,2005-01-13,"The bank of korea. The Bank of Korea. Monetary Policy Decision. The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (3.25%) for the intermeeting period. (An unofficial English translation based on the Korean original of the decision on monetary policy taken by the Monetary Policy Committee on January 13, 2005 is attached). In the real economy, private consumption and facilities investment remain sluggish and construction investment shows a slowdown in its pace of expansion, whereas exports continue to exhibit steady growth. Meanwhile, the current account sustains a surplus, thanks to that on the goods account. Both core inflation and consumer price inflation are maintaining their overall stability, as upward pressure has been subdued reflecting lackluster domestic demand. The medium-term evolution of price movements, however, still calls for caution when considering the uncertainty over the development of oil prices and the possible further upward adjustment of charges for some public goods and services. In the financial markets, overall liquidity conditions are favorable, yet the lending activities of financial institutions including loans to small- and medium-sized enterprises have been persistently constrained by their acute sensitivity to credit risk. Taking the above economic and financial conditions into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (3.25 percent) for the intermeeting period.

Romania,2005-01-17,"In its meeting of 14-15 January 2005, the NBR Board made an overview of the latest macroeconomic developments and their prospects for 2005. Following the slowdown in the rate of increase of consumer prices over the past two months, the 12-month inflation rate plunged to 9.3 percent in December, close to the inflation target for 2004. Against this backdrop, the short-term inflation projection was revised in order to incorporate the effects of the change in some assumptions regarding administered price adjustment, exchange-rate movements and larger disposable income in the wake of the alteration of tax rates. The NBR Board decided to lower the policy rate by half of a percentage point to 16.5 percent considering the step-up in disinflation over the recent months. Thus, in the last 12 months, policy rate was cut by 4.75 percentage points whilst inflation rate dropped by 4.80 percentage points. Moreover, the NBR Board decided to reduce the interest rate on lending facility (Lombard rate) from 30 percent to 25 percent and to leave the interest rate on deposit facility unchanged at 5 percent. The interest paid on ROL-denominated required reserves established by credit institutions is cut from 6 percent to 4 percent and the penalty rate on deficit reserves is down from 45 percent to 37 percent. As the recent developments and the outlook for demand-pull inflation and cost-push inflation reveal the risk of inflationary pressures, the NBR Board decided to maintain a cautious monetary policy stance in order to meet the inflation targets, including those on a longer time horizon, amid the preparations for shifting to inflation targeting."
Thailand,2005-01-19,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 19 January 2005 Ms. Atchana Waiquamdee. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand, announced that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance going forward. The main issues discussed were as follows: 1. Latest data indicated that the Thai economy expanded in the first 11 months at a satisfactory rate, supported by growth in exports, domestic spending, as well as government stimulus measures. Nevertheless the MPC was of the view that consumer spending could be dampened by the tsunami disaster and the resultant decline in tourism receipts, although these negative effects should be offset, to some degree, by greater investment and public spending. With respect to economic stability, headline inflation fell slightly in December as a result of lower oil prices and the appreciation of the Thai baht, but nonetheless remained high at 29 per cent year-on-year. Core inflation remained subdued at 06 per cent year-on-year in December while external stability continued to be strong with the current account expected to register a surplus for 2004 as well as this year. The MPC was of the view that sustained negative real deposit rates may discourage domestic saving and raise household debt. As such, the current low interest rate level should be gradually returned to neutral going forward. Nevertheless the potential impact on the Thai economy from the occurrence of the natural disaster, volatility in currency markets, and continued high oil prices, remained uncertain and the MPC agreed that it was important to wait for a clearer picture to develop. The MPC therefore decided to maintain the 14-day repurchase at 2 per cent per annum."
Nigeria,2005-01-20,"PRESS RELEASE CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO. 42 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE. IN JANUARY, 2005 The Monetary Policy Committee met for two days, 24th and 25th January, 2005, to review the macroeconomic performance in 2004 and the way forward. At the end of the meeting the MPC expressed general satisfaction on the economic achievements recorded in 2004. To sustain the gains of 2004, the Committee agreed to adopt policy measures that would ensure continued price stability and non inflationary growth. Provisional data showed that the real GDP grew by about 55 per cent. This was higher than the 50 per cent target set under the NEEDS programme for 2004. The year- on-year inflation rate was 95 per cent at end-December 2004, representing a significant deceleration from the 238 per cent recorded at end-December 2003. The 12 months moving average inflation, however, moved from 140 per cent at the end of 2003 to 150 per cent at end-2004. The good macroeconomic outturn was due to the effective implementation of an appropriate mix of monetary and fiscal polices. For the first time in almost two decades, the CBN met the target on broad money supply (M2). The M2 rose by 152 per cent at the end of 2004 against the target of 150 percent under the NEEDS. Also, following the prudent fiscal operations of the Federal Government, the fiscal deficit /GDP ratio improved from the target of 30 per cent under NEEDS to about 21 (cash basis). The stock of external reserves for the year ended December 2004 was US$169 billion, compared with the target of US$768 billion. The naira exchange rate was N13285=US$100 at end-December 2004, representing a nominal appreciation of about 30 per cent when compared with the rate of N1370 to US $100 in January 2004. The Committee, however, noted with concern the amount of the proposed budget deficit for 2005, the bulk of which would be financed through the savings from the 2004 windfall crude oil receipts. In order to sustain and improve on the economic gains which were achieved in 2004, the Committee agreed to adopt the following policy measures in addition to the open market operations: ⇒ Withdrawal/re-injection of public sector deposits to address the problem of excess liquidity in the banking system; ⇒ Reduction of the MRR by 200 basis points, in order to reduce the cost of private sector borrowing for productive investment; ⇒ Adoption of two weeks maintenance period for the CRR; and ⇒ Adoption of an exchange rate band of plus/minus 30 per cent, to sustain exchange rate stability, anchor expectations and minimize transaction costs. The Committee also agreed to review the effectiveness or otherwise of the above instruments on quarterly basis. James K Olekah Secretary. Monetary Policy Committee. Central Bank of Nigeria. Abuja."
Hungary,2005-01-24,"1. At its meeting on 24 January 2005, the Monetary Council considered the latest economic and financial developments and decided to reduce the central bank base rate by 50 basis points, from 9.50% to 9.00%, with effect from 25 January 2005. After reviewing macroeconomic data released in recent months, the Monetary Council judged that the favourable inflation trend which emerged towards the end of last year, outperforming even earlier expectations, would be likely to continue over the period ahead. The decline in inflation and nominal wages in 2004 H1 suggests that the risk of inflation expectations remaining persistent at a high level has diminished. Improvement in the outlook for inflation has made a case for a reduction in the Bank's key policy rate. However. Hungary's equilibrium position and the market's attitude to it require maintaining a cautious approach to interest rate policy. Although the investment climate worldwide continues to be favourable, domestic financial markets have recently showed signs of uncertainty, to which the Monetary Council will continue to pay close attention in taking its decisions. The decline in the rate of consumer price inflation continued in December. That also affected core inflation, being crucial in the assessment of longer-term trends. A number of factors which monetary policy controls have contributed to the latest interest rate reduction. This is evidence that last year's predictable interest rate policy and the stable exchange rate have proved successful in reining in price rises caused by the increases in indirect taxes. In the Monetary Council's view, there is a possibility that inflation will return to its level in the period before the tax hikes and, therefore, the Council does not perceive any considerable risk of inflation rising above the 4% and 3.5% inflation targets set for end-2005 ands end-2006 respectively. Last year, the primary focus of the Bank's interest rate policy was to prevent the indirect increases in taxes from causing a lasting rise in inflation. Wage growth in 2004 H1 was slowing steadily. But November's data on private sector wage growth warrants caution. The recent modest increase in wages suggests that the rise in inflation expectations has not been sustained. Consequently, disinflation is expected to continue this year. According to the latest data, the economic upturn has continued. In particular, export and output figures have reinforced the view that corporate business activity picked up towards end-2004. Although household demand rose more slowly in 2004 than in previous years, its growth rate exceeded earlier expectations. The favourable foreign trade data have slightly reduced the risks to external equilibrium; however, the current account deficit is estimated to have amounted to nearly 9 per cent as a proportion of GDP. Reducing Hungary's external imbalance requires lowering the general government deficit substantially. Transitory measures played a major part in the 2004 deficit outcome. At this juncture, therefore, there are few signs of a fiscal consolidation programme which would be consistent with the convergence programme and would satisfy financial markets, rating agencies and Hungary's European partners. The global investment climate continues to be favourable, although it also carries significant risks. However, due to the domestic equilibrium problems, foreign demand for forint-denominated investments has recently been modest, despite international investors' continued robust willingness to take risks. Taking into account the above factors, with the current 50 basis point reduction in the base rate the interest rate spread has come near to a level which will require the Council to take a cautious policy approach in the future, given the risks outlined above. 2. The Minutes of the Council's meeting will be published on 11 February 2005. 3. Inflation in December 2004, at 5.5%, was higher than the MNB's inflation target, which it had set at 3.5±1% in October 2002, consistent with the Government's Medium-Term Economic Policy Programme. This difference was due mainly to the increase in indirect taxes, announced by the Government in mid-2003 and implemented in early 2004. Excluding the effect of indirect tax hikes, inflation would have remained in the target range. Following the announcement of tax increases, the Monetary Council reassessed the inflation target and decided not to counterbalance the direct inflationary impact of the tax measures. The Council's objective with the decision was to prevent higher inflation from feeding through to inflation expectations and to ensure that the increase in prices remain temporary, which it stressed regularly in its communications. Although greater certainty will be provided on the issue in the course of the year, inflation and wage developments as well as surveys of inflation expectations suggest that last year's excess inflation has not led to persistently high inflation expectations. 4. At its meeting, the Council also discussed the conceptual framework for the Quarterly Report on Inflation, to be issued on 21 February."
Israel,2005-01-24,"24.1.2005 The Bank of Israel's Monetary Program for February 2005 The Bank ofIsrael today announced that in the context of its monetary program for February 2005 the interest rate will be reduced by 0.2 of a percentage point, to 3.5 percent. The decision to lower the interest rate is based on the combination of developments in the economy that still make it possible under the current circumstances to cut the interest rate, following the reductionsmade in the last two months, although leaving less and less room to maneuver. The Bank of Israel's policy of maintaining price stability at the lowest possible short-term interest rate, against the background of the economy's financial stability, supports the long term recovery of real activity. The developments underlying the decision to cut the interest rate include assessments regarding continued price stability, the calm and stability in the financial markets, and developments in the labor market. Assessmentsof expected inflation for one and two years ahead as reflected in capital-market data and in the assessments of private forecasters still come within the government's target of price stability, i.e., between 1 percent and 3 percent a year long term, but at this stage they are in the lower part of the range. In the foreign currency market the exchange rate has remained relatively stable for some time, and bid-offer spreads remain low. Israel's country risk premiums, as reflected by the financial markets, have been at a low level for some time and recently Israel's rating outlook has improved too. In this context it is noteworthy that the contraction of the interest-rate differential between the NIS and the dollar has continued without so far being reflected by the exchange rate, which is affected mainly by the conduct of the dollar world wide. At the same time the volatility of the exchange rate on the domestic market is lower than that of the global markets. It is also worth noting that for quite a while the economy has benefited from relatively large long-term-capital inflow. The yield on one-year Treasury bills is currently at a low level of about 4.2 percent after falling from its level in May 2004 of 5.2 percent. The yields on Treasury bills with different maturities, which have also shown a downward trend, indicate that despite the narrowing of the interest-rate differentials between the NIS and the dollar, the capital market expects short-term nominal rates of return to rise to some extent, but in the longer term. The downward trend in yields on government bonds also persists. Thus, the yield on unindexed 10-year government (Shahar) bonds went down from 7.9 percent in May 2004 to its current level of less than 7 percent, and in the same period the real yield on indexed 10-year government (Galil) bonds declined from 4.4 percent to below 4 percent. This continued decline in long-term yields isan indication of the public's confidence in the government's ability to continue to adhere to the long-term budget framework it set, following its success in doing so in 2004. In this context the great importance of the Knesset's approval of the 2005 budget along the lines confirmed by the government must be stressed yet again; this would remove the remaining uncertainty in this area. There has been steady improvement in the unemployment rate, but it is still relativelyhigh. Thus, in the light of the continued improvement in labor productivity, the business-sector wage is not expected to exert inflationary pressure. The backdrop to this is the continued recovery in real activity, which also does not threaten upward pressure on prices in the near future. The risk premium, as measured by the 5-year credit-default-swap (CDS) market went up to about 43 basis points from about 41 basis points a month earlier.</td> c The yield spread between 10-year Shahar bonds and 10-year US government bonds.</td> d The Open Market Committee of the US Federal Reserve is due to convene on February 2 nd 2005 for its regular review of interest-rate policy.

Poland,2005-01-26,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 26th January 2005 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL Held on 25-26 January 2005 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e.: reference rate 6.5% on an annual basis; lombard rate 8.0% on an annual basis; deposit rate 5.0% on an annual basis; rediscount rate 7.0% on an annual basis. The Council maintains its tightening monetary policy bias. In the period since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Council both the business and household confidence indicators in the United States have improved, while the growth of industrial output and a high growth rate of retail sales have been continued. The positive data from the American market contributed to an increase in corporate sentiment in the euro area. The most pronounced improvement was observed in Germany, where the favourable assessments referred both to the present and future situation of the economy. However, the forecasted economic growth in the euro area is currently lower than it was assumed in the November Inflation Report. Expectations of euro-zone inflation have also registered a slight slide in relation to the information presented in the Report. After the price falls observed in November and December 2004, crude oil prices picked up again in the first half of January. Even though oil price forecasts published by some external centres are lower than in the previous month, there persists a high uncertainty in relation to future oil prices. In Poland, the annual growth of industrial output in December 2004 was lower than expected and amounted to 6.4% y/y. The enterprises surveyed by the NBP have signalled a decrease in new orders as well as a possible slide in production dynamics. These data, however, are not consistent with optimistic plans the surveyed enterprises declared for new investments and also with the sustained high level of production capacity utilisation. Thus, it is hard to conclude on the degree to which the short-term signals of a deteriorating economic climate will be reflected in the actual economic situation in the longer run. The labour market has been sending conflicting messages. On the one hand. LFS data for 2004 Q3 point to an improvement of the overall situation in the labour market: the number of working persons in 2004 Q3 was 230 thousand (1.7%) higher than the year before, and the number of unemployed decreased by 194 thousand in the same period. On the other hand. December 2004 brought a stabilisation in the enterprise-sector employment. Moreover, according to the NBP's quarterly business survey, the outlook for corporate-sector employment growth in the coming quarter has deteriorated. The registered unemployment rate rose from 18.7% in November to 19.1% in December 2004, which can be attributed to seasonal factors. ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51. December 2004 saw a continuation of the negative real wage growth in the enterprise sector (-1.1% y/y against -1.7% y/y in the previous month). Inflation expectations, which have been higher since July, still have not translated into wage dynamics (no second-round effects observed). At the same time, the NBP surveyed enterprises have reported moderate plans of pay rises in 2005. Annual inflation in December 2004 stood at 4.4% against 4.5% in November, while net inflation remained unchanged at 2.4%. The higher than the target inflation observed since May 2004 is primarily the result of price increases related to Poland's accession to the European Union and also of the hikes in the prices of oil and other commodities in world markets. Inflation expectations of households, after a climb to 4.3% in December 2004, slid down to 4.1% in January 2005. At the same time, there was a greater than expected decrease in the dynamics of producer prices in industry  down to the level of 5.6% y/y. Since the last meeting of the Council the foreign exchange market has witnessed fluctuations in the zloty exchange rate and the appreciation trend of the Polish currency, observed in the previous months, has been halted. The appreciation which took place in 2004 will be conducive to inflation decrease in 2005. In view of available data it is difficult to assess whether in the next two years there may occur a slight drop in the rate of economic growth in relation to the expectations presented in November Inflation Report. Still, it is expected that in 2005 the contribution of net exports in economic growth will decrease, while the role of investment as a growth factor will increase. The Council upholds its conviction that a sustainable economic growth will hinge on the implementation of reforms which would result primarily in the reduction of expenditures and, in consequence, lead to a decrease in the deficit of the public finance sector and help remove the barriers to employment growth. In the Council's opinion the balance of risks for future inflation has not changed significantly since the previous meeting. Thus the Council maintained its tightening monetary policy bias. The next meeting of the Council will be held on 24-25 of February 2005."
United States,2005-02-02,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 2-1/2 percent. The Committee believes that, even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity. Output appears to be growing at a moderate pace despite the rise in energy prices, and labor market conditions continue to improve gradually. Inflation and longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained. The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters to be roughly equal. With underlying inflation expected to be relatively low, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan. Chairman; Timothy F Geithner. Vice Chairman; Ben S Bernanke; Susan S Bies; Roger W Ferguson. Jr.; Edward M Gramlich; Jack Guynn; Donald L Kohn; Michael H Moskow; Mark W Olson; Anthony M Santomero; and Gary H Stern. In a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 25-basis-point increase in the discount rate to 3-1/2 percent.

Euroarea,2005-02-03,"Ladies and gentlemen, it is our pleasure to welcome you to this press conference. The Vice-President and I will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. All in all, the information which has become available since the last meeting of the Governing Council means that our assessment of price stability over the medium term is unchanged. While short-term HICP inflation rates remain subject to certain volatilities, particularly in relation to oil prices, there is no significant evidence of underlying domestic inflationary pressures building up in the euro area. Accordingly, we have left the key ECB interest rates unchanged at their historically low levels. However, upside risks to price stability over the medium term remain. Continued vigilance is therefore of the essence with regard to those risks. Turning first to the economic analysis, recent data on economic activity, as well as survey information, suggest ongoing moderate growth in the fourth quarter of 2004 and a broadly unchanged situation around the new year. Looking ahead, the conditions remain in place for economic growth to pick up and become more self-sustained in the course of the year. Global growth remains solid, providing a favourable environment for euro area exports. On the domestic side, investment is expected to continue to benefit from very favourable financing conditions, improved earnings and greater business efficiency. Moreover, consumption growth should develop in line with real disposable income growth. High and volatile oil prices and persistent global imbalances pose downside risks to growth. On the domestic side, reducing uncertainties associated with the extent and pace of fiscal and structural reforms would support consumption, as such uncertainties seem to be limiting private sector expectations of future real disposable income growth. As regards exchange rates, we confirm our position, expressed when the euro rose sharply, that such moves are unwelcome and undesirable for economic growth. Turning to consumer prices, annual HICP inflation stood at 2.4% in December, up from 2.2% in November. Data for January are not yet available, but there are indications of a decline from December's inflation rate. Over the coming months, volatility in annual inflation rates is likely to persist, reflecting in particular oil price developments. Looking further ahead, on the basis of the information available so far. HICP inflation is expected to fall below 2% in the course of 2005, provided no further adverse shocks occur. At the current juncture, the evidence does not suggest that stronger underlying domestic inflationary pressures are building up in the euro area. Wage increases have remained contained over recent quarters and, in the context of ongoing moderate economic growth and weak labour markets, this trend should continue in the future. However, several upside risks to price stability need to be taken into account. Concerns relate in particular to future oil price developments and, more generally, to the potential risk of second-round effects in wage and price-setting throughout the economy. In addition, developments in indirect taxes and administered prices need to be monitored closely. Further insight into the outlook for price developments at medium to longer-term horizons is provided by the monetary analysis. The latest monetary data confirm the strengthening of M3 growth observed since mid-2004. This increasingly reflects the stimulative effect of the historically very low level of interest rates in the euro area. As a result of the persistently strong growth in M3 over the past few years, there remains substantially more liquidity in the euro area than is needed to finance non-inflationary economic growth. This could pose risks to price stability over the medium term and warrants vigilance. The very low level of interest rates is also fuelling private sector demand for credit. Growth in loans to non-financial corporations has picked up further in recent months. Moreover, demand for loans for house purchase has continued to be robust, contributing to strong house price dynamics in several euro area countries. The combination of ample liquidity and strong credit growth could, in some parts of the euro area, become a source of unsustainable price increases in property markets. To sum up, the economic analysis suggests that underlying domestic inflationary pressures remain contained. However, medium-term upside risks to price stability persist and need to be monitored closely. It is important that higher inflation in the short term does not become entrenched in long-term inflation expectations and wage and price-setting behaviour. Cross-checking with the monetary analysis supports the case for continued vigilance with regard to the materialisation of risks to price stability over the medium term. With regard to fiscal policies, a thorough assessment of the most recent updates of Member States' stability programmes is under way. It is essential that Member States comply with their commitments under the Stability and Growth Pact in the implementation of 2005 budgets and in the setting of medium-term objectives. Where relevant, this implies a correction of excessive deficits this year and determined progress towards budgetary positions which are close to balance or in surplus. Such measures should prevent a repeat of past outcomes, when insufficient adjustments were made. In light of the need to prepare for population ageing, fiscal strategies should also be part of a comprehensive reform strategy aimed at raising Europe's growth potential. Discussions on the European fiscal framework now need to be brought to a convincing conclusion. With a view to fostering confidence, the Governing Council supports proposals that strengthen the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact, which deals with the surveillance of budgetary positions. As regards the corrective arm of the Pact, the mechanisms in place must remain strong and credible in all respects. It would therefore be counterproductive to change the Regulations, dilute the 3% deficit limit or weaken the excessive deficit procedure. The fiscal framework enshrined in the Treaty on European Union and in the Stability and Growth Pact is a cornerstone of Economic and Monetary Union and thus of central importance for the cohesion of Monetary Union itself. It is important to avoid any doubts about the effectiveness of the surveillance process and the soundness of the fiscal policies of the single currency area in the long run, as such doubts would ultimately lead to higher risk premia and higher real interest rates in the euro area. Regarding structural reforms, the ECOFIN Council has recently endorsed the Annual Report on Structural Reforms 2005, prepared by the Economic Policy Committee. The Governing Council fully supports the ECOFIN Council's conclusion that “particular attention should be given to increasing employment rates, especially in the context of ageing populations, within the continuing need to increase growth by raising both employment and productivity.” To this end, we strongly support the Commission in its determination to promote the renewed Lisbon Strategy and we encourage national governments to show their determination in this regard by implementing structural reforms in Europe. Closing the existing implementation gap is essential in order to reap the benefits of reforms, in terms of both a higher growth potential in the medium term and improved consumer and business confidence in the short run."
Peru,2005-02-03,"Press Release MONETARY PROGRAM FOR FEBRUARY 2005 CENTRAL BANK KEPT REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AL 3.00% In January, the Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) increased 0.10 percent. Thus, the 12-month inflation reached 3.03 percent; lower than in December 2004 (3.48 percent). Core inflation, indicator of the inflationary trend, was 2.14 percent over last 12 months. The projections of the last Inflation Report of August 2004 with respect to the evolution of the inflation in 2005 are maintained. That is, it is expected to continue the reversion of the inflationary shocks that happened in 2004. In this context, the inflation will converge toward the lower section of the target range (1.5 to 2.5 percent) in most of the months of this year. With respect to the determinants of the 2005 inflation, the expectations of the agents are around 2.5 percent, moderate import goods inflation and an expected economic growth of 4.5 percent. The Board of the Central Bank approved to kept the reference interest rates of the monetary operations: The monetary operations regarding injection and withdrawal of liquidity by means of auctions will be made in order to place the interbank interest rate around the center of the corridor set by the reference interest rates (3.00 percent). For direct repos and monetary regulation credits, the rate is kept at 3.75 percent. For overnight deposits, the rate is maintained at 2.25 percent. In case of the interbank interest rate be higher than 3.75 percent, monetary regulation credits and direct repos will be charged with the market interbank interest rate.For February, the forecasted range for the daily average balance of banks' deposits held at BCRP is 220 - 240 million. This average balance is neither a target nor a monetary policy stance indicator, since it also reflects, among others, seasonal factors as well as liquidity demand changes. The interest rates for Central Bank's operations in dollars are: Monetary regulation credits: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point. Overnight deposits: an interest rate equivalent to the rate for similar BCRP's deposits held abroad. Swaps: the commission is maintained to a level that implies a minimum annual effective cost of 3.75 percent. The session in which the Board will approve the following Monthly Monetary Program (March 2005) will be held March 3rd, 2005."
Philippines,2005-02-09,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to keep the BSP's key policy interest rates unchanged at 6.75 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.0 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. During its review of the prevailing macroeconomic and financial conditions, the Monetary Board noted that the outlook for inflation over the policy horizon remains essentially unchanged: while current inflation is fairly high, future inflation is expected to decline. Inflation is expected to decelerate in the first quarter of this year and to settle around 5 percent by the fourth quarter of 2005. The 2005 inflation target of 5.0-6.0 percent is still likely to be exceeded but average inflation in 2006 should fall within the target range of 4.0-5.0 percent. The outlook for inflation reflects the assessment that the uptrend in inflation seen over the past year is largely transitory, attributed exclusively to supply-side factors, namely shocks to food and energy prices. These supply-side pressures, the Monetary Board believes, would be best mitigated by non-monetary policy measures that would facilitate the timely importation, distribution and delivery of key commodities. Equally important, there is yet no evidence of a declining output gap, given the continuing moderate levels of capacity utilization and employment growth, that would otherwise suggest a need for tightening. The expansion in aggregate demand does not appear to be as yet broad-based, being driven primarily by consumption and only partly by net exports and investment spending. On the other hand, the outlook for prices continues to be accompanied by risks from the well-known supply-side pressures from price movements in oil (due to world market conditions) and food items (due to weather phenomena like the El Niño). Although movements in food and energy prices fall under the BSP's exemption clauses for inflation targeting, the risk of demand-side effects from these factors could nevertheless increase in the near term and spill over to inflation and inflation expectations. At the same time, there are countervailing factors to the expected supply-side pressures on inflation. The recent appreciation of the peso relative to the US dollar could help provide a stabilizing influence on import prices. The El Niño dry spell is forecasted to be brief and mild, and thus may not unduly disrupt agricultural output. In sum, therefore, the economic evidence supports keeping present monetary policy settings unchanged, but also suggests a greater need for readiness to undertake swift monetary policy action. Monetary authorities will take appropriate action when the evidence begins to point more strongly to the following conditions: the emergence of demand-side pressures on consumer prices; the emergence of inflationary pressures that are over and above those generated by ongoing supply shocks; and an increased risk of possible exchange market pressures arising from narrowing interest rate differentials which could feed into inflation and inflation expectations. The BSP will therefore continue to monitor carefully all developments that may affect the assessment of risks to inflation and inflation expectations over the policy horizon. Monetary policy will continue to focus on ensuring a gradual disinflation towards a desired low and stable inflation path in the medium term, while remaining supportive of the economy's growth objective."
Chile,2005-02-10,"Central Bank of Chile Press Release* 10 February 2005 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided, by unanimous vote, to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points, to 2.75% (annual). Available information to date shows that output continues to grow strongly, even exceeding in last December the forecasts in the latest Monetary Policy Report. This occurs in a favorable international scenario, with persistently high copper prices, and monetary conditions in Chile that continue to be markedly expansionary. Investment has continued to grow vigorously, employment and the labor force have been increasing at high rates over the past five months, and private expectations look more optimistic. Recent price information, including January's CPI, is in line with the scenario of subdued inflation for this year forecast in the last Monetary Policy Report. Also, the various measures of the present inflation trend have continued to show gradual increases. This, combined with the steady closing of output gaps and the marked monetary stimulus, makes it advisable to increase the monetary policy interest rate. This adjustment is consistent with the strategy of gradual normalization of the monetary impulse; it reduces the risk of sharp adjustments in the future and reflects the good prospects for the domestic economy. The Board considers that this strategy makes it possible, in the most likely scenario, for inflation to evolve around 3% per annum in the normal policy horizon of 12 to 24 months, although the 12-month inflation rate can be expected to be at low levels during part of 2005. In case of any discrepancy or difference in interpretation, the Spanish original prevails."
South Africa,2005-02-10,"The world economic outlook remains positive. Preliminary estimates made by the International Monetary Fund indicate that world economic growth reached nearly 5 per cent in 2004  the highest figure in almost three decades. Moreover, this growth was widespread, with particularly high increases in China and other non-Japan Asian countries, the United States of America and a number of emerging market economies. Economic growth in the Euro area was more moderate at about 2 per cent, but was nevertheless considerably higher than the 0,5 per cent recorded in 2003. Although the IMF forecast indicates some moderation in global economic growth during 2005, it is generally projected to amount to the still high figure of 4 per cent for the year as a whole. These buoyant world economic conditions together with strong domestic demand led to an acceleration in the rate of increase in the real gross domestic product of South Africa from a seasonally adjusted and annualised rate of 3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2003 to 5,6 per cent in the third quarter of 2004. National accounts statistics are not yet available for the fourth quarter of 2004, but production statistics for some sectors seem to indicate that growth was firm. However there are indications of a slowdown in manufacturing sector output growth. Employment in the formal non-agricultural sectors of the economy increased in 2004 after a prolonged period of decline, while domestic inflation remained within the inflation target of 3 to 6 per cent. Since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee the consumer price index for metropolitan and other urban areas excluding the interest cost of mortgage bonds (the CPIX) has fluctuated around the mid-point of the target range. Owing largely to increases in petrol and diesel prices, the twelve-month growth rate of CPIX at first rose from 4,2 per cent in October 2004 to 4,6 per cent in November. The subsequent decline in the running costs of motor vehicles and lower food prices brought the increase in CPIX down to 4,3 per cent in December. The twelve-month rate of increase in the CPIX excluding petrol, diesel and food prices rose slightly from 4,1 per cent in October 2004 to 4,3 per cent in December. Measured from quarter to quarter at seasonally adjusted and annualised rates. CPIX inflation accelerated from 2,7 per cent in the third quarter of 2004 to 5,0 per cent in the fourth quarter. This acceleration in the pace of inflation was mainly due to more rapid increases in the prices of goods and occurred in most of the main goods categories with the exception of new and used vehicles. For the year 2004 as a whole CPIX inflation averaged 4,3 per cent, compared with 6,8 per cent in 2003. The lower inflation was, to a large extent, brought about by continued monetary and fiscal discipline applied by the authorities, an appreciation in the external value of the rand and moderate increases in food prices. These factors had a major impact on the prices of goods, with the result that the rate of increase in the prices of goods averaged only 2,9 per cent in 2004. In contrast, the inflation in service prices included in the CPIX remained stubbornly high at an average of 7,0 per cent. In particular, medical costs and education fees increased at rates well above the upper limit of the inflation target. For the second year in a row production price inflation in South Africa remained low. The average rate of increase in the all-goods domestic price index amounted to 1,7 per cent in 2003 and 0,6 per cent in 2004. This was largely due to the continued strength of the rand in the foreign exchange markets. The effect of the appreciation in the exchange rate of the rand is clearly illustrated by the further decline of 3,9 per cent in the prices of imported goods in 2004. This decline in the cost of imported goods enabled domestic producers to contain price increases. Consequently, the average rate of increase in the prices of domestically produced goods slowed down from 3,9 per cent in 2003 to 2,3 per cent in 2004. The rate of decline in the prices of imported goods moderated markedly in the fourth quarter of 2004, but the rate of increase in the prices of domestically produced goods slowed down. Consequently, the rate of increase in the all-goods production price index declined from a seasonally adjusted and annualised level of 2,3 per cent in the third quarter of 2004 to 0,7 per cent in the fourth quarter. In the last quarter of 2004 the rand appreciated further as the United States dollar weakened against the euro and other currencies. During 2005 to date the nominal effective exchange rate of the rand has eased back slightly as the dollar has steadied but nevertheless remains still stronger than the average for 2004 as a whole. The recent easing in the trade-weighted average value of the rand was accompanied by an increase in the Brent price of oil from about US$ 40 to US$ 45 over the same period. However, the short-term outlook for inflation improved because the petrol price per litre was lowered further by 44 cents in January and 2 cents in February. Over the longer term there are a number of developments which could also lead to a favourable inflation outcome. As indicated in the last MPC statement, the recent improvement in inflationary expectations is of particular significance in this regard owing to the prominent role that these expectations play in the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Inflation expectations which fall within the inflation target signal that CPIX inflation could be maintained within the target range of 3 to 6 per cent in the forecast period. Another important recent development which bodes well for inflation is the marked moderation in salary and wage increases. The rate of increase in nominal remuneration per worker in the formal non-agricultural sectors of the economy moderated from 9,6 per cent in 2002 to 8,7 per cent in 2003 and 6,3 per cent in the year to the third quarter of 2004. Unfortunately, labour productivity growth which averaged 4,5 per cent in 2003, came down to year-on-year figures of 1,1 per cent in the second quarter of 2004 and 1,3 per cent in the third quarter. As a result, the rate of increase in nominal unit labour cost rose from 4,0 per cent in 2003 to 4,9 per cent over the year up to the third quarter of 2004. Other factors that could contribute to the maintenance of low inflation in the next two years include the commitment by the government to fiscal prudence and of the public authorities to low administered price increases, moderation in the increases in food prices and continued low inflation internationally. The International Monetary Fund expects global inflation to remain at about 3,5 per cent in 2005. The major risks to the achievement of the inflation target have not changed to any significant extent since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee. The sustained strong growth in domestic demand as a result of lower interest rates, tax deductions, still relatively high personal disposable income growth, positive wealth effects arising from increases in the prices of real estate, shares, and bonds and the need for expenditure on infrastructural development and the extension of the production capacity of the economy. The continued strength in demand led to an acceleration in the growth rate of the economy to a seasonally adjusted and annualised rate of 5,6 per cent in the third quarter of 2004. Although some indicators point to a slowdown in the rate of economic growth in the fourth quarter, capacity constraints could eventually put pressure on domestic prices. The increase in domestic demand also brought about an increase in the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments due to a sharp rise in the demand for imported goods and services. The rise in imports was partly neutralised by higher exports arising from strong international economic growth and increases in international commodity prices. The deficit on the current account was easily financed by a substantial inflow of portfolio and trade-related capital from the rest of the world, which made it possible to increase the official foreign reserves. The continued increases in money supply in 2004: The growth over twelve months in the broadly defined money supply (M3) amounted to 12,8 per cent in December 2004, which was lower than at the end of the preceding quarter but slightly higher than the 12,3 per cent in December 2003. Quarter-to-quarter seasonally adjusted and annualised growth in M3 rose from 13,0 per cent in the third quarter of 2004 to 17,6 per cent in the fourth quarter. During the course of 2004 there was a reallocation of funds from longer term deposits to short-term deposits. Increase s in these deposits usually reflect a rise in the transaction demand for money. The strong demand for bank credit in 2004: The twelve-month growth rate in the total loans and advances of banks rose from 12,5 per cent in December 2003 to 16,3 per cent in December 2004. The quarterly growth in total loans and advances increased from a seasonally adjusted and annualised rate of 12,5 per cent in the third quarter of 2004 to 27,2 per cent in the fourth quarter. Asset-backed credit was largely responsible for this acceleration. The demand for these kind of loans measured over a period of twelve months increased from 16,3 per cent in December 2003 to 22,8 per cent in December 2004. In contrast, the twelve-month growth rate of overdrafts, outstanding balances on credit cards and general advances slowed down over the same period, but these loans picked up somewhat in the fourth quarter of 2004. The likely impact of external developments: in particular, the timing, manner and speed of the processes of adjustment to existing global imbalances. How far these adjustments will run in the months ahead remains unclear. The monetary policy stance in South Africa will continue to focus on maintaining inflation within the inflation target range, and will weigh amongst others the impact of these adjustments on the rand, the impact of such movements on the medium term outlook for inflation, and the need for South Africa to have a competitive and stable exchange rate. The recent favourable developments have improved our inflation forecasts and have led to a downward revision of inflationary pressures over the forecast period up to the end of 2006. According to our central forecast. CPIX inflation could rise moderately during 2005 to a little above the midpoint of the range and then ease somewhat during the rest of the forecast period. The Monetary Policy Committee deliberated extensively on the appropriate policy stance at this particular point in time. Given the presence of so many uncertainties and given the balance of risks, the MPC decided to maintain the current stance and keep the repo rate unchanged at 7,5 per cent per annum. The MPC will continue to monitor developments in the economy and the factors affecting inflation very closely and will stand ready to adjust the stance in either direction if necessary depending on the outlook for inflation."
Romania,2005-02-14,"The National Bank of Romania Board decided:. The NBR Board has reiterated the 7 percent inflation target for 2005, as established together with the Government of Romania. In its meeting of 10 February 2005, the NBR Board looked at the recent developments in real economy as well as in financial and monetary sectors, and at their prospects for 2005. The discussions focused on the economic policy mix set by the Government together with the National Bank of Romania and agreed upon by the IMF. Economic growth, which has been backed by sustained expansion in all components of domestic demand, is estimated at about 8 percent for 2004 and at over 5 percent for 2005. Disinflation stayed close to the projected path, so that the annual inflation rate dropped to 9.3 percent in December 2004. Disinflation continued in January 2005, with the 12-month inflation rate falling below 9 percent. Monetary developments have painted a bright picture as well. At the start of 2005, broad money was 28 percent higher year on year in real terms, pointing to a strong remonetisation of the economy, owing mainly to the rise in ROL-denominated savings, against the background of clear disinflation. Lending continued to expand, yet at a moderate pace, which is sustainable in the long run. Analysis of lending components further shows some risky trends that may lead to imbalances. Thus, in 2004, non-government credit advanced by 26 percent in real terms. Nevertheless, foreign exchange credit in euro terms surged by 57 percent, which has given an additional boost to imports and may pose prudential risks to banks and their clients. Romania's main macroeconomic challenge is that the current output fails to accommodate the significant increase in domestic demand. Consequently, the current account deficit ran at almost 7.7 percent of GDP in 2004, according to the revised methodology, compared with 6.7 percent of GDP according to the former methodology. Although the deficit was financed via autonomous capital inflows and the foreign exchange reserves of the NBR increased considerably in 2004 and January 2005, reaching 5 months of imports, a cautious economic policy stance requires measures to allow the simultaneous fulfilment of three goals, i.e. sustainable, long-term economic growth, keeping the current account deficit within manageable limits, and further disinflation in 2005 and the years to come, when inflation rate is set to fall to 2-3 percent, in line with EU requirements. To this end, the Government together with the NBR decided to adopt a package of fiscal, monetary and structural measures aimed at accomplishing the ambitious, yet feasible, goals set for 2005. In particular, the significant fiscal adjustment, which is to materialise in the further contraction of the consolidated general government deficit to 0.4-0.5 percent of GDP in 2005 from 1.2 percent of GDP in 2004, is meant to curb the worsening trend in the current account, to foster disinflation further, and to keep in place the easing trend of monetary policy (especially the interest rate should adjust to the new monetary and foreign exchange conditions in Romania). The monetary policy to be pursued by the NBR in 2005 will be subordinated to the achievement of the main goal, i.e. bringing the annual inflation rate down to 7 percent in December 2005 versus December 2004. The assumptions underlying the economic policy mix, the envisaged adjustment of administered prices and the exchange rate trends confirm that this goal may be fulfilled, despite possible monthly variations in the consumer price index. Romania's current and prospective foreign exchange and financial conditions are supportive of disinflation. The surplus in the foreign exchange market entails maintenance of the strengthening trend of the domestic currency, which contributes directly to the alleviation of inflationary pressures and indirectly to the restructuring of the economy and the reduction of domestic production costs, against the backdrop of heightened external competition. The current intricate macroeconomic environment allowed the NBR Board to cut the policy rate by 0.75 percentage points to 15.75 percent. In order to alleviate the pace of growth of foreign exchange credit due to higher foreign liabilities of banks, their foreign-exchange-denominated liabilities with maturities longer than 2 years shall also be subject to the 30 percent reserve ratio starting 24 February 2005. The interest rate on USD-denominated required reserves was raised to 0.80 percent from 0.75 percent effective 24 January 2005, in line with the developments in money market rates. These measures confirm both the National Bank of Romania's cautious monetary policy stance and the recalibration of its instruments to reflect money and credit market conditions."

Poland,2005-02-25,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 25 February 2005 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL Held on 24-25 February 2005 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e.: reference rate 6.5% on an annual basis; lombard rate 8.0% on an annual basis; deposit rate 5.0% on an annual basis; rediscount rate 7.0% on an annual basis. The Council adopted an easing monetary policy bias. In the period since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Council no significant changes were observed in the external environment of the Polish economy. Similarly to the previous month, the assessments of the economic climate both on the part of consumers and euro-area enterprises remained at a moderate level. In the United States, there was a continuation in the high dynamics in retail sales as well as positive sentiment among consumers and enterprises alike. Preliminary data on GDP growth in 2004 Q4 in the euro area and United States were slightly lower than expected. Crude oil prices in world markets persist at a high level. On the basis of preliminary figures of GDP in 2004 it can be assumed that the economic growth rate in Poland in 2004 Q4 decreased as compared to the previous quarters and stood at slightly above 4% (y/y). Preliminary estimates indicate that private consumption dynamics in 2004 Q4 was lower than in 2004 Q3. In the same period the dynamics of real wages in the economy rose from 0.7% to 1.1% y/y. Full assessment of the consumption and savings dynamics will only be possible after the publication of the data for 2004 Q4. In line with expectations the dynamics of fixed capital formation increased. It can be assessed that a step-up in investments in 2004 Q4 was accompanied by a drop in net exports and that their contribution to the annual GDP growth rate in Q4 was negative. GUS business tendency survey  in seasonally adjusted terms  points to the continuation in February of a positive assessment of the economic climate in manufacturing and a considerable improvement in sentiment in retail trade. Also, the assessment of the condition in construction is still favourable; the construction and assembly output grew for another month in a row. The January analysis of other economic climate indicators monitored by the NBP reveals that the economic situation is positively assessed, whereas for several months most of the indicators have been signalling the tendency to a gradual deceleration in the pace of the recovery. Available data suggest a gradual improvement of the situation in the labour market. Due to seasonal factors, in January the registered unemployment rate rose to 19.5%, however, in relation to the corresponding period of the previous year it dropped by over 1 percentage point. January marked a significant rise in the employment in the enterprise sector (of 1.4% m/m and 1.2% y/y). These data support with some delay the trend of rising employment in industry and services visible in Labour Force Surveys since 2003. Such a significant rise in employment in January may in part result from the fact that employment in many small companies crossed the threshold of 9 people and consequently these companies were considered in the examined pool of enterprises. This is reflected in a sizeable employment growth in sections with a large share of small companies e.g. in trade and repairs (4.2%), hotels and restaurants (8.3%). No indications have been observed that would point at the emergence of wage pressure in the enterprise sector arising from higher inflation expectations (second-round effects). In 2004 Q4 the growth rate of nominal wage in the enterprise sector fell down to 2.7% y/y (from 3.8% y/y in 2004 Q3), while in the economy as a whole the nominal wage dynamics increased to 5.6% (compared with 5.1% in the previous quarter). In January the growth rate in nominal wages in the enterprise sector was still low and amounted to 2.6% y/y. In January 2005 inflation decreased to 4.0% y/y but remained above the inflation target (2.5%), although its level was lower than anticipated. The January decrease in inflation mainly resulted from lower dynamics of food and fuel prices. It is estimated that net inflation remained at a level close to that in December (when it stood at 2.4% y/y). February saw a decline in inflation expectations of households (to 3.9% from 4.1% in January 2005). At the same time, there was a fall in the dynamics of producer prices in industry (from 5.6% y/y in December 2004 to 4.4% y/y in January 2005.). #NAME? Strong zloty appreciation reduces inflation. However, the appreciation tendency may, at the same time, contribute to the weakening in the economic growth. According to the inflation projection presented in the Inflation Report due to be published on 28 February 2005, the GDP growth rate in 2005 is expected to reach 4.0%-4.5%, and thus to be slightly lower than forecast in the November Report, mainly as a result of the currently expected lower contribution of net exports to GDP growth. Starting from 2005 the impact of investments as an economic growth factor will be rising. In 2006-2007 acceleration in the GDP dynamics to 4.5%- 5.5% is expected, provided that the expected increase in investments does occur. The Council maintains its conviction that the sustainability of the economic growth will hinge upon implementation of reforms that would result in decreasing state expenditure and, consequently, lead to a reduction in public finance sector deficit, and which would remove barriers to employment growth. According to the February inflation projection the price growth rate should be lower than that expected in the November Report. Assuming unchanged interest rates inflation will with a 50- percent probability stay in the range of 1.2%-4.0% in 2005 Q4 (2.5%-5.2% in the previous projection), 0.4%-4.2% in 2006 Q4 (1.3%-4.8% in the previous projection) and 0.5%-4.6% in 2007 Q4. In the Council's assessment for the past several months there has been a change in the balance of risks for future inflation, which resulted in a situation that the current balance may be more favourable than that presented in the February projection. This is because, the hitherto scale of zloty appreciation was larger than what was accounted for in the projection and the dynamics of food prices may be declining faster than assumed. Still, the Council acknowledges the uncertainty related to inter alia the developments in oil prices and the zloty exchange rate. Considering the above the Council adopted an easing monetary policy bias. The next meeting of the Council will be held on 29-30 of March 2005."
Malaysia,2005-02-28,"The growth prospects for Malaysia will remain favourable in 2005, with growth being well supported by both domestic and external demand. Domestic demand would be sustained by the private sector as the public sector consolidates its fiscal position. Consumer spending is expected to remain robust and private investment is expected to be sustained as companies upgrade and expand capacity to meet growing demand. On the external side, the global economy is expected to show continued growth in 2005, despite some moderation in that growth rate. Consequently, external demand would continue to support the growth of the Malaysian economy. The inflation rate is expected to edge up in the first half of 2005 because of changes in administered prices, one-off increases in taxes on tobacco and alcoholic products, and possibly some pass-through from the external sector. These factors are likely to have a transitory effect and inflation is expected to moderate and remain manageable for the rest of the year. Mitigating factors that would prevent inflationary pressures from building up include growing productivity and capacity expansion, as well as a lack of significant general demand pressures. Therefore, monetary policy will continue to play a supportive role in ensuring that the Malaysian economy continues to grow at close to its potential. The overnight policy rate (OPR) will remain unchanged at its current level of 2.70%. Bank Negara Malaysia 28 February 2005."
Thailand,2005-03-02,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 2 March 2005 Ms. Atchana Waiquamdee. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand, announced that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance going forward. The main issues discussed were as follows: 1. Latest data indicated that economic growth in Thailand moderated in December 2004 and January 2005 in response to the negative impacts from the tsunami and drought, while export growth also pointed towards a softer trend. Despite greater risks to growth, the MPC still expected overall growth for the year to be close to that previously forecasted, with private and public investment likely to play a key role in driving the growth process going forward. With respect to economic stability, headline inflation accelerated month-on-month in February on a seasonally adjusted basis, driven by higher world oil prices and an upward adjustment in domestic diesel prices. Core inflation also rose slightly on the same basis. On the external front, although the current account registered a deficit in January as imports picked up significantly and tourism receipts declined, the MPC expected the lapse into deficit to be temporary. The MPC deemed that upward price pressures were likely to build up going forward as production costs had increased considerably in the recent period. Moreover with growth remaining firm, higher oil prices were more likely to feed into higher inflation. At the same time, the negative fallout from the tsunami had not been more severe than anticipated in the previous meeting. In this light, the MPC agreed that economic stability and sustained growth in the long term would be strengthened by an upward adjustment of interest rates. The MPC therefore decided to raise the 14-day repurchase from 2 per cent per annum to 225 per cent per annum effective immediately."
Euroarea,2005-03-03,"Ladies and gentlemen, it is our pleasure to welcome you to this press conference. The Vice-President and I will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB, which was also attended by Prime Minister Juncker and Commissioner Almunia. On the whole, we continue to see no significant evidence of underlying domestic inflationary pressures building up in the euro area. Accordingly, we have left the key ECB interest rates unchanged. These interest rates are at historically low levels and are making an important contribution to the economic recovery. At the same time, upside risks to price stability over the medium term exist. These require continued vigilance on the part of the Governing Council. I shall now explain our assessment in more detail, turning first to the economic analysis. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, real GDP in the euro area grew at a quarter-on-quarter rate of 0.2% in the fourth quarter of 2004. In addition, third-quarter real GDP growth was revised down to 0.2%. This overall outcome for the second half of last year was disappointing. However, the composition of demand growth in the fourth quarter also offered some positive signs with regard to the underlying trend. The strengthening of domestic demand and, in particular, consumption may point to the recovery in economic activity in the euro area regaining some momentum. There are a number of reasons why the weaker real GDP growth in the second half of 2004 could be a transitory phenomenon. On the external side, growth in the world economy remains strong, supporting euro area exports. On the domestic side, investment is expected to continue to benefit from very favourable financing conditions, robust earnings and greater business efficiency. Consumption growth should benefit from anticipated developments in real disposable income. Accordingly, we expect continued economic growth in 2005 and 2006. This assessment is also reflected in the new ECB staff projections, which will be published today. Euro area real GDP growth is projected by the ECB's staff to be, on average, between 1.2% and 2.0% in 2005 and between 1.6% and 2.6% in 2006. These projections are lower than those published in December 2004, reflecting the weaker economic developments in late 2004. Available forecasts from international and private sector organisations convey a broadly similar outlook. The picture emerging from the projections contains a number of risks. On the external side, high and volatile oil prices and persistent global imbalances pose downside risks to growth. As regards exchange rates, we confirm our position  expressed when the euro rose sharply  that such moves are unwelcome and undesirable for economic growth. On the domestic side, there are uncertainties surrounding the evolution of consumption, while the very favourable financing conditions and the recovery in corporate earnings could lead to higher investment growth than currently projected. Turning to consumer prices, annual HICP inflation declined quite substantially in January 2005, falling to 1.9% from 2.4% in December 2004. This was largely a result of base effects from developments in indirect taxes and administered prices in some countries. In February, according to Eurostat´s flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 2.0%. In the coming months, annual inflation rates are likely to fluctuate around 2%. Looking further ahead, there is no evidence that stronger underlying domestic inflationary pressures are building up in the euro area. In the context of moderate economic growth, this trend should continue. Average annual HICP inflation is projected by the staff to lie between 1.6% and 2.2% in 2005 and between 1.0% and 2.2% in 2006. These projections are broadly unchanged from the Eurosystem staff projections published in December 2004 and consistent with forecasts recently released by international and private sector organisations. Several upside risks to these projections need to be taken into account, notably future oil price developments. Developments in indirect taxes and administered prices may also again surprise on the upside. Furthermore, continued vigilance is required regarding the potential risk of past price increases leading to second-round effects in wage and price-setting throughout the economy. In this respect, developments in longer-term inflation expectations need to be monitored closely. Further insight into the outlook for price developments at medium to longer-term horizons is provided by the monetary analysis. The latest monetary data confirm the strengthening of M3 growth observed since mid-2004. This increasingly reflects the stimulative effect of the historically very low level of interest rates in the euro area. As a result of the persistently strong growth in M3 over the past few years, substantially more liquidity in the euro area exists than is needed to finance non-inflationary economic growth. This could pose risks to price stability over the medium term and warrants vigilance. The exceptionally low level of real interest rates is also further stimulating private sector demand for credit. Growth in loans to non-financial corporations has continued to pick up in recent months. Moreover, demand for loans for house purchase has continued to be robust, contributing to strong house price dynamics in some regions of the euro area. To sum up, the economic analysis confirms that underlying domestic inflationary pressures remain contained, while medium-term upside risks to price stability exist and will be monitored closely. Cross-checking with the monetary analysis supports the case for continued vigilance with regard to the materialisation of risks to price stability over the medium term. Turning to fiscal policies, the Governing Council notes that, while some progress with fiscal consolidation and the correction of excessive deficits is envisaged in euro area countries' updated stability programmes, further consolidation in a number of countries is needed. In particular, several countries do not plan to pursue an appropriately ambitious adjustment path and are not targeting close-to-balance or in-surplus budgetary positions by the end of the programme horizon. In addition, in some cases, fiscal targets are based on rather favourable growth assumptions and on insufficiently specified measures. With respect to the Stability and Growth Pact, discussions now need to be brought to a convincing conclusion with an outcome that safeguards fiscal discipline. The credibility of the excessive deficit procedure needs to be fully preserved. This is not only fundamental for macroeconomic stability and cohesion in the euro area but also for confidence and growth prospects in all Member States. In this regard, the Governing Council welcomes the decision by the ECOFIN Council, based on a recommendation by the European Commission, to move, for the first time, to the next procedural step in the excessive deficit procedure and to give notice, in accordance with Treaty Article 104, to Greece. The Governing Council also takes the view that the extension of the deadline, from 2005 to 2006, for correcting the excessive deficit pushes the room for interpretation of the rules and procedures to the limit. It is now indispensable for Greece to take effective action to correct its severe fiscal imbalances. As regards structural developments, the euro area has seen relatively low trend productivity growth since the mid-1990s. An analysis of the determinants of productivity shows that lower productivity growth in the euro area has been partly related to higher employment due to greater participation of lower-skilled labour. Sustained wage moderation and some progress in labour market reforms aimed at increasing labour market participation appear to have partially shifted production towards a more intensive use of labour. There are also indications that the slower pace of productivity growth observed in the euro area since the mid-1990s reflects an insufficient use of new productivity-enhancing technologies. While productivity growth has increased in sectors that produce information and communication technologies or provide related services, it has declined in many other areas of the economy. This points to structural rigidities in the euro area that prevent or hinder the fast and effective dissemination of new technologies and improved production processes across the economy. Against this background, structural reforms that stimulate innovation, investment and productivity, and promote the use of new productivity-enhancing technologies are crucial. Stimulating product market competition, facilitating restructuring and improving human capital through adequate educational systems and “on-the-job” training are likely to speed up productivity gains from the use of new technologies."
Peru,2005-03-03,"Press Release MONETARY PROGRAM FOR MARCH 2005 CENTRAL BANK KEPT REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 3.00% In February, the Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) diminished 0.23 percent. Thus, the 12-month inflation reached 1.7 percent; lower than in January (3.0 percent). This evolution continues reflecting the reversion of the inflationary effect of the supply shocks that affected the economy in 2004. Core inflation, indicator of the inflationary trend, was 1.4 percent over last 12 months. For the remainder of the year 2005 the forecasts of the Inflation Report of January 2005 are maintained. Thus, it would continue the partial reversion of the inflationary supply shocks that affected the economy last year. The 12-month inflation would converge toward the lower section of the target range (1.5 to 2.5 percent) in most of months of this year. With respect to the determinants of the 2005 inflation, it remains the inflation expectations of the agents around 2.5 percent, moderate import goods inflation and an expected economic growth of 4.5 percent. The Board of the Central Bank approved to keep the reference interest rates of the monetary operations: The monetary operations of injection and withdrawal of liquidity by means of auctions will be oriented to place the interbank interest rate around the center of the corridor set by the reference interest rates (3.00 percent). For direct repos and monetary regulation credits, the rate is kept at 3.75 percent. For overnight deposits, the rate is maintained at 2.25 percent. In case that the interbank interest rate be higher than 3.75 percent, monetary regulation credits and direct repos will be charged with the market interbank interest rate.For March, the forecasted range for the daily average balance of banks' deposits held at BCRP is 220 - 240 million. This average balance is neither a target nor a monetary policy stance indicator, since it also reflects, among others, seasonal factors as well as liquidity demand changes. The interest rates for Central Bank's operations in dollars are: Monetary regulation credits: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point. Overnight deposits: an interest rate equivalent to the rate for similar BCRP's deposits held abroad. Swaps: the commission is maintained to a level that implies a minimum annual effective cost of 3.75 percent. The session in which the Board will approve the following Monthly Monetary Program (April 2005) will be held on April 7th, 2005."
Philippines,2005-03-09,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to keep the BSP's key policy interest rates unchanged at 6.75 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.0 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. The Monetary Board believes that the outlook for inflation continues to support the maintenance of present policy settings. The main reason is that headline inflation is expected to decline towards the target of 4-5 percent by 2006. Expected price pressures over the two-year policy horizon also continue to be driven primarily by supply-side influences, notably price fluctuations in the world oil market and weather-induced pressures on agricultural food prices. Equally important, demand conditions continue to indicate that the economy remains below full-employment, which implies that inflation is unlikely to be pulled up by demand-side pressures. The presence of slack or below-full capacity utilization in the economy is suggested by the fact that credit demand remains moderate despite its recent improvement, while the unemployment rate remains well above its cyclical low of about 8 percent in the mid-1990s. The Monetary Board also recognized that the main policy concern for the near term will be the impact of continued supply-side pressures on price- and wage- setting behavior, particularly with imported oil prices expected to remain high. Policy action may be considered when a high proportion of the information on hand points to demand-side effects arising from supply shocks. Such information would include (but should not be limited to) the following circumstances: inflation is expected to breach the target after accounting for the impact of supply-side shocks; and approved minimum wage increases are in excess of what is necessary to compensate workers for lost purchasing power. For the moment, the Monetary Board noted that there are no further pending petitions for wage adjustments before the regional wage boards, but developments on the wage front will be followed more closely. The potential impact of new tax measures, such as the proposed increase in the value-added tax (VAT), could also add to inflationary expectations. However, the main impact of a VAT increase will likely consist of one-off price adjustments. Meanwhile, the possibility of exchange market pressure arising from narrowing interest rate differentials and other sources remains a risk to inflation and inflation expectations, although the prospect of a weak US dollar should provide a countervailing influence on import prices. In sum, the necessity of monetary action remains low at present given the prevailing inflation outlook, but this may change depending on developments in cost-side variables and any possible adverse movements in the foreign exchange market. The Monetary Board agreed, however, that any monetary policy action at this stage should be geared more toward nudging inflation expectations in the right direction rather than dampening demand-side impulses. To guide its decisionmaking, the BSP will continue to monitor carefully all developments that may affect the assessment of risks to inflation and inflation expectations over the policy horizon. Monetary policy will continue to focus on ensuring a gradual disinflation towards a desired low and stable inflation path in the medium term, while remaining supportive of the economy's growth objective."
Chile,2005-03-10,"Central Bank of Chile Press Release* 10 March 2005 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided, by unanimous vote, to maintain the monetary policy rate at 2.75% (annual). The information available shows that inflation and output growth are behaving consistently with the outlook contained in the last Monetary Policy Report. The strong growth of the economy is supported by a favorable international scenario and continuing monetary conditions in Chile that are clearly expansionary. Investment has continued to grow with exceptional strength, employment and the labor force remain dynamic, and private expectations continue to look optimistic. Recent price information indicates that, beyond the fluctuations originating in variations in regulated public utility rates, the various measures of trend inflation have continued with their gradual increase, in line with forecasts in the last Monetary Policy Report. This is consistent with output gaps gradually closing. Monthly inflation can be expected to show some volatility in the short run, affected by the large swings in oil prices. However, the twelve-month inflation projection remains low for part of 2005, below 2% for some months. The decision to maintain the monetary policy rate on this occasion does not alter the expected gradual reduction of the monetary impulse. The Board believes that this strategy permits to achieve, in the most likely scenario, an inflation rate around 3% per annum in the normal policy horizon of 12 to 24 months. In case of any discrepancy or difference in interpretation, the Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2005-03-10,"The bank of korea. The Bank of Korea. Monetary Policy Decision. The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (3.25%) for the intermeeting period. In the real economy, while exports continue to exhibit steady growth and private consumption and facilities investment appear to be improving, construction investment shows a slowdown in its pace of expansion. Meanwhile, the current account has still run a surplus, thanks to that on the goods account. Both core inflation and consumer price inflation are maintaining overall stability, as upward pressure from the demand side has been subdued. Nevertheless, the medium-term evolution of price movements still calls for caution when considering the uncertainty over the development of oil and housing prices. In the financial markets, overall liquidity conditions are favorable and long-term interest rates appear to be regaining their stability. On the other hand, the lending activities of financial institutions including loans to small- and medium-sized enterprises remain sluggish. Taking the above economic and financial conditions into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (3.25 percent) for the intermeeting period."
Romania,2005-03-14,"The NBR Board has decided to cut the policy rate to 14.5 percent. The NBR Board keeps inflation target for 2005 at 7 percent, reiterating the commitment to proceed to the next stage of capital account liberalisation by 30 June, as a step forward to EU accession. In its meeting on 12 March 2005, the NBR Board analysed the latest developments in real economy and financial and monetary sector as well as their prospects for 2005. The discussions focused on the final stages of capital account liberalisation and their impact on macroeconomic conditions in general and the Romanian financial market in particular. The analysis has underscored the strengthening of disinflation. Following the 0.6 percent increase in prices in February, the 12-month inflation rate remained below 9 percent. The lingering effects of budget deficit widening in November and December 2004, the sharp growth of disposable incomes of employees and corporate sector in recent months, as well as the nominal drop in deposit rates were offset by good performance of consolidated budget in early 2005, the advance in output and labour productivity, and the appreciation trend of the domestic currency. Thus, even though the rise in energy prices and excise duties to gradually reach EU standards are expected to have a temporary negative bearing on consumer prices, the NBR Board considers the 7 percent inflation target for 2005 to be a realistic one, amid maintenance of an adequate economic policy mix and achievement of the EU accession objectives. Against this backdrop, following the technical consultations with European Commission officials in Brussels on 10 March 2005, the NBR Board established the safeguard measures that may be applied along with the next stage of capital account liberalisation; such measures will be transposed into the regulations to be issued by the NBR. The safeguard measures could be resorted to in case of excess short-term capital flows, should their size lead to balance of payments disequilibria or severe disturbances of monetary and exchange rate policies that might entail considerable swings in domestic liquidity. The analysis of the latest banking developments has highlighted a downtrend in interest rates on NBR deposit-taking operations conducted via auctions with a view to mopping up excess liquidity in ROL. This trend is confirmed by the extent to which banks accept to adjust their interest rates to inflation rate developments and bring them to levels consistent with the next stage of capital account liberalisation. However, given the need to maintain the consistency between the anti-inflationary monetary policy and the liberalisation of capital account operations, the NBR Board has decided to retain the cautious approach to cutting the policy rate, which was set at 14.5 percent. The policy rate is expected to gradually near the market rate, insofar as progress in achieving the objectives of both disinflation and economic policy mix pursued by the authorities is made."
United States,2005-03-22,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 2-3/4 percent. The Committee believes that, even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity. Output evidently continues to grow at a solid pace despite the rise in energy prices, and labor market conditions continue to improve gradually. Though longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained, pressures on inflation have picked up in recent months and pricing power is more evident. The rise in energy prices, however, has not notably fed through to core consumer prices. The Committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal. With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan. Chairman; Timothy F Geithner. Vice Chairman; Ben S Bernanke; Susan S Bies; Roger W Ferguson. Jr.; Edward M Gramlich; Jack Guynn; Donald L Kohn; Michael H Moskow; Mark W Olson; Anthony M Santomero; and Gary H Stern. In a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 25-basis-point increase in the discount rate to 3-3/4 percent. In taking this action, the Board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston. New York. Philadelphia. Cleveland. Richmond. Atlanta. Chicago. St. Louis. Minneapolis, and San Francisco."
Hungary,2005-03-29,"1. At its meeting on 29 March 2005, the Monetary Council considered the latest economic and financial developments and decided to reduce the central bank base rate by 50 basis points, from 8.25% to 7.75%, with effect from 30 March 2005. The exchange rate has stabilised, competition in several segments of the market has intensified, wage inflation has slowed down on the costs side and the rate of consumption growth has moderated on the demand side. In the Council's assessment, these developments have all been supportive factors for the disinflation path consistent with the announced inflation objectives and, consequently, they have provided an opportunity to ease monetary conditions. In recent months, there has been a significant decline in prices covered by the core measure of inflation; and disinflation has been underway in market services since February. These developments may influence considerably the future outlook for inflation. January wage data for the private sector are consistent with the moderation in wage growth which has started in 2004 H2. But despite this slowdown, wage inflation is still seen as excessively high, although the upside risks to inflation from the labour market have fallen. The more benign outlook for prospective inflation relative to earlier periods has been conducive to a slowdown in the growth rate of nominal wages. In assessing the future outlook for inflation, the risks posed by short-term oil price moves must also be taken into account, in addition to the fundamentally positive domestic environment. Similarly to the euro area, the inflationary impact of rising oil prices on the Hungarian economy has in recent months been mitigated by the depreciation of the US dollar. However, the upward risk to inflation arising from erratic oil price developments may increase this year. The latest information related to economic growth is broadly in line with the Council's assessment of economic performance in February, which contained a slight slowdown in the rate of growth in 20052006. In addition to domestic and international confidence indices, the January industrial output data suggest a slowdown in economic activity. January retail trade data are also consistent with the slowdown in consumption expected in 2005. Data on exports and imports have not shown signs of a departure from last year's robust trends. This is seen as a positive development in terms of growth. GDP growth in 2004 Q4 met earlier expectations; however, the pattern of this growth showed a greater-than-expected slowdown in domestic demand. The combination of a change in the structure of income growth and an anticipated slowdown in growth may add to disinflationary effects. Global financial developments have in recent weeks had a stronger-than-earlier effect on the Hungarian money and capital markets. In the very favourable international investment climate, capital flows into emerging markets were extremely intense up to mid-March, which was reflected in the appreciation of the related currencies, the decline in yields and the significant rise in share prices. However, probably because of higher long-term dollar yields, the direction of global capital flows changed. As an effect of this, the Hungarian money and capital markets experienced a correction. The recent global capital market developments suggest higher future risks arising from volatile capital movements, which may affect the room for monetary policy to manoeuvre. In taking its decision, the Monetary Council also took account of the fact that, despite the improvement in inflation outturns in recent weeks, the long-term risk assessment of the Hungarian economy had not improved materially, as reflected in the continued high interest rate differentials implied by long-term yields. Due to the persistence of risks to economic balance, the Council considers it extremely important that the recent reform of the Stability and Growth Pact, and the change to the accounting treatment of payments into private pension fund schemes in particular, do not lead to more relaxed fiscal policy relative to that in the Convergence Programme."
Poland,2005-03-30,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 30 March 2005 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL Held on 29-30 March 2005 The Council decided to reduce the NBP interest rates by 0.5 percentage point to the following levels: reference rate 6.0% on an annual basis; lombard rate 7.5% on an annual basis; deposit rate 4.5% on an annual basis; rediscount rate 6.5% on an annual basis. The Council maintained an easing monetary policy bias. In January and February 2005 economic climate indicators in the euro zone and the United States showed that the discrepancy in the pace of economic recovery in these two areas persisted. International forecasting institutions revised downwards their predictions for economic growth in 2005 in the euro area and in Germany in particular, while the US growth forecasts improved. The recently observed signals of a strengthening inflationary pressure in the United States led to interest rate increases in this market. The interest on American securities increased, which resulted in a decrease in the relative return on portfolio investments in the developing countries and new EU member states alike. This, in turn, contributed to the recently observed outflow of capital from these markets and the depreciation of these countries' currencies. In March 2005 a strong upsurge in crude oil prices was observed in world markets. The forecasts for the next few years now presume that the decrease in oil prices will be significantly smaller than previously expected. According to GUS data, the GDP growth rate in 2004 Q4 amounted to 3.9%, which is less than it had been estimated on the basis of preliminary data for 2004. The data on the GDP in 2004 Q4 confirmed a recovery in investment demand as well as a reduction in the consumption dynamics. Contrary to previous expectations, the contribution of net exports in the GDP growth in Q4 remained positive. ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51. Upon analysis, the available data indicate that in 2005 Q1 the GDP dynamics will be probably lower than in the previous quarter and also lower than it was accounted for in the February Inflation Report. This prediction is supported by, among others, the low industrial output dynamics and by the evident deterioration in the economic sentiment in manufacturing, even though the economic climate is still assessed positively. In seasonally adjusted terms business confidence in construction and trade also worsened to some extent, after a period of significant improvement in this assessment. The key factor in the assessment of the outlook for economic growth is investment. A considerable improvement in the financial results of enterprises and an evident rise in construction and assembly output create basis for the continuation of the investment recovery. These tendencies, however, might be weakened if the assessments of economic climate continued to deteriorate and if the political risk increased. The available data signal a gradual improvement of the situation in the labour market. The registered unemployment rate decreased from 19.5% in January to 19.4% in February 2005, and was 1.2 percentage points lower than a year ago. In February, another increase in employment in the enterprise sector was recorded. The positive tendency in the labour market is also confirmed by the BAEL data for 2004 Q4, according to which the number of working persons rose (by 2.5% y/y), while the number of unemployed fell (by 5.9% y/y). The gradual improvement of the situation in the labour market is not accompanied by any acceleration in the wage dynamics. In February 2005 the growth rate of nominal wages in the enterprise sector was still low and stood at 1.4% y/y (representing a real decrease of 2.1% y/y), which confirms a lack of wage pressure in enterprises. If the rate of pay rises continues to be lower than labour productivity dynamics, then it should be possible to sustain the high pace of economic growth, which will be based to the greater extent on the employment growth. The fact that the GDP dynamics in 2004 Q4 and probably also in 2005 Q1 proved lower than expected raises the probability of inflation in 2005 running lower than it was presented in the February Inflation Report. In February 2005, the dynamics of consumer prices was considerably lower than expected and amounted to 3.6% y/y. This primarily resulted from the application of a new weight structure used in calculating the price index of consumer goods and services (CPI). The use of the new weight structure led to a revision of annual inflation in January 2005 from 4.0% to 3.7%. The drop in inflation in February was mainly triggered by lowering annual food price dynamics. Net inflation in January and February 2005 stood at 2.3% y/y against 2.4% in December 2004. The fall in the current inflation as well as the shrinking gap between inflation measured with the price index of -2 - consumer goods and services and core net inflation both confirm the disappearance of transitory factors which contributed to inflation increase in 2004. Additionally. March was another consecutive month when inflation expectations of households were decreased (down to 3.4% from 3.9% in February 2005). The downward trend in the dynamics of producer prices in industry has also been continued since it started last year. In February, the rate of growth of these prices fell even more than expected and amounted to 3.4% y/y (compared with 4.5% y/y in January 2005). The data on inflation in the first months of 2005 and the latest forecasts of food prices both increase the probability of inflation in 2005-2006 running lower than presented in the February Inflation Report. This assessment may be changed following commodity price developments in world markets, oil price shifts in particular. Since the last meeting of the Council the zloty has depreciated. The developments of the exchange rate in 2005 Q1 have been broadly consistent with the path accounted for in the February Report. The Council acknowledges the rise in uncertainty surrounding the future course of the exchange rate in view of the situation in international financial markets and the uncertainty related to the pre- election period. The Council maintains its conviction that the sustainability of the economic growth will hinge upon implementation of reforms that would result in decreasing state expenditure and, consequently, lead to a reduction in public finance sector deficit, and which would remove barriers to employment growth. The next meeting of the Council will be held on 26-27 of April 2005."
Philippines,2005-04-06,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to increase the BSP's policy interest rates by 25 basis points to 7.0 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.25 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. In its assessment of the outlook for inflation and output, the Monetary Board noted that demand-driven inflationary pressures remain limited at present given fairly high unemployment, modest credit growth, and spare capacity in manufacturing. At the same time, the latest forecasts continue to show headline inflation declining towards the 4-5 percent target by 2006. However, the upside risks to the inflation outlook have increased given prevailing expectations for international oil prices, which are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future. In addition, recent supply-side developments—particularly the increases in oil prices—may already be feeding into inflation expectations. The prospect of renewed cost-push pressures from rising oil prices and other supply-side factors, combined with falling real wages and rising inflation expectations implies a greater risk that the public will come to expect future inflation to continue to spiral away from the Government's target. Such changes in inflation expectations have an impact on overall price- and wage-setting behavior in the economy. Under these circumstances, the Monetary Board believes that a measured increase in policy interest rates can help prevent rising inflationary expectations from becoming widespread and entrenched and prevent ongoing supply shocks from generating second-round effects. The Monetary Board likewise noted other risks to future prices. Exchange market pressure, for example, remains a risk to inflation expectations, given the likelihood of declining interest rate differentials and possible adverse shifts in investor sentiment due to delays in needed tax measures. Recent increases in liquidity growth due to external inflows are also being monitored closely, because of the potential implications of the additional liquidity for exchange market stability and the inflation path. The Monetary Board emphasized that the increase in the BSP's policy interest rates is chiefly a preemptive move to prevent inflation expectations from spiraling away from the inflation target. he policy action is intended as a response to rising inflation expectations, and underlines the BSP's commitment to fighting inflation. In the months ahead, the BSP will continue to assess the appropriate response to the risks to the inflation outlook, paying particular attention to adjustments in nominal wages and transport fares. The overall stance of monetary policy will be oriented towards responding to inflationary risks and delivering price stability over the policy horizon."
Chile,2005-04-07,"Central Bank of Chile Press Release* 7 April 2005 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank decided, by unanimous vote, to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points, to 3.0% (annual). The information available shows robust expansion of domestic expenditure, while activity growth continues to be strong, although somewhat slower than in recent quarters. Continuing clearly expansionary monetary conditions in Chile and a favorable international environment - although with increased risks associated with it- support this scenario. The latest price information indicates that the various measures of core inflation have continued with their gradual increase, in line with forecasts in the last Monetary Policy Report. Also there is some volatility in monthly inflation, provoked by the international oil price increases through direct effects and regulated rates, a situation that most likely will persist in the short run. Trend inflation and the current monetary stimulus make it advisable to raise the monetary policy interest rate. This adjustment reduces the risk of sharp movements in the future, and is consistent with the process of gradual monetary policy normalization and the good outlook for the Chilean economy. The Board reiterates its commitment to adjust monetary policy in order to maintain expected inflation around 3% per annum over the normal policy horizon of 12 to 24 months. In the most likely scenario, this entails reducing the monetary impulse at a measured pace. In case of any discrepancy or difference in interpretation, the Spanish original prevails."
Euroarea,2005-04-07,"Ladies and gentlemen, it is our pleasure to welcome you to this press conference. The Vice-President and I will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. All in all, we have not changed our assessment of risks to price stability over the medium term. So far, we have seen no significant evidence of underlying domestic inflationary pressures building up in the euro area. Accordingly, we have left the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Both nominal and real interest rates are at exceptionally low levels, lending ongoing support to economic activity. However, upside risks to price stability over the medium term remain and continued vigilance is therefore of the essence. I shall now explain our assessment in more detail, turning first to the economic analysis. Recent data and survey indicators on economic activity have been mixed. In general they point to ongoing economic growth at a moderate pace over the short term, with no clear signs as yet of a strengthening in underlying dynamics. Looking further ahead, the conditions remain in place for moderate economic growth to continue. Global growth remains solid, providing a favourable environment for euro area exports. On the domestic side, investment is expected to continue to be supported by very favourable financing conditions, improved profits and greater business efficiency. Consumption growth should develop in line with real disposable income growth. However, at the same time, persistently high oil prices in particular pose downside risks to growth. Turning to consumer prices. Eurostat's flash estimate for annual HICP inflation was 2.1% in March, unchanged from February. In the coming months, annual inflation rates are likely to remain somewhat above 2%, although the exact figure will depend largely on how oil prices develop. Looking further ahead, so far we have seen no significant evidence of underlying domestic inflationary pressures building up in the euro area. Wage increases have remained contained over recent quarters and, in the context of moderate economic growth and weak labour markets, this trend is likely to continue for the time being. Given recent oil price rises, it is once again paramount that second-round effects stemming from wage and price-setting throughout the economy are avoided. It is particularly important that the social partners assume their responsibilities in this respect. In addition, developments in longer-term inflation expectations need to be monitored closely. The monetary analysis provides further insight into the outlook for price developments at medium to longer-term horizons. While the latest monetary and credit data show some moderation in the pace of monetary expansion, they confirm that the stimulative effect of the low level of interest rates has remained the dominating force. In addition, the fact that monetary dynamics continue to be driven mainly by the most liquid components suggests that excess liquidity may entail risks of upward inflationary pressures in the medium to longer term. Furthermore, strong monetary and credit growth indicates the need to carefully monitor whether risks are building up in the context of strong house price increases in some regions of the euro area. To sum up, the economic analysis confirms that underlying domestic inflationary pressures remain contained, while there continue to be medium-term upside risks to price stability which need to be monitored closely. Cross-checking with the monetary analysis supports the case for continued vigilance with regard to the materialisation of such risks. Turning to fiscal policies, recent information provides a mixed picture and continues to raise concerns. Although public finances remain sound in a few euro area countries and fiscal consolidation is progressing slowly in others, in several countries fiscal perspectives are worrying, as imbalances are not projected to decline, as planned earlier, and in some cases are even forecast to rise. Given that inappropriate consolidation strategies and shortcomings in their implementation have, in the past, made compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact difficult, it is now essential that consolidation plans are ambitious and are fully implemented. It is equally essential that the European Commission and the ECOFIN Council strictly enforce the new agreement on the implementation of the Pact so as to restore the framework's credibility. The Governing Council would also like to reiterate the need to deliver on fiscal and structural reforms that enhance the sustainability of public finances and confidence in the growth prospects of all Member States. As regards structural reforms in the euro area, the Governing Council welcomes the Presidency Conclusions of the Brussels European Council of 22 and 23 March 2005, which state that “it is essential to relaunch the Lisbon Strategy without delay and re-focus priorities on growth and employment”. EU countries urgently need to promote innovation and human capital formation, establish a regulatory environment which is friendlier for businesses, accelerate market liberalisation, and increase labour market flexibility. Attention must now shift towards implementing this reform agenda. Closing the implementation gap is essential in order to reap the full benefits of structural reforms in terms of both a higher growth potential in the medium term and improved consumer and business confidence in the short term."
South Korea,2005-04-07,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (3.25%) for the intermeeting period. (An unofficial English translation based on the Korean original of the decision on monetary policy taken by the Monetary Policy Committee on April 7, 2005 is attached). In the real economy, while exports continue to exhibit steady growth and private consumption and facilities investment appear to be improving, construction investment shows a lackluster movement. Meanwhile, the current account has still run a surplus, thanks to that on the goods account. Both core inflation and consumer price inflation are maintaining overall stability, as upward pressure from the demand side has been subdued. Nevertheless, the medium-term evolution of price movements still calls for caution when considering the increasing pressure from the cost side mainly due to high oil prices, and signs of a rebound in housing prices. In the financial markets, overall liquidity conditions are favorable, yet the lending activities of financial institutions including loans to small- and medium-sized enterprises remain sluggish. Taking the above economic and financial conditions into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (3.25 percent) for the intermeeting period."
Peru,2005-04-07,"Press Release MONETARY PROGRAM FOR APRIL 2005 CENTRAL BANK KEPT REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 3.00% In March, the Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) augmented 0.65 percent. Thus, the 12-month inflation reached 1.9 percent; lower than the Central Bank inflation target (2.5 percent), but within the target range (1.5  3.5 percent). Core inflation, indicator of the inflationary trend, was 1.3 percent over last 12 months. For the remainder of the year 2005 the forecasts of the Inflation Report of January 2005 are maintained. Thus, it would continue the partial reversion of the inflationary supply shocks that affected the economy last year. The 12-month inflation would converge toward the lower section of the target range (1.5 to 2.5 percent) in most of months of this year. With respect to the determinants of the 2005 inflation, it remains the inflation expectations of the agents around 2.5 percent, moderate import goods inflation and an expected economic growth of 4.5 percent with a positive outlook. The Board of the Central Bank approved to keep the reference interest rates of the monetary operations: The monetary operations of injection and withdrawal of liquidity by means of auctions will be oriented to place the interbank interest rate around the center of the corridor set by the reference interest rates (3.00 percent). For direct repos and monetary regulation credits, the rate is kept at 3.75 percent. For overnight deposits, the rate is maintained at 2.25 percent. In case that the interbank interest rate be higher than 3.75 percent, monetary regulation credits and direct repos will be charged with the market interbank interest rate.For April, the forecasted range for the daily average balance of banks' deposits held at BCRP is 250 - 270 million. This average balance is neither a target nor a monetary policy stance indicator, since it also reflects, among others, seasonal factors as well as liquidity demand changes. The interest rates for Central Bank's operations in dollars are: Monetary regulation credits: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point. Overnight deposits: an interest rate equivalent to the rate for similar BCRP's deposits held abroad. Swaps: the commission is maintained to a level that implies a minimum annual effective cost of 3.75 percent. The session in which the Board will approve the following Monthly Monetary Program (May 2005) will be held on May 5th, 2005."
Romania,2005-04-11,"In its meeting on 7 April 2005, the NBR Board analysed the latest developments of macroeconomic indicators and their prospects. The trends in financial, monetary and economic indicators in the first few months of 2005 point to further fast-paced economic growth amid lingering inflationary pressures induced by both the aggregate demand and the hike in administered prices. For 2005, the top priority is to slow down the rate of increase of domestic demand in order to support both the achievement of the 7 percent inflation target and the maintenance of the current account deficit at sustainable levels in the medium term. The NBR Board considers realistic the continuation of disinflation provided an adequate economic policy mix is in place. Both the support of monetary and fiscal policies and the step-up in structural and institutional reforms are critical to the slowdown of the advance in domestic demand. The analysis of the latest developments on the foreign exchange and money markets has underscored the further downtrend in interbank rates as well as in lending and deposit rates. Moreover, the exchange rate of the ROL remained relatively stable at significantly appreciated levels against the previous year, thereby impacting favourably domestic prices and inflation expectations. The room for manoeuvre for the central bank's interest rate policy, given the risks associated with the current differential between domestic and international interest rates amid capital account liberalisation, allows the cut in the policy rate, which is expected to gradually near the market rate, insofar as progress in attaining the objectives of both disinflation and economic policy mix is made. The NBR Board has decided to set the policy rate at 12.5 percent, two percentage points below the previous level. Furthermore, the NBR Board has decided to lower both the interest rate on the lending facility, from 25 percent to 20 percent, and the interest rate on the deposit facility, from 5 percent to 4 percent. The interest rate payable on ROL-denominated required reserves set up by credit institutions has been brought down to 2 percent from 4 percent while that on EUR-denominated reserves has been set at 0.7 percent from 1 percent. The penalty rate on reserve deficit in ROL has been cut to 30 percent from 37 percent. The National Bank of Romania will keep an eye on economic and monetary developments so that, by resorting to adequate tools, to ensure maintenance of a cautious monetary policy stance needed to achieve the inflation targets for 2005 and 2006 (7 percent and 5 percent respectively) as well as on a longer time horizon."
South Africa,2005-04-14,"Over the past two months, the global environment has continued to be characterised by uncertainty. International oil prices have reached record highs despite increases in output quotas by OPEC and have confounded expectations of a short-lived spike. Higher oil prices have resulted in a downward revision of global growth estimates. The imbalances in the US remain, and the outlook for the dollar remains uncertain. Against the dollar, the rand has generally traded in a range higher than that in 2004. Domestically, expenditure remains strong and the robust economic growth has been accompanied by six consecutive quarters of employment growth in the formal non-agricultural sectors of the economy. However, there has recently emerged evidence of some slackening of activity in the manufacturing sector. Despite the uncertain global environment, the inflation outlook remains favourable. Inflation as measured by the consumer price index for metropolitan and other urban areas excluding the interest cost on mortgage bonds (CPIX) has remained within the inflation target range of 3-6 per cent for the past 18 months. After declining to 3,6 per cent in January of this year, it declined further to 3,1 per cent in February. This is the lowest rate of increase of CPIX since the inception of this measure of inflation. The recent downward movement was due in part to consecutive decreases in the petrol price totaling 65 cents per litre between December 2004 and February 2005. Increases in most of the other components of the CPIX were also well contained, while footwear and clothing prices continued to decline. Food prices also continued to increase at a subdued year-on-year rate of 1,6 per cent in February while total goods price inflation measured 1,8 per cent. Of particular significance is the fact that services inflation has continued its gradual downward trend. In January year-on-year services inflation declined below the upper end of the inflation target range to 5,9 per cent, and declined further to 5,6 per cent in February. This was the first time since the introduction of inflation targeting that services inflation has been at these levels. This partly reflects progress made by the public authorities in curbing administered price increases. The overall administered price index however remains above the target range because of the impact of the petrol price, which has a significant weighting in this index. Production price inflation has also remained low, to an important degree due to the impact of the exchange rate of the rand. In January and February, the respective year-on-year inflation rates for the overall PPI were 1,4 per cent and 1,2 per cent. Prices of imported goods increased year-on-year by 0,3 per cent in January, and declined by 0,7 per cent in February. However, the prices of domestically produced goods also remained well contained. In the first two months of this year, the year-on-year inflation in these prices declined to 1,9 per cent and 1,8 per cent respectively, as the prices of agricultural products, manufactured foodstuff and textiles declined. Despite the uncertainties created by the oil market developments, the outlook for inflation remains favourable. The continued low level of production price inflation indicates that significant generalised upward pressure on consumer prices is not expected in the short term. However the recent increases in the petrol price of 42 cents per litre in March and 40 cents per litre in April and possible further increases expected next month suggest that CPIX inflation may have reached its low turning point in February. According to our central forecast. CPIX inflation will begin to rise moderately over the coming months to peak at a level of around 5,25 per cent early next year before resuming a downward trajectory towards the mid-point of the inflation target range. This favourable forecast is underpinned by a number of factors. The latest inflation expectations survey conducted on behalf of the Bank by the Bureau for Economic Research (BER) at the University of Stellenbosch shows a significant decline in inflation expectations. According to the survey. CPIX inflation expectations reached their lowest level since the BER started the survey in 2000. For the first time, all groups of respondents expect inflation to be below the upper end of the inflation target band. On average CPIX inflation is expected to be at 4,5 per cent, the mid-point of the band for 2005, down from 5,5 per cent in the previous survey. CPIX inflation is also expected to remain within the target range for the next 3 years. This outcome indicates that there is an increasing acceptance by the South African population that the low levels of inflation achieved over the past 18 months can be sustained. These improved expectations are corroborated by the gap between the nominal yield on conventional bonds and the real yield on inflation-linked bonds. Although the expected long-term inflation implied by these yields has risen since their February lows, they nevertheless indicate longer-term expectations comfortably within the target range. Government's fiscal policies also remain supportive of monetary policy. Higher than expected tax revenues have resulted in a deficit before borrowing significantly lower than the original estimate of 3,1 per cent and the revised estimate of 2,3 per cent of GDP announced in the budget. Other positive factors include continued low world inflation, progress being made with respect to administered prices and low levels of food price increases in part as a result of the bumper maize crop. Not all the positive factors identified in the previous statement of the MPC have improved however. Unit labour cost developments present a mixed picture. In the last MPC statement we commented on the marked moderation in salary and wage increases. Revisions to the Survey of Employment and Earnings undertaken by Statistics South Africa now indicate that average earnings rose by 7,2 per cent and 10,5 per cent in the third and fourth quarters respectively. With labour productivity growth declining to 0,6 per cent and 0,4 per cent in those quarters, it implies an increase in unit labour cost in the formal non-agricultural sectors of the economy of 6,6 per cent in the third quarter, compared to the original estimate of 4,9 per cent, and 10,1 per cent in the fourth quarter. The average unit labour cost increase for 2004 was 7,3 per cent compared to 4,0 per cent in the previous year. While these figures taken at face value should be a cause for concern, they do not necessarily reflect a reversal of the downward trend in reported nominal wage settlements, which according to recent surveys averaged below 7 per cent in 2004 and around 6 per cent in the first quarter of 2005. These figures appear to confirm the lagged nature of wage settlements, and the continuing adjustment to lower inflation rates. Because of their importance to the inflation process, these developments will be closely monitored by the MPC. There are a number of upside risks to the inflation outlook which the MPC has taken cognisance of. The most important risk factor remains the uncertainty relating to the international oil prices. The price of Brent crude has averaged around US$54 per barrel since the beginning of April, compared to US$45 per barrel in February and the outlook for oil prices has become increasingly uncertain. Domestic expenditure continues to be robust. Growth in real gross domestic expenditure averaged 6,5 per cent in 2004, and real final demand averaged 6,8 per cent. This was a result of acceleration in real household and government consumption expenditure and real gross fixed capital formation. The strong growth in private sector consumption continues to be sustained by relatively low nominal interest rates, higher asset prices, higher levels of consumer confidence and increased real disposable incomes. The higher levels of expenditure continue to be reflected in the money supply aggregates and credit extension by the banking sector. Although the year-on-year monthly rates of increase in M3 have remained fairly stable at around the 12 per cent level, the quarter-to-quarter annualised rate of increase in the fourth quarter of 2004 amounted to 17,6 per cent. In January and February of 2005 the month-on-month annualised growth rate of loans and advances of banks to the private sector was 22,5 per cent and 20,6 per cent respectively. This was mainly the result of asset-backed credit growth which recorded similar rates of increase. However, the rate of increase in house prices has been moderating for the past year. Real gross domestic product growth averaged 3,7 per cent in 2004 compared to 2,8 per cent in 2003. As expected, the quarter-on-quarter annualised growth rate of 4,0 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2004 was slower than the previous quarter rate of 5,7 per cent. Moreover, there is evidence of a slackening of activity in the manufacturing sector. The outlook for growth and for exports in particular will depend to a significant degree on growth developments internationally. Although output growth has been robust, the higher expenditure growth has continued to put pressure on the current account of the balance of payments. The current account deficit widened in the fourth quarter of 2004 to 4,0 per cent of GDP, up from 3,1 per cent in the third quarter. It measured 3,2 per cent of GDP for the year as a whole. However as has been the case for the past three years, these deficits continue to be comfortably financed by inflows on the financial account of the balance of payments. This enabled us to continue building up our levels of foreign exchange reserves at a moderate pace- gross foreign exchange reserves rose to US$15,9 billion and the international liquidity position to US$12,4 billion at the end of March. The prospects for the international economy have become more uncertain and the IMF and the World Bank have both revised down their forecast for growth in 2005, particularly in the eurozone and Japan. The IMF has also warned of an increasingly unbalanced global expansion and the risks posed by higher oil prices, rising inflationary pressures, and the large and growing indebtedness of the United States to the rest of the world. Given the continued imbalances in the US economy, the outlook for the US dollar remains uncertain. The rand exchange rate will continue to be affected by these developments. The rand strengthened after the last MPC meeting, but has weakened more recently as a result of the stronger dollar and the generalised weakness in emerging market assets. It is nevertheless slightly stronger than it was at the time of the last meeting and has traded over the past six months at a range higher than for the main part of 2004. The MPC has carefully reviewed the above-mentioned developments and future prospects for inflation and the economy, taking particular account of the areas of uncertainty identified and the associated risks. The MPC welcomed the evidence of a further material decline in inflation expectations and noted that on balance the outlook for inflation, on the basis of our central forecast, was that CPIX inflation would remain comfortably within the target range of 3-6 per cent over the next two years, even taking account of the impact of the recent rise in oil prices. Although the overall performance of the South African economy seems to be reasonably well sustained, the MPC noted with concern evidence of some slackening in activity in some sectors of the economy as a result of the move by the rand to a higher trading range over the past six months. It remains the view of the MPC that a competitive and stable exchange rate would contribute to continuing sustainable growth in output and employment. Taking all of the above-mentioned developments into consideration, the MPC has decided to reduce the repo rate by 50 basis points to 7,0 per cent per annum with immediate effect. The MPC is convinced that this is appropriate in the circumstances, and consistent with maintaining inflation within the target range. The MPC will continue to monitor domestic and international developments closely, and will not hesitate to adjust rates as and when necessary to ensure that inflation remains within the target range mandated by the government of 3-6 per cent."
Thailand,2005-04-20,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 20 April 2005 Ms. Atchana Waiquamdee. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand, announced that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance going forward. The main issues discussed were as follows: 1. Latest data indicated that economic growth in Thailand moderated in the first 2 months of 2005 in response to the negative impacts from higher oil prices, natural disaster, unrest in the southern provinces, and a slowdown in the world economy. Despite greater risks to growth in the short-term, the MPC was confident that strong economic fundamentals should help to support growth in the medium- term at a satisfactory rate. Reflecting higher energy prices, headline and core inflation accelerated in March to 32 per cent and 08 per cent year-on-year, respectively. Nevertheless the probability that core inflation will exceed the target range in the next 8 quarters remains low. The current account was likely to move into deficit in the first quarter of 2005 in response to abnormally high imports, partly due to higher oil prices and inventory accumulation of certain goods whose prices were expected to rise. Nevertheless the MPC still expected the current account to remain in surplus for the year. With the risk of further upward movements in inflation remaining, the MPC deemed that the upward path of the policy rate should be maintained. However against the background of increased risks to growth from negative factors emanating from both domestic and external sources, especially the high price of oil, and without signs of cumulating financial imbalances from unusually low interest rates, policy tightening should be implemented at a gradual pace to ensure that monetary conditions would facilitate private sector's adjustment to the risks outlined above. The MPC therefore decided to maintain the 14-day repurchase at 225 per cent per annum for the time being."
Poland,2005-04-27,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 27 April 2005 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL Held on 26-27 April 2005 The Council decided to reduce the NBP interest rates by 0.5 percentage point to the following levels: Reference rate 5.5% on an annual basis Lombard rate 7.0% on an annual basis Deposit rate 4.0% on an annual basis Rediscount rate 6.0% on an annual basis. The Council adopted a neutral monetary policy bias. In March 2005, the consumer confidence indicators in the euro area and the United States deteriorated, which resulted mainly from a strong growth of crude oil prices and their persistently high level in February and March 2005. High oil prices contributed also to a worsening of economic climate in the enterprise sector, which was particularly visible in the euro area, and to an increase in the dynamics of producer prices in industry in the United States and most euro area economies. International forecasting agencies revised upwards oil price forecasts for the coming years. According to their current forecasts, the years 2006 and 2007 will see these prices decrease on a smaller scale than previously expected. In April the return on American securities fell, increasing the relative profitability of portfolio investments in the developing countries and in the new EU member states. In March. Poland saw a decline in industrial output dynamics, which was deeper than expected (drop of 3.7% y/y). Negative annual industrial output dynamics was mainly related to the high level of production in March 2004 (then the growth stood at 23.5% y/y) and a smaller number of working days as compared to the previous year. After seasonal adjustment, the production decline reached 1% y/y and 1.6% m/m. As expected in the February Inflation Report, considering moderate consumption dynamics and a probably neutral contribution of net exports to GDP growth, investment is the key factor for the outlook for economic growth and inflation. The investment in enterprises (9.2% y/y increase) was a dynamic factor behind last year's investment growth of 5.1% y/y, with a particularly strong growth recorded in the group of medium-size enterprises. Despite lower output dynamics in the construction and assembly sector, partly due to unfavourable weather conditions, construction site development companies noted a considerable output growth which, combined with positive assessments of investment plans signalled in the business climates surveys of the National Bank of Poland, indicates continuation of investment recovery. However, other business climate surveys suggest that the assessment pointing to stabilisation or deterioration of the current business conditions prevails and they also indicate that expectations of the future economic activity are not unambiguous. ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (22) 826 99 55, fax (22) 826 37 51. Upon analysis, the available data for 2005 Q1 confirm earlier expectations according to which the GDP growth in 2005 Q1 was lower than in 2004 Q4 and lower than it was accounted for in the February Inflation Report. The available data signal a gradual improvement in the labour market. The registered unemployment rate fell from 19.4% in February to 19.3% in March 2005, and was down by 1.1 percentage point, as compared to the corresponding period last year. In March 2005 the employment in the corporate sector stabilised and was higher by 1.6% y/y. The growth rate of nominal wages in the corporate sector was still low and stood at 2.2% y/y, which means a drop of 1.2% y/y in real terms and confirms a lack of wage pressure in enterprises. In March 2005, the consumer prices dynamics stood at 3.4% y/y, which was below the upper limit for deviations of the inflation target. March's inflation decline was driven mainly by lower annual food and non-alcoholic beverage price dynamics. A drop was also recorded in most core inflation indicators except for net inflation which increased to 2.4% y/y from 2.3% in February. The fall in the current inflation as well as the shrinking gap between inflation measured with the price index of consumer goods and services and core net inflation both confirm the disappearance of transitory factors which contributed to inflation increase in 2004. Moreover. April 2005 saw a further decrease in households' inflation expectations (down to 3.0% from 3.4% in March 2005). The downward trend in the producer prices in industry started last year has continued. In March, the annual dynamics of those prices amounted to 2.2% y/y (compared with the revised downward 3.2% y/y in February 2005). The data on inflation in 2005 Q1 and the latest food price forecasts suggest the likelihood of inflation rate running lower in the years 2005-2006 than presented in the February Inflation Report. This assessment may be adjusted following commodity price developments in the world markets, and oil price movements in particular. At the same time, a further increase in oil prices may additionally weaken GDP growth. The exchange rate developments in April 2005 have been broadly consistent with the path accounted for in the February Report. The developments of the exchange rate may be affected by the situation in the international financial markets and the uncertainty related to the pre-election period. The Council is concerned about numerous legislative proposals put forward in the recent months which may result in an increase in the general government deficit and, in consequence, a postponement of the fulfilment of the euro area membership criteria. The uncertainty concerning the prospects for public finance reforms and the extent of the implementation of other necessary structural reforms is a significant risk factor for inflation. In the Council's assessment, the balance of risks for future inflation is more favourable than presented in the February inflation projection. In March the signals of food price dynamics falling faster than expected were confirmed. Compared to March, the likelihood of the GDP growth in 2005 being lower than projected in the February Report has increased. Moreover, strong wage discipline in the enterprise sector has continued. In the Council's assessment, starting from 2005 Q3 inflation may stay below the inflation target for a few quarters. At the same time, the Council recognizes the risk of a stronger inflationary pressure in the longer term, related to the revision of the oil price forecasts which are, however, subject to considerable uncertainty. The next meetings of the Council will be held on 17 May 2005 (when the Report on monetary policy implementation in 2004 and the NBP Annual Report for 2004 will be discussed) and on 24- 25 May 2005."
United States,2005-05-03,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 3 percent. The Committee believes that, even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity. Recent data suggest that the solid pace of spending growth has slowed somewhat, partly in response to the earlier increases in energy prices. Labor market conditions, however, apparently continue to improve gradually. Pressures on inflation have picked up in recent months and pricing power is more evident. Longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained. The Committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal. With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan. Chairman; Timothy F Geithner. Vice Chairman; Susan S Bies; Roger W Ferguson. Jr.; Richard W Fisher; Edward M Gramlich; Donald L Kohn; Michael H Moskow; Mark W Olson; Anthony M Santomero; and Gary H Stern. In a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 25-basis-point increase in the discount rate to 4 percent.

Euroarea,2005-05-04,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to the press conference here in Berlin. Today is the 11th time that the Governing Council has met outside Frankfurt, and I would like to thank President Weber for his invitation and hospitality. Let me also express our gratitude to the staff of the Deutsche Bundesbank for their excellent organisation of today's meeting. Let me now report on the outcome of today's meeting, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we continue to see no significant evidence of a build-up of underlying domestic inflationary pressures in the euro area. Accordingly, we have left the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The exceptionally low level of interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum provides considerable support to economic activity in the euro area. At the same time, continued vigilance with regard to upside risks to price stability is warranted. Allow me to elaborate on our decision, turning first to the economic analysis. Regarding the current situation and the short-term outlook for economic activity, recent data and survey indicators are, on balance, on the downside. Some of the downward risks to economic growth identified earlier, in particular those related to persistently high oil prices, appear to have partially materialised over the past few months. At the same time, when looking beyond the short term, conditions remain in place for stronger real GDP growth. On the external side, euro area exports should continue to be supported by foreign demand. On the domestic side, investment should benefit from the very favourable financing conditions, the robust corporate earnings currently being observed and ongoing improvements in corporate efficiency. Consumption growth should evolve broadly in line with expected developments in disposable income. Downside risks to economic growth continue to be related to oil price developments and global imbalances. Turning to price developments, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 2.1% in April, unchanged from March. Over the coming months, annual HICP inflation rates are likely to remain around these levels. Wage increases have remained contained over recent quarters and, in the context of moderate economic growth and weak labour markets, this trend should continue for the time being. Overall, when looking ahead, we see no significant evidence of underlying domestic inflationary pressures building up in the euro area so that inflation rates should develop in line with price stability. However, there continue to be upside risks to price stability, relating mainly to oil price developments and their potential to lead to second-round effects stemming from wage and price-setting behaviour. In order to avoid this, it is important that the social partners continue to assume their responsibilities. As regards the monetary analysis, monetary and credit growth remain strong despite some moderation over the recent past. These developments mainly reflect the stimulative effect of the low level of interest rates in the euro area. As monetary dynamics over the past year have mainly been driven by developments in the most liquid components of M3, this continues to signal upside risks to price stability in the medium to longer term. To sum up, the economic analysis suggests that underlying domestic inflationary pressures remain contained. However, upside risks to price stability over the medium term need to be monitored closely. Cross-checking with the monetary analysis supports the case for continued vigilance with regard to the materialisation of such risks. Against this background, longer-term inflation expectations need to be monitored closely. As regards fiscal policies, recent information and forecasts suggest little progress in reducing fiscal imbalances in the euro area. A timely and full implementation of consolidation commitments is essential. This will strengthen the confidence of investors and consumers in the soundness of economic policies. At the same time, it is essential to implement, in a strict and timely manner, the revised Stability and Growth Pact procedures, which are soon to enter into force, so as to underpin the credibility of the EU fiscal framework. The Governing Council has repeatedly argued in favour of structural reforms to improve the potential for higher economic growth in the euro area. Authorities are aware of the structural obstacles and have taken important measures to address them, but continued reforms will be needed in order to keep up with the unavoidable challenges arising from an ongoing deepening in the division of labour at the global level, rapid technological change and population ageing. It is important to explain to the general public that these reforms will progressively deliver higher growth and lead to more job creation, and that, as a result, our societies will be better off. Over recent years, uncertainties surrounding the structural reform agenda in some euro area countries appear to have hindered the necessary improvement in the confidence of consumers and entrepreneurs. A clear commitment to implementing the reforms and the explanation of their benefits will help to reduce such uncertainties and thereby make a considerable contribution to improving the economic outlook for the euro area."
Philippines,2005-05-04,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to keep the BSP's key policy interest rates unchanged at 7.0 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.25 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. During its assessment of prevailing macroeconomic conditions, the Monetary Board noted that latest forecasts indicate that inflation may be levelling off and is likely to fall within the targeted 4-5 percent range in 2006 in the absence of further adverse shocks. This is supported by the year-on-year core inflation which slowed down to 7.8 percent in April from 8.0 percent in the previous month. Taken together, the expectations of a decelerating path for inflation alongside the presence of slack in the economy support the maintenance of current policy settings. Authorities also have enough flexibility to keep monetary policy settings unchanged for the time being. Members of the Monetary Board believe that the recent policy rate increase should be given time to fully work its way into the economy and exert its impact on inflation expectations. Significant monetary tightening does not appear to be required by present conditions, given that demand pressures continue to be softened by sluggish employment conditions, moderate capacity utilization, and generally modest credit demand. The Board also recognized that the term spreads or the differentials between long-term and short-term interest rates have narrowed in recent months, indicating that long-term inflation expectations remain anchored. Nevertheless, the Monetary Board remains strongly committed to fighting inflation and continues to pay close attention to the risks to the inflation outlook. Such risks include the prospects for sustained cost-side pressures via high oil prices, impending second-round effects in the form of nominal wage increases and ancillary adjustments in other key prices such as transport fares and power costs. In the weeks ahead, the Monetary Board will continue to discuss the appropriate policy response to help contain the greater risk of rising inflation, emerging second-round effects from cost-push sources, and public inflation expectations."
Peru,2005-05-05,"Press Release MONETARY PROGRAM FOR MAY 2005 CENTRAL BANK KEPT REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 3.00% In April, the Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) augmented 0.12 percent. Thus, the 12-month inflation reached 2.0 percent; lower than the Central Bank inflation target (2.5 percent), but within the target range (1.5  3.5 percent). Core inflation, indicator of the inflationary trend, was 1.3 percent over last 12 months. For the remainder of the year 2005 the forecasts of the Inflation Report of January 2005 are maintained (2.3 percent). In the first months of 2005, there is a boost in the economic activity and a stronger Peruvian currency vis-à-vis the US dollar. The improve in the economic activity is explained by higher domestic demand and private investment. The export and import (capital goods and industrial inputs) volumes are above the forecast from January Inflation Report. Also, the terms of trade are higher than expected thanks to favorable export prices even though upper oil prices. Under these trends in the economic activity, there is expected that the GDP will be close to 5 percent in 2005. The Board of the Central Bank approved to keep the reference interest rates of the monetary operations: The monetary operations of injection and withdrawal of liquidity by means of auctions will be oriented to place the interbank interest rate around the center of the corridor set by the reference interest rates (3.00 percent). For direct repos and monetary regulation credits, the rate is kept at 3.75 percent. For overnight deposits, the rate is maintained at 2.25 percent. In case that the interbank interest rate be higher than 3.75 percent, monetary regulation credits and direct repos will be charged with the market interbank interest rate.The interest rates for Central Bank's operations in dollars are: Monetary regulation credits: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point. Overnight deposits: an interest rate equivalent to the rate for similar BCRP's deposits held abroad. Swaps: the commission is maintained to a level that implies a minimum annual effective cost of 3.75 percent. The session in which the Board will approve the following Monthly Monetary Program (June 2005) will be held on June 2nd, 2005."
Chile,2005-05-12,"Central Bank of Chile Press Release* 12 May 2005 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided, by unanimous vote, to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points, to 3.25% annually. Recent evidence shows that output growth, although at a more measured pace than in previous quarters, continues to be above the trend. Investment, consumption and employment continue to grow, supported by clearly expansionary domestic monetary conditions and a favorable international scenario, but with persistently high risks. The latest price information indicates that, beyond unusual movements in specific prices and the direct incidence of higher oil prices, trend inflation is increasing gradually, in line with previous estimates. It is worth noting that, despite a rise in hourly wages experienced over the past few months, unit labor costs have remained stable. This increase in the interest rate is consistent with the process of gradual monetary policy normalization introduced last September, and it reflects the good outlook for the Chilean economy while it reduces the risk of sharp movements in the interest rate in the future. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy aiming at keeping expected inflation around 3% per annum over the normal policy horizon of 12 to 24 months. In case of any discrepancy or difference in interpretation, the Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2005-05-12,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (3.25%) for the intermeeting period. (An unofficial English translation based on the Korean original of the decision on monetary policy taken by the Monetary Policy Committee on May 12, 2005 is attached). In the real economy, while exports continue to exhibit steady growth and private consumption and facilities investment appear to be improving, construction investment shows a lackluster movement. Meanwhile, the current account has still run a surplus, thanks to that on the goods account. Both core inflation and consumer price inflation continue to exhibit overall stability, as upward pressure from the demand side has been subdued. Nevertheless, the medium-term evolution of price movements still calls for caution when considering the underlying pressure from the cost side mainly due to high oil prices and a rise in real estate prices. In the financial markets, overall liquidity conditions are favorable and the lending activities of financial institutions including loans to small- and medium-sized enterprises seem to be slowly improving. Taking the above economic and financial conditions into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (3.25 percent) for the intermeeting period."
Malaysia,2005-05-25,"The growth of the Malaysian economy in the first quarter was within expectations. The private sector continued to be the key driver of growth, as the public sector consolidated its fiscal position. Going forward, the near-term outlook for Malaysia remains positive. Consumer spending is expected to remain robust and private investment is expected to be sustained as companies expand capacity. On the external front, global growth is expected to continue to support the growth of the Malaysian economy. The inflation rate is expected to edge upwards in the next few months, before moderating in the later part of 2005. The increase in prices reflects adjustments in costs arising from higher input prices such as higher commodity and oil prices. There are no signs that strong demand pressures are a source of inflationary concern. Growing productivity and capacity expansions are also playing a role in mitigating inflationary pressures. Price developments will be closely monitored to ensure that Malaysia continues to enjoy sustainable economic growth in an environment of price stability. The lack of strong demand pressures allows monetary policy to continue to remain accommodative to support economic growth. The overnight policy rate (OPR) will therefore remain unchanged at its current level of 2.70%. Bank Negara Malaysia 25 May 2005."
Poland,2005-05-25,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 25 May 2005 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL Held on 24-25 May 2005 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e.: reference rate 5.5% on an annual basis; lombard rate 7.0% on an annual basis; deposit rate 4.0% on an annual basis; rediscount rate 6.0% on an annual basis. The Council maintained its neutral monetary policy bias. Since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Council no significant changes in the external environment of the Polish economy have been observed that could affect the outlook for economic growth and inflation in Poland. The data on GDP in the United States and the euro area in 2005 Q1 suggest that economic growth is still markedly faster in the United States than the euro area. No significant changes in the forecasts for crude oil prices have been noted and a negative effect of high oil prices on the assessment of economic climate both on the part of consumers and enterprises in the euro area and Unites States alike has continued. Basing on preliminary data it is estimated that the annual GDP growth in Poland may have reached approximately 3.0% in 2005 Q1. In seasonally adjusted terms, the GDP growth has accelerated slightly as compared with the previous quarter. April 2005 saw a smaller than expected decline in industrial output (a drop of 1.0% y/y). An annual drop in industrial output was mainly caused by the high growth of output recorded in April 2004 (when the growth stood at 21.8% y/y). In seasonally adjusted terms, industrial output declined by 1.5% y/y, while in month-on-month terms it rose by 2.3%. Increased activity of construction site development companies may be evidence of the sustained investment revival, which may be favoured by still robust financial results of enterprises. Moreover, business confidence signalled by enterprises in GUS business tendency surveys have stopped deteriorating. In April 2005, employment in the corporate sector reported a year-on-year growth of 1.7%, while the unemployment rate decreased to 18.8%, i.e. by 1.1 percentage point y/y. In 2004 Q4, for the first time since 1999, the number of working persons in the economy increased by 0.2% y/y (as reported by companies employing more than 9 people). It confirms the positive tendencies visible in BAEL (Labour Force Survey) since 2003. This gradual improvement in the labour market is accompanied by a low wage growth. In April 2005, the nominal wage growth in the enterprise sector was still low and stood at 1.8% y/y (i.e. a drop of 1.2% y/y in real terms). In 2005 Q1 wage growth in the economy as a whole amounted to 3.6% y/y and 0% y/y in real terms, which was lower than expected and than in the previous quarter. As expected, in April 2005 the annual growth of consumer prices decreased to 3.0% y/y against 3.4% recorded in the previous month. April's inflation decline was mainly driven by lower annual growth rate of food and non-alcoholic beverage prices. A drop was also recorded in all core inflation indicators (net inflation amounted to 2.3% y/y as compared to 2.4% recorded in March 2004). The fall in the current inflation and also the shrinking gap between inflation measured with the price index of consumer goods and services and net core inflation both confirm the disappearance of transitory factors which contributed to inflation increase in 2004. Moreover. May 2005 saw a slight decrease in inflation expectations of households (down to 2.9% from 3.0% in April 2005). The downward trend in producer prices in industry started last year has continued. In April the annual growth of those prices amounted to 0.8 % (as compared to 2.2% in March 2005). The zloty exchange rate developments in May 2005 have been broadly consistent with the path accounted for in the May Inflation Report. The exchange rate developments may be affected by the situation in the international financial markets and the uncertainty related to the pre-election period. Numerous legislative proposals put forward in the recent months may cause a widening of the public finance deficit and, in consequence, postpone the compliance with of the euro-area membership criteria. The uncertainty about the prospects for public finance reforms and the extent of implementation of other necessary structural reforms is a significant inflation risk factor. According to the NBP staff inflation projection presented in the May Inflation Report, the annual GDP growth rate is expected to reach approximately 4% and thus be lower than expected in the February Report. It is expected that starting from 2005, the main demand factors driving economic growth will be consumption and investment. In the years 2006-2007. GDP dynamics should accelerate to 5.0%-5.5% unless the business conditions in Poland deteriorate or some negative shocks in the world economy occur. #NAME? Assuming unchanged interest rates, there is a 50-percent probability that inflation will stay within the range of 1.1%-2.2% in 2005 Q4, 1.2%-3.8% in 2006 Q4 and 0.7%-4.3% in 2007 Q4. In the Council's assessment, the May inflation projection and the currently available data indicate that the balance of risks for future inflation has not changed enough to warrant a change of the monetary policy parameters. The next meeting of the Council will be held on 28-29 June 2005."
Philippines,2005-06-01,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to keep the BSP's key policy interest rates unchanged at 7.0 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.25 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. During its deliberations on the monetary policy stance, the Monetary Board noted that the outlook for inflation and domestic demand suggests that there is flexibility for monetary authorities to maintain current policy settings based on the following considerations:. The prevailing and emerging risks to inflation are associated mainly with supply-side or cost-push factors (such as the VAT reform, oil prices and imminent adjustments in transport fares). These factors are expected to push the future inflation path upward in the short term but are unlikely to have a lasting impact on prices in the absence of sustained shocks. Demand side pressures continue to be muted due to cyclical and structural conditions, including high unemployment and weak credit demand. Authorities also noted that various measures of core inflation show indications of an easing. There is a need to preserve the conditions for continued expansion in aggregate demand given emerging indications of the contractionary impact of the oil shock and the expected impact of fiscal adjustment via VAT reform on growth in the short run. At the same time, continued supply-side pressures may influence inflation expectations. While monetary policy action is not the appropriate response to address the effects of ongoing supply shocks on inflation, it will try to mitigate inflation from feeding into higher wages and prices of other goods and services. The monetary authority therefore, stands ready to take action in order to guide inflation expectations and signal the BSP's commitment to fight inflation. The risk of exchange market pressures due to declining interest rate differentials has been largely contained by continued strong foreign exchange inflows from OFWs and portfolio investments. Given the predominance of supply shocks in the current inflation uptrend, policy responses via interest rates have been geared mainly toward steering inflation expectations rather than curbing demand. Members of the Monetary Board believe that the recent policy rate increase should be given time to fully work its way into the economy and exert its impact on inflation expectations. Significant monetary tightening does not appear to be justified by the extent of ongoing demand-side pressures, given sluggish employment conditions, moderate capacity utilization, and generally modest credit demand. On the whole, the Monetary Board remains strongly committed to fighting inflation and continues to pay close attention to the risks to the inflation outlook. Authorities emphasize that current monetary policy strategy under the inflation targeting framework seeks to respond primarily to future inflation, guided by an appreciation of the nature of ongoing inflation shocks. Decisions on policy interest rates are therefore based on the outlook for inflation, with emphasis on the likelihood of emerging demand-side pressures and adverse shifts in inflation expectations. In the months ahead, the Monetary Board will continue to discuss the appropriate policy response to help contain the greater risk of rising inflation, emerging second-round effects from cost-push sources, and public inflation expectations."
Euroarea,2005-06-02,"Ladies and gentlemen, it is our pleasure to welcome you to this press conference. The Vice-President and I will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. Overall, on the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we expect euro area underlying inflationary pressures to remain contained in the medium term. Accordingly, we have left the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The exceptionally low level of interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum continues to provide considerable support to economic growth in the euro area, which currently shows only moderate dynamics. At the same time, we will remain vigilant with regard to upside risks to price stability. I shall now explain our assessment in more detail, turning first to the economic analysis. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, real GDP grew by 0.5% quarter on quarter in the first quarter of 2005, compared with 0.2% in the previous quarter. However, figures for real GDP growth over the last two quarters partly reflect statistical effects related to working-day adjustments to the data. This has led to some understatement of growth dynamics in the last quarter of 2004 and to some overstatement in the first quarter of 2005. Most recent indicators for economic activity remain, on balance, on the downside. The moderation in economic activity observed since mid-2004 is partly related to the rise in oil prices. Looking ahead, there is scope for positive fundamental factors to again shape the outlook, assuming that the effects from adverse developments gradually diminish. Notably, global economic activity is expected to remain strong, despite some moderation from the record levels observed last year. This continues to support euro area exports and should have a potential positive impact also on investment. Investment is expected to benefit from robust earnings, improvements in business efficiency and the very favourable financing conditions. At the same time, consumption growth is expected to develop in line with real income growth. This assessment is broadly consistent with the new Eurosystem staff projections, which will be published today. Euro area real GDP is projected to grow at rates of between 1.1% and 1.7% in 2005, and between 1.5% and 2.5% in 2006. Recent forecasts from international and private sector organisations give similar indications. In comparison with the March ECB staff projections, the ranges projected for real GDP growth in 2005 and 2006 have been adjusted slightly downwards. All in all, our judgement remains that real economic growth will gradually improve over the period ahead. At the same time, recent data have heightened the uncertainties surrounding the short-term evolution of domestic demand, and persistently high oil prices and global imbalances may pose downside risks to the projections for economic growth. Turning to price developments in the euro area, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 2.0% in May, compared with 2.1% in April. Over the coming months, annual HICP inflation rates are expected to remain broadly around current levels. On the one hand, energy prices are exerting upward pressure on HICP inflation. On the other hand, underlying inflationary pressure has been rather contained and, on average, wage increases have remained moderate over recent quarters. According to the Eurosystem staff projections, average annual HICP inflation is seen to lie between 1.8% and 2.2% in 2005, and between 0.9% and 2.1% in 2006. Compared with the ECB staff projections published in March 2005, the inflation projections for 2005 have been revised slightly upwards and for 2006 slightly downwards. In 2006, this largely reflects the expected statistical effect of a planned health care reform in one euro area country, the Netherlands, which is estimated to imply a one-off reduction of 0.2 percentage point in the euro area inflation rate for 2006. This effect should be excluded from the assessment of the medium-term outlook for price stability. Taking into account the assumptions underlying the projections, upside risks to the inflation projections prevail. These risks relate notably to future oil price developments, indirect taxes and administered prices. Furthermore, ongoing vigilance is required in order to ensure that past price increases do not lead to second-round effects in wage and price-setting throughout the economy. In this respect, continued responsibility on the part of social partners is very important. The monetary analysis provides further insight into the risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. Over the past few months, money and credit have continued to grow robustly in the euro area. These developments mainly reflect the stimulative effect of the low level of interest rates in the euro area. The monetary dynamics are driven by the strong growth of the most liquid components of broad money contained in the narrow aggregate M1. At the same time, the euro area private sector's demand for MFI loans, in particular for house purchase, has remained strong. The assessment of ample liquidity in the euro area is confirmed by all indicators. Also in the light of the increasingly liquid nature of monetary expansion, the accumulated stock of the broad monetary aggregate M3 may entail upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. To sum up, the economic analysis suggests that underlying domestic inflationary pressures remain contained in the medium term. At the same time, it is necessary to underline the conditionality of this assessment and the related upside risks to price stability. Cross-checking with the monetary analysis supports the case for ongoing vigilance. As regards fiscal policies, developments in the euro area remain of concern. While a few countries are succeeding in maintaining sound budgetary positions, in several countries it is essential that fiscal consolidation is given the highest priority in view of the budgetary situation. Moreover, the revised rules and procedures for the Stability and Growth Pact, expected to take effect soon, need to be implemented in a strict manner to ensure credibility and to promote a timely return to sound budgetary positions. With respect to structural reforms, the so-called “Integrated Guidelines” for 2005-2008, covering both the new Broad Economic Policy Guidelines and the new Employment Guidelines, are soon to be adopted. These guidelines for economic and employment policies will, in turn, serve as the basis for action at the EU level and for Member States to draw up national reform programmes by the autumn of this year. The new governance structure of the Lisbon agenda should provide new impetus to structural reforms in Europe. These reforms are vital for Europe's ability to respond to the challenges arising from an ongoing deepening in the global division of labour, the fast process of technological change and the ageing of the population. A determined approach in addressing these challenges and successful communication that convinces the public of the benefits of the reforms hold the key to both improving the economic outlook in the short run and sustaining the prosperity of European citizens in the longer term."
Egypt,2005-06-02,"Press Release June 2, 2005 The Central Bank of Egypt sets its deposit rate at 95 % per annu. In its monthly meeting, the monetary policy committee of the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) decided today to set its key interest rates, the overnight deposit rate and the overnight lending rate, at 95 percent and 125 percent, respectivel. This reduces the overnight interest rates from their current level. The economic recovery in Egypt gained momentum in 2004/2005 driven mainly by strong growth in exports of goods and service. The indicators of real economic activity suggest, on balance, that the recovery continues and that real output growth is now gradually approaching its targeted rat. The annual rate of inflation declined in the first quarter of 200. This was mainly due to the non expansionary monetary policy adopted by the CBE, the sustainability of the new exchange rate regime that lowered inflation expectations, in addition to the decline of the international prices of commodities At the same time, the annual growth rate of the broad money supply in domestic currency (M2D) has increased significantl. However this has mainly been on account of the portfolio shift associated with the gradual disappearance of dollarization since the launching of the inter-bank foreign exchange marke. Growth of bank credit to the private sector is still running at a low leve. Overall the CBE believes that the balance of risks to price stability over the medium term is neutra. The CBE remains committed to take all actions necessary to ensure price stability over the medium ter.

Chile,2005-06-09,"Central Bank of Chile * Press Release 9 June 2005 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided, by unanimous vote, to maintain the monetary policy rate at 3.25% (annual). The information available shows that inflation and economic activity are behaving consistently with the outlook contained in the last Monetary Policy Report. Output continues to grow above its trend, supported by a favorable international scenario and clearly expansionary monetary conditions. In line with projections, trend inflation continues to rise gradually. However, fluctuations in fuel prices and some regulated rates have affected CPI and CPIX inflation (that excludes fuels and perishables). Unit labor costs remain contained, despite the higher increase in hourly wages. The decision to maintain the monetary policy rate on this occasion does not alter the expected gradual reduction of the monetary impulse. The Board believes that this strategy permits to achieve, in the most likely scenario, an inflation rate around 3% per annum in the normal policy horizon of 12 to 24 months. * In case of any discrepancy or difference in interpretation with the Spanish original, the latter prevails."
South Korea,2005-06-09,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (3.25%) for the intermeeting period. (An unofficial English translation based on the Korean original of the decision on monetary policy taken by the Monetary Policy Committee on June 9, 2005 is attached). In the real economy, while exports continue to exhibit steady growth and private consumption appears to be improving, construction investment shows signs of some alleviation of its sluggishness. On the other hand, an improvement of facilities investment has not yet become evident. Meanwhile, the current account is still running a surplus, thanks to that on the goods account. Despite the persistence of high oil prices, both core inflation and consumer price inflation continue to exhibit overall stability as upward pressure from the demand side has been subdued. Nevertheless, real estate prices have continued to rise. In the financial markets, overall liquidity conditions are favorable and loans to small- and medium-sized enterprises and households are increasing. Taking the above economic and financial conditions into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (3.25 percent) for the intermeeting period."
Thailand,2005-06-09,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 9 June 2005 Mr. Bandid Nijathaworn. Deputy Governor (Monetary Stability). Bank of Thailand, announced that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance going forward. The main issues discussed were as follows: 1. Latest data indicated that economic growth had moderated in the first four months of 2005 compared to last year in response to the negative impacts from higher oil prices, natural disasters, and unrest in the southern provinces. Nevertheless the MPC viewed that the economic momentum, especially from public spending, would allow the economy to continue to expand going forward> 2. Pressure on economic stability heightened. Core inflation accelerated from 08 to 12 per cent year-on-year in May and was likely to rise further due in part to higher production costs and tightening labour market conditions. On the external front, the high current account deficit during the first four months of 2005 raised the probability that the current account for the entire year could be in deficit, and further development in this regard should be monitored. The MPC viewed that the economy had expanded reasonably against the backdrop of many negative factors. While the growth momentum was expected to remain, risks to inflation were higher than in the previous MPC meeting. In this light, policy tightening should be implemented at a gradual pace to promote economic stability and sustainable growth in the long term. The MPC therefore decided to raise the 14-day repurchase rate from 225 per cent per annum to 250 per cent per annum effective immediately."
South Africa,2005-06-09,"Since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee there have been a number of developments of significance for monetary policy. Although still at relatively high levels, the international oil price appears to have stabilised somewhat at more moderate levels than in March and April. At the same time there has been a significant strengthening of the US dollar against the euro, which contributed to the recent depreciation of the rand. Domestically, expenditure and credit extension remain robust, while a contraction in the manufacturing sector has resulted in a moderation of overall output growth. Although the inflation outlook has changed somewhat. CPIX inflation is still expected to remain well within the target range during the forecast period. The rate of increase in the consumer price index for metropolitan and other urban areas less mortgage interest cost (CPIX) has remained within the mandated target range of 3-6 per cent since September 2003. Year-on-year CPIX inflation rose from the February low of 3,1 per cent to 3,6 per cent and 3,8 per cent in March and April respectively. This recent upward trend has been due almost entirely to consecutive increases in the petrol price totalling 82 cent per litre in March and April. Most of the short term volatility in the inflation rate over the past few months can be attributed to petrol price developments. If petrol and diesel prices are excluded, annual CPIX inflation increased marginally from 3,2 per cent in February to 3,3 per cent in March and April. The annualised quarter-on-quarter seasonally adjusted rate of increase of CPIX in the first quarter of this year amounted to 2,1 per cent compared to 5,0 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2004. Inflation in the other categories of the CPIX index has remained well contained, although services prices have increased marginally over the past two months, to a year-on-year 6 per cent rate in April compared to 5,6 per cent in February. Goods price inflation over the same period rose from 1,8 per cent to 2,7 per cent. Food price inflation remained subdued at 1,4 per cent in April while prices of furniture, vehicles and clothing and footwear continued to decline. Administered prices (as measured by Statistics South Africa) were strongly influenced by petrol price changes. However if we exclude this component, annual administered price inflation continued its declining trend from 6,9 per cent in February to 6,7 per cent in April, still above the upper end of the inflation target range. The higher international oil prices also had an impact on production price inflation, although the impact was cushioned in part by the rand exchange rate. Year-on-year changes in production prices measured 1,9 per cent and 1,8 per cent in March and April respectively, up from the 1,2 per cent measured in February of this year. The inflation outlook, although still generally favourable, has changed somewhat as a result of a number of recent developments. Perhaps the most significant development since the last MPC meeting has been the behaviour of the rand exchange rate. Since the last meeting the rand has moved from R6,18 against the US dollar to a level of around R6.80 on 9 June, after having reached levels of over R6,90 during May. Although the rand exchange rate was affected primarily by US dollar movements, the rand depreciated moderately against the euro as well. On a trade-weighted basis, the rand has depreciated by about 5,7 per cent since the last meeting. At current levels the rand is within the range in which it traded for much of last year. The move back to this trading range is unlikely to have a significant impact on the inflation outlook. The rand exchange rate is likely to continue to be dominated by US dollar developments. Although US growth estimates for 2005 have been scaled back moderately, it is expected to significantly outperform growth in the euro area. Japan and the UK. Nevertheless significant macroeconomic imbalances remain, contributing to the uncertain outlook for the US dollar. Although the inflation outlook is not expected to be markedly affected by these recent exchange rate developments, in the near term the impact will be seen on the petrol prices which are determined primarily by the international crude oil prices and the exchange rate. The international price of Brent crude oil declined from levels of around US$55 per barrel at the time of the last MPC meeting and stabilised at lower levels, averaging around US$48 per barrel in May. The lower international oil price allowed for a 16 cents per litre petrol price reduction in June, after the further 20 cent per litre increase in May. Although the international oil prices have moved in a relatively narrow trading range over the past few weeks. Brent crude has risen again above the US$50 per barrel level in the past few days, reflecting the uncertainty and volatility in the market. The combination of these higher prices and the current levels of the rand are likely to result in a further increase in the domestic petrol price in July. Domestically, expenditure continues to expand at a robust pace, although there were signs of some moderation in the first quarter of 2005. The twelve-month rate of increase in real retail sales was 6,8 per cent in March, up from the 3,4 and 6,0 per cent increases in January and February respectively, but below the annual average increase of almost 10 per cent in 2004. Motor vehicle sales again reached record levels in May, when a year-on-year increase of 30,7 per cent was recorded. The property market has also remained firm, although the rate of increase in prices has moderated significantly. Higher real disposable incomes, as a result of wage settlements in excess of inflation, together with lower interest rates are likely to give continued support to domestic demand. Provisional estimates show that household debt as a proportion of disposable income rose to 60 per cent in the first quarter of this year compared to 58 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2004. The debt service ratio, however, remains low at around 6,5 per cent. The high levels of expenditure have been reflected in stronger growth in the money supply and credit extension in particular. Growth in M3 has continued at an annual rate of around 12 per cent, although it accelerated by 13,9 per cent in April. M3 deposit holdings of households increased by 9 per cent year-on-year, compared to 16,5 per cent for the corporate sector. The twelve-month growth in total loans and advances increased to 19,7 per cent in April, compared to increases of around 17 per cent in the previous three months. The year-on-year growth in asset-backed credit remained at around 23 per cent in March and April, reflecting the strong demand for durable goods and mortgage advances. Lower inflation expectations remain entrenched, with the latest survey from the Bureau of Economic Research at the University of Stellenbosch showing little change from the previous quarter. Inflation expectations for all categories of respondents are still comfortably within the inflation target range for the next three years. Although there was a slight increase in the forecasts of the market analysts, this was offset by a similar decline in inflation expectations of the trade unionists. Also noteworthy is the fact that new business executive respondents had the same low expectations as those who have participated for some time. Potential pressure on inflation from the supply side of the economy has dissipated. Growth in gross domestic product declined from an annualised rate of 4,0 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2004 to 3,5 per cent in the first quarter of 2005. As expected, the slower growth was due primarily to the 1,9 per cent contraction in the manufacturing sector. This was partly a consequence of the strong rand which impacted negatively on the export and import-competing subsectors of manufacturing. This trend was also reflected in the continued downward trend in the leading business cycle indicator and the decline in manufacturing capacity utilisation from 85,5 per cent in the third quarter of 2004 to 84,6 per cent in the first quarter of this year. The slower rate of growth of 2,7 per cent in the agricultural sector also contributed to the overall slowdown. By contrast, the mining sector grew by an annualised rate of 9,1 per cent. The volume of gold production however declined to its lowest level since the 1930s. When measured over four quarters. GDP growth was 4,2 per cent. The high expenditure growth has also resulted in a higher value of merchandise imports, although the increase of 2,5 per cent in April was significantly less than the 10,1 per cent increase recorded in March. Exports however, which have been increasing steadily since February, rose by 7,1 per cent in April. These developments have resulted in an improvement in the trade balance, and may result in a moderate decline in the overall current account deficit which measured 4 per cent of GDP in the fourth quarter of last year. By the end of May gross foreign exchange reserves had increased to US$17,2 billion, and the international liquidity position had increased to US$13,7 billion. The increase in reserves levels reflects a combination of foreign exchange operations conducted by the Reserve Bank for own account as well as on behalf of customers, including foreign exchange purchases arising from a FDI transaction. Other supportive factors include the benign world inflation, which has been affected only marginally by the higher international oil prices, and continued fiscal discipline in South Africa. Administered price increases are still above the upper end of the inflation target range, but the downward trend continues, although at a slow pace. Food price inflation has remained low while production price developments also indicate that there are few pressures emanating from rising input costs in the short run. The risks to the inflation outlook appear to be fairly evenly balanced. According to the forecasting model of the Bank. CPIX inflation is still expected to remain comfortably within the target range of 3-6 per cent for the forecast period. The central forecast is for CPIX inflation to peak in the first quarter of 2006 at a slightly higher level than previously forecast, and then to decline to a level of around 4,8 per cent at the end of the fourth quarter of 2006. This moderately higher forecast is in part a consequence of revised expectations relating to petrol prices and the exchange rate, and the easing in monetary conditions. Taking all of the above into consideration the Monetary Policy Committee has come to the conclusion that the current monetary policy stance remains appropriate to maintain inflation within the target range. This means that the repo rate remains unchanged at 7 per cent per annum. The MPC will continue as usual to monitor closely all the developments in the economy and the factors influencing inflation, and will stand ready to adjust the stance in either direction if necessary, depending on the outlook for inflation."
Peru,2005-06-15,"Press Release MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JUNE 2005 CENTRAL BANK KEPT REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 3.00% The Board of the Central Bank approved to keep the reference interest rates for the interbank market at 3,00 percent. Thus: The monetary operations of injection and withdrawal of liquidity by means of auctions will be oriented to place the interbank interest rate around 3.00 percent. For direct repos and monetary regulation credits, the rate is kept at 3.75 percent. For overnight deposits, the rate is maintained at 2.25 percent. In this decision it has been considered: The Metropolitan Lima Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 0,1 percent in May. Thus, the CPI inflation over last twelve months diminished from 2,0 percent in April to 1,8 percent in May, being located in the lower section of the inflation target range (between 1,5 percent and 2,5 percent). In turn, the 12-month core inflation decreased from 1,3 to 1,2 percent. The 2005 inflation forecast is maintained at a similar level of the one in the January Inflation Report (2,3 percent). The inflation forecast for the following months shows a transitory fall to a level around the lower limit of the target range (1,5 percent). For 2006 it is projected that the inflation converge to a nearby level of the target range center (2,5 percent). In the first months of the year it's being observed a higher dynamism of the economic activity, explained by the investment, private consumption and exports expansion. The export and import volumes (capital goods and industrial supplies) are above of what was forecasted in the January Inflation Report. Likewise, the terms of trade are above the expectations due to the higher export prices, in spite of the higher oil international prices. If the tendency observed in the economic activity is maintained, it would be expected that the GDP growth rates in 2005 and 2006 be around 5 percent.In case that the interbank interest rate be higher than 3.75 percent, monetary regulation credits and direct repos will be charged with the market interbank interest rate. The interest rates for the following operations in dollars between the Central Bank and the Financial System are: Monetary regulation credits: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point. Overnight deposits: overnight LIBOR minus 3/8 of a percentage point. Swaps: the commission is maintained to a level that implies a minimum annual effective cost of 3.75 percent. Reserve requirement deposits subject to a payment: 2.25 percent. The session in which the Board will approve the following Monthly Monetary Program (July 2005) will be held on July 7th, 2005."
Philippines,2005-06-29,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to keep the BSP's key policy interest rates unchanged at 7.0 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.25 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. During its deliberations on the monetary policy stance, the Monetary Board noted that the outlook for inflation and domestic demand suggests that there is flexibility for monetary authorities to maintain the current policy settings based on the following considerations:. Underlying conditions in the inflation environment continued to be driven mainly by rising oil prices. Meanwhile, demand-side pressures remain largely absent amid evidence of moderating consumption growth, sluggish private credit activity, and general indications of spare capacity in the economy. Inflation expectations, however, appear to be manageable despite resurgence in oil price pressures, the emergent risks from transport fare increase and the impact of the VAT reform in the short run. The Monetary Board, however, noted the need to monitor closely the current pressures in the foreign exchange market. While sentiment-driven and prompted largely by developments in the political front, monetary authorities observed that the volatility in the exchange rate could affect inflation expectations. The prospect of narrowing interest rate differentials given the tightening mode of the US also poses an additional risk to the stability of the currency with potential inflationary impact. Given these considerations, the Monetary Board emphasized that it will continue to monitor indications of inflation expectations to guard against any adverse shift in the public's expectations on future prices and reassured the public that it stands ready to undertake policy action to ensure that inflation remains anchored. At the same time, the Monetary Board emphasized the need to continue to strengthen transparency and communication of policies and prospects of inflation in order to help manage inflation expectations. The Monetary Board also reiterated that direct non-monetary measures to ensure the availability and distribution of basic food products to cushion the price pressures remain crucial."
Poland,2005-06-29,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 29 June, 2005 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL Held on 28-29 June, 2005 The Council decided to lower the NBP interest rates by 0.5 percentage point to the following levels: reference rate 5.0% on an annual basis; lombard rate 6.5 on an annual basis; deposit rate 3.5% on an annual basis; rediscount rate 5.5% on an annual basis, and to change the monetary policy bias to easing. Since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Council the following developments in the external environment of the Polish economy have been observed. The outlook for economic growth in the United States remains positive owing mainly to the sustained high consumption demand growth. The euro area continues to witness stagnation in retail trade and deterioration in consumer confidence indicators. Economic forecasts which have appeared since the last MPC meeting signal a lowering of expected economic growth in the euro area in 2005 and 2006. Most of these forecasts point to a lower than previously expected inflation in the euro area. Oil price increases observed since the Council's last meeting increased the likelihood that high oil prices will persist longer than previously expected. According to the GUS estimates, the annual GDP growth in Poland in 2005 Q1 was 2.1% significantly less than projected in the May Inflation Report and less than envisaged in most other forecasts. A lower than expected economic growth resulted mainly from slower than projected growth of private consumption and a surprising decline in gross fixed capital formation growth. At the same time. May 2005 saw a slower than expected growth of industrial output (0.9% y/y). The marked recovery in construction, which has been evident since mid-2004, has continued. Business confidence signalled in June by enterprises in GUS business surveys has remained broadly unchanged since May. In view of the available GUS data GDP growth in 2005 Q2 has probably not accelerated significantly. Economic data received since the publication of the May Inflation Report suggest that economic growth in 2005 may be significantly lower than expected. The reported slowdown in economic growth is likely to be temporary. Yet, at present it is difficult to assess how long the period of lower growth will last. The data to be released in the coming months should allow a better assessment of the scale of the expected improvement in economic activity and, in consequence, should determine the scale and period of the adjustment in monetary policy. In May 2005, employment in the corporate sector reported a year-on-year growth of 1.6%, while the unemployment rate decreased to 18.3%, i.e. by 1.2 percentage point y/y. Besides, according to the BAEL surveys (Labour Force Survey) the number of working persons in the economy reported a year-on-year increase of 2.2%. It confirms the upward trend in the number of the working persons observed since 2003. The gradual improvement in the labour market is accompanied by a moderate wage growth. In May 2005, the nominal wage growth in the enterprise sector stood at 3.0 % y/y (0.5% y/y in real terms). After a year of decline, an increase in real value of the payroll fund in the corporate sector has been reported for three months, due to rising employment and decreasing inflation. In May 2005, the annual growth of consumer prices decreased to 2.5% y/y against 3.0% recorded in the previous month. This decline in inflation was in line with expectations and it may be expected that inflation in the coming months will fall below the inflation target of 2.5%. A significant drop was also recorded in all core inflation indicators (net inflation amounted to 1.5% y/y as compared with 2.3% recorded in April 2005). Moreover. June 2005 saw a decrease in inflation expectations of households (down to 2.6% from 2.9% in May 2005). The downward trend in producer prices in industry started last year has continued. In May the annual growth of those prices was negative and amounted to -0.5 % y/y (as compared with 0.9% y/y in April 2005). The zloty exchange rate developments in June 2005 have been broadly consistent with the path accounted for in the May Inflation Report. The exchange rate developments may be affected by the situation in the international financial markets and the uncertainty related to the pre-election period. The MPC decision to lower the interest rates was based on the assessment that the balance of risks for future inflation has changed in the direction of lower inflation. The Council maintains its opinion expressed in The Monetary Policy Strategy after 2003 and The Monetary Policy Guidelines for 2005 that the most favourable for Poland would be to adopt an economic strategy focused on creating conditions that guarantee the introduction of the euro at the earliest possible date. Implementation of public finance reforms leading to the meeting of the fiscal convergence criteria is the necessary condition for the euro area membership. However, the numerous legislative proposals put forward in the recent months may cause a widening of the public finance deficit and, in consequence, postpone the compliance with the euro area membership criteria. The next meeting of the Council will be held on 26-27 July 2005."
United States,2005-06-30,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 3-1/4 percent. The Committee believes that, even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity. Although energy prices have risen further, the expansion remains firm and labor market conditions continue to improve gradually. Pressures on inflation have stayed elevated, but longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained. The Committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal. With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan. Chairman; Timothy F Geithner. Vice Chairman; Susan S Bies; Roger W Ferguson. Jr.; Richard W Fisher; Edward M Gramlich; Donald L Kohn; Michael H Moskow; Mark W Olson; Anthony M Santomero; and Gary H Stern. In a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 25-basis-point increase in the discount rate to 4-1/4 percent. In taking this action, the Board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston. New York. Philadelphia. Cleveland. Richmond. Atlanta. Chicago. St. Louis. Minneapolis. Kansas City. Dallas, and San Francisco."
Euroarea,2005-07-07,"The Governing Council of the ECB expresses its deep sympathy and its total solidarity with the British people and the Bank of England in these dreadful circumstances. We have observed a minute of silence in memory of the victims of these terrorist attacks and we convey our sincere condolences to the British people and the Bank of England. The Vice-President and I will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we have concluded that the monetary policy stance is appropriate, given the current outlook for price stability over the medium term. Accordingly, we have decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Across the maturity spectrum, interest rates in the euro area are low by historical standards, in both nominal and real terms, and thus lend ongoing support to economic activity. The Governing Council will continue to monitor carefully all factors that might affect this assessment and remains vigilant with respect to the emergence of risks to price stability over the medium term. In the context of our economic analysis, recent indicators of economic activity in the euro area have, on balance, confirmed that growth has remained subdued. High and rising oil prices in particular appear to have weighed on demand and confidence. On the basis of current information, the growth rate in the second quarter of this year is expected to be lower than the first quarter growth rate of 0.5%, quarter on quarter. Available data are still mixed, with some of the most recent indicators showing a slight improvement, but there are no signs as yet that a more sustained recovery in economic activity has already started. At the same time, looking beyond the short term, there continues to be reason to expect a gradual improvement in economic activity in the euro area. On the domestic side, investment should benefit from the very favourable financing conditions, the robust growth of corporate earnings currently observed and ongoing improvements in corporate efficiency. Consumption growth should evolve broadly in line with expected developments in disposable income. On the external side, ongoing growth in global demand and improvements in euro area price competitiveness should support euro area exports. This assessment is in line with available forecasts and projections. This baseline scenario for growth continues to be surrounded by a good deal of uncertainty. On balance, risks to economic growth lie on the downside and are notably related to the persistence of high oil prices, the low level of confidence prevailing in the euro area and global imbalances. Turning to price developments, annual HICP inflation was 2.1% in June, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, compared with 1.9% in May. Over the next few months annual HICP inflation rates are expected to fluctuate around current levels and may not fall below 2% for the remainder of 2005. This outlook mainly reflects recent developments in oil prices, which were seen as an upside risk in the context of the June 2005 Eurosystem staff inflation projections. However, wage increases have remained contained over recent quarters and, in the context of moderate economic growth and weak labour markets, this trend should continue for the time being. Overall, we continue to see no significant evidence of underlying domestic inflationary pressures building up in the euro area. At the same time, upside risks to this scenario for inflation warrant close monitoring. These risks relate mainly to oil price developments and their potential to lead to second-round effects stemming from wage and price-setting behaviour. It is important that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities. Moreover, uncertainties about future developments in administrative prices and indirect taxes need to be taken into account when assessing currently available inflation projections. Looking at inflation prospects over medium to longer horizons, our assessment is also based on the results of our monetary analysis. In line with developments since mid-2004, monetary and credit growth in the euro area remain strong. The stimulating impact of the low level of interest rates has remained the dominant factor driving monetary developments, as reflected in the strength of M1 growth and the dynamism of loans to the private sector. Overall, monetary developments support the case for vigilance with regard to upward risks to price stability over medium to long-term horizons. To sum up, the economic analysis confirms that domestic inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained in the euro area, while oil price developments in particular imply some upward revisions to the main scenario for price developments. The monetary analysis identifies risks to price stability over the longer term. Overall, cross-checking the information from the two pillars suggests a need for ongoing vigilance in order to maintain inflation expectations in line with price stability. In fact, by keeping medium-term inflation expectations firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability, monetary policy is making a significant contribution towards a recovery in economic growth. Prudent fiscal policies could provide considerable support for confidence in the euro area. The discussions on revising the Stability and Growth Pact regulations have been concluded and rigorous implementation is now key to ensuring an effective framework for fiscal policy coordination and discipline. This is all the more true as current and projected fiscal deficits in several euro area countries still need to be addressed with rigour. In a number of cases these deficits not only imply a rising debt ratio, but also leave no safety margin for short-term budgetary relief in the event of adverse developments. In this context, as significant revisions of past deficit and debt figures have been reported for a few countries, let me also reiterate previous calls by the Governing Council for the reliable compilation and timely reporting of government finance statistics. Finally, let me conclude with a few words on structural reform. As we have stressed repeatedly, a decisive and comprehensive set of measures aimed at achieving a more dynamic and competitive European economy with flexible labour and product markets is urgently needed. The primary objective of such measures is to deal with the ongoing challenges from globalisation, rapid technological change and ageing populations and, overall, to ensure greater resilience to shocks. Successful structural reforms would, however, also contribute to fostering the adjustment processes within the euro area. In particular, they would allow those member countries with a weaker record in terms of economic growth and employment creation to perform better in the future. As regards existing growth and inflation differentials within the euro area, there is clear evidence that the dispersion of inflation and real GDP growth rates in the euro area is not materially different from that of the United States and it does not show any signs of having increased since 1999. However, in cases where differences are not due to catching-up processes or temporary factors, structural reforms are even more necessary to enhance economic performance and flexibility in the adjustment process."

South Korea,2005-07-07,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (3.25%) for the intermeeting period. (An unofficial English translation based on the Korean original of the decision on monetary policy taken by the Monetary Policy Committee on July 7, 2005 is attached). In the real economy, while exports continue to exhibit steady growth, private consumption maintains a growing pace and construction investment appears to be recovering. On the other hand, an improvement of facilities investment has not yet become evident. Meanwhile, the current account is still running a surplus, thanks to that on the goods account. Despite the persistence of high oil prices, both consumer price inflation and core inflation continue to exhibit overall stability as upward pressure from the demand side has been subdued. Nevertheless, real estate prices have continued to show a relatively rapid rise. In the financial markets, overall liquidity conditions are favorable and financial institutions' loans, centered on housing finance loans, have shown a sharp increase. Taking the above economic and financial conditions into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (3.25 percent) for the intermeeting period."
Romania,2005-07-08,"The Board of the National Bank of Romania (NBR) has decided to:. In its meeting on 8 July 2005, the NBR Board approved the free access of residents to opening current and deposit accounts abroad. The move is an important step towards achieving full convertibility of the leu (RON) and is in line with the principle of gradual capital account liberalization - first inflows, then outflows. Under the schedule agreed upon with the European Union. Romania is to achieve full convertibility by 1 September 2006, a deadline by which liberalization of access to operations in money market instruments should be completed, given their higher volatile potential. The 11 April move to allow non-residents' access to leu-denominated time deposits has proceeded smoothly, with the lower interest rate differential stemming excessive inflows of short-term capital. However, steady capital inflows (from investments, capital transfers and remittances) in the last few months have continued to put some upward pressure on the leu. The NBR believes that allowing residents to open current and deposit accounts abroad - a decision due to take effect after the publication of the revised foreign exchange regulations in the Official Gazette - will help ease the upward pressure on the leu. The NBR Board also assessed the developments in the monetary area and the real economy in the first part of the year. The analysis of macroeconomic indicators shows that economic growth has remained robust. However, the increase in domestic demand still significantly exceeds the domestic supply's response capacity, thereby sharpening the external imbalance. The disinflation process has registered a pause primarily as a result of supply-side shocks (steep adjustments in administered and fuel prices as well as in excise duties) but also due to pressures on the aggregate demand side. Developments in monetary indicators highlight that the remonetisation of the economy has continued. Money supply (M2) saw a 33.4 percent year-on-year increase in real terms in May. Lending has remained on an upward path, with non-government credit advancing by 25.9 percent in real terms in May against the same year-ago period. The analysis of non-government credit structure reveals the persistence of certain risks which could generate imbalances in the economy. The dynamics of foreign currency-denominated loans (which hit a nine-year high in May) outran the growth of leu-denominated credit, despite the March tightening of reserve requirements on foreign currency liabilities and the significant decrease in interest rates on leu lending. The continuous upswing in foreign currency borrowings poses potential risks to macroeconomic and financial stability -- it reduces monetary policy effectiveness, stimulates imports and may increase foreign exchange risks in the banking sector, leading, over time, to an asset-liability mismatch. In this context, the NBR Board agreed the need for additional measures to discourage foreign currency lending, improve non-government credit structure and prevent potential prudential risks. These measures -- which imply changes in reserve requirements and in the norms limiting household lending risk -- are aimed at containing the potential risks to the economy and the banking sector as a whole, and at ensuring a healthy and sustainable long-run credit growth. The NBR Board decided to apply a 30 percent reserve ratio on all foreign currency-denominated liabilities irrespective of their maturity and the date they had been raised. This measure will be implemented in two stages: for the 24 July-23 August 2005 maintenance period, a 15 percent ratio on foreign-currency liabilities with maturities longer than two years which were raised before 23 February 2005 included will apply, while the 30 percent ratio will apply to the above mentioned liabilities starting with 24 August-23 September 2005 maintenance period. The NBR Board also decided to reduce to 16 percent from 18 percent the reserve ratio on leu-denominated liabilities with maturities of up to two years, starting from the 24 August -23 September 2005 maintenance period. It also changed the norms on limiting household lending risk. The revised regulations will come into force 30 days after their publication in the Official Gazette. Basically, the norms set a monthly debt service ceiling to the equivalent of 40 percent of net monthly incomes of the borrower or, as the case may be, his/her family. The ceiling covers all payment commitments under all types of credits (mortgage, real-estate and consumer loans) or similar contracts, such as leasing. Moreover, the monthly debt service ceiling related to consumer and real-estate credits, irrespective of the creditor, shall not exceed 30 percent and 35 percent respectively of net monthly income of the borrower or, as the case may be, of his/her family. In order to increase the efficiency of these norms and in line with the memorandum agreed with the International Monetary Fund, the Romanian authorities are planning to draft new legislation to set minimum standards for licensing, regulation and supervision of non-bank financial institutions. The National Bank of Romania will continue to closely monitor monetary and macroeconomic trends in order to appropriately use its instruments with the aim of maintaining the prudent monetary policy stance needed to attain its medium- and long-term inflation targets."
Chile,2005-07-12,"Central Bank of Chile Press Release* 12 July 2005 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to raise the monetary policy rate by 25 basis points, to 3.5% (annual). The new information available shows that output growth continues above its trend, supported by monetary conditions in Chile that continue to be clearly expansionary, and by a favorable international scenario, despite high oil prices. Investment has continued to grow with unexpected strength, while employment is increasing rapidly, which favors the dynamism of consumption. Monthly CPI inflation has been higher than forecast in the last Monetary Policy Report, due to the incidence of increases in the prices of fuels, some regulated rates and perishables. However, trend inflation continues to rise gradually, in line with projections. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy in order to maintain forecast inflation around 3% per annum in the normal policy horizon of 12 to 24 months. * In case of any discrepancy or difference in interpretation, the Spanish original prevails."
Peru,2005-07-15,"Press Release MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JULY 2005 CENTRAL BANK KEPT REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 3.00% The Board of the Central Bank approved to keep the reference interest rates for the interbank market at 3,00 percent. It was also approved to maintain the lending and deposit interest rates of the Central Bank operations: For direct repos and monetary regulation credits, the rate is kept at 3.75 percent. For overnight deposits, the rate is maintained at 2.25 percent. In this decision it has been considered: The Metropolitan Lima Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 0,26 percent in June. Thus, the CPI inflation over last twelve months diminished from 1,8 percent in May to 1,5 percent in June, in line with the May Inflation Report. This level corresponds to the lower section of the inflation target range (1,5 percent). In turn, the 12-month core inflation decreased from 1,2 to 0,9 percent. The 2005 inflation forecast is maintained at a similar level of the one in the May Inflation Report. The path of the forecasted inflation shows that this would be maintained for more months around the lower limit of the inflation target range, before initiating its convergence toward its goal, what would be achieved during 2006. The main macroeconomic forecasts of the May Inflation Report are maintained. Domestic economy continues growing consistently and it is estimated that economic activity would be expanded around 6,0 percent in the second quarter and 5,0 percent in 2005. In case that the interbank interest rate be higher than 3.75 percent, monetary regulation credits and direct repos will be charged with the market interbank interest rate. The interest rates for the following operations in dollars between the Central Bank and the Financial System are: Monetary regulation credits: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point.Overnight deposits: overnight LIBOR minus 3/8 of a percentage point. Swaps: the commission is maintained to a level that implies a minimum annual effective cost of 3.75 percent. Reserve requirement in foreign currency subject to a payment: 2.25 percent. The session in which the Board will approve the following Monthly Monetary Program (August 2005) will be held on August 4th, 2005. -2-."
Thailand,2005-07-20,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 20 July 2005 Ms. Atchana Waiquamdee. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand, announced that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance. The main issues discussed were as follows: 1. Latest data indicated that economic growth had moderated in the first 5 months of 2005 in response to the impacts from higher oil prices and natural disasters. The MPC however expected the economy to regain momentum going forward, partly as a result of exports and public spending. Surging oil prices affected economic stability, causing the current account to register a larger deficit and core and headline inflation to accelerate. Moreover inflation was poised to rise further following the float of domestic diesel oil price and upward adjustments in consumer prices and the minimum wage. The MPC viewed that output would continue to expand but the probability of core inflation exceeding the target range became greater. As a result, the policy rate should remain on an upward trend to keep core inflation under control and support sustainable growth in the long term. The MPC therefore decided to raise the 14-day repurchase rate from 250 per cent per annum to 275 per cent per annum effective immediately."
Israel,2005-07-25,"25.7.2005 The Bank of Israel's Interest Rate for August 2005 Remains Unchanged at 3.5 percent  The Bank ofIsrael today announced that in the context of its monetary program for August 2005 the interest rate will remain unchanged at 3.5 percent. This decision is based on the assessment that in the current circumstances the presentlevel of the Bank of Israel interest rate is consistent with an inflation rate expected to be close to the midpoint of the government's price-stability target of between 1 percent and 3 percent inflation a year. Regarding the factors which could affect assessments of inflation in the future, the Bank notes that the effect of the recent depreciation of the NIS on the future path of inflation is to increase the probability that inflation willremain close to the midpoint of the target, as it seems that prices will rise faster in the second half of the year than they did in the first. The rate of expansion of real economic activity does not appear to carry with it the threat of inflationary pressures that could endanger the achievement of the price-stability target. Fiscal discipline has gained the public's confidence and is reflected in lower yields in the bond market than in the past, and contributes to economic stability. Developments in the global markets, including changes expected in interest rates and rises in oil prices, have not affected inflation expectations, which are within the target range. Although uncertainty with regard to the economic implications of possible geopolitical developments has risen, it has not led to a change in assessments of future inflation. The Bank ofIsrael will continue to keep its interest-rate policy under constant review, with the aim of achieving the inflation target set by the government andof avoiding deviations from it, both upward and downward, and of supporting the whole range of objectives of macroeconomic policy. The risk premium, as measured by the 5-year credit-default-swap (CDS) market, was about 28 basis points in June, similar to its level a month earlier.

Philippines,2005-07-27,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the BSP's key policy interest rates steady at 7.0 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.25 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. In its assessment of the outlook for inflation and macroeconomic conditions, the Monetary Board noted that inflation continues to be caused mainly by oil prices as well as the recent adjustments in transport fares and wages. Meanwhile, demand conditions are characterized by moderate economic growth due to a slowdown in consumer spending in the first quarter. At the same time, the Monetary Board recognizes that the volatility in the foreign exchange market could affect the inflation outlook. Given indications of slower output performance, the monetary authorities stressed monetary policy shall be used only to address persistent volatility of the peso which will have an inflation impact. With the earlier policy move to raise the reserve requirements to help keep liquidity in check, the BSP continues to monitor the level of money supply to ensure an appropriate level of liquidity. The Monetary Board also noted the narrowing differentials between the domestic and foreign interest rates that can potentially have an effect on foreign exchange flows, exchange rate and ultimately, inflation. Moreover, the monetary authorities underscored their readiness to act preemptively to curb any possible build-up in inflation expectations. The Monetary Board also reiterated that it will continue to support the use of direct non-monetary measures that would ensure greater availability and timely distribution of basic food products to cushion pressures on consumer prices."
Poland,2005-07-27,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 27 July 2005 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL Held on 26-27 July 2005 The Council decided to lower the NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage point to the following levels: reference rate 4.75% on an annual basis; lombard rate 6.25% on an annual basis; deposit rate 3.25% on an annual basis; rediscount rate 5.25% on an annual basis; The Council maintains its easing monetary policy bias. The following developments in the external environment of the Polish economy have been observed since the last meeting of the Council. The improvement in the business conditions in the United States, which was to a large extent driven by a strong increase in consumption demand, points to a better outlook for economic growth in this country than it was the case a month ago. The euro area saw a rise in confidence indicators in industry; however still no signs of improvement in consumption demand are visible. The latest forecasts indicate a slight lowering in the expected rate of economic growth in the euro area in 2005 and 2006 as compared to the expectations from June 2005. The prices of crude oil forecast for 2005-2007 reported further increases. The current forecasts show that starting from 2005 Q3 oil prices will remain at a considerably higher level than it was expected in the May Inflation Report and before the previous meeting of the Council in June. This increase in crude oil prices raises the risk of inflation growth and also of a weakening in economic growth in the USA and euro area alike. The analysis of available data indicates that GDP growth rate in 2005 Q2 proved higher than in the previous quarter, yet lower than anticipated in the May Report. According to GUS data, industrial output in June 2005 was growing faster than expected, amounting to 6.8% y/y in real terms. Allowing for seasonal factors (primarily for the larger number of business days this June compared with the previous year), the rise in industrial production according to the GUS stood at 3.9% y/y and was markedly higher than in May (1.5%) and in April 2005 (decrease of 1.6%). Also higher than expected was the nominal growth rate of retail sales, which stood at 10.5% y/y (8.8% y/y in real terms). The visible recovery in construction observed since the mid-2004 has been continued. The annual growth in construction and assembly output in June amounted to 29.9% y/y (according to the GUS  to 24.4% y/y in seasonally adjusted terms) and also outpaced the ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51, expectations. Enterprises' assessments of economic climate as signalled in GUS business tendency surveys are still positive and close to those recorded in June. Available data may confirm the Council's expectations from June 2005 that the economic growth deceleration in 2005 Q1, signalled by the GUS, is temporary in nature. The data to be released in the coming months should allow for a better assessment of the scale of the expected improvement in economic activity. There has been a gradual improvement in the labour market. In June 2005 employment in the enterprise sector was 1.7% y/y higher, while the unemployment rate slid to18% (i.e. by 1.4 percentage points in year-on-year terms). June 2005 also brought a gradual acceleration in wage growth rate. The pace of the rise in nominal wages in the enterprise sector amounted to 4.5% y/y and 3.0% y/y in real terms, i.e. was at its highest level since March 2004. Even higher rises were recorded in real payroll fund in the enterprise sector, which was supported by the continuing growth in employment in the sector (of 1.7% y/y). At the moment it is difficult to assess whether the increased wage growth rate in June 2005 will be upheld later this year as well. Still, it has to be emphasised that maintaining the present low growth rate of unit labour costs is the necessary condition of sustained acceleration in economic growth based to a larger extent on the rise of employment. In June 2004 the annual growth rate of consumer prices fell down to 1.4% (compared with 2.5% in the previous month), and so it landed below the lower limit for deviations from the inflation target. This steep slump in the annual inflation index in June was, similarly as in May, anticipated and mainly resulted from the evaporation of the impact of the one-off and transitory increase in prices associated with Poland's EU accession. The rise led to keeping the annual inflation rates at a temporarily higher level. It can be expected that in the months to come inflation will remain low, i.e. markedly below the target of 2.5%. However, there exists a risk of higher inflationary pressure related to increased forecasts of oil and gas prices, even though this may also lead to the dampening of economic growth. June 2005 also saw a decline in all indices of core inflation (net inflation in June stood at 1.4% y/y compared to 1.5% in May 2005). Additionally, in July 2005 inflation expectations of households decreased (down to 2.2% from 2.6% in June 2005). The growth rate of producer prices in industry has remained low and in June stood at 0.1% y/y. The developments in zloty exchange rate in June 2005 were broadly consistent with the exchange rate path accounted for in the May Inflation Report. The future exchange rate developments may be affected by the situation in international financial markets and also by the uncertainty associated with the pre-election period in Poland. In the Council's assessment, in spite of the fact that data on economic activity in June 2005 proved better than expected and despite higher forecast prices of fuels, the probability of inflation running below the inflation target in the monetary policy transmission horizon still exceeds the probability of its moving above the target. The Council maintains its opinion that the most favourable course of action for Poland would be to adopt an economic strategy focused on creating conditions that would guarantee the introduction of the euro at the earliest possible date. Implementation of public finance reforms leading to the meeting of the fiscal convergence criteria is the necessary condition for the euro area membership. However, the numerous legislative proposals passed or put forward in the recent months may cause a widening of the public finance deficit and, in consequence, postpone the compliance with the euro area membership criteria. The next meeting of the Council will be held on 30-31 August 2005."

Romania,2005-08-08,"The Board of the National Bank of Romania (NBR) has decided to:. In its meeting of August 8, 2005, the NBR Board analyzed the latest developments in macroeconomic indicators and their prospects in the context of the official shift to the inflation targeting strategy. The inflation targeting strategy has as its fundamental objective ensuring and maintaining aggregate price level stability, all monetary policy instruments available to the central bank being employed to this end. This requires increased transparency and consistency of monetary policy messages, while the signaling role of the policy rate gains in importance. Therefore, the NBR Board has decided to eliminate the temporary departure between the monetary policy rate (the maximum level for money market deposit taking) and its effective sterilization rate (at which it actually drains liquidity from the market) by unifying these at the level of 8.5 percent per year, effective starting August 9, 2005. This departure arose in the context of preparations for the April 2005 step of capital account liberalization. The NBR Board has also approved the first quarterly Inflation Report which assesses developments in macroeconomic indicators, identifies the main challenges and constraints in implementing monetary policy and presents the inflation outlook. The report, along with the specifics of the direct inflation targeting regime and the schedule of NBR Board policy meetings will be presented to the public on the occasion of the press conference programmed for August 15, 2005. The NBR Board believes that a prudent monetary policy stance should be continued, given the expectations that inflationary pressures will be present in the short run, as well as the need to prevent the risk of increasing volatile capital inflows."
United States,2005-08-09,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 3-1/2 percent. The Committee believes that, even after this action, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity. Aggregate spending, despite high energy prices, appears to have strengthened since late winter, and labor market conditions continue to improve gradually. Core inflation has been relatively low in recent months and longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained, but pressures on inflation have stayed elevated. The Committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal. With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan. Chairman; Timothy F Geithner. Vice Chairman; Susan S Bies; Roger W Ferguson. Jr.; Richard W Fisher; Donald L Kohn; Michael H Moskow; Mark W Olson; Anthony M Santomero; and Gary H Stern. In a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 25-basis-point increase in the discount rate to 4-1/2 percent.

Chile,2005-08-11,"Central Bank of Chile Press Release* 11 August 2005 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to raise the monetary policy rate by 25 basis points, to 3.75% (annual). The available information shows that output growth continues above trend and domestic expenditure is growing strongly. The international scenario continues to be favorable, despite the fact that oil price is still increasing. Domestically, monetary conditions continue to be clearly expansionary and investment is growing vigorously. Employment is increasing rapidly, which favors stronger consumption dynamism. CPI inflation exceeded 3% sooner than forecast, mainly due to the incidence of increased fuel prices and some regulated rates. However, the various trend inflation measures are normalizing, leaving behind the unusually low levels of the past few quarters. The Board considers that, in the most likely scenario, it will continue to reduce the prevailing monetary stimulus, in order to maintain expected inflation around 3% per annum in the normal policy horizon. * In case of any discrepancy or difference in interpretation, the Spanish original prevails."
South Africa,2005-08-11,"The South African economy is continuing to show signs of robust growth and inflation has remained at low levels. Since the last meeting of the MPC, international oil prices have risen to new highs, the rand exchange rate has appreciated moderately and domestic expenditure has remained strong. Oil price increases could be a major source of inflation pressure and pose the greatest risk to future inflation outcomes. Improved international perceptions of South Africa have been reflected in developments during the past two months. The recent ratings upgrade by Standard and Poor's of South Africa's external debt rating to BBB+, the completion of the purchase by Barclays Bank plc of a controlling share in Absa Bank and the recent successful conclusion by the SA Reserve Bank with 33 banks of a $1.5 billion dual-term syndicated loan facility at far more favourable margins reflect the growing positive sentiment towards South Africa by international investors. In conjunction with the higher level of foreign exchange reserves, such developments can be expected to underpin a greater degree of stability of the macroeconomic environment. Inflation as measured by the consumer price index for metropolitan and other urban areas excluding the interest cost on mortgage bonds (CPIX) has remained within the inflation target range of 3-6 per cent for the past 22 months. For the past three months. CPIX inflation has been below the market consensus forecasts. In June. CPIX inflation was 3,5 per cent, down from the 3,9 per cent measured the previous month. The lower inflation has become increasingly broad-based, and a significantly larger number of categories of goods and services are now within the inflation target range. Prices have continued to decline in a number of categories, including clothing and footwear, furniture and equipment and some food items such as vegetables and grain. Although services inflation has been declining in recent months there is still a significant difference between goods inflation and services inflation. In June, for example, services inflation measured 6,1 per cent compared to 2 per cent for goods inflation. Although the decline in services inflation has been slow, it nevertheless compares favourably with the 7,0 per cent measured in June 2004. Part of the sluggishness of services inflation can be attributed to the behaviour of administered prices excluding petrol. Although administered price inflation declined significantly from the middle of 2003, since mid-2004 it has remained relatively unchanged. In May and June 2005, administered price inflation excluding petrol measured 7,0 and 6,9 per cent respectively. Production price inflation has also remained subdued. In June 2005, the percentage change over twelve months was 2,3 per cent, compared to 2,4 per cent the previous month. Although imported goods prices showed an increase from 1,8 per cent to 3,4 per cent from May to June, prices of goods produced domestically rose at a year-on-year rate of 1,9 per cent, down from 2,6 per cent the previous month. This decline was mainly a result of falling prices in the agricultural sector. The central outlook for inflation remains generally favourable and CPIX inflation is expected to remain within the 3 to 6 per cent target range for the forecast period to the end of 2007. Although the inflation rate over the past few months has been below 4 per cent, it is expected to increase over the next few months, partly as a result of the higher petrol prices. According to our central forecast. CPIX inflation will begin to rise moderately and peak in the first quarter of 2006 marginally below 5,5 per cent, whereafter it is expected to decline moderately. This is marginally higher than the previous forecast and reflects changes in oil price and exchange rate assumptions. The favourable inflation outlook is underpinned by a number of factors which have improved since the previous meeting. These include the low food price and producer price inflation, and the lower than expected inflation outcomes referred to above. Since the last MPC meeting there has been a moderate appreciation of the exchange rate of the rand. At the time of the June meeting the rand was trading at a level of around R6,80 to the US dollar. Since then the dollar has weakened against the euro. Having reached a level below US$1,19 to the euro, the dollar is currently trading at levels of around US$1,24. This development explains in part the strengthening of the rand exchange rate to current levels of around R6,37. A further factor that contributed to the strengthening of the rand was the ratings upgrade from Standard and Poor's. On a trade-weighted basis, the rand appreciated by 6,8 per cent in the period following the last MPC meeting, although it has depreciated by 6,1 per cent since the beginning of the year. The rand will continue to be influenced mainly by dollar developments, which remain uncertain. The trend of wage settlements and unit labour costs are closely watched by the MPC. At the April meeting we commented on the divergence between wage settlement trends and unit labour cost trends. Although we would not expect these two measures to coincide exactly, they should move in broadly the same direction. Since then there has been greater consistency in the two measures. In the first quarter of 2005, unit labour costs in the non-agricultural sectors increased by 5,9 per cent, compared to the first quarter of 2004. This was a decline from the revised figure of 9,8 per cent measured in the fourth quarter of 2004. Average wage settlements, as surveyed by Andrew Levy Employment Publications, were 6 per cent for the first half of 2005, compared to 6,8 per cent in 2004 as a whole. Although it is too early to tell if this lower trend will continue, it is a positive development from an inflation perspective. However, much will depend on the outcome of the current round of wage negotiations that are taking place in a number of sectors. Fiscal policy continues to be supportive of monetary policy. Despite the mildly expansionary budget tabled in February this year, the tax revenues in the current fiscal year have to date significantly exceeded budgeted revenues, primarily as a result of higher-than-expected corporate taxes. Expenditure is broadly in line with budget. Given the volatility of expenditures and revenues, it is probably premature to draw firm conclusions about the likely fiscal outcome for the year, but it appears unlikely that the budgeted deficit will be exceeded. International developments remain broadly supportive of a favourable inflation environment. Although there are some signs of inflation pressures in a number of countries related to oil price increases, the longer term outlook remains benign. Interest rate trends have varied, and in general, interest rates in fast-growing countries such as the United States have been increasing, while those in the slower-growing economies have either remained unchanged, as in the euro area, or have recently declined, as in the United Kingdom and Sweden. There are however a number of threats to the inflation outlook. The most significant emanates from the international oil prices which have reached new record highs in recent days. The monthly average spot price of Brent crude oil increased from US$53,86 per barrel in June to US$57,49 in July. Since then prices have breached the US$64 per barrel level, and prices for future delivery over the next three months are currently above this level as well. These price increases have occurred despite several increases since 2004 in the official production quotas of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). The full impact of these developments are yet to be reflected in the inflation numbers. In July and August the petrol price increased by a total of almost 60 cents per litre, and the current underrecovery points to a further possible increase in September. The recent strengthening of the rand against the dollar has, however, helped to mitigate the impact of the rise in international crude oil prices on domestic petrol prices. Although GDP growth figures for the second quarter of the year are not yet available, indications are that the real economy has continued to grow at a robust pace. The composite leading business cycle indicator has increased significantly since March of this year and initial indications are that this indicator will increase further in June. Manufacturing production appears to have recovered from the slowdown experienced at the end of 2004. Manufacturing production increased by 3,2 per cent in the second quarter of 2005, following a contraction of 1,9 per cent in the first quarter. The Investec/BER Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), which reached its highest level ever in June, indicates that this recovery is expected to remain intact. The various business confidence and trade activity indices also show that expectations are strongly positive. Mining production has also remained strong, with the seasonally adjusted physical volume of total mining production for the three months to May 2005 reflecting a 4,1 per cent increase compared to the preceding three months. According to surveys, consumer confidence is also still at a high level, and consumption expenditure appears to be continuing at a strong pace. New vehicle sales peaked at record levels of 31 per cent year-on-year growth in June, although this rate of increase declined to 19,4 per cent July. Retail sales grew in real terms by 4,8 per cent in May 2005 compared with May 2004. The housing market, although still strong, has shown signs of moderation. House prices increased at an annual rate of 21,4 per cent in July of this year having peaked at an annual rate of increase of over 35 per cent in September 2004. The month-on-month increase is now less than one per cent, down from 3 per cent in January 2004. The continued high levels of expenditure are still being reflected in the rates of growth in money supply and credit extension. The twelve-month growth in M3 accelerated from 15 per cent in April 2005 to 17,1 per cent in June. Growth in total loans and advances to the private sector increased from 19,7 per in April to 22,1 per cent in June, driven primarily by an increase in asset-backed credit, in particular mortgage advances, which grew at an annual rate of 26,6 per cent in June. The robust expenditure has been reflected in part in increases in imports. However because the increase in the value of merchandise exports exceeded that of merchandise imports, the trade deficit in the second quarter of 2005 narrowed, and the current account deficit, which measured 3,8 per cent of GDP in the first quarter, is expected to contract moderately as well. Non-resident net purchases of bonds and equities have amounted to almost R40 billion in the year to date. Capital inflows increased in the second quarter compared to the first quarter, implying that the current account deficit was comfortably financed, and allowed for further reserve accumulation. At the end of July, gross reserves in the balance sheet of SA Reserve Bank had increased to US$18,9 billion, and the international liquidity position to US$15,4 billion. Although the outlook for inflation is generally favourable as described above, the Monetary Policy Committee has decided that it would be inappropriate at this stage to change the monetary policy stance in view of the risks to the inflation outlook. The repo rate therefore remains unchanged at 7 per cent per annum. The MPC will continue as usual to monitor closely all the developments in the economy and the factors influencing inflation, and will stand ready to adjust the stance in either direction if necessary, depending on the outlook for inflation."
Peru,2005-08-15,"Press Release MONETARY PROGRAM FOR AUGUST 2005 CENTRAL BANK KEPT REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 3.00% The Board of the Central Bank approved to keep the reference interest rates for the interbank market at 3,00 percent. It was also approved to maintain the lending and deposit interest rates for the Central Bank operations: For direct repos and monetary regulation credits, the rate is kept at 3.75 percent. For overnight deposits, the rate is maintained at 2.25 percent. In this decision it has been considered: The Metropolitan Lima Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 0,10 percent in July. Thus, the CPI inflation over last twelve months diminished from 1,5 percent in June to 1,4 percent in July. In turn, the 12-month core inflation was maintained at 0,9 percent. The CPI inflation forecast shows that this would be located for more months around the lower limit of the inflation target range, gradually converging toward the center of the range. The economy grows at a sustained rhythm, without inflationary pressures. It is estimated that the economic activity have expanded approximately in 6,0 percent in the first semester of 2005 and it is projected to grow around 5,0 percent during the second semester of the year. In case that the interbank interest rate be higher than 3.75 percent, monetary regulation credits and direct repos will be charged with the market interbank interest rate. The interest rates for the following operations in dollars between the Central Bank and the Financial System are: Monetary regulation credits: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point. Overnight deposits: overnight LIBOR minus 3/8 of a percentage point. Swaps: the commission is maintained to a level that implies a minimum annual effective cost of 3.75 percent.Reserve requirement in foreign currency subject to a payment: 2.25 percent. The session in which the Board will approve the following Monetary Program (September 2005) will be held on September 1st, 2005. -2-."
Malaysia,2005-08-24,"In 2005, the economy is still expected to grow at close to its potential despite a more challenging international environment. A major uncertainty over global growth is the likely impact of persistently high global oil prices. Nevertheless, continued growth in Malaysia's major export markets, combined with sustained domestic consumption will continue to support growth. Recent data have shown inflation edging up, reflecting adjustments to rising costs resulting from higher input prices. The inflation level is expected to continue to be affected by cost-driven factors, given the sustained high global oil prices. The cumulative impact of previous price adjustments will cause inflation to peak in the third quarter of 2005, and to moderate thereafter. Productivity increases, capacity expansions and competitive pressures are playing a strong mitigating role in containing inflationary pressures. In an environment where inflation has increased, the level of monetary accommodation will be balanced to ensure that the maximum sustainable growth is achieved in an environment of price stability. Given the uncertainties associated with both the inflation and economic outlook, particularly in relation to the impact of high oil prices, the balance of these risks will be closely monitored in setting the future course of monetary policy. The Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) is maintained at its current level of 2.70%. Bank Negara Malaysia 24 August 2005."
Philippines,2005-08-24,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board maintained the BSP's key policy interest rates at 7.0 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.25 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. In its assessment of inflation and macroeconomic conditions, the Monetary Board noted that the outlook for inflation remains unchanged. Current forecasts continue to reflect the dominant impact of high oil prices. A modest deceleration in inflation is expected in the second half of 2005, helped in part by the recent easing in food prices. Nevertheless, average inflation is still likely to exceed the target for both 2005 and 2006. Significant monetary tightening could only reduce demand rather than address directly the key factor behind rising consumer prices, namely oil prices. While BSP surveys show that the firms continue to expect an increase in inflation, consumer expectations seem to have eased somewhat. This highlights the continued importance of anchoring inflation expectations, particularly given the likelihood of a continued increase in oil prices. Greater attention will be given to publicly communicating the evolving assessment for future inflation alongside the BSP's overall policy message. Non-monetary measures, as always, should continue to be pursued to the greatest extent possible. The principal emerging risk to the economy at present may be to output. Continued pressures on prices may prompt a cutback in consumption spending, which remains the key driver of aggregate demand. Under such conditions, the monetary policy stance should provide enough room to allow demand to continue to grow in order to balance out the expected contractionary impact of rising oil prices. Liquidity conditions in the financial system will continue to receive close attention from monetary authorities because of their implications on activity in the foreign exchange market and consequently inflation. The continued narrowing of interest rate differentials may affect the foreign exchange market. However, official response to instability in the foreign exchange market will be undertaken if there is a threat to the inflation target. The Monetary Board reiterates that it remains committed to the BSP's inflation objectives and will continue to closely monitor the evolving conditions for consumer prices, aggregate demand, domestic liquidity and other factors in order to determine the appropriate stance of monetary policy."
Poland,2005-08-31,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 31 August 2005 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL Held on 30-31 August 2005 The Council decided to lower the NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage point, excluding the rediscount rate which was lowered by 0.50 percentage point, to the following levels: (cid:131) reference rate 4.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate 6.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate 3.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate 4.75% on an annual basis. The Council maintains its easing monetary policy bias. Since the last meeting of the Council, the outlook for economic growth and inflation in the euro area and the United States has not changed significantly. However, due to persistently high oil prices in world markets there has been an acceleration in consumer and producer prices in the United States and in producer prices in the euro area. In August crude oil prices reported another significant climb. Moreover, most analytical centres considerably increased their forecasts of oil prices for the coming years. There persists a large uncertainly about the scale of decrease in economic growth as well as about the rise in inflation caused by a considerable accumulated oil price increase. According to GUS (CSO) estimates. Poland's GDP growth rate in 2005 Q2 was higher than in 2005 Q1 both in year-on-year and quarterly terms allowing for seasonal factors. The annual GDP growth in 2005 Q2 amounted to 2.8% and was consistent with expectations. However, the structure of this growth was significantly different from expectations. Slightly lower than expected was the growth in individual consumption and investments. Considerably lower than anticipated was the contribution of inventories to GDP growth. At the same time, the contribution of net exports proved much higher than expected. Net exports  despite the strong appreciation of the zloty in 2004 and at the beginning of 2005  were the main demand factor of economic growth in 2005 Q2. It can be expected that economic growth in the second half of 2005 will be gradually increasing. July 2005 brought a smaller than expected rise in industrial output (of 2.6% y/y), however, allowing for seasonal factors, the rise in industrial output equalled 4.7% y/y and thus was the greatest since the beginning of the year. The recovery in construction, observed since 2004, has been continued. The annual growth in the construction and assembly production in July 2005 amounted to 17.4%. Enterprises' assessments of economic climate as signalled in GUS business tendency surveys remain positive and close to those recorded in July. In 2005 Q2 the number of persons working in the economy (in entities with over 9 employees) rose by 1.2% in annual terms. In July 2005 the employment in the enterprise sector rose by 1.8% y/y, while the unemployment rate slid to 17.9%, i.e. by 1.4 percentage point in year-on-year terms. According to NBP business tendency survey the number of enterprises intending to increase their employment in 2005 Q3 surpasses the number of those planning to reduce it, though the net balance of forecasts is slightly lower than one year ago. In 2005 Q2 the rise in nominal wages in the economy amounted to 3.9% y/y and, in line with expectations, was slightly higher than in the previous quarter (when it was 3.6% y/y). July 2005 saw a continuation of a moderate growth rate in nominal wages in the enterprise sector (3.2% y/y). The acceleration in the annual wage growth in enterprises in June 2005 was primarily connected with the one-off payments of awards and bonuses in the mining industry. In the Council's assessment, a necessary condition for sustained acceleration in economic growth, which would be to a larger extent grounded in the rise of employment, is the preservation of the low growth in unit labour costs. In line with the expectations of the NBP and external forecasters, in July 2005 the annual growth of consumer prices decreased slightly and amounted to 1.3%. It can be expected that in the coming quarters inflation will remain low, i.e. markedly below the inflation target of 2.5%. However, there is a risk of increased inflationary pressure related to higher forecasts of oil and gas prices, yet this may also dampen economic growth. July 2005 also brought a decline in most core inflation indices (only net inflation remained at the level from the previous month and was equal to 1.4% y/y). Additionally. August 2005 was another consecutive month which saw a decrease in inflation expectations of households (down to 1.3% from 2.2% in July 2005). Since the last meeting of the Council, oil prices has recorded a substantial climb - prices of Brent oil increased by USD 8.7 per barrel, i.e. by 15%. However, due to stronger than last year zloty exchange rate against the dollar and a moderate growth in domestic demand, the impact of high oil prices on producer prices in industry has been limited so far. The growth rate of producer prices in industry in July 2005 was equal to 0.0% y/y. The Council maintains its opinion that the most favourable for Poland would be to adopt an economic strategy focused on creating conditions that would guarantee the introduction of the euro at the earliest possible date. Implementation of public finance reforms leading to the meeting of the fiscal convergence criteria is the necessary condition for the euro area membership. However, the bills passed in July 2005 made the achievement of this goal significantly more difficult in the coming years, which has a negative effect on the economic growth prospects and may postpone Poland's euro area membership. The NBP inflation projection presented in the August Inflation Report was prepared on the basis of data available as of 28 July 2005 and so it does not account for the GUS estimates of GDP in 2005 Q2. The projection indicates that with a 50-percent probability the annual GDP growth should stay at 3.2%-3.5%, 3.9%-5.3% and 3.8%-5.6% in 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. In the years 2006-2007. GDP growth should accelerate unless the business conditions in Poland deteriorate or negative shocks occur in the world economy. According to the August inflation projection, the price growth should be lower than expected in the May Report. Assuming unchanged interest rates, there is a 50-percent probability that inflation will stay within the range of 0.9%-1.5% in 2005 Q4 (compared with 1.1%-2.2% in the May Report), 1.0%-3.1% in 2006 Q4 (compared with 1.2%-3.8%) and 1.2%-4.1% in 2007 Q4 (compared with 0.7%-4.3%). In line with the projection, inflation will reach a level close to the inflation target in mid-2007. Still, it has to be emphasised that the inflation projection presented in the Report does not account for all sources of uncertainty, such as the unknown economic policy of the government in -2 - the coming years and the effects of worsened outlook for public finance in connection to the bills passed by the Parliament largely impeding the necessary reduction of the public finance deficit and of the pace of public debt growth in the subsequent years. Moreover, the projection does not allow for the latest information which might have a significant bearing on the forecasted price growth. In view of the latest data the most probable path of oil prices for 2005-2007 lies approximately 15% above the path assumed in the August projection. Prices of crude oil running much higher than those accounted for in the projection constitute an important factor of inflationary risk in the monetary policy transmission horizon. In the Council's assessment, in the monetary policy transmission horizon the probability of inflation running below the inflation target is higher than presented in the August inflation projection, among others, due to possible acceleration in the structural changes ongoing in the Polish economy. In view of the fact that the interest on required reserve should not exceed the yield on open market operations the Council reduced the spread between the rediscount rate, which serves as the basis for setting the interest on the required reserve of banks, and the reference rate  from 0.5 to 0.25 percent point. The next meeting of the Council will be held on 27-28 September 2005."
Euroarea,2005-09-01,"Let me start by saying that the Governing Council of the ECB again wishes to express its profound sadness at the loss of its first chairman and President of the ECB. Dr Willem F Duisenberg, who passed away on 31 July. The Governing Council observed a moment of silence and, on behalf of all of the current and former members of the Governing Council. I paid tribute to the great qualities and achievements of my predecessor at the memorial service held in Amsterdam on 6 August. We owe it to his skilful leadership that the ECB and the Eurosystem successfully passed the stages of their establishment and initial challenges to become a central banking system that, through its actions, has gained the respect and trust of the people of the euro area and beyond. The Vice-President and I will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we have concluded that the monetary policy stance remains appropriate, given the current outlook for inflation rates over the medium term. The prevailing exceptionally low level of both nominal and real interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum provides considerable support to economic activity in the euro area. At present our judgement is that, although upside risks to price stability exist, we continue to see no significant evidence of a build-up in underlying inflationary pressures in the euro area. However, not least in view of the risk of second-round effects from ongoing oil price increases, the Governing Council continues to monitor the development of inflation expectations very closely. At present, particular vigilance with regard to upside risks to price stability is warranted. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, turning first to the economic analysis. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, real GDP grew at a quarter-on-quarter rate of 0.3% in the second quarter of 2005, compared with 0.4% in the first quarter according to the latest data releaseEconomic activity thus continued to grow moderately in the euro area. The most recent survey indicators have, on balance, been supportive to the view that economic growth could improve in the second half of 2005, while higher oil prices continue to weigh on demand and confidence. On the external side, ongoing growth in global demand and improvements in euro area price competitiveness should support euro area exports. On the domestic side, investment should benefit from very favourable financing conditions, the robust growth of corporate earnings and ongoing improvements in corporate efficiency. Consumption growth should gradually rise, broadly in line with expected developments in disposable income. This assessment is broadly consistent with the new ECB staff projections, which will be published today. Euro area real GDP is projected by staff to grow at rates of between 1.0% and 1.6% in 2005 and between 1.3% and 2.3% in 2006. Recent forecasts from international and private sector organisations give a similar picture. In comparison with the June Eurosystem staff projections, the ranges projected for real GDP growth in 2005 and 2006 have been revised downwards slightly, reflecting both the downward revision of growth data for the first quarter of this year and the effects of higher oil prices. On balance, risks to the economic growth projections continue to lie on the downside, and relate to higher oil prices, low consumer confidence and concerns about global imbalances. Turning to price developments, annual HICP inflation was 2.1% in August according to Eurostat's flash estimate, compared with 2.2% in July. Over the next few months, annual HICP inflation rates are expected to fluctuate around current levels, mainly due to recent developments in oil prices. Looking further ahead. ECB staff project average annual HICP inflation to lie between 2.1% and 2.3% in 2005 and between 1.4% and 2.4% in 2006. The latest projections constitute considerable upward revisions to the Eurosystem staff inflation projections published in June, reflecting the fact that oil prices have once again increased by more than was suggested earlier by forward rates. At the same time, wage increases have remained contained over recent quarters; the projections are based on the assumption that this trend will prevail for the time being given the current labour market situation. Overall, we continue to see no significant evidence of underlying domestic inflationary pressures building up in the euro area. Risks to this new baseline inflation scenario are on the upside and relate to potential further rises in oil prices, administered prices and indirect taxes. More fundamentally, the main risks to the inflation outlook stem from potential second-round effects in wage and price-setting behaviour triggered by ongoing oil price rises. In this respect, it is key that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities. Against this background, we will continue to monitor wage developments and inflation expectations very closely. Ongoing vigilance is required in order to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations remain well-anchored in the euro area. Turning to the monetary analysis, the latest data confirm the strong monetary and credit growth which has been observed since mid-2004. The monetary dynamics are driven by the prevailing low level of interest rates, as reflected in the robust growth of the more liquid components of M3. Low interest rates are also fuelling credit expansion, with the strengthening of the demand for loans broadly based across the private sector. In this context, price dynamics in the housing markets need to be monitored closely. The liquidity situation in the euro area remains ample by all plausible measures, indicating risks to price stability over medium to longer horizons. To sum up: recent oil price developments have pushed up the inflation projections for the year ahead, while medium-term domestic inflationary pressures still remain contained in the euro area. However, the balance of risks to the baseline inflation scenario is tilted to the upside. Cross-checking the economic analysis with the monetary analysis confirms the need for particular vigilance in order to keep medium-term inflation expectations firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. By achieving this, monetary policy is making a significant contribution towards a recovery in economic growth. Fiscal policies will make their best contribution to stability, growth and confidence if prevailing imbalances are tackled as part of determined and well-designed reform programmes. A rigorous implementation of the revised Stability and Growth Pact would reinforce the credibility of reform plans and boost expectations of a sound fiscal and growth situation. Against this background, it is regrettable that the pace of fiscal consolidation remains too slow. In some countries, targets for correcting excessive deficits are at risk. Moreover, due to a very generous application of the new rules of the Pact, countries which have recently breached the 3% deficit limit are being granted relatively long periods to correct the situation. The Governing Council therefore urges Member States to step up consolidation efforts where needed and to implement the revised rules in a manner that supports these efforts and deters future slippages. As regards structural reforms, the European Commission has recently presented the “Community Lisbon Programme” and a list of measures at the EU level to relaunch the Lisbon strategy. The programme focuses on enhancing knowledge and innovation in order to strengthen growth, on making Europe a more attractive place to invest and work, and on creating more and better jobs. It includes, for example, measures to further open EU markets and to simplify the regulatory framework within which business operates. The Community Lisbon Programme will be complemented by the introduction of national action plans for growth and jobs, which the Member States will present this autumn. Progress at both the Community and the Member State level is crucial to addressing the economic challenges facing the EU."
Egypt,2005-09-01,"Press Release September 1, 2005 The Central Bank of Egypt decided to reduce its overnight deposit rate by 50 basis points to 9% and its lending rate by 1% to 115% per annu. In its monthly meeting, held on September 1, 2005, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) decided to narrow the width of the corridor from 3% to 25. Furthermore the MPC decided to reduce the deposit rate from 95% to 9% and the lending rate from 125% to 115. The MPC's decision was based on the declining inflation rates witnessed during the second half of 2004-2005, which reveal lower inflationary expectation. The MPC will continue to monitor closely all developments in the economy, specially the factors affecting inflation, and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates in either direction if necessary to insure price stability over the medium ter.

Thailand,2005-09-07,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 7 September 2005 Ms. Atchana Waiquamdee. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand, announced that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance. The main issues discussed were as follows: 1. Against a backdrop of adverse shocks, in particular surging oil prices, the economy grew by 44 per cent in the second quarter of 2005, higher than expected and accelerating from 33 per cent in the first quarter. This reflected good economic fundamentals and the economy's ability to weather negative shocks. In this light, the MPC viewed that the growth momentum should continue going forward, especially when supported by a positive outlook on exports and investments, both public and private. The current account balance registered a large deficit during the first half of the year. In the latter half of this year, however, better export performance and a slowdown in imports should contribute towards a surplus in the current account. Nevertheless the MPC assessed that the current account balance for the entire year would be in deficit and remain so in 2006. Both core and headline inflation clearly accelerated owing to persistent increases in oil prices. Going forward, there remained a possibility that inflation would stay high or rise further if oil prices continue to increase. The MPC viewed that, while the growth momentum was strong, inflationary pressure was likely to increase and the probability of core inflation exceeding the target range remained. Moreover the current account was poised to be in deficit this year and the next. As a result, the policy rate should continue on an upward trend to keep core inflation within the target range and move real domestic interest rates towards a level consistent with economic stability and sustainable growth in the long term. The MPC therefore decided to raise the 14-day repurchase rate by 50 basis points from 275 to 325 per cent per annum effective immediately."
Chile,2005-09-08,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 8 September 2005 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points to 4% annual. Despite the fact that the oil price has remained high, the international environment continues to be favorable. Strong world output growth persists, together with high copper prices and good financial conditions. The effects of hurricane Katrina, which are estimated to be low on world activity, have caused an additional shock on fuel prices and somewhat lower international interest rates. Domestic output grew relatively less in July than in previous months, due to circumstantial and probably temporary factors. Domestic expenditure continues to increase vigorously in an environment of clearly expansionary monetary conditions. Investment continuous to grow strongly, while high growth in employment, combined with optimistic private expectations, favor consumption dynamism. Annual CPI inflation and various inflationary trend measures are within the target range of 2% to 4%. Private inflation expectations have increased, especially for one year ahead and sooner, in line with the temporary increase in inflation projected in the last Monetary Policy Report. The Board considers that, in the most likely scenario, it will continue to reduce the prevailing monetary stimulus, in order to maintain forecast inflation around 3% per annum in the normal policy horizon of 12 to 24 months. * In case of discrepancy, the Spanish original prevails."
Peru,2005-09-15,"Press Release MONETARY PROGRAM FOR SEPTEMBER 2005 CENTRAL BANK KEPT REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 3.00% The Board of the Central Bank approved to keep the reference interest rates for the interbank market at 3.00 percent. In this decision it has been considered: The Metropolitan Lima Consumer Price Index (CPI) decreased 0.18 percent in August. Thus, the CPI inflation over last twelve months diminished from 1.4 percent in July to 1.2 percent in August. For the followings months, the annual CPI inflation forecast would be located around the lower limit of the inflation target range (1.5 percent). The economy grows at a sustained rhythm, without inflationary pressures. In the first semester of 2005, the GDP grew 5.9 percent and it is projected to grow 5.5 percent in this year, and 5.0 percent in 2006. It was also approved to maintain the lending and deposit interest rates for the Central Bank operations: For direct repos and monetary regulation credits, the rate is kept at 3.75 percent. For overnight deposits, the rate is maintained at 2.25% percent. In case that the interbank interest rate be higher than 3.75 percent, monetary regulation credits and direct repos will be charged with the market interbank interest rate. The interest rates for the following operations in dollars between the Central Bank and the Financial System are: Monetary regulation credits: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point. Overnight deposits: overnight LIBOR minus 3/8 of a percentage point. Swaps: the commission is maintained to a level that implies a minimum annual effective cost of 3.75 percent. Reserve requirement in foreign currency subject to a payment: 2.25 percent. The session in which the Board will approve the following Monetary Program (October 2005) will be held on October 6th, 2005. ."
United States,2005-09-20,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 3-3/4 percent. Output appeared poised to continue growing at a good pace before the tragic toll of Hurricane Katrina. The widespread devastation in the Gulf region, the associated dislocation of economic activity, and the boost to energy prices imply that spending, production, and employment will be set back in the near term. In addition to elevating premiums for some energy products, the disruption to the production and refining infrastructure may add to energy price volatility. While these unfortunate developments have increased uncertainty about near-term economic performance, it is the Committee's view that they do not pose a more persistent threat. Rather, monetary policy accommodation, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity. Higher energy and other costs have the potential to add to inflation pressures. However, core inflation has been relatively low in recent months and longer-term inflation expectations remain contained. The Committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal. With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan. Chairman; Timothy F Geithner. Vice Chairman; Susan S Bies; Roger W Ferguson. Jr.; Richard W Fisher; Donald L Kohn; Michael H Moskow; Anthony M Santomero; and Gary H Stern. Voting against was Mark W Olson, who preferred no change in the federal funds rate target at this meeting. In a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 25-basis-point increase in the discount rate to 4-3/4 percent. In taking this action, the Board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston. New York. Philadelphia. Richmond. Chicago. Minneapolis, and Kansas City."
Philippines,2005-09-21,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to increase the BSP's policy interest rates by 25 basis points to 7.25 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.5 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. The Monetary Board believes that there may be a stronger case at present for monetary action against inflation pressures. Supply-side inflation pressures are expected to build up over the policy horizon given the likelihood of continued high crude oil prices for the foreseeable future. Such an outlook not only increases the risk of second-round effects from supply shocks but also poses a threat to inflation expectations, as the public may begin to expect inflation to remain indefinitely at high levels. Given that the projected risks from cost-side pressures have intensified in recent weeks, the Monetary Board believes that it is important for the BSP to undertake monetary action now to protect its inflation targets and help avoid the need for drastic tightening measures later. The Monetary Board also considered that the recent growth in the money supply may not necessarily be channeled into consumption and investment spending, given that growth in bank lending has remained moderate and aggregate demand is slowing down. Furthermore, the Monetary Board noted that the trend of rising foreign interest rates due to monetary tightening by other central banks could lead to further declines in interest rate differentials. Declining interest differentials may encourage investors to buy more dollar-denominated assets. Combined with excess liquidity in the financial system, a shift toward dollar assets could lead to volatility in the peso-dollar exchange rate, which in turn could raise inflation and inflation expectations. The Monetary Board will continue to closely monitor the evolving conditions for consumer prices, aggregate demand, domestic liquidity and other factors in order to determine the appropriate stance of monetary policy."
Romania,2005-09-21,"The Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided to reduce, starting with September 22, 2005, the following interest rates:. Also, according to current regulations, the Board has decided to reduce the interest rate paid for leu-denominated minimum reserves to an annual 1.5 percent from 2.0 percent, starting with the September 24-October 23, 2005 maintenance period. The NBR Board reaffirms the aim to maintain a prudent monetary policy stance in the coming period. In its meeting on September 21, 2005, the NBR Board analyzed the latest developments and prospects in macroeconomic indicators, domestic and international financial markets, in the context of the capital account liberalization measures adopted in the first half of the year. The latest data reveal slower economic growth for the second quarter, with gross domestic product expansion below forecast as a result of lower gross value added in the agriculture sector following a significant contraction of self-consumption, as well as a sharper downward trend of industrial output. Household purchases of goods and services, especially from imports, have continued to grow at a fast rate, supported mainly by the rise in incomes and readily available financing via banks and non-banking institutions. Also, internal demand expansion has continued to outpace domestic output, leading to a wider external deficit. Developments in monetary indicators highlight that the expansion of foreign currency credits continues to outpace the rise in leu-denominated loans. This unfavorable trend has triggered the approval of a set of prudential measures aimed at: improving the structure of non-government lending; reducing the gap between the domestic currency/foreign currency structure of non-government lending and that of savings; alleviating financial stability risks. Measures aimed at slowing down foreign currency lending combined with an adequate control of liquidity will allow NBR to pursue a proper management of aggregate demand, thus consolidating the new monetary policy framework. The leu has seen an appreciation versus the euro against the background of significant capital inflows attracted by investors' favorable perception of Romanian financial market conditions and also as a result of nominal and real convergence linked to European Union accession. In August 2005 inflation hit its lowest monthly level in 15 years (0.1 percent), being in line with forecasts released when the NBR officially shifted to a direct inflation targeting strategy and with expectations of continued disinflation. In this context, the NBR Board has decided to reduce the monetary policy rate to an annual 7.5 percent and to adjust accordingly the interest rates on NBR's standing facilities (the deposit facility and the lending facility), which set a corridor for domestic money market and financial market leu interest rates. The consolidation of a market for domestic currency denominated financial products, including medium and long term ones, is essential for both the effectiveness of the inflation targeting strategy and the successful future adoption of the euro, according to the Maastricht criteria. The new monetary policy rate is consistent with the need to calibrate the monetary policy in order to achieve inflation targets in the medium term and to avoid the risk of increased inflows of volatile capital. The next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled according to the announced calendar on November 9, 2005, when a new quarterly Inflation Report is to be analyzed."
Israel,2005-09-26,"26.9.2005 The Bank of Israel's raises the interest rate for October 2005 by 25 basis points, to 3.75 percent  The Bank of Israel today announced that the interest rate for October 2005 will rise by 25 basis points, to 3.75 percent. The decision to raise theinterest rate was taken to help keep inflation within the limits of the range set by the government, between one percent and three percent a year, a range defined as price stability. The decision to raise the interest rate was based on the following considerations: a. There are increasing signs of upward pressure on prices--inflation expectations for the coming year continue to rise and are currently higher than the midpoint of the target range; the NIS has depreciated somewhat against the dollar, which is likely to provide an impetus to inflation; the Bank of Israel's models also point to the need to increase the rate of interest at this stage to preserve price stability. b. The short-term nominal interest rate in the US is higher than that in Israel, and it is assessed that it will continue upwards, and the differential between the long-term dollar and NIS interest rates has contracted. c. Global oilprices have risen in the last few months and are exerting upward pressure on prices. d. The relatively low level of short-term real interest against the background of relatively rapid economic growth intrinsically exerts certain pressure on prices. The current rise in the interest rate is consistent with continued relatively rapid growth, which is expected to be reflected by further reductions in unemployment. e. Persistent political uncertainty is likely to cause economic uncertainty. The Bank of Israel declares that it will continue to monitor inflationary developments closely, with the aim of achieving the inflation target set by the government and of avoiding deviations from it, both upward and downward, and thereby supporting the attainment of the various macroeconomic objectives, especially those of employment and growth.

Poland,2005-09-28,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 28 September 2005 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL Held on 27-28 September 2005 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: reference rate 4.50% on an annual basis; lombard rated 6.00% on an annual basis; deposit rate 3.00% on an annual basis; rediscount rate 4.75% on an annual basis and to maintain its easing monetary policy bias. Since the last meeting of the Council, the outlook for economic growth in the euro area and the United States has deteriorated, whereas the forecasted inflation in those economies was increased. August 2005 saw an increase in the consumer price inflation (up to 3.6% y/y) in the United States, which partly resulted from increased oil prices in the world markets. In the euro area, inflation stood at 2.2% y/y, i.e. at a same level as previous month. In September crude oil prices reported a certain decrease, yet, both current and forecasted oil prices remain high. According to current forecasts, in the medium term oil prices may increase or persist on an elevated level. There persists a large uncertainty about the influence of considerable accumulated oil price increase on economic growth and inflation. In Poland, in August 2005 industrial output growth increased to 4.6% y/y, against 2.6% y/y in July. Allowing for seasonal factors, growth in industrial output in August amounted to 4.6% y/y, against 4.5% in July. The recovery in the construction sector observed since 2004 has continued, although its pace has decreased in the last two months. The annual growth in the construction and assembly production in August 2005 amounted to 6.5%. Nominal growth of retail sales in August was higher than a month ago and reached 7.9% y/y (5.6% y/y in real terms). August was the fourth consecutive month of relatively strong growth of retail sales, however the volume of retail sales in the first eight months of 2005 was 0.2% lower than in the corresponding period of the previous year. In September, positive enterprises' assessments of economic climate dominate as signalled in GUS business tendency surveys and they are close to those recorded in August. Available data indicate a slight improvement in the labour market. In August 2005 the employment in the enterprise sector rose by 2.0% y/y, while the unemployment rate decreased to 17.8%, i.e. by 1.3 percentage point when compared with the corresponding month of the previous year. According to BAEL (Labour Force Surveys), in 2005 Q2 the number of working persons in the economy increased by 1.9% y/y, and in seasonally adjusted terms the number of working persons in the economy was  like in 2005 Q1 - close to the level recorded in the previous quarter. Stabilization of the number of working persons in the economy was accompanied by an increase in the number of persons working outside private farms in agriculture, which in 2005 Q2 stood at 2.7% y/y (i.e. 0.3% q/q in seasonally adjusted terms). August saw a continuation of a moderate growth rate in nominal wages in the enterprise sector (2.8% y/y). Continuation of this tendency will favour further employment growth and  when accompanied by favourable developments in productivity  will limit inflationary pressure. In line with the expectations of the NBP and external forecasters, in August 2005 the annual growth rate of consumer prices increased and amounted to 1.6% (against 1.3% in July). In August, most core inflation indicators remained at the level close to the one recorded in July (net inflation was equal to 1.3% y/y). September 2005 saw an increase in inflation expectations of households (up to 1.4% from 1.3% recorded in August 2005). It may be expected that, due to moderate growth in demand and to strong statistical base effect related to Poland joining the EU, until the end of 2005 inflation will remain at a low level i.e. well below the inflation target (2.5%). However, as a result of recently increased forecasts of oil and gas prices inflation may move back to the target faster than presented in August projection. It needs to be emphasised that increased oil prices may also weaken economic growth. The impact of high oil prices on producer prices in industry has been so far offset by stronger than one year ago zloty exchange rate against the dollar and a moderate growth in domestic demand. In August, the growth rate of producer prices in industry was negative and reached - 0.1% y/y. The zloty exchange rate developments in September 2005 have not deviated significantly from the exchange rate path accounted for in the August Inflation Report. The Council maintains its opinion that the most favourable for Poland would be to adopt an economic strategy focused on creating conditions that would guarantee the introduction of the euro at the earliest possible date. Implementation of public finance reforms leading to the fulfilment of the fiscal convergence criteria is the necessary condition for the euro area membership. The Council emphasises that maintaining the easing monetary policy bias does not have to imply a change in interest rates over the coming meetings. The Council has adopted the Monetary Policy Guidelines for the year 2006. This document sets forth the monetary policy strategy, conditions of its implementation and objectives of monetary policy in 2006. The Council has maintained the present understanding of the inflation target and the way of its implementation, including the focus of monetary policy on maintaining inflation as close as possible to the 2.5% target in the medium term. In 2006, monetary policy will be conducted so as to achieve the target within the 5-7 quarters horizon. Yet, this period may be shorter or longer depending on the type and strength of shocks affecting Polish economy. The Council has adopted the document on International Investment Position of Poland in 2004. The international investment position of Poland is a specification of foreign assets and liabilities of domestic entities. At the end of 2004. Poland's net international investment position was negative and reached EUR 93.3 billion, which accounted for 47.8% of GDP. It is a typical situation for open economies, running a current account deficit and importing capital from abroad. For example, international investment position of other countries in our region was also negative and the ratio of its ratio to GDP ranged from 112% for Hungary to 30% for the Czech Republic. Compared with those countries, the ratio of international investment position to GDP for Poland is at the medium level. Compared with 2003. Poland's negative international investment position has increased by EUR 19.1 billion, i.e. 25.7%, as a result of foreign liabilities increasing faster than foreign assets. Faster increase of foreign liabilities resulted, to a considerable extent, from exchange rate developments. Considerable part of Polish liabilities, including equity capital of Polish companies with foreign participation, is expressed in Polish zloty. As a result of strong appreciation of the Polish zloty against the euro, the value of those capitals expressed in EUR has significantly increased. -2 - The Council has adopted the Forecast of the Balance of Payments of the Republic of Poland for the Year 2006. According to this forecast, given the expected acceleration of domestic demand and moderate revival in economic climate in the euro area as well as less favorable terms of trade in the Polish foreign trade, the year 2006 is likely to see deterioration in Poland's balance of trade in goods and services as compared with the year 2005. Yet, current account deficit will remain at a safe level. Moreover, it will be largely financed by the inflow of foreign capital in form of direct investment. The next meeting of the Council will be held on 25-26 October 2005."

Euroarea,2005-10-06,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to the press conference here in Athens. The Governing Council has, today, met for the 12th time outside Frankfurt, meaning that it has now met once in each of the euro area member countries. I would particularly like to thank Governor Garganas for his kind hospitality and express our special gratitude to the staff of the Bank of Greece for the perfect organisation. Let me now report on the outcome of today's meeting, which was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup. Prime Minister Juncker, and Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, despite renewed upward pressure on prices stemming mainly from oil market developments, we have concluded that the monetary policy stance still remains appropriate. Accordingly, we have decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. At the same time, strong vigilance with regard to upside risks to price stability is warranted. It is essential that the increase in the current inflation rate does not translate into higher underlying inflationary pressures in the euro area. Strong vigilance is also called for in the light of ample liquidity in the euro area. Across the maturity spectrum, interest rates in the euro area remain very low in both nominal and real terms, and thus lend ongoing support to economic activity. For this support to continue, it is of the essence that inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Real GDP has been growing at a quarter-on-quarter rate of 0.4% and 0.3% over the first two quarters of 2005, dampened in particular by higher oil prices. In line with our staff projections, recent survey indicators, on balance, support the view that economic growth could gradually pick up from the second half of this year onwards. On the external side, ongoing growth in global demand should support euro area exports. On the domestic side, investment should benefit both from continuously favourable financing conditions and from the robust growth of corporate earnings. Consumption should gradually recover, broadly in line with expected developments in real disposable income. This outlook for economic activity remains subject to downward risks, relating mainly to oil prices, concerns about global imbalances and weak consumer confidence. Temporarily, further uncertainty arose as to the economic effects of the recent hurricanes in the United States, which assessments, in the meantime, have generally suggested to be limited and short-term. Turning to price developments, recent increases mainly in oil prices have pushed headline inflation rates to levels significantly in excess of 2%. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 2.5% in September, compared with 2.2% in the previous two months, and it is likely that HICP inflation will remain elevated in the short term. In interpreting this jump in the annual inflation rate, it is key to make a clear distinction between temporary, short-term factors on the one hand, and those of a more lasting nature on the other. While no detailed information on developments in the components of HICP in September is available as yet, it appears that oil price increases have again played an important role, this time exacerbated by a much stronger increase in petrol prices owing to exceptional capacity constraints at refineries following the two hurricanes in the United States. If a gradual normalisation in this market segment is confirmed, an unwinding of the sharp increases in spreads between oil prices and refined products could materialise. However, there is currently no indication that oil prices will moderate significantly in the foreseeable future. Rather, markets expect oil prices to remain at high levels, driven mainly by buoyant global demand and, to some extent, by fragilities on the supply side. Accordingly, this scenario underlies our forward-looking assessment of price developments. Crucially, what matters is how these developments affect the outlook for price stability over the medium term. For the time being, there continues to be no clear evidence of domestic inflationary pressures building up in the euro area. In particular, wage increases have remained contained over recent quarters and, with labour markets weak, this should continue for the time being. Our main scenario, therefore, remains one of elevated inflation rates over the short term, with a gradual decline thereafter. These relate to ongoing uncertainties surrounding oil market developments, to a potentially stronger pass-through than has so far been observed, on account of higher oil prices being passed on to consumers via the domestic production chain, and to potential second-round effects in wage and price-setting behaviour, all of which play an important role in our assessment for price stability over the medium term. In addition, possible further increases in administered prices and indirect taxes have to be taken into account. Accordingly, strong vigilance is required in order to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations for the euro area remain well-anchored. The monetary analysis provides further insight into inflation prospects over medium to longer horizons. Money and credit have continued to grow robustly in the euro area over the past few months, with the annual rate of M3 growth now exceeding 8%. The strength of monetary growth has been increasingly driven primarily by the prevailing low level of interest rates. In recent months, the short-term dynamics of M3 have gained further momentum and the growth of borrowing, in particular mortgage loans, remains very strong. In this context, price dynamics in a number of housing markets need to be monitored closely. Strong monetary and credit growth, in the context of an already ample liquidity situation in the euro area, points to risks to price stability over medium to longer horizons. To sum up, the economic analysis indicates that oil and petrol price increases, in particular, imply upward revisions to the outlook for short-term price developments. Some of these increases can be expected to be of a temporary nature, while others are likely to be more lasting. Domestic inflationary pressures over the medium term still remain contained in the euro area, but significant upside risks have to be taken into account. Moreover, the monetary analysis identifies upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. Overall, cross-checking the information from the two pillars confirms the need for strong vigilance in order to maintain inflation expectations in line with price stability. By keeping medium-term inflation expectations firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability, monetary policy is making a significant ongoing contribution towards a recovery in economic growth. As regards fiscal policies in the euro area, most recent information continues to provide a very mixed picture. Some countries report significant imbalances, while others continue to maintain sound fiscal positions. Preparations for 2006 budgets are in their final stages in most euro area countries. It is essential that forthcoming budgets reflect the need for fiscal consolidation that both progresses at the appropriate pace and is embedded in a well-designed and comprehensive reform strategy. This would help to support confidence within the euro area by strengthening expectations of sustainable and growth-friendly public finances and by enhancing the credibility of the reformed Stability and Growth Pact. As for the impact of high oil prices on public finances, consolidation of budgets must be continued. Let me also recall the latest G7 statement, which affirms that subsidies and artificial price caps that constrain the price of oil and oil products have an adverse effect on the global market and should be avoided. In the context of its regular discussions about structural reform issues, the Governing Council focused on unit labour cost (ULC) developments within the euro area, which play an important role in determining inflation and competitiveness patterns across the euro area countries. Since the inception of EMU, several euro area countries have experienced significantly larger cumulative increases in their ULCs than the euro area average. On the other hand, some countries have exhibited cumulative ULC developments significantly below the euro area average. It must be understood that some differences in ULC growth rates are a natural feature of a well-functioning monetary union, as these may reflect catching-up processes or necessary adjustments to past shocks. In this respect, the flexibility within the euro area may well have been underestimated in its early phase of existence. In some euro area countries, wage developments have substantially and persistently exceeded labour productivity growth, leading to relatively strong ULC developments over a prolonged period of time, higher inflationary pressures and losses in competitiveness. This may be, at least partially, due to wage rigidities, such as an explicit or de facto indexation of nominal wages to prices or high reservation wages determined by the level of unemployment benefits, and to a lack of competition in some sectors. In the context of external shocks, such as sharp increases in oil prices, there is an even greater need for speeding-up structural reforms. Together with the completion of the EU internal market, such reforms would support ULC developments that are conducive to price stability and would further smooth the functioning of adjustment mechanisms in the euro area, thereby strengthening the foundations for sustained growth in output and employment."
Chile,2005-10-11,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 11 October 2005 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.25% (annual). Output continues to grow above trend, although recent information reveals it is somewhat below earlier forecasts. Domestic demand remains strong, showing more dynamism in investment than in consumption, employment is still increasing at a fast pace and monetary conditions in Chile continue to be clearly expansionary. Despite high oil prices and increased risk of a pick-up in international inflation, the external scenario continues to be favorable, with a persistently high copper price, good financial conditions and a high world output growth outlook. In September, inflation was surprisingly high because of the incidence of specific prices, particularly fuels and some perishables, leading CPI inflation to be around 4% sooner than expected. On the contrary, the core inflation measures CPIX and CPIX1 (that exclude fuels, perishables and some regulated utilities, among others) have continued to grow, in line with projections. Expected inflation indicators, for horizons of two years and beyond, remain around 3%. This picture is consistent with a temporary increase in inflation and with the inflation trend converging to the center of the target range, as forecast in the latest Monetary Policy Report. The Board considers that, in the most likely scenario, it will continue to reduce the prevailing monetary stimulus, in order to maintain expected inflation around 3% per annum in the normal policy horizon of 12 to 24 months. * In case of discrepancy, the Spanish original prevails."
South Africa,2005-10-13,"For the past two years. CPIX inflation has been within the inflation target range of 3-6 per cent. In recent months, however, oil price developments have posed an increasing risk to the continued attainment of the inflation target and since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee. CPIX inflation has risen by 1,3 percentage points. These increases were in line with expectations, and our current forecasts show that we should remain within the target range over the forecast period. More recently there has been some respite in the oil market, and prices have moderated from recent peaks caused by hurricanes Katrina and Rita. However, oil prices remain at high levels and continue to be of concern. Despite the petrol price increases, the economy continues to perform at a robust pace, domestic demand remains strong, and formal sector employment has increased. Inflation as measured by the consumer price index for metropolitan and other urban areas excluding the interest cost on mortgage bonds (CPIX) reached a low of 3,1 per cent in February and then began to increase, mainly as a result of petrol price movements. After measuring 3,5 per cent in June. CPIX inflation increased to 4,2 per cent and 4,8 per cent in July and August respectively. During these two months, the petrol price increased by a total of R0,56. Excluding petrol and diesel costs. CPIX inflation measured 3,6 per cent in both July and August having averaged 3,4 per cent for the previous 12 months. This indicates that thus far there has been limited pass-through from petrol prices to prices of other goods and services. Other categories of goods and services that have shown significant price increases are tobacco products, domestic workers' wages, medical costs and education. In contrast, prices of clothing and footwear have continued to fall, while most other categories show very subdued price increases. Despite recent increases in the maize price, food price inflation has remained low, measuring 2,7 per cent in August. Administered prices excluding petrol rose at 5,9 per cent, marginally below the upper limit of the inflation target range. However if the petrol price is included, administered prices increased by 11,2 per cent. Production price inflation has also displayed a marked upward trend, reflecting to a significant degree the higher energy prices. Having measured 2,4 per cent in May 2005, production price inflation increased steadily, reaching 4,2 per cent in August. Imported goods inflation increased from an annual rate of 1,8 per cent in May to 6,2 per cent in August, while domestically produced goods inflation increased from 2,6 per cent to 3,6 per cent over the same period. Owing mainly to the adverse oil price developments, the Bank's inflation forecast has deteriorated somewhat since the last MPC meeting. However CPIX inflation is expected to remain within the target range of 3-6 per cent over the forecast period. The upper turning point is expected to occur in the first two quarters of 2006 at a level just below 6 per cent. Thereafter. CPIX inflation is expected to resume a moderate downward trajectory. Although there are no clear signs of second-round effects, the longer the upward trend and volatility of oil prices persist, the more likely the price increases will continue to impact on expectations and feed through to other prices. Monetary policy has to remain vigilant in anticipating such developments. Since the last meeting of the MPC, the international crude oil prices reached new record levels of almost US$70 per barrel in the wake of the hurricanes in the United States. The price of Brent crude averaged around US$64.50 per barrel in August and US$63 in September, compared to US$58 in July. These developments resulted in further increases in the domestic petrol price of R0,29 and R0,12 per litre in September and October respectively, and will contribute to further upward pressure on CPIX in those months. More recently crude oil prices have declined to below US$60 per barrel and if this trend continues, we could see a moderate decline in petrol prices in November. However the volatility of international oil prices means that significant upside risk remains. There are a number of other developments that also pose risks to the inflation outlook. The latest inflation expectations survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research at the University of Stellenbosch indicates that there has been a marginal deterioration in inflation expectations which may be a result of the impact of the higher petrol prices. CPIX inflation is now expected to average 5,2 per cent next year, and 5,4 per cent in 2007, up 0,3 per cent and 0,4 per cent respectively. The deterioration in inflation expectations was also reflected in the increase in the breakeven inflation rates, measured by the spreads between the yields on South African CPI inflation-linked bonds and conventional nominal bonds of the same maturity. If the deterioration in inflation expectations were to continue, it would be a cause for concern given the critical role of expectations in the price and wage formation process. The economy has continued to grow at a robust pace, with quarter-on-quarter annualised real GDP growth accelerating from 3,5 per cent in the first quarter of 2005 to 4,8 per cent in the second quarter. This acceleration was attributed in part to the strong increase in the real value added by the manufacturing sector, which appears to have recovered from the contraction in the first quarter. The utilisation of production capacity in manufacturing, having fallen back in the previous two quarters, picked up again in the second quarter of 2005. The physical volume of manufacturing production continued on an upward trend in the third quarter and the most recent value of the Investec/BER Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) also indicates that the recovery in this sector has continued, although at a more moderate pace. Most other sectors have also remained buoyant and the composite leading business cycle indicator shows a favourable growth outlook. This positive growth performance had a positive effect on employment. According to the Quarterly Employment Statistics survey, formal non-agricultural employment increased at an annualised quarter-on-quarter rate of 7,6 per cent in the second quarter of this year. Over the past year this reflects an increase of 84,000 employees. Domestic demand shows few signs of significant moderation and all components of final demand grew at a healthy rate in the second quarter. New motor vehicle sales reached new record highs in September, although there was a moderate slowdown in the growth of motor vehicle sales which increased by 25,3 per cent over the year. The strong domestic demand has been underpinned by low nominal interest rates, higher real incomes and increases in asset prices. Share prices on the JSE Limited, for example, reached new record highs, and since the previous MPC meeting the all-share price index increased by 4 per cent. The vigorous demand was financed in part by increased borrowing, and the household debt ratio continued to rise in the second quarter. Household debt as a percentage of disposable income rose from 60 per cent in the first quarter to 62 per cent in the second quarter of 2005. However, because of the low nominal interest rate environment, debt servicing cost as a percentage of disposable income remained unchanged at a relatively low level of 6½ per cent. The monetary and credit aggregates have also been increasing at rates consistent with strong domestic demand. Year-on-year growth in M3 picked up from 17,1 per cent in June 2005 to 19,9 per cent in July and 19,0 per cent in August. Total domestic credit extension grew by 18,0 per cent in July and 18,3 per cent in August. Twelve-month growth in bank loans and advances to the private sector remained above 20 per cent, with increases in mortgage advances reaching 26 per cent in August. The latter reflects continued buoyancy in the housing market, although the rate of increase in house prices has fallen steadily since September 2004. Strong domestic demand and high international crude oil prices have impacted on the current account of the balance of payments. Although the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments as a percentage of GDP contracted to 3,4 per cent in the second quarter of 2005, data for July and August indicate a possible widening of the trade deficit in the third quarter. The current account however remains financed by capital inflows, and the international liquidity position of the Bank increased to a level of US$16,1 billion at the end of September. World inflation is expected to be negatively affected by higher oil prices. The IMF now predicts that world inflation in 2006 will average 3,7 per cent, compared to the April forecast of 3,1 per cent for the same period. Nevertheless this is lower than the revised 3,9 per cent average expected for 2005 and indicates that world inflation appears to be well contained. World growth is expected to be sustained at a robust rate of 4,3 per cent in 2006 although it has moderated somewhat since last year. Not all developments have been negative from an inflation perspective. Although inflation expectations have deteriorated moderately, there is no evidence that this has impacted on wage settlements. Unit labour costs in the first half of this year increased at rates within the inflation target range, measuring 4,6 per cent and 5,3 per cent in the first two quarters of this year. The nominal effective exchange rate of the rand depreciated by 0,3 per cent since the last meeting of the MPC, but it has been relatively stable over the period. The volatility that did occur was to a large extent a reflection of movements between the euro and the US dollar. Positive international perceptions of South Africa were further confirmed with the recent sovereign credit rating upgrade by the Fitch rating agency. The deterioration in the inflation outlook cannot be ignored. The increased risk of possible pass-through leading to pronounced second-round effects on CPIX inflation must inform policy going forward. Although there is no conclusive evidence of pass-through at present, and the Monetary Policy Committee has not judged it necessary to change the monetary policy stance at this meeting, these developments will be closely monitored. The Committee stands ready to take the appropriate action in order to ensure that the inflation target mandate continues to be achieved. At this meeting the MPC has decided therefore that the repurchase rate will remain unchanged at 7 per cent per annum."
Peru,2005-10-15,"Press Release MONETARY PROGRAM FOR OCTOBER 2005 CENTRAL BANK KEPT REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 3.00% The Board of the Central Bank approved to keep the reference interest rates for the interbank market at 3.00 percent. In this decision it has been considered: The forecasts of the Inflation Report of August are maintained. The CPI inflation over last twelve months is 1.1 percent in September. It is expected that in the next months, the decreasing tendency of the inflation rate is reverted and located around the lower limit (1.5 percent) at the end of the year. According to the last Inflation Report, it is expected that the inflation over last 12 months is located in the lower range of the target (1.5 - 2.5 percent) throughout the next year. The dynamism of the economic activity in the forecasted horizon is consistent with this convergence of inflation towards its target level in 2006. The GDP grew 4.9 percent in July, accumulating an increase in the first seven months of the year of 5.8 percent. The results of June and July (4.6 percent and 4.9 percent) represent only one slight and transitory deceleration that would be reverted in the following months. Growth projections of 5.5 and 5.0 percent for years 2005 and 2006 are maintained. In August 2005 exports reached a level of USS 1,473 million. With this result, during the last 12 months the exports reached an amount higher to the USS 15 billion, being expected a level superior to the USS 16 billion at the end of the year. The evolution of export prices would continue being favorable. So if this tendency continues, it would be a higher expansion of the trade balance in the year. As of August the accumulated trade surplus over the last twelve months is USS 4.1 billion. The Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) diminished 0.1 percent in September, with which the inflation rate over the last twelve months diminished from 1.2 percent in August to 1.1 percent in September. The core inflation (that isolates the most volatile components of the Consumer Price Index basket) in the last twelve months, diminished from 0.8 percent in August to 0.7 percent in September. It was also approved to maintain the lending and deposit interest rates for the Central Bank operations: For direct repos and monetary regulation credits, the rate is kept at 3.75 percent. For overnight deposits, the rate is maintained at 2.25% percent. In case that the interbank interest rate be higher than 3.75 percent, monetary regulation credits and direct repos will be charged with the market interbank interest rate. The interest rates for the following operations in dollars between the Central Bank and the Financial System are: Monetary regulation credits: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point. Overnight deposits: overnight LIBOR minus 3/8 of a percentage point. Swaps: the commission is maintained to a level that implies a minimum annual effective cost of 3.75 percent. Reserve requirement in foreign currency subject to a payment: 2.25 percent. The session in which the Board will approve the following Monetary Program (November 2005) will be held on November 3th, 2005. ."
Philippines,2005-10-19,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to increase the BSP's policy interest rates by 25 basis points to 7.5 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.75 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. The Monetary Board noted that the latest BSP forecasts, which incorporate more recent data on inflation, output and other key variables, indicate a possible breach of the inflation target in 2007, due to possible second-round effects coming from supply-side pressures. Equally important, the possibility of a sustained deviation of the forecast from the target over the policy horizon poses a considerable risk to inflation expectations, in that the public may begin to expect inflation to remain persistently well above announced government targets. Because monetary action normally requires 15-21 months to take full effect on inflation, policy measures undertaken now will help address the risks to inflation and inflation expectations in the coming year and in 2007. An added concern is the continued rapid growth in domestic liquidity. Available data suggest that the financial system remains very liquid despite the recent increase in the policy rate and the reserve requirements, and that the additional liquidity in recent months has been fueled by both foreign exchange inflows and by the deposit generation activities of banks. In summary, the Monetary Board believes that the need for a timely response to expected pressures, the risk of a sustained breach of the inflation target and the continued presence of excess liquidity in the financial system, provide the impetus for monetary action. Recent policy moves have contributed to making the overall policy stance less accommodative. However, the evidence suggests that this action was necessary. This monetary action will not only address the risks to inflation and inflation expectations but also clearly demonstrate the BSP's commitment to its price stability mandate."
Thailand,2005-10-19,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 19 October 2005 Mr. Bandid Nijathaworn. Deputy Governor (Monetary Stability). Bank of Thailand, announced that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance. The main issues discussed were as follows: 1. In the third quarter of 2005, domestic demand moderated but exports growth picked up strongly while agricultural output also recovered. As a result, the overall economy continued to improve from the previous quarter. In this light, the MPC viewed that the growth momentum should carry on going forward with the support of a positive outlook on exports and investment, both public and private. Pressure on internal stability increased. Headline inflation had accelerated and was likely to increase further. Meanwhile core inflation was likely to stay high with a possibility of accelerating beyond the monetary policy target in 2006. Nonetheless external stability improved consequent of a slowdown in imports and stronger exports performance, which led to an improvement in the current account from July onwards. The MPC viewed that economic growth should continue and the impact of adverse factors on the economy had begun to diminish. However there was a higher probability of inflation accelerating, especially in the last quarter of this year. Thus the policy interest rate should remain on an upward path to promote economic stability and move real domestic interest rates towards a level consistent with economic stability and sustainable growth in the long term. The MPC therefore decided to raise the 14-day repurchase rate by 50 basis points from 325 to 375 per cent per annum effective immediately. The MPC believed that the policy interest rate hikes of 50 basis points in the previous and this meetings should help better contain inflationary pressure that had been expected to increase during the last quarter of this year."
Hungary,2005-10-24,"1. At its meeting on 24 October 2005, the Monetary Council considered the latest monetary and economic developments and left the central bank base rate unchanged at 6.0%. In the Council's assessment, a number of factors have facilitated the development of a low-inflation environment over the recent period. Consumer prices were 3.7% higher in September than a year earlier; and the rate of core inflation fell below 2%. However, the Council expects a variety of factors to influence future inflation developments. Although the reduction in VAT rates will slow the annual rate of price inflation considerably in 2006, its direct effects are likely to wear off in 2007. Different shocks are expected to affect labour costs in the near future, which is likely to add to inflation uncertainty. Oil prices have remained high in recent weeks, coupled with the build-up of inflationary pressure in the world economy. Nevertheless, there appears to be a good chance that the inflation target will be met. The uncertainty surrounding Hungarian economic balance and the country's convergence process has increased significantly recently. The Council has received several pieces of news which suggest the development of adverse conditions. The Government has revised upwards the deficit ratio for 2005 relevant for the adoption of the euro in Hungary. Although this upward revision itself is not expected to affect the country's indebtedness, it may have a negative influence on the market's assessment of Hungary's convergence process. It has become obvious to market participants that over the coming years the budget deficits may turn out worse than earlier expectations. The deficit target for 2006, set in the budget bill, is higher than outlined in the convergence programme and, moreover, it involves a number of upward risks, as pointed out in the latest analysis by the European Commission. The Hungarian economy has moved farther from the nominal convergence path facilitating the adoption of the euro in 2010. The Council has stressed on previous occasions that the adoption of the euro should be given priority in the interests of long-term economic growth, which, in turn, requires a commitment to meet the Maastricht convergence criteria at the earliest possible date. Although the Government has repeatedly confirmed its commitment to adopting the euro in 2010, the announcement has not yet been coupled with specific measures. As regards the external environment, there are signs that the current favourable assessment of emerging economies may deteriorate. In the Council's view, continued inflationary pressures in the world market could influence major central banks' interest policy over the near term. Rises in yields in developed markets may have a negative impact on demand for emerging-country assets, which, in turn, may lead to an increase in yields on forint-denominated assets. 2. At its meeting, the Council also discussed the conceptual framework for the Quarterly Report on Inflation, to be issued on 28 November 2005."
Israel,2005-10-24,"24.10.2005 The Bank of Israel's raises the interest rate for November 2005 by 25 basis points, to 4 percent The Bank of Israel today announced that the interest rate for November 2005 will rise by 25 basis points, to 4 percent. The decision to raise the interest rate was taken to support the government's target of price-stability--defined as an inflation rate of between one percent and three percent a year-long term. The decision was based on the following considerations: There is growing concern worldwide regarding rising inflation due to the rise in energy and goods prices, and tighter monetary policy is expected in the future, which would affect the interest differential between the NIS and other currencies. The rate ofshort-term real interest is lower than that consistent with the rate of economic growth, which has accelerated recently, while there is a gradual contraction of the output gap. In the lastfew months the NIS has depreciated, which under the present circumstances is likely to boost inflation. The Bank ofIsrael's models indicate the need to raise the interest rate to maintain price stability. Inflation expectations have risen in the last two months. The Bank of Israel considers that the current rise in the interest rate is consistent with continued economic growth. The Bank will continue to keep its interest-rate policy under constant review with the intention of maintaining price stability and supporting the attainment of the range of objectives of economic policy. The US Federal Reserve will announce its next interest-rate decision on 1 November 2005. Table 2:Official Interest Rates of Central-Bank in Several Countries.

India,2005-10-25,"RBI Governor announces Mid-term Review of Annual Policy Statement for the year 2005-06 Highlights Domestic Developments Based on the current assessment of a pick-up in agricultural output and in the momentum in other sectors. GDP growth projection for 2005-06 revised to 7.0-7.5 per cent from the earlier projection of around 7.0 per cent. Annual inflation, as measured by point-to-point variations in wholesale price index, receded from 6.0 per cent in April 2005 to 4.6 per cent in October 2005. Inflation in the range of 5.0-5.5 per cent as projected. Forward looking policy response is necessary to realise growth momentum and potential for higher growth without adding to inflation expectations. Money supply (M ) may turn out to be somewhat higher than the earlier 3 projection of 14.5 per cent for the full year. Aggregate deposit growth also expected to be higher than earlier projection. Year-on-year adjusted non-food credit is expected to increase significantly higher than 19.0 per cent projected earlier. Financial markets have remained stable and orderly, although interest rates have firmed up in almost all segments. The yield curve has steepened. Significant increase in CBLO volumes. Total liquidity sterilised in the form of MSS. LAF and surplus balances of Central Government increased from an average of about Rs.1,14,192 crore in March 2005 to Rs.1,20,076 crore in October 2005. The market borrowing programme of the Central Government has so far remained consistent with the projections set out in the Union Budget for 2005-06.2005-06 increased by 20.5 per cent compared with 30.8 per cent in the corresponding period in the previous year. Imports rose by 33.1 per cent as against an increase of 37.3 per cent in the corresponding period last year. Hardening of international crude oil prices and import demand emanating from a pick-up in domestic industrial activity contributed to the import growth observed. Foreign exchange reserves stood at US$ 143.4 billion as on October 14, 2005, increasing from US$ 141.5 billion as at end-March 2005. Evolving developments in the balance of payments warrant careful monitoring in view of oil prices and continued strong investment demand. Foreign exchange market witnessed orderly conditions in the first half of 2005-06. The exchange rate of the rupee depreciated by 3.0 per cent to US dollar by October 21, 2005, from Rs.43.75 per US dollar at end-March 2005 to Rs.45.09 per US dollar. However, it appreciated by 4.2 per cent against the Euro, by 2.5 per cent against the Pound sterling and by 4.5 per cent against the Japanese yen during the period Global Developments Global economic activity remained robust but slackened moderately in the second quarter of 2005; Likely growth of 4.3 per cent in 2005 from 5.1 per cent in 2004. Rise in oil prices has triggered inflationary pressures globally, remaining the single largest risk to the global economy. Risks to global growth also emanate from the persisting macroeconomic imbalances and the resulting abundance of global liquidity, asset bubbles, excessive leveraging in financial markets. Overall Assessment On balance, macroeconomic and financial conditions have evolved as anticipated. Overall industrial growth has strengthened, monsoon fears have eased, non-food credit growth has been buoyant, the demand for government securities has been sustained and a pick-up in investment demand is evident. Some downward risks to the economic outlook have emerged in the recent months. Ensuring credit quality and increasing the pace of investment in infrastructure is important. Asset prices have registered a substantial increase. The overall positive sentiment, the business confidence of the private sector and the strength as well as resilience of the domestic economy would continue to determine capital flows.Stance of Monetary Policy The Reserve Bank will continue to ensure that appropriate liquidity is maintained in the system so that all legitimate requirements of credit are met, consistent with the objective of price stability. Towards this end. RBI will continue with its policy of active demand management of liquidity through open market operations including MSS. LAF and CRR, and using all the policy instruments at its disposal flexibly, as and when the situation warrants. Barring the emergence of any adverse and unexpected developments in various sectors of the economy and keeping in view the current assessment of the economy including the outlook for inflation, the overall stance of monetary policy for the remaining part of the year will be: Consistent with emphasis on price stability, provision of appropriate liquidity to meet genuine credit needs and support export and investment demand in the economy. Ensuring an interest rate environment that is conducive to macroeconomic and price stability, and maintaining the growth momentum. To consider measures in a calibrated and prompt manner, in response to evolving circumstances with a view to stabilising inflationary expectations. Monetary Measures Bank Rate kept unchanged at 6.0 per cent. Reverse Repo Rate increased by 25 basis points to 5.25 per cent, effective October 26, 2005. The spread between reverse repo rate and the repo rate under LAF maintained at 100 basis points. The cash reserve ratio (CRR) kept unchanged at 5.0 per cent. Developmental and Regulatory Policies Interest Rate Policy Indian Banks' Association being asked to review the benchmark prime lending rate (BPLR) system and issue transparent guidelines for appropriate pricing of credit. Financial Markets The Reserve Bank has constituted a new department named as Financial Markets Department (FMD) in July 2005 with a view to moving towards functional separation between debt management and monetary operations. Intra-day short selling in government securities proposed to be introduced. NDS-OM module to be extended to all insurance entities which are mandated to invest in government securities. Screen-based negotiated quote-driven system for call/notice and term money markets and electronic trading platform for market repo operations in government securities are being developed by Clearing Corporation of India Ltd. (CCIL). External Commercial Borrowings Special purpose vehicles (SPVs) or any other entity, notified by the Reserve Bank, which are set up to finance infrastructure companies/projects would be treated as financial institutions and ECBs raised by such entities would be considered under the approval route.40 per cent of the net worth of the bank on a solo and consolidated basis; consolidated direct capital market exposure modified to 20 per cent of the bank's consolidated net worth. Banks having sound internal controls and robust risk management systems can approach the Reserve Bank for higher limits. General provisioning requirement for 'standard advances' increased from the present level of 0.25 per cent to 0.40 per cent; direct advances to agricultural and SME sectors exempted from the additional provisioning requirement. Supervisory review process to be initiated with select banks having significant exposure to some sectors, namely, real estate, highly leveraged NBFCs, venture capital funds and capital markets, in order to ensure that effective risk mitigants and sound internal controls are in place. General permission to banks to issue debit cards in tie-up with non-bank entities.5,000 branches are proposed to be covered by RTGS connectivity, and the number of monthly transactions of the system is expected to expand from one lakh to two lakh. The National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) system would be implemented in phases for all networked branches of banks all over the country. The pilot project for Cheque Truncation System is expected to be implemented in New Delhi by end-March 2006. National settlement system (NSS) to enable banks to manage liquidity in an efficient and cost effective manner to be introduced in the four metropolitan centres by end-December 2005. New company for retail payment systems proposed to be set up under Section 25 of Companies Act; to be owned and operated by banks and likely to get operational from April 1, 2006. Banks urged to test their business continuity plans periodically. Currency chest facility and licence to conduct foreign exchange business (authorised person licence) to scheduled UCBs registered under the Multi-State Co- operative Societies Act and under the State Acts where the State Governments concerned have assured regulatory coordination by entering into MoU with the Reserve Bank. Acquirer UCB to be permitted to amortise the losses taken over from the acquired UCB over a period of not more than five years, including the year of merger. Details of the scheme regarding implementation of the provisions of the Right to Information Act, 2005 have been placed on the Reserve Bank's website. The Reserve Bank has recently updated its nominal effective exchange rates (NEER) and real effective exchange rates (REER) indices. The new 6-currency indices and the revised 36-country indices of NEER and REER would be published in the the Reserve Bank of India Bulletin of December 2005. The Third Quarter Review of Part I of the annual policy to be undertaken on January 24, 2006. Alpana Killawala Chief General manager6 Dr.Y. Venugopal Reddy. Governor, in a meeting with Chief Executives of major commercial banks today presented the mid-term Review of the annual policy Statement for 2005-06. The Statement consists of two parts: Part I. Review of Annual Statement on Monetary Policy for the Year 2005-06; and Part II. Review of Annual Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies for the Year 2005-06. An analytical review of macroeconomic and monetary developments was issued, a day in advance, as a supplement to Part I of the Statement providing the necessary information and technical analysis with the help of simple charts and tables. Domestic Developments GDP Growth in 2005-06 Based on the current assessment of a pick-up in agricultural output and in the momentum in industrial and services sectors. Governor placed the GDP growth in 2005-06 in the range of 7.0-7.5 per cent as against around 7.0 per cent as projected earlier. He added that the kharif output may register an increase over the previous year's level. In addition, the improvement in water storage levels over the previous year augurs well for the outlook on rabi production. Prospects for sustained growth in industrial output have improved in an environment of rising investment and export demand, strong corporate profitability and buoyant business confidence. Inflation Rate Inflation, as measured by variations in the wholesale price index (WPI), on a point-to- point basis, receded from 6.0 per cent in April 2005 to 4.6 per cent by October 8, 2005 despite upward adjustments in the administered prices of petrol, diesel and electricity and increase in the prices of aviation turbine fuel, naphtha, furnace oil and iron and steel. On an average basis, annual inflation based on the WPI was 5.3 per cent as on October 8, 2005 as compared with 6.2 per cent a year ago. Governor said that the commitment to price stability has earned some success during the year so far. Given the outlook for inflation primarily in the context of the oil economy in India, however, it may be difficult to contain the inflation in the range of 5.0-5.5 per cent projected earlier without an appropriate policy response. It is also necessary to recognise and formulate a forward looking policy response in a manner that the growth momentum and the potential for higher growth is realised without adding to inflation expectations. Monetary and Credit Indicators Assessing the growth in monetary and credit aggregates. Governor said that money supply (M ) has increased by 9.6 per cent in the first half and may turn out to be 3 somewhat higher than the earlier projection of 14.5 per cent for the full year. Aggregate deposit growth is also expected to be higher than Rs.2,60,000 crore projected earlier. Non-food bank credit including investments in bonds/debentures/shares of public sector undertakings and private corporate sector, commercial paper (CP) etc., is expected to increase significantly, higher than 19.07.8 per cent in the first half as compared with 21.4 per cent a year ago and is expected to increase significantly higher than 19.0 per cent projected earlier. Non-food credit has witnessed a structural shift towards the non- agriculture non-industrial sectors in recent years. However, credit off-take has been broad-based this year. Growth in non-agricultural non-industrial sector is led by housing, real estate and personal loans. Scheduled commercial banks' investments in bonds/debentures/shares of public sector undertakings and private corporate sector, commercial paper (CP), etc., declined by 11.7 per cent in the first half as compared with a decline of 3.9 per cent in the corresponding period last year. Fiscal Position and Government Borrowings The revenue deficit and gross fiscal deficit (GFD) of the Central Government during April-August, 2005 accounted for about 78.0 per cent and 57.1 per cent of the budget estimates for 2005-06, as compared with 82.6 per cent and 38.2 per cent, respectively, in the corresponding period of the preceding year. The market borrowing programme of the Centre and States envisaged for 2005-06 is higher than in the previous year. Governor mentioned that the market borrowing programme of the Central Government has so far remained consistent with the projections set out in the Union Budget. Underlying liquidity conditions and shifts in banks' portfolio preferences in favour of credit has, however, entailed some hardening of yields. Continued large borrowings from the market by the Centre and the States pose concerns for the efficient conduct of debt management as well as for monetary operations. Regarding market borrowing of the States, with the phasing out of Central Plan Loans to the States, higher devolution of taxes and grants from the Centre to the States and larger receipts from the national small saving fund (NSSF). States' market borrowings is not likely to be out of alignment with the net allocation for 2005-06. Scheduled commercial banks' investment in government and other approved securities at Rs.14,283 crore in the first half of 2005-06 was lower than that of Rs. 28,526 crore in the first half of the previous year, partly on account of the pick-up in credit demand. A substantial support for the market borrowing programme has been coming from non-bank entities. Liquidity Scenario During 2005-06 up to October 14, 2005 additional liquidity of Rs.4,065 crore was absorbed under the MSS. Notwithstanding the MSS operations, surplus liquidity conditions resulted in the reverse repo volumes tendered under the LAF increasing from an average of Rs.29,809 crore in March to Rs.34,832 crore in August before declining to Rs.21,128 crore in October. Governor noted that up to July, the absorption of liquidity through the MSS was more than offset by decreasing reverse repo levels. Thereafter. LAF reverse repo increased sharply as liquidity conditions eased with the resumption of inflows from abroad. Total liquidity that remained sterilised (in the form of MSS. LAF and surplus balances of Central Government) increased from an average of about Rs.1,14,192 crore in March to Rs.1,23,844 crore in August before declining to Rs.1,20,076 crore in October 2005.85 per cent, while the average collateralised borrowing and lending obligation (CBLO) rate increased from 4.58 per cent to 4.80 per cent. The average daily volume of CBLO increased significantly from Rs.5,185 crore to Rs.8,572 crore. Public sector banks kept their rates for deposits of over one year unchanged in the range of 5.25-6.50 per cent during April-September 2005. The benchmark prime lending rates (BPLRs) of public sector banks, private sector banks and foreign banks also remained unchanged in the first half of 2005. Equity market activity recorded a pick-up in terms of issuances. The BSE Sensex recovered from weak sentiment in April and rallied with intermittent corrections in the successive months and rose to a new peak of 8800 on October 4, 2005 after which it registered some decline. External Developments Exports. Imports and Trade Balance Exports during the first half of 2005-06 increased by 20.5 per cent in US dollar terms as compared with 30.8 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year. India's merchandise export growth surpassed that of most Asian countries during this period. The overall trade deficit during the first half widened to US $ 20.3 billion from US $ 11.9 billion a year ago, reflecting the hardening of international crude oil prices and more significantly, import demand emanating from a pick-up in domestic industrial activity. Balance of Payments During 2004-05, the current account recorded a deficit of US $ 6.4 billion after remaining in surplus over the preceding three years beginning in 2001-02. The turnaround to current account balance deficit has entailed step-up in recourse to debt flows and a distinct moderation in the accretion to the reserves. Foreign exchange reserves at US$ 143.4 billion as on October 14, 2005 with net accretion of US$1.9 billion since April. There are significant shifts within balance of payments which have implications for the conduct of monetary policy. Import to GDP ratio having risen to 17.2 per cent in 2004-05, after hovering around 13.0 per cent during previous five years, the trade deficit is emerging as the key determinant of India's balance of payments. Governor explained that a key factor underlying the phenomenon of current account balances has been the buoyancy in net invisible earnings which has been sustained in the current financial year so far. Remittances from Indians employed abroad at 3.3 per cent of GDP seem to be of a significantly permanent nature. It is in this context that the current level of the trade deficit and the current account deficit appear to be manageable through normal capital flows. However, in view of the oil prices rise and continued strong investment demand, the evolving developments in the balance of payments warrant careful and continuous monitoring. He added that the substitution of debt by non-debt flows in preceding years gives room for manoeuvre since debt9 per US dollar by October 21, 2005. However, it appreciated by 4.2 per cent against the Euro, by 2.5 per cent against the Pound sterling and by 4.5 per cent against the Japanese yen during the period. The payment obligation on account of the redemption of India Millennium Deposits (IMDs) of about US $ 7.1 billion is due in December 2005. The Reserve Bank is closely coordinating with the State Bank of India (SBI) and other involved banks and it would be ensured that the discharge of liabilities would be without any adverse impact on Indian financial market. Global Developments Global Growth Global economic activity has slackened in the second quarter of 2005, stalled by weak growth in the Euro area and Japan though domestic demand was sustained in the US. Growth has been robust in several developing countries, including those in Asia, led by China and India. Latin America, the Middle East and Russia. Global output growth to slow down moderately to 4.3 per cent in 2005 from 5.1 per cent in 2004. Global Inflation Rise in oil prices has triggered fears of generalised inflationary pressures globally. Consumer price inflation up in most advanced economies in the third quarter of 2005. Inflation has also risen in major emerging market economies, excluding China and in other developing countries. Oil price remain the single largest risk to the global economy exacerbated by the continued increase in global demand, geopolitical uncertainties, strong refining demand and a series of supply disruptions. It has a large permanent component which needs to be eventually passed to the consumers in medium-term but could lead to significant increase in domestic inflation and higher interest rates in the short-term. Risks to Growth Risks to global growth also emanate from the persisting macroeconomic imbalances and the resulting abundance of global liquidity which carries the potential of fuelling asset bubbles, excessive leveraging in financial markets and threats to global financial stability. The current configuration of good growth, low inflation, abundant liquidity, flat yield curves, lowering of credit risk premia and ever-expanding search for yields has benefited many emerging market economies. On the downside, the same combination of factors has allowed the macro imbalances to widen and has resulted in a build-up of debt, especially by the household sector. These factors have imparted an apparent stability to the financial system while sowing seeds of potential disequilibrium that might require a larger adjustment at a later stage. Monetary policy has also been tightened in several economies in emerging Asia, primarily inresponse to higher fuel prices. The indications in policy debates are towards either tightening or withdrawal of the accommodative stance. Stance of Monetary Policy for the Second Half of 2005-06 Governor mentioned that the conduct of monetary policy during the first half of 2005- 06 has been broadly in accordance with the stated stance. On balance, macroeconomic and financial conditions have evolved as anticipated. Overall industrial growth has strengthened, monsoon fears have eased, non-food credit growth has been buoyant, broad-based and supportive of the acceleration in industrial activity. However, the rising shares of housing and real estate in particular has warranted precautionary policy action to ensure credit quality. The demand for government securities from insurance companies and other non-bank financial institutions has been sustained. A pick-up in investment demand is evident and the business climate has improved considerably. Monetary conditions have evolved in an orderly manner. Liquidity mismatches have also been met in an orderly manner with the flexibility available, particularly under the LAF mechanism and operation of MSS. The pass-through of the escalation in international crude prices has been managed well and timed into the ebbing phase of inflation. Accordingly, the inflationary outcome has so far turned out to be consistent with initial projections and inflationary expectations are stable. Financial markets have remained stable and supportive of growth. Widening of the trade deficit has automatically absorbed the capital flows and economised on monetary policy action to sterilise these flows. Current account deficit remains within manageable limits, supported by rising international competitiveness of India's invisible exports and remittances from Indians working overseas. However, several factors posing a downward risk to the outlook on growth and inflation have emerged in the recent months. Non-food credit expansion has been high. Despite high non-food credit growth, the share of credit to infrastructure remains low relative to the size and state of the economy. Inflation is low in terms of commodity prices but asset prices, especially housing prices, have registered a substantial increase. Asset price changes continue to pose a challenge for monetary policy as it can have a powerful effect on investment and/or consumption through a financial accelerator effect. Global crude oil prices continue to be high and volatile and an overwhelming part of the increase in recent years is now increasingly being regarded as permanent. Trade and current account deficit has been widening but the invisible surplus and capital inflows have ensured a comfortable balance of payments situation. International interest rates cycles had so far shown mixed behaviour but currently the general indications are that the accommodative stance is being withdrawn and, in some cases, may be tightened. This has implications for capital flows. Governor cautioned that these factors warrant close monitoring for sustaining the growth process with a tolerable level of inflation. Upside inflationary pressures from oil prices can be expected to continue with attendant direct and indirect effects. So far, there has been only partial pass-through of international crude prices into domestic prices of petroleum products and second round effects have not yet become noticeably significant. At this stage, therefore, it is necessary to contain inflationary expectations in response to the evolving oil scenario and continue to take measures in a forward looking manner. It is necessaryto be in readiness to take further measures as warranted to meet the challenges posed by the evolving situation, given the unfolding of the risks. The Reserve Bank will continue to ensure that appropriate liquidity is maintained in the system so that all legitimate requirements of credit are met, consistent with the objective of price stability. Towards this end. RBI will continue with its policy of active demand management of liquidity through OMO including MSS. LAF and CRR, and using all the policy instruments at its disposal flexibly, as and when the situation warrants. In sum, barring the emergence of any adverse and unexpected developments in various sectors of the economy and keeping in view the current assessment of the economy including the outlook for inflation, the overall stance of monetary policy for the remaining part of the year will be: Consistent with emphasis on price stability, provision of appropriate liquidity to meet genuine credit needs and support export and investment demand in the economy. Ensuring an interest rate environment that is conducive to macroeconomic and price stability, and maintaining the growth momentum. To consider measures in a calibrated and prompt manner, in response to evolving circumstances with a view to stabilising inflationary expectations. Monetary Measures (a) Bank Rate On a review of macroeconomic development, bank Rate kept unchanged at 6.0 per cent. (b) Reverse Repo Rate In view of the current macroeconomic and overall monetary conditions, it has been decided to increase the fixed reverse repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility by 25 basis points with effect from October 26,2005 to 5.25 per cent. The repo rate will continue to be linked to the reverse repo rate. The spread between the reverse repo rate and the repo rate has been retained at 100 basis points, as at present. Accordingly, the fixed repo rate under LAF will be 6.25 per cent, effective October 26, 2005. (c) Cash Reserve Ratio The cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks is currently at 5.0 per cent. While the Reserve Bank continues to pursue its medium-term objective of reducing the CRR to the statutory minimum level of 3.0 per cent, on a review of the current liquidity situation, it is felt desirable to keep the present level of CRR at 5.0 per cent unchanged. Developmental and Regulatory Policies Governor stated that the annual policy Statements as well as mid-term Reviews of the Reserve Bank have progressively sharpened the focus on developmental and regulatory policies to strengthen the financial system, with a view to ensuring financial stability as a prerequisite for high and stable growth. The Reserve Bank's approach has been to reorient its role in the context of the evolving conditions for improving institutional soundness, strengthening the regulatory and supervisory processes and developing the necessary legal and technological infrastructure. In this context, the Reserve Bank is continually broadening its consultative and participative process for wider involvement of all stakeholders in the financial systemwith a view to encouraging a more informed evaluation of the underlying content and quality of policies. On the development and regulatory policies in this mid-term Review, the focus is one enhancing delivery of appropriate credit at a reasonable price, developing financial markets and enhancing the integration of various segments of the financial markets with proper checks and balances. Within the emphasis assigned to credit delivery to agriculture and the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector, developing a conducive environment for micro-finance institutions (MFIs) to cover financial services in addition to credit requires specific attention. With a view to ensuring financial inclusion of all segments of the population, in both rural and urban areas, a comprehensive framework to revive the co-operative credit system, revitalise the regional rural banks (RRBs) and reorient commercial banking towards the credit- disadvantaged sections of society assumes high priority. Interest Rate Policy On further deregulation of interest rates. Reserve Bank constituted an Internal Working Group on NRI Deposits which submitted its report in September 2005. Furthermore, the Indian Banks' Association (IBA) has been requested to constitute technical groups for preparation of discussion papers on review and deregulation of interest rate on savings bank deposits and lending rates on small loans up to Rs.2 lakh. Review of BPLR system Indian Banks' Association may, in consultation with its member banks, review the benchmark prime lending rate (BPLR) system and issue transparent guidelines for appropriate pricing of credit. Current system has not fully met expectations. Competition has forced the pricing of significant portion of loans far out of alignment with BPLRs and in non-transparent manner. There is a public perception that there is under-pricing of credit for corporates while there could be over-pricing of lending to agriculture and small and medium enterprises. Therefore, a need has arisen to review the current procedures and processes of pricing of credit through a well structured and segment-wise analysis of costs at various stages of intermediation in the whole credit cycle. Financial Markets Money Market A screen-based negotiated quote-driven system for all dealings in call/notice and term money market and an electronic trading platform for conduct of market repo operations in government securities, in addition to the existing voice-based system, are being developed by Clearing Corporation of India Ltd. Government Securities Market As indicated earlier, in the post FRBM Act period, the Reserve Bank will reorient government debt management operations while simultaneously strengthening monetary operations in order to prepare for withdrawing from primary financing of the Central Government's borrowing programme, effective April 2006. Accordingly, the Reserve Bank has constituted a new department named as Financial Markets Department (FMD) in July 2005 with a view to moving towards functional separation between debt management and monetary operations. To begin with, the functions of the FMD include OMO. LAF. MSS and standing liquidity facilities; regulation anddevelopment of money market instruments and monitoring of money, government securities and foreign exchange markets. The functions of the FMD would also cover the Reserve Bank's operations in the domestic foreign exchange market, in due course, in order to achieve the desired integration with conduct of monetary operations. The recommendations of the Technical Group relating to restructuring the underwriting obligations of primary dealers (PDs), allowing PDs exclusivity in primary auctions, introduction of 'When Issued' market and limited short selling in government securities were examined by the Reserve Bank in consultation with the Government. Accordingly, as a first step, it is proposed: to introduce intra-day short selling in government securities. Guidelines in this regard would be issued separately. Operationalisation of Electronic Trading Platform As indicated in the annual policy Statement of April 2005, a screen-based order- driven anonymous NDS Order Matching (NDS-OM) Module has been operationalised in August 2005. In the first phase, the NDS-OM module has been introduced for RBI-regulated NDS members. It is now proposed: to extend NDS-OM module to all insurance entities which are mandated to invest in government securities. Revision of WMA/Overdraft Scheme for State Governments: Status Advisory Committee to Review the WMA Scheme constituted in April 2005 (Chairman: Shri M.P. Bezbaruah) is expected to submit its report shortly. The report would then be discussed with the State Governments. Foreign Exchange Market The recommendations of the Internal Group on Forex Markets, particularly those on writing of covered options by corporates, hedging of economic risk of corporates in resp"
Poland,2005-10-26,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 26 October 2005 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL Held on 25-26 October 2005 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: reference rate 4.50% on an annual basis; lombard rate 6.00% on an annual basis; deposit rate 3.00% on an annual basis; rediscount rate 4.75% on an annual basis and to maintain its easing monetary policy bias. Since the last meeting of the Council, the outlook for economic growth in the euro area and the United States has not changed significantly. However, the US inflation forecasts for the next year have been revised upwards. In September 2005 the growth rate of consumer prices in the United States rose to its highest level since 1991, up to 4.7% y/y as compared to 3.6% in August. In the euro area, inflation increased to 2.6% y/y against 2.2% in August. In both cases, inflation hike was mainly fed by high oil prices in the world markets. October 2005 saw a slight decrease of crude oil prices. As compared with August. Brent oil prices decreased by 7.5 USD per barrel, i.e. by 11.1%. However, both current and forecast oil prices remain high. There still persists large uncertainty about the impact of the considerable accumulated growth of oil prices on economic growth and inflation In Poland, industrial output in September 2005 grew by 5.5% (y/y), which equals 5.1% in seasonally adjusted terms. The recovery in construction, observed since 2004, has continued. The annual growth of construction and assembly output in September 2005 stood at 10.5% (y/y) and in seasonally adjusted terms at 12.7%. This was primarily the result of an almost twofold increase of output in construction site development companies. Retail sales rose by 5.4% y/y. The October business tendency surveys conducted by GUS did not reveal any significant change in enterprises' assessment of economic climate. The September data do not suffice to assess if economic growth acceleration was actually as large as expected in the August Inflation Report. The more complete assessment will be possible once GUS data on Q3 have been released. Available data point to a steady improvement in the labour market. In September 2005 the employment in the enterprise sector rose by 2.2% y/y, while the unemployment rate declined to17.6%, i.e. by 1.3 percentage point as compared to the corresponding month of the previous year. ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51. In September 2005, the growth in nominal wages in the enterprise sector fell to 1.8% y/y (against 3.2% in July and 2.8% in August). The moderate wage growth, if sustained, would contribute to a further growth in employment and  with labour productivity growth still considerably higher than wage growth  to limiting inflationary pressure. Due to a lack of data on wages outside the corporate sector in Q3 2005, it is difficult to assess the future wage developments in the whole economy. In line with the expectations of the NBP and external forecasters, in September 2005 the annual growth of consumer prices increased and amounted to 1.8%. Core inflation indicators remained low and stayed below the inflation target (net inflation had not changed since August and stood at 1.3%). Inflation expectations of households have edged up, yet they still stay below the inflation target. It can be expected that, due to the moderate growth in demand and the disappearance of the statistical base effect, inflation will remain low until the end of 2005, i.e. markedly below the inflation target of 2.5%. The impact of high oil prices on producer prices in industry has so far been offset by the stronger than last year zloty exchange rate against the dollar and by a moderate growth of domestic demand. In September 2005, like in August, producer prices in industry decreased by 0.2% y/y (0.0% m/m). In October 2005 the zloty exchange rate was stronger than accounted for in the August Inflation Report. Zloty appreciation was conducive to sustaining low inflation despite high crude oil prices. The Council expresses the hope that the parliament and the government formed after the general election will introduce necessary structural reforms, in particular by acting towards a prompt reduction of public finance sector deficit, which should support long-term economic growth and ensure Poland's entry to the euro area at the earliest possible date. The Council maintains its opinion that inflation may return to the target sooner than it was forecasted in the August inflation projection. It is expected that having achieved the target, inflation will remain at a level close to the target. The moderate wage growth is an indication than no second round effects have materialised so far. Should there appear signals of increased probability that these effects should occur, the balance of risks might change, which would then affect the future decisions of the Council. The Council has also decided to change the release schedule of the Inflation Report and the NBP staff inflation projection, which is a part of the Report. This decision is due to a new schedule of quarterly GDP estimates releases by GUS (CSO). The GDP estimates are now released no later than 60 days after the end of each quarter, i.e. a few days before or after the publication of the Inflation Report. Therefore, with the previous Report publication schedule in place, it would not be possible to include the GUS estimates in the Report. For this reason the upcoming Report will be released in January 2006, after the Council meeting. Subsequent Reports are to be released quarterly, i.e. in April. July and October 2006. The Council has also adopted The Balance of Payments of the Republic of Poland for 2005 Q2. The next meeting of the Council will be held on 29-30 November 2005."
United States,2005-11-01,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4 percent. Elevated energy prices and hurricane-related disruptions in economic activity have temporarily depressed output and employment. However, monetary policy accommodation, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity that will likely be augmented by planned rebuilding in the hurricane-affected areas. The cumulative rise in energy and other costs has the potential to add to inflation pressures; however, core inflation has been relatively low in recent months and longer-term inflation expectations remain contained. The Committee perceives that, with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal. With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured. Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan. Chairman; Timothy F Geithner. Vice Chairman; Susan S Bies; Roger W Ferguson. Jr.; Richard W Fisher; Donald L Kohn; Michael H Moskow; Mark W Olson; Anthony M Santomero; and Gary H Stern. In a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 25-basis point increase in the discount rate to 5 percent. In taking this action, the Board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston. New York. Philadelphia. Cleveland. Richmond. Atlanta. Chicago. St. Louis. Minneapolis. Kansas City. Dallas, and San Francisco."
Euroarea,2005-11-03,"Let me report on the outcome of today's meeting, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, taking into account ongoing upward pressure on prices stemming mainly from energy price developments, we have concluded that the monetary policy stance still remains appropriate. Accordingly, we have decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. At the same time, strong vigilance with regard to the upside risks to price stability is warranted. Strong vigilance is also called for in the light of ample liquidity and buoyant monetary and credit growth in the euro area. It is of the essence that the increase in current inflation rates does not translate into inflationary pressures over the medium term and to ensure that inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. Across the maturity spectrum, interest rates in the euro area remain very low in both nominal and real terms, and the current very accommodative stance of monetary policy lends considerable support to economic activity. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Although economic growth has been dampened by the marked increase in oil prices over recent quarters, it appears that the euro area economy has shown considerable resilience to this shock, supported also by responsible wage-negotiating behaviour. Moreover, the latest indicators suggest that economic activity is currently strengthening. This would be in line with the September ECB staff projections, which indicate a gradual recovery from the second half of 2005 onwards. On the external side, it is projected that ongoing growth in global demand will support euro area exports, and on the domestic side, that investment will benefit from continued favourable financing conditions, as well as from the robust growth of corporate earnings. Consumption should gradually recover, broadly in line with expected developments in real disposable income. At the same time, the outlook for economic activity remains subject to downward risks, relating mainly to oil prices, concerns about global imbalances and weak consumer confidence. Turning to price developments, recent increases in mainly energy prices have pushed headline inflation rates to levels significantly in excess of 2%. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 2.5% in October 2005, compared with 2.6% in September and 2.2% in the two preceding months. It is likely that HICP inflation will remain elevated in the short term. As we stressed in October, it is key in interpreting current inflation rates to make a clear distinction between temporary, short-term factors on the one hand, and those of a more lasting nature on the other. While some developments might prove to be transitory, markets expect oil prices to remain at high levels, driven mainly by buoyant global demand and, to some extent, by fragilities on the supply side. This suggests a more lasting impact of energy prices on overall price developments. This assumption underlies our forward-looking assessment of price developments. At the same time, wage increases have remained contained over recent quarters and, with labour markets weak, this should continue for the time being. Moreover, pressure from manufacturing prices remains low given strong global competition. All in all, while inflation rates are expected to stay above 2% over the shorter term, there continues to be no clear evidence yet of domestic inflationary pressures building up in the euro area. We remain, however, concerned about the medium-term upside risks to this scenario. As we stressed a month ago, these relate to ongoing uncertainties surrounding oil market developments, to a potentially stronger pass-through than has so far been observed, on account of higher oil prices being passed on to consumers via the domestic production chain, and to potential second-round effects in wage and price-setting behaviour. In addition, possible further increases in administered prices and indirect taxes have to be taken into account. Hence, strong vigilance is required to ensure that medium and long-term inflation expectations for the euro area remain well-anchored. The monetary analysis also points to increased upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. Liquidity in the euro area is very ample by all plausible measures. Moreover, the strengthening of monetary growth observed since mid-2004 has gained further momentum over the past few months. Growth in the monetary aggregate M3 has been driven by its most liquid components, confirming the increasingly dominant impact of the low level of interest rates. Furthermore, the growth of borrowing, especially mortgage loans, remains very robust. In this context, price dynamics in a number of housing markets need to be monitored closely. To sum up, the economic analysis indicates that energy price increases, in particular, imply upward revisions to the outlook for short-term price developments. Some of the contributing factors can be expected to be temporary but others are likely to be more lasting. Domestic inflationary pressures over the medium term still remain contained in the euro area, but significant upside risks have to be taken into account. Moreover, the monetary analysis identifies increased risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. Overall, cross-checking the information from the two pillars confirms that strong vigilance is warranted to keep inflation expectations in line with price stability. Only by keeping medium and long-term inflation expectations firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability can monetary policy make a significant ongoing contribution towards a recovery in economic growth. As regards fiscal policies, a number of countries have presented their 2006 budget plans. Despite some welcome progress with fiscal consolidation, the outlook for countries in excessive deficit is a matter of great concern, as there is a risk of consolidation not proceeding and commitments for this year and next not being met. Further delays in the correction of excessive deficits and a continued inclination to look for the most lenient way to implement the procedural steps of the revised Stability and Growth Pact risk undermining the Pact's credibility. All parties involved in the forthcoming decisions carry an important responsibility to ensure the proper functioning of the overall fiscal framework in the future. This would be the most effective way to enhance the growth prospects of the euro area and to build confidence in public finances ahead of the time when the challenges of population ageing set in. We therefore urge countries with fiscal imbalances to give priority to their timely correction and to implement the revised Pact rigorously. This will send the right signal to the public and support the credibility of the fiscal framework. As regards structural reforms, we stress again the urgent need to increase the flexibility of labour and product markets in order to achieve a more dynamic and competitive European economy and to help foster the adjustment processes within the euro area. The opportunities arising from globalisation and rapid technological change can best be captured by allowing and by speeding up structural change with a view to enhancing potential growth and employment creation. This would also help to facilitate the necessary adjustment to the higher level of oil prices by further increasing energy efficiency and energy savings, while avoiding distortionary measures that hamper the adjustment process."
Romania,2005-11-09,"The Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided to maintain the level of its policy interest rate at 7.5 percent per annum and to increase the volume of sterilization through open market operations. The Board of the National Bank of Romania has reaffirmed its decision to conserve the prudent stance of monetary policy with a view to ensuring the sustainability of the programmed pace of disinflation. In its meeting of November 9, 2005, the Board of the National Bank of Romania analyzed the evolutions in recent months of a broad range of macroeconomic and financial market indicators, as well as their prospects in the context of recently adopted and forthcoming macroeconomic and structural policy measures. The disinflation process resumed in the third quarter and continued in the first part of the fourth quarter of 2005, with the annual inflation rate dropping in October to its lowest level in 15 years (8.1 percent). Consumer price growth deceleration is, however, still impeded by supply-side factors, especially by the dynamics of world oil prices, as well as by the persistence of pressures exerted by the rapid growth of aggregate demand. Third quarter statistics show domestic absorption dynamics staying high, comparable in relative terms to figures registered in the previous quarter. The expansion of its principal components during the current period - household consumption and private investment - has been mainly underpinned by the substantial growth of disposable income and the acceleration of private sector indebtedness, the latter stimulated by favorable access conditions to alternative sources of bank and non-bank financing, both domestic and external. As a consequence of reduced pressures induced by short-term capital inflows, leu appreciation has slowed, the domestic currency exchange rate even registering a change in trajectory from the end of September. The assessment of current and future economic conditions indicates that the present level of the policy rate is compatible with the medium-term disinflation perspective. In this context, the National Bank of Romania will maintain the prudent stance of monetary policy and will resort to its entire array of instruments, including through increasing the volume of sterilization, in order to counteract increasing inflationary pressures. The persistence of a risk of reappearance of potentially volatile inflows will be counterbalanced by the need to ensure the attainment of the projected disinflation path. As a consequence, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided to maintain its policy interest rate at the level of 7.5 percent per annum and to increase the volume of liquidity sterilized through open market operations (one-month deposit auctions and certificates of deposit issued by the NBR). At the same time, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided to increase the interest rate paid on minimum required reserves in US dollars from 0.80 percent to 0.95 percent per annum, while keeping unchanged the interest rate paid on minimum required reserves in lei and euro. In the same meeting, the Board approved the Inflation Report no. 2 (November 2005), which provides an assessment of the recent macroeconomic context, presents the inflation perspective in a six-quarter horizon, and identifies the main challenges and constraints on monetary policy in the next period, in the context of inflation targeting. This report will be made public in a press conference scheduled for November 16, 2005."
Chile,2005-11-10,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 10 November 2005 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.5% (annual). Third quarter's output growth was somewhat lower than forecast in the last Monetary Policy Report, although it is still above trend. Investment growth remains strong, and employment continues to increase at a fast pace. Domestic interest rates on various instruments have increased in the past few weeks, but financial conditions in Chile continue to be expansionary. Although inflation and interest rates in developed countries have also risen, the external scenario continues to be favorable, with a persistently high copper price and the prospect of high world growth, albeit with higher risks. In October, inflation exceeded previous projections, mainly due to the incidence of perishable goods' prices. Thus, annual CPI inflation was above 4% and is expected to remain above the target range during the first months of 2006. Core inflation measures CPIX and CPIX1 (that exclude fuels, perishables and some regulated utilities, among others) continue to be well contained until now, as are inflation expectations, which for one year or more are around 3%. This is consistent with a transitory increase in annual inflation and its subsequent convergence to the center of the target range, as forecast in the latest Monetary Policy Report. The Board believes it is appropriate to reaffirm its commitment with price stability as well as its willingness to reduce the prevailing monetary stimulus at the necessary pace to maintain expected inflation around 3% per annum in the policy horizon of 12 to 24 months. * The Spanish original prevails."

South Korea,2005-11-10,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (3.5%) for the intermeeting period. (An unofficial English translation based on the Korean original of the decision on monetary policy taken by the Monetary Policy Committee on November 10, 2005 is attached). In the real economy, while an improvement of facilities investment has not yet been sufficient and construction investment has slowed, exports exhibit robust growth and the recovery of private consumption shows solid movements. Meanwhile, the current account is still running a surplus, thanks to that on the goods account. Both consumer price inflation and core inflation maintain overall stability and the upward pace of real estate prices has slowed down. Nevertheless, there are latent inflationary pressures due to the persistently high oil prices. In the financial markets, overall liquidity conditions are favorable and financial institutions‘ loans continue to increase led by those to small and medium enterprises. On the other hand, long-term market interest rates have maintained upward trend. Taking the above economic and financial conditions into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (3.5%) for the intermeeting period."
Peru,2005-11-15,"Press Release MONETARY PROGRAM FOR NOVEMBER 2005 CENTRAL BANK KEPT REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 3.00% The Board of the Central Bank approved to keep the reference interest rates for the interbank market at 3.00 percent. In this decision it has been considered: The Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) increased 0.14 percent in October. Thus, the inflation rate over the last twelve months increased from 1.1 percent in September to 1.3 percent in October. For the fourth consecutive month, the inflation rate is located below the lower limit of the target range (1.5 percent). Nevertheless, it is expected that the inflation rate is located around the lower limit at the end of the year and between 1.5 and 2.5 percent throughout the year 2006, reaching around the 2.5 percent target at the end of that year. 2005 GDP growth will be close to 6 percent and the rate projected for 2006 stays at 5 percent. In the third quarter, domestic demand is showing a higher growth than GDP. It is being observed recently a real exports' growth slowdown, although with rates higher than 5 percent according to the forecasts of the August Inflation Report. The terms of trade evolution continues being favorable for the economy. It was also approved to maintain the lending and deposit interest rates for the Central Bank operations: For direct repos and monetary regulation credits, the rate is kept at 3.75 percent. For overnight deposits, the rate is maintained at 2.25% percent. In case that the interbank interest rate be higher than 3.75 percent, monetary regulation credits and direct repos will be charged with the market interbank interest rate. The interest rates for the following operations in dollars between the Central Bank and the Financial System are: Monetary regulation credits: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point. Overnight deposits: overnight LIBOR minus 3/8 of a percentage point. Swaps: the commission is maintained to a level that implies a minimum annual effective cost of 3.75 percent. Reserve requirement in foreign currency subject to a payment: 2.25 percent. The session in which the Board will approve the following Monetary Program (December 2005) will be held on December 1th, 2005. ."
Philippines,2005-11-16,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board maintained the BSP's key policy interest rates at 7.5 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.75 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. The Monetary Board noted that there is evidence to support the maintenance of policy settings. The recent easing of foreign crude oil prices and the appreciation of the peso imply reduced cost-push pressures in the near term. There are continuing soft spots in the economy, based on various indicators of employment, demand and bank credit. However, the Monetary Board is of the view that the risks to inflation still remain. While showing some easing, domestic liquidity still remains high. Overall conditions for inflation and output may require a preemptive monetary response. In particular, potential shifts in the public's inflation expectations continue to be a major policy concern given the possibility of a sustained deviation from the government targets until 2007. Looking ahead, the Monetary Board will continue to monitor closely the evolving conditions for consumer prices, aggregate demand, domestic liquidity and other factors in order to determine the appropriate stance of monetary policy. The Monetary Board remains committed to the BSP's inflation objectives and stands ready to take the necessary action to protect the Government's inflation targets."

Israel,2005-11-28,"28.11.2005 The Bank of Israel's raises the interest rate for December 2005 by 50 basis points, to 4.5 percent The Bank of Israel today announced that the interest rate for December 2005 will rise by 50 basis points, to 4.5 percent. The rise is necessary to help keep inflation within the government's target of price-stability--defined as an inflation rate of between one percent and three percent a year. The decision was essentially based on the increasing number of indications of continued upward pressure on prices. Thus the rate of inflation, which has risen in the last few months, is expected to reach close to the upperlimit of the inflation target range in 2005, and may even exceed it in thefirst months of 2006. The Bank of Israel's interest policy, including the current decision, is aimed at bringing inflation back to the midpoint of the target range, but this process is expected to take several months. The following are the main reasons for the current pressures on prices:</td> The anticipated effects of the cumulative rate of depreciation of the NIS against the dollar. Continued rapid economic growth. The persistent upward trend in inflation rates world wide, which leads to higher central banks' interest rates, including the dollar interest rate. Political uncertainty affects the markets and will probably continue to do so, despitethe fact that fiscal discipline is likely to be maintained. The Bank will continue to keep inflation under close and constant review, with the intention of reaching the government's target without deviating from it either upwards or downwards. The Bank supports the attainment of the range of objectives of macroeconomic policy, and in particular, the encouragement of employment and growth.

Malaysia,2005-11-30,"Bank Negara Malaysia today announced that the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) is raised by 30 basis points to 3 percent. The ceiling and floor rates of the corridor for the OPR are correspondingly increased to 3.25 percent and 2.75 percent respectively. Since our August Monetary Policy Statement, indicators now show that the economy is stronger, and economic activity is expected to gain momentum going into next year. These growth prospects are underpinned by strengthened domestic demand and a supportive external environment. Inflation has edged up, mainly on account of higher energy prices and other costs. Going forward, while inflationary pressures are not expected to intensify, the rate of inflation is expected to remain at current levels for some time. Following the adjustment of the interest rate, the level of the OPR continues to be below its neutral level and therefore, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and supportive of the economy. Bank Negara Malaysia will closely monitor developments t o ensure that Malaysia continues to have sustainable economic growth in an environment of price stability.

Poland,2005-11-30,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 30 November 2005 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL Held on 29-30 November 2005 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: reference rate 4.50% on an annual basis; lombard rate 6.00% on an annual basis; deposit rate 3.00% on an annual basis; rediscount rate 4.75% on an annual basis and to maintain its easing monetary policy bias. Since the last meeting of the Council, the outlook for economic growth in the euro area and the United States has not changed significantly. Euro-area inflation forecasts have not been revised, while the annual rate of price growth in October 2005 dropped slightly to 2.5%, from 2.6% in September. In turn, the US inflation forecasts for 2006 have been adjusted upwards, even though the current growth rate of consumer prices decreased from 4.7% y/y in September to 4.3% in October 2005. Crude oil prices have continued falling throughout November. Since the October meeting of the Council the price of Brent oil has decreased by USD 6.81 per barrel, i.e. by 11.4%. However, the price forecasts of this commodity for 2006 have not changed significantly and remain above the currently quoted prices. The uncertainty about the impact of the considerable accumulated growth of oil prices on economic growth and inflation remains significant and still has to be taken into consideration. According to the estimates of the Central Statistical Office (GUS), the year-on-year GDP growth in Poland in 2005 Q3 was higher than in Q2. The annual GDP growth in Q3 amounted to 3.7%, which was in line with expectations presented in the August Inflation Report. Also consistent with NBP expectations was the dynamic of individual consumption and investments. Net exports  despite a strong appreciation of the zloty in 2004 and at the beginning of 2005  remained the main demand factor of economic growth in 2005 Q3. Net exports' contribution to GDP growth proved significantly larger than anticipated in the August Report. GUS data point to a strengthening of the economic recovery, which is supported by gradual acceleration in domestic demand, including investments. In October 2005 the growth rate of industrial output considerably exceeded the expectations of both external forecasters and the NBP, and amounted to 7.6% y/y, i.e. 6.8% in seasonally adjusted terms as compared to 5.7% a month before. The published data point to the strengthening of the rising tendencies in industry observed since the middle of 2005. The annual growth in construction and assembly output decreased from 10.5% in September to 6.8%, i.e. from 12.2% to 9.8% in seasonally adjusted terms. Thus, it is still running high, mainly due to a considerable revival in construction in 2005 Q2. There has also been a continuation to a moderate rising trend in ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51, retail sales, which in October rose by 7.5% y/y in nominal terms (5.7% in real terms). November has not brought any significant changes in the assessment of economic climate as signalled by enterprises in GUS business tendency surveys, while the most optimistic assessments have been recorded in construction. The favourable results of the non-financial sector in the first three quarters of 2005 published by the GUS point at good financial standing of the surveyed companies: growing revenue, high profitability and safe liquidity level. The situation in the labour market has continued to improve. Since the beginning of the year moderate growth in employment in the corporate sector has been recorded. In October 2005 it increased by 2.0% y/y and the unemployment rate fell to 17.3% y/y, i.e. by 1.4 percentage point as compared to the corresponding month of the previous year. In 2005 Q3 the growth of nominal wages in the economy fell to 3.4% y/y (against 3.9% y/y in 2005 Q2). However, the wage growth in the corporate sector in October 2005 was considerably higher than expected (nominal growth of 6.4% y/y against 1.8% y/y in September). This growth was fuelled by additional payments in certain sectors (mining of metal ores and post and telecommunications). Even after accounting for the above factors, the wage growth reported in October exceeded the average from the first three quarters of 2005. At present, it is difficult to assess whether this acceleration in wage growth will be maintained in the subsequent months. It should be emphasised that low unit labour cost growth rate is the necessary condition for sustained acceleration in economic growth grounded in the rise of employment. In line with the expectations of the NBP's experts and external forecasters, in October 2005 the annual growth in consumer prices decreased and amounted to 1.6%. Core inflation indicators decreased (net inflation amounted to 1.2% against 1.3% in September). Inflation expectations of households were low (1.5%), similar to those in September 2005. It can be expected that until the end of 2005 inflation will remain low, i.e. markedly below the inflation target of 2.5%. October 2005 saw a fall in producer prices in industry in year-on-year terms which has been continuing since May (fall by 0.9% y/y, i.e. 0.0% m/m). Low producer prices in industry were determined by moderate growth of domestic demand and stronger than last year zloty exchange rate. Since the last meeting of the Council, zloty exchange rate has not changed significantly, yet, in the first two months of 2005 Q4 the zloty remained stronger than accounted for in the August Inflation Report. The Council maintains its opinion that inflation may return to the target sooner than it was forecasted in the August inflation projection. It is expected that having achieved the target, inflation will remain at a level close to it. The moderate wage growth is an indication than no second round effects have materialised so far. Should there appear signals of increased probability that these effects should occur, the balance of risks might change, which would then affect the future decisions of the Council. The Council maintains its belief that the most favourable for Poland would be to adopt an economic strategy focused on creating conditions that would guarantee the introduction of the euro at the earliest possible date, which should contribute to acceleration in the long-term economic growth. The next meeting of the Council will be held on 20-21 December 2005."
Euroarea,2005-12-01,"Ladies and gentlemen, let me welcome you to our press conference and report on the outcome of today's meeting of the ECB's Governing Council. The meeting was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup. Prime Minister Juncker, and Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we have decided to increase the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points, after two and a half years of maintaining rates at historically low levels. Our decision to increase interest rates was warranted so as to adjust our accommodative monetary policy stance, while taking into account the risks to price stability that we have identified in our economic analysis, cross-checked by our monetary analysis. Our decision will contribute to keeping medium to long-term inflation expectations in the euro area solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. Such anchoring of inflation expectations is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting economic growth in the euro area. In fact, interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum continue to remain very low in both nominal and real terms. Thus, our policy remains accommodative and continues to lend considerable support to sustainable economic activity and job creation. We will continue to monitor closely all developments with respect to risks to price stability. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Recent data and survey evidence indicate that economic activity has strengthened in the second half of this year. According to Eurostat's first estimate, real GDP growth was 0.6% quarter on quarter in the third quarter of 2005, after 0.3% in the first and 0.4% in the second quarter. Moreover, the information on business confidence broadly remains consistent with continued economic growth towards the end of the year. Looking ahead, on the external side, ongoing growth in global demand should support euro area exports, while on the domestic side, investment should benefit from continued favourable financing conditions and the robust growth of corporate earnings. Private consumption should grow broadly in line with expected developments in real disposable income. At the same time, the outlook for economic activity remains subject to downward risks, relating mainly to higher than expected oil prices, concerns about global imbalances and weak consumer confidence. This assessment is broadly consistent with the December 2005 Eurosystem staff projections. Euro area real GDP is projected to grow at rates of between 1.2% and 1.6% in 2005, and between 1.4% and 2.4 % in 2006 and 2007. Most recent forecasts by international organisations give a similar picture. In comparison with the September 2005 ECB staff projections, the ranges projected for real GDP growth in 2005 and 2006 have been revised slightly upwards. Turning to price developments, recent increases  mainly in energy prices  have lifted headline inflation rates to levels significantly in excess of 2%. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 2.4% in November 2005, compared with 2.6% and 2.5% in the two preceding months. It is likely that annual HICP inflation rates will remain elevated in the short term. In interpreting current inflation rates, it is important to make a clear distinction between temporary, short-term factors, on the one hand, and factors of a more lasting nature, on the other. In that respect, it is of crucial importance to take a strictly forward-looking perspective, which does not allow much comfort to be drawn from the current, comparatively lower rates for measures of inflation that exclude certain components, such as energy or certain categories of food. Such measures of “core” inflation have, at least in the past, been shown to lag behind, rather than lead, the developments in headline inflation. In addition, the increase in energy prices to a large extent reflects higher global demand for energy. While it is difficult to quantify precisely this effect, it would appear inappropriate to exclude energy from the price index and at the same time retain other items, such as internationally traded manufactured goods. Owing to the same forces of globalisation, these goods currently exhibit little upward movement in prices and even suggest a downward trend. All in all, in line with our monetary policy strategy, a comprehensive and forward-looking analysis is warranted of the main underlying developments driving the outlook for price stability. This comprehensive assessment encompasses the information contained in various measures of inflation. An important input into our analysis is provided by the Eurosystem staff projections. The projections indicate average HICP inflation to lie between 2.1% and 2.3% in 2005, and between 1.6% and 2.6% in 2006. These results constitute an upward revision to the ECB staff projections of September 2005. They mainly reflect that the effects of the statistical treatment of the 2006 health reform in the Netherlands are no longer expected to distort the inflation figures for 2006. For 2007 an average inflation rate of between 1.4% and 2.6% is projected. Underlying these projections is the assumption that wage increases will remain contained, as has been the case over recent quarters. Most recent forecasts by international organisations give a broadly similar picture. In the view of the Governing Council, the main scenario for price stability emerging from the economic analysis remains subject to upside risks. Such risks relate to uncertainties arising from oil market developments, the pass-through of previous oil price increases to consumers via the domestic production chain, the possibility of second-round effects in wage and price-setting behaviour, as well as further increases in administered prices and indirect taxes. Evidence pointing to increased upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term comes from the monetary analysis. Liquidity in the euro area is ample by all plausible measures. The strengthening of monetary growth observed since mid-2004 has gained further momentum over the past months. Growth in the monetary aggregate M3 has been driven by its most liquid components, confirming the increasingly dominant impact of the low level of interest rates. Furthermore, the growth of borrowing  especially mortgage loans  remains very robust. In this context, price dynamics in a number of housing markets need to be monitored closely. To sum up, increased risks to price stability identified by the economic analysis have been cross-checked with the monetary analysis. An adjustment of our monetary policy stance was therefore warranted. Today's decision will contribute to keeping medium and long-term inflation expectations in line with price stability. Keeping inflation expectations firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability will permit monetary policy to continue to make a significant contribution towards a sustainable recovery in economic growth and job creation in the euro area. To this effect, we will continue to monitor closely all developments relevant to the medium-term outlook for price stability. As regards fiscal policies, euro area countries are now finalising their 2006 budgets and stability programmes. Plans to foster sound public finances and to undertake fiscal reforms that boost economic growth and prepare for the challenges related to population ageing in some countries are welcome. However, in countries with fiscal imbalances, the speed of consolidation is disappointingly slow and there is a high risk that commitments are not being met. It is, therefore, essential that fiscal consolidation is prioritised again as part of a comprehensive and growth-friendly reform programme. This would build confidence in the proper functioning of the Stability and Growth Pact and be the best way in which fiscal policies in the euro area can underpin economic growth. With respect to structural reforms, the Governing Council welcomed the 2005-2008 Lisbon National Reform Programmes that were submitted by EU Member States in October and November 2005, in line with the renewed Lisbon Strategy. These programmes present key country-specific challenges and structural reform measures to increase growth and employment. A parallel Community Lisbon Programme was adopted by the Commission in July 2005 to complement the national programmes with actions to be taken at the European level. Taken together, the programmes show a welcome political commitment on the part of the Member States and the Community, which could give renewed impetus to the implementation of structural reforms. To this end, it is important to match ambitious objectives with concrete policy measures and take new reform initiatives, and to monitor, evaluate and communicate the reform process effectively. Achieving the goals of the Lisbon Strategy is critical in the face of the triple challenge of accelerating globalisation, rapid technological change and ageing populations."

South Korea,2005-12-08,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) by 25 basis points from 3.5% to 3.75% for the intermeeting period. In a related action, the Committee raised the interest rates on Liquidity Adjustment Loans of the Bank of Korea by the same 25 basis points to 3.5%.

South Africa,2005-12-08,"Inflation has remained under control and within the inflation target range, and growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has been robust. The recent revisions of the GDP data show that the economy has been growing at a faster rate than previously estimated. The most significant change was to the 2004 growth rate, which is now estimated to have been 4,5 per cent. A slightly higher growth rate is expected to be achieved this year, although there are signs that the economy might be losing some of its earlier momentum. At the October MPC meeting, the inflation outlook had deteriorated somewhat, which was a cause for concern. Since then, however, recorded outcomes have been better than anticipated, and the outlook has changed somewhat. However a number of significant risks remain. Inflation as measured by the consumer price index for metropolitan and other urban areas excluding the interest cost on mortgage bonds (CPIX) declined to 4,7 per cent in September, and 4,4 per cent in October following its peak of 4,8 per cent in August. The decline occurred despite the increases in local petrol prices in September and October of R0,29 and R0,12 respectively. Since then the petrol price has been reduced by R0,31 in November and R0,30 in December. If petrol price increases were excluded from this index. CPIX inflation in September and October would have measured 3,5 per cent and 3,2 per cent respectively, reflecting a continued absence of marked second-round effects from petrol price increases. These more favourable outcomes have been due to a number of factors which partly offset the impact of the petrol price increases. Notable among these were the year-on-year declines in the prices of clothing and footwear, furniture and equipment, and homeowners' costs. Year-on-year food price inflation also remained low, measuring 2,5 per cent in October compared to 3,3 per cent in September. Services inflation moved further within the inflation target range, having declined to 5,2 per cent in October, compared to goods price inflation of 4,1 per cent. Of significance is the fact that administered prices excluding petrol declined to 4,5 per cent and 4,3 per cent in September and October respectively. This can be compared to a rate of increase of 7 per cent in May. Administered price inflation including petrol amounted to 10,0 per cent in October. Production price inflation also reversed its recent upward trend in October when it measured 4,2 per cent, compared to 4,6 per cent in September. Prices of domestically produced goods rose by 3,8 per cent and 3,5 per cent in September and October respectively, while price increases of imported goods amounted to 6,8 per cent and 5,8 per cent. The food price category continued to exhibit price declines. As a result of the lower inflation outcomes as well as the changes in some of the determinants of the inflation outlook. CPIX inflation is now forecast to run at a level somewhat below the previous forecast and reach a level of around 5 per cent by the end of 2007. There are a number of changes that have occurred since the last meeting of the MPC which have led to this improved inflation outlook. Perhaps the most significant have been developments in the international oil market. In the aftermath of the series of hurricanes and the build-up of oil inventories in the United States, oil prices have moderated somewhat and Brent crude has averaged around US$55 since November. At the time of the last MPC meeting, the price of Brent crude had fallen to just below US$60 per barrel, having averaged around US$64.50 per barrel in August and US$63 per barrel in September. The current levels are therefore significantly lower than they have been for some time. However given the risks and volatility in the oil markets, including uncertainties related to the Northern Hemisphere winter, this situation could change very rapidly, and will therefore be carefully monitored. The resultant R0,61 cumulative decline in domestic petrol prices in November and December will be reflected in the CPIX outcomes for these months. Currently there is a significant overrecovery on the petrol price which, if sustained, is likely to result in a further petrol price reduction in January. To date the overall impact of the international oil price increases on inflation and output have been far more muted than originally expected, both domestically and internationally. World growth is expected to remain relatively vigorous, particularly in the United States and Asia, and according to IMF projections, world inflation is expected to moderate next year to an average rate below 4 per cent. According to the inflation expectations survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research at the University of Stellenbosch, overall CPIX inflation expectations in the fourth quarter of 2005 remained unchanged compared to the third quarter. All categories of respondents still expect inflation to remain within the target range over the next two years. CPIX inflation is expected to average 5,2 per cent in both 2006 and 2007. This represents an unchanged picture for 2006, compared to the previous survey, but the expectations for 2007 are now 0,2 percentage points lower than in the third quarter. The expectations of trade unionists and business people increased marginally for next year, but this was offset by the decline in the expectations of analysts. Inflation expectations as indicated in the long-term break-even inflation rates, measured as the yield differential between conventional bonds and inflation-linked bonds, point to some improvement in inflation expectations. The break-even inflation rate in the five-to-eight year maturity range decreased from a recent high of 5,1 per cent in mid-October to 4,8 per cent at the end of November. Exchange rate developments have reinforced the impact of the lower international oil prices on the domestic petrol prices. The rand initially depreciated against the dollar after the last MPC meeting, but in recent weeks it has appreciated against most currencies. Since the last meeting the nominal effective exchange rate of the rand has appreciated by almost 7 per cent. This recent rand strength is explained in part by improved international perceptions of South Africa's growth prospects and higher commodity prices. In recent days the platinum price has breached the US$1,000 level, and the gold price has exceeded US$500. Wage growth has remained moderate with unit labour cost increases in the first half of the year being well within the inflation target range. Revised year-on-year increases in unit labour costs in the formal non-agricultural sector measured 3,8 per cent and 4,5 per cent in the first two quarters of this year respectively, while unit labour cost increases in the manufacturing sector measured 4,4 per cent and 0,2 per cent in the these quarters. Surveys by Andrew Levy Employment Publications show that wage settlements for the first 9 months of this year averaged 6,2 per cent, down from 6,7 per cent in the same period in 2004. Regarding fiscal policy, the October Medium Term Budget Policy Statement indicated that the budget deficit for the current fiscal year is now expected to be approximately one per cent of GDP compared to an initial budgeted estimate of 3,1 per cent. Furthermore, the projected deficits for the forthcoming two fiscal years are expected to be around 2 per cent of GDP. Output and expenditure trends however are likely to be a source of upward pressure on inflation. According to the recently revised data, the economy grew at an annualised rate of 5,2 per cent in the first two quarters of 2005 before slowing to 4,2 per cent in the third quarter. Manufacturing capacity utilisation also remained high in the third quarter and the composite leading business cycle indicator has continued on its rising trend. Although growth is expected to continue at a robust pace, there are also some indications of a slowdown in manufacturing sector growth as seen in the significant decline in the Investec/BER Purchasing Managers Index over the past four months, and the 4,9 per cent decrease in real manufacturing production in October. Expenditure also remains robust with real gross domestic final demand growing at a rate of around 6 per cent in the first three quarters of this year. Real household expenditure has been growing at a similar rate. Motor vehicle sales continued to reach new highs, but the rate of increase has declined. In October, the number of new motor vehicles sold decreased by 1,7 per cent compared to September sales. The strong demand is underpinned by the current level of interest rates and strong asset prices, with the JSE securities exchange reaching new record highs in November. Although house prices continue to rise, the rate of increase has declined significantly. These favourable conditions have resulted in household debt as a percentage of disposable income rising to 63,5 per cent in the third quarter of 2005. Money supply and credit extension growth remain at high rates consistent with expenditure growth, but there may be some signs of moderation. M3 money supply decelerated from a year-on-year rate of 19,0 per cent in August 2005 to 16,8 per cent and 16,4 per cent in September and October respectively. Growth in total loans and advances, driven mainly by asset-backed credit, declined marginally from 21,9 per cent in August to 20,5 per cent in October. Part of this could be due to increased securitisation. Mortgage advances in particular remained strong reflecting continued buoyancy in the housing market. The increasing deficit on the current account of the balance of payments is a potential concern. The latest data show that the current account deficit increased to 4,7 per cent of GDP in the third quarter, up from a revised deficit of 3,7 per cent in the second quarter. These deficits are a reflection of higher domestic expenditure and are not in themselves inflationary. To date the deficits have been more than adequately financed by capital inflows which in turn are being attracted by the improved growth prospects in the economy. The overall balance of payments has remained in surplus, and the level of gross gold and foreign exchange reserves increased slightly above the US$20 billion level to date. Taking the above factors into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee has decided to leave the repo rate unchanged at 7 per cent per annum. The MPC will, as is usually the case, remain vigilant in order to ensure that CPIX inflation stays within the inflation target range. Should the outlook deteriorate, the MPC will not hesitate to adjust the repo rate in the appropriate direction."
Chile,2005-12-13,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 13 December 2005 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 4.5% (annual). The external scenario facing the Chilean economy continues to be very favorable, while some of the risks identified in the past few months have moderated. The copper price has posted another rise and international financial conditions are still propitious. Domestic financial conditions continue to be expansionary. Recently output grew less than in the past few months, but the year on year rate of growth is still around its trend. Internal demand continues to grow strongly and, despite a slight slowdown in job creation, unemployment is falling steadily. Annual CPI inflation and its short-term projection have declined, influenced by the rapid normalization of fuel prices and the significant appreciation of the peso. Core inflation measures CPIX and CPIX1 (that exclude fuels, perishables and some regulated rates, among others) have remained below 3%. Other indicators of trend inflation and various measures of inflation expectations are well anchored. Recent news relating to output, prices and the exchange rate and their implications on the expected inflation trend justify maintaining the monetary policy rate unchanged on this occasion. This pause is consistent with the strategy of normalization of the monetary impulse necessary to attain an annual inflation rate around 3% over the normal policy horizon of 12 to 24 months. * The Spanish original prevails."
United States,2005-12-13,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4-1/4 percent. Despite elevated energy prices and hurricane-related disruptions, the expansion in economic activity appears solid. Core inflation has stayed relatively low in recent months and longer-term inflation expectations remain contained. Nevertheless, possible increases in resource utilization as well as elevated energy prices have the potential to add to inflation pressures. The Committee judges that some further measured policy firming is likely to be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance. In any event, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to foster these objectives. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan. Chairman; Timothy F Geithner. Vice Chairman; Susan S Bies; Roger W Ferguson. Jr.; Richard W Fisher; Donald L Kohn; Michael H Moskow; Mark W Olson; Anthony M Santomero; and Gary H Stern. In a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 25-basis point increase in the discount rate to 5-1/4 percent. In taking this action, the Board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston. New York. Philadelphia. Cleveland. Richmond. Atlanta. Chicago. St. Louis. Minneapolis. Kansas City. Dallas, and San Francisco."
Philippines,2005-12-14,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board maintained the BSP's key policy interest rates at 7.5 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.75 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. The Monetary Board noted that the balance of economic evidence supports an unchanged policy setting. The current combination of generally favorable supply-side and demand-side pressures should provide a stabilizing influence on inflation expectations in the near term. In particular, the recent easing of energy prices, the strengthening of the peso, and the ongoing harvest season alongside normal weather conditions are likely to hold back cost-side inflation pressures. Equally important, the deceleration of liquidity growth and the continued easing of core inflation demonstrate the relative absence of demand-based inflation pressures. This is consistent with the observed slowdown in aggregate demand, particularly in consumer spending which remains the key driver of growth. The previous monetary tightening should also be allowed to run its course and impact on both liquidity growth and inflation expectations. The Monetary Board also recognized that the risks to inflation still remain. Global energy prices may surge again and create uncertainty in the inflation outlook given limited global surplus production capacity. Potential shifts in the public's inflation expectations may also become a risk given the relatively high level of inflation relative to government target. For the same reason, the Monetary Board views the possibility of second-round effects and the continued presence of ample liquidity in the financial system as potential risks to the inflation outlook. The Monetary Board reiterates that it remains committed to the BSP's inflation objectives and will continue to closely monitor the evolving conditions for consumer prices, aggregate demand, domestic liquidity and other factors in order to determine the appropriate stance of monetary policy and undertake action if necessary."
Thailand,2005-12-14,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 14 December 2005 Ms. Atchana Waiquamdee. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand, announced that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance. The main issues discussed were as follows: 1. During the first ten months of 2005, the Thai economy expanded quite satisfactorily, particularly in the third quarter where GDP grew by 53 per cent. This was led by a strong recovery of the agricultural sector on the supply side, and a pick-up in exports coupled with a slowdown in imports on the demand side. Nevertheless the expansion in private domestic demand, especially private consumption and investment, has shown some signs of moderating. Overall economic stability has improved. The current account has turned around from a large deficit in the first half of the year to a surplus from July onwards. Headline inflation decelerated from 62 per cent in October to 59 per cent in November, while core inflation was stable at 24 per cent. The MPC perceived that the Thai economy still has a momentum for continued expansion. Meanwhile the risk to inflation, though having moderated, remains and the real interest rates are still negative. Against that background, the MPC judged that the policy interest rate should stay on an upward path, but the need to adjust the policy rate at a fast pace has diminished. The MPC therefore decided to raise the 14-day repurchase rate by 25 basis points from 375 to 400 per cent per annum, effective immediately."
Malaysia,2005-12-15,"On 14 December 2005, at its eighth and final meeting for the year 2005. Bank Negara Malaysia's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided on the following:.

Peru,2005-12-15,"Press Release MONETARY PROGRAM FOR DECEMBER 2005 CENTRAL BANK RAISES REFERENCE RATE FROM 3,00% TO 3,25% The Board of the Central Bank approved to raise the reference interest rate for the interbank market from 3,0 percent to 3,25 percent. This decision has been take to reduce the exchange rate volatility and increment the cost of speculative financial movements. This decision does not imply a sequence of raises in the reference interest rate. Also, it has been considered: The Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) increased 0.07 percent in November. Thus, the inflation rate over the last twelve months increased 1.1 percent. The dynamism of the economic activity is consistent with the convergence of inflation toward its target level in 2006 from the current inflation levels. The Central Bank's decisions are preventive. Its monetary policy is designed to anticipate shock over the inflation target considering lags of the monetary policy influence. The Central Bank expects the inflation rate converge to 2.5 percent, within a range of 1.5 percent to 3.5 percent, considering the temporarily influence of the monetary policy (around one-year). Eventually, the inflation rate could exceed that range. In that case, the Central Bank should evaluate changes in its monetary policy. In that way, since 2006, the inflation target will be assets continuously. It was also approved to raise the lending and deposit interest rates for the Central Bank operations: For direct repos and monetary regulation credits, the rate raises to 4.00 percent. For overnight deposits, the rate raises to 2.50% percent. In case that the interbank interest rate be higher than 4.00 percent, monetary regulation credits and direct repos will be charged with the market interbank interest rate. The interest rates for the following operations in dollars between the Central Bank and the Financial System are: Monetary regulation credits: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point. Overnight deposits: overnight LIBOR minus 3/8 of a percentage point. Swaps: the commission is maintained to a level that implies a minimum annual effective cost of 4.00 percent. Reserve requirement in foreign currency subject to a payment: 2.25 percent. The session in which the Board will approve the following Monetary Program (January 2006) will be held on January 1, 2006."
Poland,2005-12-21,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 21 December 2005 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 20-21 December 2005 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: reference rate 4.50% on an annual basis; lombard rate 6.00% on an annual basis; deposit rate 3.00% on an annual basis; rediscount rate 4.75% on an annual basis and to maintain its easing monetary policy bias. Since the last meeting of the Council, the forecasts of economic growth in 2006 for the euro area have been slightly revised upwards. Yet, the outlook for economic growth in the United States has not changed significantly. In November the annual growth rate of consumer prices in the euro area decreased to 2.3% from 2.5% y/y recorded in October while in the United States it dropped from 4.3% to 3.5%. Both the euro area and the United States inflation forecasts for 2006 have not changed significantly. Crude oil prices have increased in December. Since the November Council meeting the price of Brent oil has risen by USD 6.1 per barrel i.e. by 11.6%. The forecasted prices of this commodity for 2006 have not changed significantly. The uncertainty about the impact of the considerable accumulated growth of oil prices on economic growth and inflation remains significant and has to be taken into consideration. The data published since the last meeting of the Council point to a strengthening of the economic recovery in Poland observed since 2005 Q2. In November, the industrial output growth was higher than expected both by external forecasters and the NBP, and amounted to 8.5% y/y, i.e. 7.4% in seasonally adjusted terms as compared to 6.8% a month before. The annual growth in construction and assembly output decreased from 6.8% in October to 5.9% in November, i.e. from 9.8% to 8.6% in seasonally adjusted terms. Since the beginning of the year, moderate growth in employment in the corporate sector has been recorded. In November 2005, the employment in the corporate sector increased by 2.4% y/y, and its annual growth was the highest in 2005. This would suggest a continuing gradual improvement in the labour market. November 2005 was the second consecutive month of wage growth in the enterprise sector, which was considerably faster than that anticipated by the NBP and external forecasters (nominal wage growth of 6.9% y/y as compared with 6.4% y/y in October). Such a high growth was driven by a shift of annual bonus payment in the mining sector. Yet, even excluding such one-off factors, the wage growth reported in the first two months of 2005 Q4 exceeded the average for the first three quarters of 2005. This means that accelerated output growth is accompanied by higher wage ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51, growth. It should be emphasised that maintaining wage discipline in enterprises is the necessary condition for sustained acceleration in economic growth grounded in the rise of employment. The November inflation was consistent with the expectations for 2005 Q4 presented in the August Inflation Report. The annual consumer price growth in November declined to 1.0%. The decrease in annual inflation was mainly driven by a fall in food and non-alcoholic beverages prices and fuel prices. The fall in food prices in November resulted i.a. from introduction of restrictions in the Polish food exports to Russia and decreased demand for poultry caused by the bird flu effect. November 2005 saw a continued fall in producer prices in industry in year-on-year terms (fall by 0.4% y/y, i.e. growth by 0.1% m/m). Low indicator of producer prices in industry was determined by stronger than a year ago zloty exchange rate and moderate growth of domestic demand. Since the Council's last meeting, zloty exchange rate has not changed significantly and has remained stronger than forecasted in the August Inflation Projection. In the Council's assessment low inflation in November may indicate that inflation will return to the target later that it was assessed in the previous meetings. It is expected that  assuming no shocks occur - having achieved the target, inflation will remain at a level close to it. Broader assessment of the inflation outlook will be possible in January 2006 once the Inflation Projection is published. The Council maintains its belief that implementing an economic strategy focused on creating conditions which ensure introduction of the euro at the earliest possible date would be most favourable for Poland and would contribute to higher long-term economic growth. Moreover, in the meeting the Council: Adopted a resolution amending the resolution on accounting principles, the format of reporting assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and the profit and loss account of the National Bank of Poland, due to the expiry of the validity of interim regulations relating to recording and valuation of operations in foreign currency. In line with the adopted changes, from 1 January 2006 the accounting principles used in the European System of Central Banks, previously applicable to assets and liabilities in foreign currency connected with holding and management of foreign exchange reserves only, will apply also to assets and liabilities in foreign currency not connected with holding and management of foreign exchange reserves (foreign currency held at the NBP's branches). The resolution will be published in the NBP's Official Journal. Adopted a resolution amending the resolution on principles of conducting open market operations, aligning it with the provisions of the Monetary Policy Guidelines for the year 2006 adopted by the Monetary Policy Council. The amendments include, among others, the following modifications: 1. in the case of fine-tuning operations there is a possibility for the NBP to execute, regardless of repo transactions, also reverse repo transactions, 2. within the framework of structural operations, the NBP may  apart from purchasing securities on the secondary market  also sell securities. Approved the Financial Plan of the NBP for the year 2006. The next meeting of the Council will be held on 24 January 2006 and will focus on the draft Inflation Report. The Report will finally be adopted at the Council's meeting held on 30-31 January 2006."
Romania,2005-12-21,"The Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided to raise the minimum reserve requirement ratio on foreign currency-denominated liabilities to 35 percent from 30 percent, tighten control over liquidity and measures to reduce credit growth, standing ready to use its entire array of instruments to counter growing inflationary pressures. The NBR Board believes that growth of consumption is unsustainable, a trend which implies a tighter economic policy mix to safeguard the continuation of disinflation in the medium and long run. In its meeting of December 21, 2005, the NBR Board has assessed the latest developments in macroeconomic and financial market indicators as well as their prospects in the context of the macroeconomic and structural measures to be implemented in 2006. Latest data show year-on-year inflation quickened to 8.7 percent in November - under the impact of administered price adjustments - revealing the prospect of a year-end figure slightly above 8.5 percent, the upper limit of the 2005 target band. The expected marginal overshooting of this year's target band came as a result of supply-side shocks (steep adjustments in administered and fuel prices as well as in excise duties) but also due to pressures on the domestic demand side. However, annual average inflation is estimated at around 9.0 percent versus 11.9 percent in the previous year, signaling a consolidation of the disinflation process. Moreover, core inflation, which measures free prices and those with low volatility is slowing down, with CORE2 computed by the NBR (CPI less administered prices and prices of vegetables, fruit, eggs and fuel) falling to 6.2 percent in November 2005 from 8.3 percent in December 2004. Developments in the macroeconomic area reveal a notable deceleration of the increase in domestic supply and productivity, while consumption growth stayed strong, at levels similar to the same period of 2004. The increase in domestic demand still significantly exceeds domestic output, thereby sharpening the external imbalance and fueling lasting inflationary pressures. The NBR Board has assessed the current economic conditions, both domestically and internationally, as well as the associated risks and uncertainties, and has decided to tighten control over liquidity and measures to slacken credit expansion. In this context, the NBR Board has decided to raise the minimum reserve requirement ratio on foreign currency-denominated liabilities to 35 percent from 30 percent. Given the forthcoming adjustments in administered prices, the fiscal position and of other economic policies envisaged for 2006, the NBR Board is ready to resort to its entire array of instruments to counteract growing inflationary pressures in the period ahead. According to the announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for February 8, 2006, when the third quarterly Inflation Report is to be analyzed."
Israel,2005-12-26,"26.12.2005 The Bank of Israel's interest rate for January 2006: No change. Stays at 4.5 percent The Bank of Israel today announced that the interest rate for January 2006 will remain unchanged at 4.5 percent. This decision is consistent with the Bank's continued support of price stability in the context of the government's target inflation rate of between one percent and three percent a year. The decision not to change the interest rate following the latest increases was based on the following considerations: According to inflation expectations derived from the capital market and the assessments of private forecasters, expected inflation for the next twelve months has dropped to slightly below 2 percent, the midpoint of the inflation target. These sources also assess that the Bank of Israel's interest rate will rise to some extent in the course of the next year, due mainly to continued relatively rapid economic growth and the persistent upward trend in inflation rates and the interest rates of central banks world wide. The capitalmarkets and the foreign currency market in particular are relatively calm. The budgetdeficit for 2005 is expected to have dropped significantly. This, togetherwith the proceeds of privatization, is expected to result also in a reduction in the burden of the government-debt/GDP ratio, which is higher in Israel than in other countries. Real interest rose a little, against the background, among other things, of the rapidexpansion of economic activity. Till now the geopolitical uncertainty has not affected developments in the capital market. The more the decision-makers adhere to the maintenance of the current economic strategy, the greater the chances that the calm in the markets will persist, and that the creation of the conditions essential for long-term growth will continue. The Bank will continue to pursue the achievement of the government's inflation target, and in this context will support the attainment of the rangeof objectives of economic policy, particularly in the areas of growth and employment. Stays at 4.5 percent. The Bank of Israel's interest rate for January 2006: No change. The Bank of Israel today announced that the interest rate for January 2006 will remain unchanged at 4.5 percent. The decision not to change the interest rate following the latest increases was based on the following considerations:. According to inflation expectations derived from the capital market and the assessments of private forecasters, expected inflation for the next twelve months has dropped to slightly below 2 percent, the midpoint of the inflation target."
