Poland,2020-01-08,"Warsaw, 8 January 2020 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 7-8 January 2020 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: ▪ reference rate at 1.50%; ▪ lombard rate at 2.50%; ▪ deposit rate at 0.50%; ▪ rediscount rate at 1.75%. Global economic growth remains relatively low, although signs of a possible trade agreement between the United States and China have translated into a certain improvement in sentiment in the global economy. Despite this, uncertainty about the global outlook in the coming quarters persists. In the euro area, economic growth remains slow alongside the ongoing downturn in industry. In the United States, economic conditions continue to be relatively strong, although, like in many other economies, industrial activity remains weak. In China economic activity growth is lower than in the previous years. In the recent period, oil prices have risen reflecting a certain improvement in sentiment about trade relations between the major economies as well as a significant increase of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Nevertheless, inflation in the environment of the Polish economy is running at a moderate level and in the euro area it is low. The European Central Bank is keeping the deposit rate below zero, while conducting asset purchases and signalling the maintenance of loose monetary policy in the coming quarters. After the 2019 interest rate cuts, the US Federal Reserve is keeping the rates unchanged. In Poland, economic conditions remain good, despite a gradual slowdown in economic growth. GDP growth is supported by stable consumption growth, fuelled by favourable labour market conditions, very strong consumer confidence and social benefit payments. At the same time, incoming data indicate further growth in investment and exports, albeit slower than in the previous quarters. According to the GUS flash estimate, inflation stood at 3.4% y/y in December 2019. Inflation in December was driven up by rising food and fuel prices. Alongside that, core inflation, after a rise in recent months partly resulting from higher services prices, has remained moderate. In the Council's assessment, the outlook for economic conditions in Poland remains favourable, and GDP growth, despite the expected decline, will continue at a relatively high level in the coming quarters. At the same time, there remains uncertainty about the scale and persistence of the slowdown abroad and its impact on domestic economic activity. Inflation  after a temporary rise in 2020 Q1  will stay close to the target in the monetary policy transmission horizon. The Council judges that the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability."
Romania,2020-01-08,"In its meeting of 8 January 2020, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided the following:. The annual CPI inflation rate declined to 3.4 percent in October 2019, from 3.5 percent in September, then rose to 3.8 percent in November, i.e. above the variation band of the target, in line with the latest medium-term forecast. The advance against September owed mainly to the hike in fruit and vegetable prices, but also to the pick-up in core inflation. The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate (which excludes from the CPI inflation administered prices, volatile prices, and tobacco product and alcoholic beverage prices) continued to grow in the first two months of 2019 Q4, from 3.4 percent in September to a slightly higher-than-projected 3.5 percent in November. The increase reflected the impact of higher global agri-food commodity prices and the slightly softer leu versus the euro, overlapping significant inflationary pressures from demand and unit labour costs. The average annual CPI inflation rate fell to 3.7 percent in October, before returning to 3.8 percent in November 2019, the same level reported in September 2019; calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, the average annual inflation rate dropped further, reaching 3.8 percent in October-November, against 3.9 percent in September. Economic growth continued to lose momentum in 2019 Q3, posting an annual pace of 3 percent, compared with 4.4 percent in the previous quarter. On the demand side, the contribution of household consumption remained significant, yet it shrank sharply (down to 3 percentage points amid the unfavourable agricultural year), falling substantially behind that of gross fixed capital formation (5.9 percentage points). Net exports saw their negative contribution to GDP dynamics rising, given the more pronounced reacceleration in the growth of imports relative to that of exports of goods and services. The latest statistical data point to mixed developments in annual terms for consumption, investment and industrial production in October: further high dynamics of households' purchases of goods and services and a swift rise in the volume of construction works, on the one hand, and the larger contraction in industrial production and sliding new orders in manufacturing, on the other hand. Moreover, the most recent balance-of-payments data highlight the slower year-on-year worsening of the trade balance in October compared with Q3. However, the current account deficit recorded a renewed widening, on the back of the deterioration of the primary and secondary income balances, while its coverage by foreign direct investment and capital transfers narrowed. The annual growth rate of credit to the private sector continued to moderate slightly in October and November, to 7.5 percent and 7.2 percent respectively from 7.7 percent in September, its average for the two months overall declining to 7.32 percent versus 7.9 percent in Q3. With the deceleration owing exclusively to the foreign currency component, the share of domestic currency loans in total private sector credit widened further, hitting a post-May 1996 high of 67.2 percent in November. The latest assessments reconfirm the outlook for the annual inflation rate to end the year 2019 slightly above the variation band of the target, before returning and staying in the upper half of the band in the near run, at slightly lower values than in the latest medium-term forecast published in the November 2019 Inflation Report. Heightened uncertainties and risks surrounding the inflation outlook stem from the fiscal and income policy stance, given the domestic election calendar. The trend of the current account deficit remains a matter of concern as well. Uncertainties are also generated by developments in the euro area and global economies, amid the increase in geopolitical tensions and in vulnerabilities on some emerging markets, while the accommodative stance of the ECB's and the Fed's monetary policies, as well as the stance of central banks in the region, remain relevant. In today's meeting, based on the currently available data and assessments, the NBR Board decided to keep unchanged the monetary policy rate at 2.50 percent per annum, while maintaining strict control over money market liquidity. Moreover, the NBR Board decided to leave unchanged the deposit facility rate at 1.50 percent per annum and the lending (Lombard) facility rate at 3.50 percent per annum. Furthermore, the central bank maintained the current levels of the minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board's decisions aim to ensure and preserve price stability over the medium term in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth and amid safeguarding financial stability. The NBR Board underlines that the balanced macroeconomic policy mix and the implementation of structural reforms designed to foster the growth potential over the long term are of the essence in preserving a stable macroeconomic framework and strengthening the capacity of the Romanian economy to withstand potential adverse developments. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR's website on 15 January 2020, at 3:00 p.m. In line with the announced calendar, the next monetary policy meeting of the NBR Board is scheduled for 7 February 2020, when a new quarterly Inflation Report is to be examined."
Israel,2020-01-09,"The inflation environment remains low. The November CPI was lower than expected, and inflation over the past 12 months is 0.3 percent. Inflation excluding energy and fruits and vegetablesindicates a lower basic inflation rate than in previous months. In the coming months, inflation is expected to stay low, but most one-year expectations and forecasts remained near the lower bound of the target range. Since the previousinterest rate decision, the shekel has been relatively stable against the dollar, while most other currencies strengthened against the dollar. However, during 2019, the shekel strengthened by 8.3 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, a development that continues to make it difficult to return inflation to the target range. Most indicators ofeconomic activity point to continued solid growth in the fourth quarter, and the labor market remains tight. However, the interim budget is expected to have a markedly contractionary effect in the first half of 2020, and there is continuing uncertainty regarding budgetary policy thereafter. According to the Research Department's staff forecast, growth is expected to slow somewhat in 2020. Global economic activity continues to slow, but it seems that the risks of a significant deterioration have declined in view of progress in the trade negotiations between the US and China and the results of the UK elections. Inflation remains low, but it appears that the process of enhanced monetary accommodation by the major central banks has reached its limit at this stage. The Monetary Committee's assessment is that in view of the inflation environment in Israel, the monetary policies of major central banks, developments in the global economy and the risks to the domestic economy, and the development of the exchange rate, it will be necessary to leave the interest rate at its current level for a prolonged period or to reduce it in order to support a process at the end of which inflation will stabilize around the midpoint of the target range, and so that the economy will continue to grow strongly. Furthermore, the Committee is taking additional steps as necessary to make monetary policy more accommodative. The Bank of Israel continues to monitor developments in inflation, the real economy, fiscal policy, the financial markets, and the global economy, and will act to attain the monetary policy targets in accordance with such developments. For the file of figures accompanying this notice, clickhere. The CPI reading for November declined by 0.4 percent, a greater decline than expected, so that year over year inflation remained below the target range. In the past 12 months, inflation was 0.3 percent (Figure 1 in the attached file of figures), and inflation excluding energy and fruit and vegetables stabilized at a low level, which may indicate a lower basic inflation rate than in previous months (Figure 2). Inflation of nontradable goods prices remained moderate, in view ofthe slowdown in the increase of the housing component, and inflation in the prices of tradable goods remained negative, in view of the decline in energy prices and the appreciation of the shekel. Inflation is expected to remain low in the coming months, but most one-year forecasts and expectations remain around the lower bound of the target range (Figure 4). The Research Department's staff forecast indicates that inflation in 2020 is expected to be 1 percent, 0.2 percent lower than in the previous forecast. Expectations derived from CPI financial contracts appear to have declined moderately in recent months. Medium-and long-term forward inflation expectations derived from the bond market remained largely stable since the previous interest rate decision, and have increased slightly in recent days (Figure 5). Since the previous interest rate decision, the shekel was relatively stable against the dollar, while most currencies strengthened against the dollar. However, over the course of 2019, the shekel strengthened by 8.3 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate (Figure 6), which continues to make it difficult to return inflation to the target range. Most indicators of economic activity show that in the fourth quarter, the economy continued to grow solidly. This is substantiated by the Business Tendency Survey for December and the Companies Survey for the fourth quarter (Figure 13), the Composite State of the Economy Index for November (Figure 14), and the Purchasing Managers Index. Goods exports were flat in October and November, while services exports continued to grow rapidly in October (Figure 15). In contrast, the Consumer Confidence Index declined in October andin November. The labor market remains tight: The unemployment rate remained low, while the employment and participation rates increased (Figure 17), and wage increases continue despite a moderate decline in the job vacancy rate and a halt in the increase in employee posts. The interim budget is expected to have a markedly contractionary effect in the first half of 2020, even in view of the path of government debt repayment, and uncertainty remains regarding budgetary policy thereafter and its implications for economic activity and inflation. According to the Research Department's staff forecast, growth is expected to slow somewhat in 2020 as a result of the continued slowdown in world trade and the budgetary contraction. GDP is expected to grow by 2.9 percent, of which about 0.3 percentage points is due to the one-off effect of the start of natural gas production from the Leviathan field. In 2021. GDP is expected to grow by 3.2 percent. Equityindices in Israel were relatively stable since the previous interest rate decision, despite equity market increases abroad. Long-term government bond yields declined since the previous interest rate decision, in contrast with the continued increase in yields in Europe and the US (Figure 8). Home prices continued to increase moderately, and in the past year they have increased by 2.6 percent. The number of home purchases increased, led by first-home purchasers. Mortgage volume continued to expand, and mortgage interest rates continued to decline. The global economy continues to slow, but several indicators point to a possible moderate improvement in the coming months. Forecasts by investment houses were stable regarding global growth in 2020 and 2021, following a long period of downward revisions in growth forecasts (Figure 20). With the exception of the United States, most fourth quarter country statistics indicated a continued slowdown in the growth rate, with the main weakness focused on manufacturing. The slowdown in world trade continues (Figure 21), but the risk of a significant worsening has declined in view of progress in trade negotiations between the US and China and the results of the UK election. Inflation remained lower than the central banks' guiding targets (Figure 23), but it appears that the process of enhanced monetary accommodation by the major central banks has reached its limit at this stage. In the financial markets, the price increases in equity indices have continued (Figure 26). In theUS, the Federal Reserve kept the federal funds rate unchanged, and signaled that the rate is expected to remain at its current level unless there is a significant change in the state of the economy. Growth surprised to the upside in the fourth quarter as well, and the trade agreement that is taking shape with China may contribute to a recovery in manufacturing. In Europe, growth remains moderate, mainly in Germany and Italy, and the manufacturing sector continues to weigh on activity. The ECB left its interest rate unchanged, and is expected to leave its policy in place for a long time. In Japan, leading indicators point to a slowing of growth in the fourth quarter, after the increase in VAT. Data on activity in China were positive, but the long-term trend of moderation continues. Oil prices increased in view of a reduction of supply and an expected increase in demand (Figure 24). The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on January 23, 2020. The next decision regardingthe interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Monday. February 24, 2020."
Peru,2020-01-09,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT JANUARY 2020 BCRP MAINTAINED REFERENCE RATE AT 2.25% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to maintain the reference at 2.25 percent, in light of the following developments: Year-on-year inflation is expected to be around 2.0 percent over the forecast horizon, with a moderate downside bias due to the possibility of a lower-than-expected increase in domestic demand. Monthly inflation was 0.21 percent in December, consequently, year-on-year inflation remained at 1,9 percent in December 2019. With monthly inflation excluding food and energy at 0.34 percent in December, the year-on-year figure also remained at 2.3 percent. One-year ahead expected inflation as of December remained at 2.2 percent. The weak performance of primary industries and General Government investment in 2019 was attenuated by the activity in non-primary industries. Business conditions expectations as of December remained stable with respect to November, while economic activity indicators point to a gradual closure of the output gap. Global growth risks from trade tensions have attenuated, although the impact of the recent geopolitical events on international energy prices is still uncertain. The BCRP Board pays close attention to new information on inflation and its determinants in assessing future changes in the monetary policy stance. The Board also decided to maintain the interest rates on BCRP off-auction credit and deposit operations in domestic currency with financial entities. Overnight deposits: 1.00 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 2.80 percent per year for financial entities' first 10 operations over the last 12 months; and the rate fixed by the BCRP Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations Committee for operations other than financial entities' first 10 operations over the last 12 months. Dollar swaps: a fee equal to a minimum annual effective cost of 2.80 percent. The BCRP Board's next monetary policy session will take place on February 13, 2020."
Egypt,2020-01-16,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release January 16, 2020 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 1225 percent, 1325 percent, and 1275 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 1275 percen. Annual headline urban inflation recorded 71 percent in December 2019 compared to 36 percent in November 2019, as monthly inflation recorded negative 02 percent in December 2019 compared to negative 34 percent in December 201. This came in line with the expectations of the Central Bank of Egypt reflecting the strong unfavorable base effect stemming from the reversal of transitory shock to prices of fresh vegetables in the previous yea. Meanwhile annual core inflation recorded 24 percent in December 2019 compared to 21 percent in November 2019, mainly due to higher poultry price. Real GDP growth stabilized, recording a preliminary estimate of 56 percent in 2019 Q3, after recording 56 percent in fiscal year 2018/19, the highest growth since fiscal year 2007/0. Latest available data in 2019 Q2 showed that private domestic demand outpaced net exports as the main driver of economic activity since the beginning of 2019, driven by the acceleration in private investment growth, which recorded the highest growth in 2018/19 since 2005/06, as well as the gradual recovery in private consumptio. Meanwhile unemployment rate recorded 78 percent in 2019 Q3 compared to 75 percent in 2019 Q2, the lowest level on recor. Nevertheless employment continued to recover for the third consecutive quarte. Globally the expansion of economic activity stabilized, financial conditions and uncertainty regarding trade policies ease. Meanwhile international oil prices remain subject to volatility due to potential supply-side factors that include geopolitical risk. Against this background, and following the cumulative reduction of 350 basis points over the previous three MPC meetings, the MPC decided that keeping key policy rates unchanged remains consistent with achieving the inflation target of 9 percent (±3 percentage points) in 2020 Q4 and price stability over the medium ter. The MPC closely monitors all economic developments and will not hesitate to resume its easing cycle subject to further moderation of inflationary pressure.

Turkiye,2020-01-16,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to reduce the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) from 12 percent to 11.25 percent. Recent data indicate that recovery in economic activity continues. Sectoral diffusion of economic activity continues to improve. However, investment demand remains weak. While favorable effects of improved competitiveness prevail, weakening global economic outlook tempers external demand. As the contribution of net exports to economic growth declines, economic recovery is expected to be sustained with the help of the ongoing disinflation process and improvement in financial conditions. Current account balance, which has recently recorded significant improvement, is expected to maintain a moderate course with the contribution of supportive policy measures. Weakness in global economic activity and low levels of global inflation strengthen expectations regarding the continuation of expansionary monetary policies in advanced economies. Current global financial conditions and the recent partial improvement in expectations regarding global trade support the demand for emerging market assets and the risk appetite. Nevertheless, rising protectionism, uncertainty regarding global economic policies and geopolitical developments are closely monitored for their impact on capital flows, international trade and commodity prices. Inflation outlook continued to improve and inflation expectations sustained their wide-spread decline. The improvement in macroeconomic indicators, inflation in particular, supports the fall in country risk premium and helps contain cost pressures. Developments in the exchange rate, domestic demand conditions and producer prices have contributed to a mild trend in core inflation indicators. The course of inflation is considered to be broadly in line with the year-end inflation projection. Accordingly, considering all factors affecting the inflation outlook, the Committee decided to make a measured cut in the policy rate. At this point, the current monetary policy stance remains consistent with the projected disinflation path. The Committee assesses that maintaining a sustained disinflation process is a key factor for achieving lower sovereign risk, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery. Keeping the disinflation process in track with the targeted path requires the continuation of a cautious monetary stance. In this respect, monetary stance will be determined by considering the indicators of the underlying inflation trend to ensure the continuation of the disinflation process. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability and financial stability objectives. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
South Africa,2020-01-16,"South African Reserve Bank PRESS STATEMENT EMBARGO DELIVERY 16 January 2020 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the November meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), global economic indicators improved somewhat and global inflation remained low. Central banks in advanced economies provided more monetary accommodation, helping to ease global financing conditions, but further easing appears less likely. While downside risks from trade tensions and geo-political developments remain, the global slowdown appears to be bottoming out. The domestic economic outlook remains fragile. Despite a rebound in local GDP in the second quarter of 2019. GDP contracted in the third quarter. The fourth quarter is expected to show some positive growth. Recent monthly inflation has been lower than the mid-point of the inflation target range. The year-on-year inflation rate, as measured by the headline consumer price index MPC Statement January 16th, 2020 Page 1. The year-on-year inflation rate, as measured by the headline consumer price index MPC Statement January 16th, 2020 Page 1 (CPI) was 3.6% in November (down from 3.7% in October). Goods price inflation in November was 2.8% (down from 3.1% in October), while services price inflation remained at 4.2%. Food and non-alcoholic beverage price inflation was stable at 3.5% (down from 3.6%). The Bank's measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity decreased slightly to 3.9% (from 4.0% in October). Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods decreased to 2.3% in November (from 3.0% in October). The medium-term inflation outlook has been revised significantly lower compared to the November forecast. The inflation forecast generated by the SARB's Quarterly Projection Model (QPM) averages 4.1% in 2019 (down from 4.2%), 4.7% for 2020 (down from 5.1%) and 4.6% for 2021 (down from 4.7%). The Bank's forecast for headline CPI inflation for 2022 is 4.5%. Headline CPI inflation is now expected to peak at 4.9% in the final quarter of 2020 and settle at 4.5% in the third quarter of 2021 (one quarter earlier). The forecast for core inflation for 2019 is unchanged at 4.2%, is 4.3% in 2020 (down from 4.5%) and 4.4% in 2021 (down from 4.6%). The Bank's forecast for core inflation for 2022 is 4.5%. Food price inflation continues to surprise to the downside on a monthly basis, and is revised from 5.8% to 4.7% for 2020. Inflation expectations have continued to moderate gradually. According to the Bureau for Economic Research (BER) fourth quarter survey, expectations for headline inflation are down slightly for 2019 to 4.5% (from 4.6%). Five-year-ahead inflation expectations also eased to 4.9% (from 5.0%). MPC Statement January 16th, 2020 Page 2. MPC Statement January 16th, 2020 Page 2 The inflation expectations of market analysts in the December 2019 Reuters Econometer survey are generally lower, at 4.2% (from 4.3%) for 2019, 4.6% (from 4.7%) for 2020 and 4.7% (from 4.8%) in 2021. Market based expectations implicit in the break-even inflation rate (the yield differential between conventional and inflation-linked bonds) have moderated somewhat since the previous MPC. Five-year break-even rates are currently about 4.1% and ten-year break-even rates are 5.3%. Global GDP is expected to average 3.0% in 2019, rising to about 3.4% in 2020. In recent months, global trade and manufacturing indicators have exhibited signs of stabilisation, and, alongside resilient services, suggest that global growth rates will hold up. However, a range of downside risks to growth remain. These include geo- political developments, trade tensions, further oil price shocks, and high levels of corporate and sovereign debt. Inflation outcomes and inflation expectations in most advanced economies remain below target levels. Barring significant shocks, monetary policy in major advanced economies will remain accommodative over the medium term. Since the November MPC, the rand has appreciated by 2.6% against the US dollar, and by 1.8% against the euro. The implied starting point for the rand is R14.60 against the US dollar, compared with R14.94 at the time of the previous meeting. While the rand has benefited from improvements in global sentiment, high long-term bond yields reflect concerns about domestic growth prospects and fiscal risks. The GDP growth outcome for the third quarter confirmed that the economy remains weak and vulnerable to idiosyncratic shocks and poor sectoral performances. While MPC Statement January 16th, 2020 Page 3. While MPC Statement January 16th, 2020 Page 3 growth in the fourth quarter is expected to have picked up, electricity supply constraints will likely keep economic activity muted in the near term. Public sector investment continues to be weak and export growth remains lacklustre, despite strong terms of trade. Government and household consumption, and private investment, continue to grow, albeit modestly. The RMB/BER Business Confidence Index improved to 26 points (from 21), while the Absa Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 47.1 points in December (from 47.7). The SARB's composite leading business cycle indicator also continued to trend lower, while the coincident indicator increased marginally month-on-month. The forecast of GDP growth for 2019 is revised lower to 0.4% (from 0.5%). The forecasts for 2020 and 2021 have also decreased to 1.2% (from 1.4%) and 1.6% (from 1.7%), respectively, due to lower growth than previously expected in the third and fourth quarters. The GDP forecast for 2022 is 1.9%. The MPC assesses the risks to the growth forecast to be to the downside. Escalation in global trade tensions, geo-political risks, further domestic supply constraints and/or sustained higher oil prices could generate headwinds to growth. Public sector financing needs have risen, increasing risk premiums and pushing borrowing costs for the broader economy higher. Implementation of prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms that lower costs and increase investment, potential growth and job creation, remains urgent. The overall risks to the inflation outlook are assessed to be balanced. Demand side pressures remain subdued and house rental prices are expected to increase at only moderate rates. Global inflation should also remain low. Food price inflation has MPC Statement January 16th, 2020 Page 4. Food price inflation has MPC Statement January 16th, 2020 Page 4 continued to surprise to the downside, although rising imported food prices create some caution about the future price trajectory. While the currency has strengthened relative to the November meeting, the risk remains that domestic shocks generate more capital flow volatility and put pressure on the exchange rate and inflation. Other upside risks to the inflation outlook remain, including from fuel, electricity and water prices, and from nominal wage growth. The MPC welcomes the lower inflation outcomes and continued moderation in inflation expectations. While the Committee would like to see inflation expectations anchored closer to the mid-point of the inflation target range on a sustained basis, the lower inflation forecast and improved risk profile opens some space to provide further policy accommodation to the economy. Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to reduce the repurchase rate by 25 basis points. Monetary policy actions will continue to focus on anchoring inflation expectations near the mid-point of the inflation target range in the interest of balanced and sustainable growth. In this persistently uncertain environment, future policy decisions will continue to be highly data-dependent, sensitive to the balance of risks to the outlook, and will seek to look-through temporary price shocks. The implied path of policy rates over the forecast period generated by the Quarterly Projection Model indicated two repo rate cuts of 25 basis points each in the first and fourth quarters of 2020. This remains a broad policy guide which could change in either direction from meeting to meeting in response to new developments and changing data and risks. MPC Statement January 16th, 2020 Page 5.

South Korea,2020-01-17,"Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period. This press release is the English version of the Bank of Korea's policy statement. In the case of any inconsistency, the original version in Korean will prevail. The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Board considers that the pace of global economic growth has continued to slow with the ongoing sluggishness in trade. The global financial markets have been generally stable in line mainly with progress in the US-China trade negotiations, while recently volatility temporarily increased due to the escalation of military tensions in the Middle East. Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and the global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by developments in global trade protectionism and geopolitical risks. The Board judges that the sluggishness in the domestic economy has eased somewhat. Facilities investment has slightly increased and consumption growth has expanded, although construction investment and exports have continued to decline. Employment conditions have continued to improve in some respects, with the increase in the number of persons employed having risen. GDP is forecast to grow at the lower-2% level this year, consistent overall with the level projected in November. Although the adjustment in construction investment will continue, the sluggishness in exports and facilities investment will gradually ease and the consumption growth rate will moderately rise. Consumer price inflation has risen to the upper-0% level, due largely to a smaller decline in the prices of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products and to increases in petroleum product prices. Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has been at the mid-0% range, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has remained at the upper-1% level. Looking ahead, it is forecast that during this year consumer price inflation will rise to around 1%, generally in accord with the path projected in November, and core inflation will run at the upper-0% level. In the domestic financial markets, stock prices have risen and the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has fallen, affected chiefly by movements in the global financial markets and expectations of a recovery in the semiconductor industry. Long-term market interest rates have rebounded from an earlier decline. The amount of increase in household lending has expanded, and housing prices have shown high rates of increase in Seoul and its surrounding areas especially. Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As it is expected that domestic economic growth will be moderate and it is forecast that inflationary pressures on the demand side will remain at a low level, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance. In this process it will judge whether to adjust the degree of monetary policy accommodation, while carefully monitoring developments in global trade disputes, the economies of major countries, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks and examining their effects on domestic macroeconomic and financial stability conditions."
Malaysia,2020-01-22,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to reduce the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) to 2.75 percent. The ceiling and floor rates of the corridor of the OPR are correspondingly reduced to 3.00 percent and 2.50 percent, respectively. The global economy continues to expand at a moderate pace. Latest indicators and the recent dissipation of trade tensions point to improving global trade activity. Monetary easing across major economies in the second half of 2019 has helped ease financial conditions, and is expected to continue to support economic activity. However, downside risks remain due to geopolitical tensions and policy uncertainties in a number of countries. This could cause a resurgence of financial market volatility and weigh on the global growth outlook. For the Malaysian economy, latest indicators and supply disruptions in commodity-related sectors point to moderate expansion of economic activity in the fourth quarter. For 2019, growth will be within the projected range. For 2020, growth is expected to gradually improve, with continued support from household spending and better export performance. Overall investment activity is expected to record a modest recovery, underpinned by ongoing and new projects, both in the public and private sectors. However, downside risks to growth remain. These include uncertainty from various trade negotiations, geopolitical risks, weaker-than-expected growth of major trade partners, heightened volatility in financial markets, and domestic factors that include weakness in commodity-related sectors and delays in the implementation of projects. Headline inflation averaged at 0.7% in 2019. In 2020, headline inflation is expected to average higher but remain modest. The trajectory of headline inflation will be dependent on global oil and commodity price developments and the timing of the lifting of the domestic retail fuel price ceilings. Underlying inflation is expected to remain broadly stable, reflecting the continued expansion in economic activity and the absence of strong demand pressures. The adjustment to the OPR is a pre-emptive measure to secure the improving growth trajectory amid price stability. At this current level of the OPR, the MPC considers the stance of monetary policy to be appropriate in sustaining economic growth with price stability. Bank Negara Malaysia 22 January 2020."
Euroarea,2020-01-23,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We expect them to remain at their present or lower levels until we have seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within our projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics. We will continue to make net purchases under our asset purchase programme (APP) at a monthly pace of €20 billion. We expect them to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of our policy rates, and to end shortly before we start raising the key ECB interest rates. We also intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. Today the Governing Council also decided to launch a review of the ECB's monetary policy strategy. Further details about the scope and timetable of the review will be published in a press release today at 15:30 CET. The incoming data since our last meeting are in line with our baseline scenario of ongoing, but moderate, growth of the euro area economy. In particular, the weakness in the manufacturing sector remains a drag on euro area growth momentum. However, ongoing, albeit decelerating, employment growth and increasing wages continue to support the resilience of the euro area economy. While inflation developments remain subdued overall, there are some signs of a moderate increase in underlying inflation in line with expectations. The unfolding monetary policy measures are underpinning favourable financing conditions for all sectors of the economy. In particular, easier borrowing conditions for firms and households are supporting consumer spending and business investment. This will sustain the euro area expansion, the build-up of domestic price pressures and, thus, the robust convergence of inflation to our medium-term aim. At the same time, in the light of the continued subdued inflation outlook, monetary policy has to remain highly accommodative for a prolonged period of time to support underlying inflation pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term. We will, therefore, closely monitor inflation developments and the impact of the unfolding monetary policy measures on the economy. Our forward guidance will ensure that financial conditions adjust in accordance with changes to the inflation outlook. In any case, the Governing Council continues to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro area real GDP increased by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2019, following growth of 0.2% in the second quarter. This pattern of moderate growth reflects the ongoing weakness of international trade in an environment of continued global uncertainties, which has particularly affected the euro area manufacturing sector and has also dampened investment growth. At the same time, the services and construction sectors remain more resilient, despite some moderation in the latter half of 2019. Incoming economic data and survey information point to some stabilisation in euro area growth dynamics, with near-term growth expected to be similar to rates observed in previous quarters. Looking ahead, the euro area expansion will continue to be supported by favourable financing conditions, further employment gains in conjunction with rising wages, the mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance and the ongoing  albeit somewhat slower  growth in global activity. The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook, related to geopolitical factors, rising protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets, remain tilted to the downside, but have become less pronounced as some of the uncertainty surrounding international trade is receding. Euro area annual HICP inflation increased to 1.3% in December 2019, from 1.0% in November, reflecting mainly higher energy price inflation. On the basis of current futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to hover around current levels in the coming months. While indicators of inflation expectations remain at low levels, recently they have either stabilised or ticked up slightly. Measures of underlying inflation have remained generally muted, although there are further indications of a moderate increase in line with previous expectations. While labour cost pressures have strengthened amid tighter labour markets, the weaker growth momentum is delaying their pass-through to inflation. Over the medium term, inflation is expected to increase, supported by our monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion and solid wage growth. Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth stood at 5.6% in November 2019, broadly unchanged since August. Sustained rates of broad money growth reflect ongoing bank credit creation for the private sector and low opportunity costs of holding M3 relative to other financial instruments. The narrow monetary aggregate M1 continues to be the main contributor to broad money growth on the components side. The growth of loans to firms and households remained solid, benefiting from the ongoing support provided by our accommodative monetary policy stance, which is reflected in very low bank lending rates. While the annual growth rate of loans to households remained unchanged from October, at 3.5% in November, the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations moderated to 3.4% in November, from 3.8% in October, likely reflecting some lagged reaction to the past weakening in the economy. These developments are also visible in the results of the euro area bank lending survey for the fourth quarter of 2019, which indicate weakening demand for loans to firms, while demand for loans to households for house purchase continued to increase. However, credit standards for both loans to firms and loans to households for house purchase remained broadly unchanged, pointing to still favourable credit supply conditions. Overall, our accommodative monetary policy stance will help to safeguard very favourable bank lending conditions and will continue to support access to financing across all economic sectors and in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is still necessary for the continued robust convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute more decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential, supporting aggregate demand at the current juncture and reducing vulnerabilities. The implementation of structural policies in euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up to boost euro area productivity and growth potential, reduce structural unemployment and increase resilience. The 2019 country-specific recommendations should serve as the relevant signpost. Regarding fiscal policies, the euro area fiscal stance is expected to continue to provide some support to economic activity. In view of the weak economic outlook, the Governing Council welcomes the Eurogroup's call in December for differentiated fiscal responses and its readiness to coordinate. Governments with fiscal space should be ready to act in an effective and timely manner. In countries where public debt is high, governments need to pursue prudent policies and meet structural balance targets, which will create the conditions for automatic stabilisers to operate freely. All countries should intensify their efforts to achieve a more growth-friendly composition of public finances. Likewise, the transparent and consistent implementation of the European Union's fiscal and economic governance framework over time and across countries remains essential to bolster the resilience of the euro area economy. Improving the functioning of Economic and Monetary Union remains a priority. The Governing Council welcomes the ongoing work and urges further specific and decisive steps to complete the banking union and the capital markets union."
Armenia,2020-01-24,"PRESS RELEASE 24.01.2020 In the January 24, 2020 meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) decided to leave the refinancing rate unchanged, 5.5%. There was 1.3% inflation in December of 2019 compared to that of 1.5% registered in the same period last year, with the 12-month inflation rate amounting to 0.7% for the year. Determined by reduced economic uncertainty in the external sector and the factors of supply of certain raw materials and food products, there has been some increase in prices in international markets. However, growth rates of the world economy are still relatively low, and the global demand remains weak accordingly. In general, the CBA Board does not expect any significant impact on the inflation environment from the external sector. The Board admits that economic activity was rather high in the fourth quarter too, under which annual estimates of economic growth will exceed expectations. Domestic demand growth is also estimated to be high, mainly due to the increase in private consumption, which is further promoted by a stimulative monetary policy. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the fiscal policy is estimated to be expansionary and is predicted to persist over this year as well; its extent will depend largely on the course of the fiscal policy being implemented. Taking into account the actual developments of external and domestic economies and in anticipation of an expansionary fiscal policy, as well as further favoring a gradual recovery of inflation, the CBA Board finds it appropriate to maintain the current level of monetary policy stimulus by leaving the refinancing rate unchanged. In view of anticipated macroeconomic developments, keeping monetary conditions expansionary will still be needed. As a result, the expectation is that the inflation will be running below the target in the upcoming months and will gradually return to it in the medium run. Risks to the inflation deviating from the projection path are currently in either direction; if they materialize, the CBA will react accordingly, while ensuring the price stability in the mid-term perspective. Detailed information that underlies the decision on setting of the interest rate will be available in Press Release (Minutes on Interest Rate) to be published by February 10, 2020. Press Service of the Central Bank of Armenia."
Nigeria,2020-01-24,"CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO. 128 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING HELD ON THURSDAY 23rd AND FRIDAY 24th JANUARY, 2020 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) held its 271st meeting, the first in fiscal 2020, on the 23rd and 24th of January, 2020. The Meeting held in an environment of sluggish global economic recovery and financial market vulnerabilities, and tepid domestic growth. The Committee appraised these developments and the outlook for the first quarter of 2020, as well as the rest of the year. All the Eleven (11) members of the Committee were in attendance. Global Economic Developments The headwinds that characterized the global economy in 2019 showed signs of moderation, giving way to improved prospects for economic recovery in 2020. Consequently global output is projected to grow by 33 per cent in 2020 from 29 per cent in 2019. The downside risks to the global outlook, include: broad slowdown in the advanced economies; resurgence of financial stress in the Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs); rising geo-political tensions in the 1 Middle-East; and extreme weather conditions in some regions. Output growth across major advanced economies, remains fragile, due to weak recovery in manufacturing activities and sluggish rise in global trade. Consequently growth in the Advanced Economies is projected to slow to 16 per cent in 2020, from 17 per cent in 2019. With most EMDEs facing brighter prospects, output growth is expected to recover to 44 per cent in 2020 from 37 per cent in 2019. The major impetus for this recovery is expected to come from India. Brazil and Russia. In most advanced economies, inflation remained below their long-run targets, reflecting weak aggregate demand in the Euro Area and Japan, as well as moderating wage growth in the US, despite the robust job performance. Central Banks in the advanced economies are thus, expected to continue with monetary accommodation into the medium term. In the EMDEs, however, inflation prospects remain mixed, with some economies facing stronger upside risks than others. Domestic Economic Developments Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) continued to improve, although slowly. It grew to 228 per cent in the third quarter of 2019, compared with 212 and 181 per cent in the preceding and corresponding quarters of 2018, respectively. The improvement in growth was driven, largely, by the performance of the oil sector, which grew by 649 per cent, while the non-oil sector grew by 185 per cent. Staff projections estimate real GDP in Q4 2019 and Q1 2020 at 220 and 235 per cent, 2 respectively. The Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Indices (PMI) grew further in December 2019, for the 33rd and 32nd consecutive months, to 608 and 621 index points, respectively. The optimism in growth prospects in Q1 2020, and the rest of the year, is anchored on the enhanced flow of credit to the private sector, to improve manufacturing activities, and financial and exchange rate stability. In addition, the Bank's continued intervention in Agriculture, and Small & Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs) is expected to boost growth. Identified headwinds to growth, however, include; uncertainty in the oil market, high unemployment, rising public debt and security challenges across the country. The Committee noted the continued uptick in headline inflation (year- on-year) in December 2019 to 1198 per cent, from 1185 per cent in the previous month. The increase in inflation, which was anticipated, was largely attributable to increase in both the food and core components, by 1467 and 933 per cent in December 2019 from 1448 and 899 per cent in November, respectively. The increase in the food component reflects largely seasonality effect and the impact of the continued insurgency in some food producing areas of the country. Although Staff forecasts suggest a short-term upward trend in prices, the Committee believes that the Bank's continued intervention in the real sector is expected to increase domestic production and lower prices in the medium-term. The Committee observed that broad money supply (M3) grew by 622 per cent (year-to-date) in December 2019. Aggregate Credit (Net) similarly grew to 2733 per cent in December 2019, from 2312 per cent in the previous month. This was largely attributed to an increase in Credit to Government, which grew to 9295 per cent in December 2019, from 7236 per cent in the previous month. Credit to the Private Sector also grew to 1361 per cent in December 2019, from 1282 per cent in the previous month. Consequently sectoral distribution of credit between end-May 2019 and end-December 2019 was as follows: manufacturing (N44644 billion); General Retail and Consumer Loans (N41902 billion); General Commerce (N24848 billion); Agriculture. Forestry and Fishing (N16094 billion); Information and Communications (N15647 billion); Finance and Insurance (N12987 billion); Construction (N8654 billion); and Transportation and Storage (N6861 billion), amongst others. The Committee observed with delight that, over the last six months, aggregate credit grew by N20 trillion and urged the Management of the Bank to sustain the current momentum of improved flow of credit to the Private Sector, while exploring other options with the fiscal authorities to strengthen the legal framework for the enforcement of credit recovery. Lower money market interest rates, in the review period, reflected the liquidity overhang in the banking system, resulting from the restriction of individuals and non-bank corporates in the domestic economy from participating in OMO bill auctions. Consequently the monthly weighted average Inter-bank call and Open Buy Back (OBB) rates fell 4 sharply to 382 and 324 per cent, in December 2019, from 1142 and 1073 per cent, respectively, in the previous month. The Committee noted the improved performance in the equities market, as the All-Share Index (ASI) and Market Capitalization grew by 1161 and 1827 per cent, respectively, between end-October 2019 and 10th January, 2020. This was indicative of the shift by domestic investors from the money market to the equities market in response to the Bank's policy to restrict their investments in the OMO bills auction. The MPC also noted the improved performance and sustained resilience of the banking system, evidenced by the continued moderation of the Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) ratio from 66 per cent in October to 61 per cent in December 2019. The Committee noted that the improvement reflected the Bank's continued deployment of heterodox policies to ensure that NPLs fell below the prudential benchmark of 50 per cent. Outlook Although global output is projected to expand moderately in 2020, compared with the previous year, the overall medium-term outlook for the global economy remains uncertain, due to the persistence of several headwinds. These include: the lingering trade tensions between the US and its major trading partners; rising levels of both corporate and public debts; continued geopolitical tensions in the Middle-East; fragile recovery of manufacturing activities; and the 5 narrowing policy space by which central banks in the advanced economies can respond to future macroeconomic shocks. In addition, predicted weather-related disasters could pose further threats to global output recovery. On the domestic side, available data on key macroeconomic indicators show prospects of improved output growth for the economy in 2020. Revised projections for 2020, show that the economy is expected to grow by 250 per cent (IMF), 210 per cent (World Bank) and 235 per cent (CBN). The underlying projection is anchored on the following conditions: enhanced flow of credit to the real sector of the economy; sustained stability in the exchange rate; continued CBN interventions in agriculture and non-agricultural Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs); and the effective implementation of the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP). The downside risks to this projection are primarily the rising stock of public debt and lack of fiscal buffers. Others include the persistent security threat in major food-producing areas, poor and inadequate infrastructure and weak public and private sector investment. The Committee's Considerations The Committee noted the persistent increase in the inflation rate, which stood at 1198 per cent in December 2019. It also noted that the inflation was driven by both monetary and structural factors. Having addressed the monetary factors, the headroom for further monetary policy measures has become constrained, being 6 supported by empirical evidence which suggests that inflation above 1200 per cent is inimical to output growth in the Nigerian economy. The MPC thus called on the fiscal authorities to speedily address legacy structural impediments giving rise to upward-trending price developments. Amongst these, the Committee identified infrastructure deficit and the long-standing clashes between herdsmen and farmers, which are constraining domestic production and contributing substantially to the rise in food inflation. The MPC, therefore, urged the Federal Government to relentlessly seek innovative ways of addressing security challenges across the country in order to boost aggregate food supply. The Committee further noted the contribution of imported food and other tradeables to the rise in price levels but emphasized the opportunity to ramp up production of domestic substitutes supported by the Bank's development finance initiatives, particularly in agriculture and manufacturing sectors. The Committee noted the improvement in the financial soundness indicators, growth in assets of the banking system and the gradual switch in the composition of DMB assets from investments in government securities to growth in credit portfolio. It however, noted that lending rates at the retail segment of the market had remained fairly sticky downwards as deposit rates had declined substantially. It also noted that in some cases. DMBs were not encouraging term deposits in their portfolios and therefore, emphasized the Bank's 7 commitment towards the implementation of the Loan-to-Deposit ratio (LDR) policy. On fiscal operations, the Committee applauded the Government for the recent signing of the 2020 Finance Bill which opens a new vista of opportunities in public financial management. The MPC, however, cautioned that public debt was rising faster than both domestic and external revenue, noting the need to tread cautiously in interpreting the debt to GDP ratio. The Committee also noted the rising burden of debt services and urged the Fiscal Authorities to strongly consider building buffers by not sharing all the proceeds from the Federation Account at the monthly FAAC meetings to avert a macroeconomic downturn, in the event of an oil price shock. It urged Government to gradually reduce reliance on oil receipts and focus on revenue diversification through reforms of the tax system. The Committee also called on Government to rationalize fiscal expenditure towards reducing the current excessively high cost of governance. The MPC expressed concern about the rising inflation, which increased consecutively in the last 4 months as at December 2019 to 1198 per cent and higher than its target range of 6-9%. This rising price level is attributable to a combination of structural and supply side factors, expansionary fiscal policy; and growth in money supply arising from rising liquidity surfeit in the industry due to changes in the Bank's OMO policy. In furtherance of its primary mandate to maintain price 8 and monetary stability and in view of the anticipated medium-term liquidity surfeit from maturing OMO bills held by local private and institutional investors, which would not be rolled over, the Committee considered it prudent to raise the CRR to curtail liquidity surfeit in the banking system. The Committee is confident that increasing the CRR at this time is fortuitous as it will help address monetary-induced inflation whilst retaining the benefits from the Bank's LDR policy, which has been successful in significantly increasing credit to the private sector as well as pushing market interest rates downwards. The Committee further encouraged the Management of the Bank to be more vigorous in its drive to improve access to credit through its pursuit of the Loan-to- deposit ratio policy as doing this would help, not only in creating job opportunities but also help in boosting output growth and in moderating prices. It is noteworthy that Gross credit in the industry grew by N2 Trillion between May 2019 and December 2019; channeled primarily to the employment-stimulating sectors such as agriculture and manufacturing, in addition to increased lending to the retail and SME segments, which is expected to help boost domestic output growth in the short to medium term. To retain the gains from credit expansion and current industry focus on lending, the Committee advised the Bank to sustain its LDR Policy and in addition continue to deploy its DCRR policy which directs new funding for greenfield projects and expansion to critical sectors of the economy. The Committee's Decision On the arguments to tighten, the Committee noted that given that inflation rate inched up in December 2019 and that the rate is still above the upper band of the 6-9 per cent threshold, tightening may be necessary to tame the rising trend in inflation. In addition, the relatively bearish outlook of the equities market indices points to waning investor confidence in equity in preference for coupon rate on bonds. Raising the policy rate, could be a policy choice to reverse the tendency and attract more foreign portfolio investments. Also the risks to the level of reserves persist as prices of oil futures remain uncertain. Policy tightening would enhance the accretion to foreign reserves and attain relative stability in the foreign exchange market. Moreover raising rates would reinforce the stability of the foreign exchange market as an upswing in the rate will inhibit demand pressures in the market through a decline in money supply. Although tightening would limit the ability of DMBs to create money, ultimately leading to a reduction in money supply and curtail their credit creation capabilities, which would eventually lead to rising cost of credit and credit risk as DMBs re-price their risk assets, the MPC believes that the aggressive pursuit of the current loan-to-deposit ratio policy thrust would continue to help to catalyze credit growth and positively impact growth and prices. On the decision to loosen, members noted that the relative stability in the foreign exchange market provides confidence to foreign 10 investors. There is, therefore, no immediate concern that loosening would exert pressures on the foreign exchange market in the near term. In addition, an accommodative monetary policy stance would motivate banks to lend to maintain their profit performance and would result in decline of the overall cost of production. This would further affirm the Bank's support for stimulating output growth. The Committee also feels that the downside to loosening is that it could amplify inflationary pressures as the economy experiences increased liquidity surfeit, particularly if loosening drives growth in consumer credit, without corresponding adjustment in output, thus escalating inflationary pressures. An interest rate reduction would increase money supply and exert pressure on the exchange rate. Moreover an accommodating monetary policy stance may not necessarily lower the retail lending rate, as interest rates are generally sticky downwards. On the argument for a Hold, the MPC acknowledged that a mix of heterodox monetary and financial policy measures have recently been deployed by the Bank. Noting the existence of a lag between the policy pronouncement and its impact on the economy, a hold in the rate would ensure its efficient impact on the economy. The Committee noted the slow pace and low rate of economic growth as real GDP growth of 210, 212 and 238 per cent in Q1. Q2 and Q3 2019, respectively, being below the population growth rate, still needs 11 sustained policy support. Maintaining monetary policy rate at its present level is essential for sustainable support to growth before any possible adjustments. This will enable policy to react suitably to developments as they occur in the near term. In addition, retaining the current policy position provides avenues to evaluating the impact of the heterodox monetary and financial policies to support lending by the banking industry without altering the policy rate. On the downsides to holding, the Committee noted that it would reduce the speed of economic recovery relative to loosening, exert a drag on output growth, as DMBs continue to utilize bonds sales instead of engaging in financial intermediation to the private sector. In view of the foregoing, the Committee by a decision of 9 members, voted to alter the Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR) by 500 basis points from 225 to 275 per cent, while leaving all other policy parameters constant. Two members voted to leave all parameters constant. In summary, the MPC voted to: 1. Change the CRR from 225 to 275 per cent; 2. Retain the MPR at 135 per cent; 3. Retain the asymmetric corridor of +200/-500 basis points around the MPR; 4. Retain the Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent. 12 Thank you. Godwin I Emefiele Governor.

Pakistan,2020-01-28,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement January 28, 2020. At its meeting on 28th January 2020, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 13.25 percent. The decision reflected the MPC's view that the outlook for inflation has remained broadly unchanged. On the one hand, recent inflation outturns have been on the high side and there remain near term risks to inflation primarily from food price shocks and potential increases in utility prices. On the other hand, several factors are expected to gradually moderate the pressure on inflation. These include the recent appreciation of the exchange rate after the introduction of the market-based exchange rate and ongoing fiscal consolidation. On balance, the SBP's projection for average inflation remained broadly unchanged at 1 12 percent for FY20. The MPC also viewed the current monetary policy stance as appropriate to bring inflation down to the medium-term target range of percent over the next six to eight quarters. In reaching this decision, the MPC considered key developments in the real, external and fiscal sectors along with their projections, and the resulting outlook for monetary conditions and inflation. Key developments since the last MPC meeting. The MPC noted three key developments since the last meeting on 2 November 2019. First the ongoing and substantial reduction in the current account deficit and the orderly conditions in the foreign exchange market after the transition to market-based exchange rate system continued to strengthen the country's external accounts. Second the IBA-SBP survey of business confidence showed an improvement in the business community's outlook for economic activity for third successive wave. Third fiscal developments remained on track and in line with commitments made under the IMF-supported program, buoying the overall economic reform sentiment. Real sector. The latest production estimates of major crops indicate that all Kharif crops, except cotton, grew in line with expectations. Cotton production has been revised downward due to adverse supply side shocks. Large scale manufacturing (LSM) indicates that economic activity is strengthening in export-oriented and import- competing industries, while inward-oriented industries continue to slow down. Specifically LSM showed gains in textiles, leather products, engineering goods, rubber products, cement and fertilizer, and declines in auto, electronics, food, chemicals, and petroleum products. Primarily on account of adverse supply side shocks to cotton production as well as the contraction in LSM to date. SBP's projection for real GDP growth for FY20 is likely to be revised downward. Nevertheless available monthly indicators of activity show that the slowdown in most economic sectors appears to have bottomed-out, and gradual recovery is expected in the coming months. External sector. The current account deficit contracted by 75 percent to US$.15 billion during the first half of FY20 due to notable reduction in imports and modest growth in both exports and workers' remittances. Importantly export volumes of major items including rice, value-added textiles, leather products, and fish and meat, exhibited notable increase during Jul-Dec FY20. This reflects the benefits of more competitive exchange rate and take-up of incentive credit schemes for export-oriented sectors. The capital account also continued to strengthen, with continued inflows of foreign portfolio investment and foreign direct investment. Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN. These favorable developments facilitated the SBP to build up its foreign exchange reserves despite making repayment of US$. billion international Sukuk in early December 2019. SBP's foreign reserves increased from US$.28 billion at end-June 2019 to US$ 1.73 billion as of 17th January 2020, an increase of US$.45 billion, and SBP's short liabilities fell by US$.82 billion in the first six months of FY20. These developments have significantly improved the SBP's net international reserves (NIR) position. The MPC noted that recent foreign portfolio inflows reflect international investors' improved perceptions of Pakistan's credit worthiness. Such inflows reduce the interest rate on government debt due to the greater demand for government securities, deepen capital markets, and free up domestic banks' resources for lending to the private sector. The MPC noted the bulk of the improvement in the SBP's reserve adequacy stemmed from the improvement in the current account—not portfolio inflows—and current inflows comprised only. percent of total marketable government debt. As such, inflows at current levels represented limited risks. The MPC noted that the SBP continues to monitor developments carefully and has more than adequate buffers to manage any outflows in an orderly manner. The MPC noted that monetary policy would continue to be based on the medium-term outlook for inflation. Fiscal Sector. Fiscal consolidation has remained on track during the year to date and has supported qualitative improvement in the inflation outlook. During the first half of FY20, tax revenue collections showed healthy increase of 16 percent over the same period last year. On the expenditure side, while non-interest current expenditures have been strictly controlled, the federal releases for public sector development programs (PSDP) stood at Rs 300 billion in H1-FY20 as compared to Rs 187 billion in the same period last year. This increased public spending is expected to support business activity, especially in construction-allied industries. From the monetary policy perspective, the MPC emphasized that the continuation of fiscal prudence would remain critical for effective anchoring of market sentiment and improving the inflation outlook. Monetary and inflation outlook. Private sector credit (PSC) grew by. percent during 1st Jul 17th Jan FY20 as compared to. percent in the same period last year. This deceleration broadly reflects soft economic activity. However loans under SBP's export finance scheme and long-term financing facility for exporters increased by 20. percent and 13. percent during the same period, supporting the recent growth in exports. The MPC noted that recent inflation outturns have been on the higher side. National CPI inflation rose to 12. and 12. percent (on y/y basis) in November and December 2019, largely reflecting sharp increases in selected food items on account of temporary supply disruptions and upward adjustments in administered prices. If sustained, high food price inflation could lead to demands for faster wage growth and to possible risks of wage-price inflation spiral. However available evidence suggests that such second-round effects on inflation from supply side shocks have not materialized and inflation expectations remain broadly anchored. Consequently the MPC viewed the latest increases in CPI as primarily transitory in nature. The MPC noted that real interest rates on forward-looking basis were not high compared to other emerging markets and from the perspective of Pakistan's own experience. Page."
Chile,2020-01-29,"N76 PRESS RELEASE * Wednesday 29 January 2020 Monetary Policy Meeting  January 2020 In its Monetary Policy Meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to hold the monetary policy interest rate at 1.75%. The decision was adopted with the unanimous vote of the Board members. In the external scenario, the signing of Phase 1 of the trade agreement between China and the United States and the improved activity figures in the main economies had a positive impact on financial markets and commodity prices. However, the Coronavirus outbreak in China triggered a rise in the perception of global risk, which has translated into increases in risk premiums, a global appreciation of the dollar, and falls in stock markets, interest rates and commodity prices. The price of copper has been particularly affected. Since the last meeting, domestic financial markets have shown volatility in line with the evolution of their internal and external fundamentals, and with the impact of the measures adopted by the Bank. As for banking loans, the marked deceleration of consumer credit stands out, while commercial and mortgage credit loans have shown no major changes in their annual expansion rates. At the same time, an important amount of corporate bond issues has been observed abroad, with favorable financial conditions. The Banking Credit Survey for the fourth quarter of 2019 reports that credit supply is perceived to have tightened, particularly in consumer and large company portfolios, and that demand had dwindled, particularly in the consumer segment. Regarding activity, fourth-quarter data confirmed that the disruptions caused by the social crisis had a strong impact on the Imacec in October and November, but some moderation could be expected in the December figure, in line with the baseline scenario of the last Monetary Policy Report. On the expenditure side, different sources reveal a noticeable contraction of the tradable components of private consumption, a further fall in annual terms of imports of consumer goods, retail inventories still perceived as too high, and consumer expectations that persist in markedly pessimistic territory. The latter occurs in a context where administrative data show an incipient deterioration of the labor market. As for investment, business expectations remained pessimistic and capital goods imports have continued to contract in annual terms. The Capital Goods Corporation' investment plans survey has shown no big changes in the amounts committed for this year and next. In this scenario, in January's Economic Expectations Survey growth expectations dropped to 1.2% annually for this year and 2.5% for 2021. In recent months, annual inflation rose to 3% and the core measure remained at around 2.5%. Both fell short of expectations estimated in the December Report. The evolution of inflation continues to be exposed to opposing forces, whose relative impact is still uncertain. On the one hand, the pressures inherent in the idiosyncratic depreciation that the peso has accumulated since October are still present. On the other hand, the outlook for activity remains weak and its recovery continues to depend on the economic agents' response to the changed scenario. Inflation expectations remain at around 3% two years ahead. The decision to maintain the MPR at its current level is consistent with safeguarding the expansionary stance of monetary policy, as communicated by the Board last December, considering the evolution of the macro scenario and the set of extraordinary measures adopted. The March Monetary Policy Report will assess the macroeconomic situation and its implications for inflation and the monetary policy trajectory. The Board reaffirms its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the two-year horizon. The minutes of this Monetary Policy Meeting will be published at 8:30 a.m. on Thursday, 13 February, 2020. The next Monetary Policy Meeting will be held on Tuesday, 31 March and the statement thereof will be published at 18:00 hours the same day. __The Spanish original prevails."
Georgia,2020-01-29,"29.01.2020 The National Bank keeps its policy rate unchanged at 9.0 percent The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on January 29, 2020, and decided to keep the refinancing rate unchanged at 9.0 percent. In December, annual inflation equalled 7.0 percent. In addition to the one-off factors from early 2019, the nominal effective exchange rate depreciation had a significant impact on inflation. In response, to neutralize inflationary pressures stemming from the exchange rate depreciation, from September 2019, the NBG began tightening its monetary policy stance. In December, the nominal effective exchange rate strengthened slightly, which reduced the pressure on inflation. However, the nominal effective exchange rate remains undervalued. In recent periods, economic growth accelerated and lending is robust. If these dynamics create additional inflationary pressure, the tight monetary policy stance may be maintained for more extended period. According to the NBG forecast, other things being equal, the inflation will start to decline from the beginning of the year and approach the target by the end of the year. This will be ensured by the monetary policy which will remain tight until the medium term inflation expectations decline to three percent target. Meanwhile, the exports and remittances revealed moderate growth, and, despite the decline in summer, the annual change in tourism revenues became positive since October 2019. It is noteworthy that in 2019, similar to 2018, the current account improved significantly. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all means and instruments at its disposal to ensure price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee is scheduled on March 18, 2020."
United States,2020-01-29,"EST January 29, 2020 Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate. Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Although household spending has been rising at a moderate pace, business fixed investment and exports remain weak. On a 12 month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running - below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey- based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1 1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. The Committee judges that the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate to support sustained expansion of economic - activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation returning to the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective. The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including global developments and muted inflation pressures, as it assesses the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.

Ukraine,2020-01-30,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to cut the key policy rate to 11% per annum effective 31 January 2020. The NBU continues to ease its monetary policy with the aim of maintaining inflation at the target level of 5% and supporting steady economic growth. In 2019 consumer inflation declined to a six-year low of 4.1% (versus 9.8% in 2018). The NBU thus achieved its medium-term inflation target of 5% ± 1 pp (declared in 2015) earlier than expected. The strengthening of the hryvnia was the key factor driving the rapid disinflation seen in late 2019, offsetting the effects of robust consumer demand. Throughout most of 2020, inflation will be below the 5±1 pp target range, but it will return to the target range at the end of the year. According to the NBU's estimates, inflation continues to slow. It will be below the 5±1 pp target range starting in January and throughout most of the year. However, it will accelerate in Q4 to 4.8% at year-end 2020. This will be due to the following factors. First, the last year's appreciation of the hryvnia will continue to be reflected in prices of imported goods and products with a large share of imported inputs. Second, continued relatively low global energy prices will curb the rise in domestic fuel prices. Third, in the absence of supply shocks, food price inflation will be insignificant owing to expected higher yields of fruit and vegetables. At the same time, administered prices will grow somewhat faster than last year, mainly as excise taxes on tobacco products continue to converge with European levels. Driven by the monetary policy easing, inflation in 20212022 will remain within the medium-term target of 5+/-1% pp. The further steady, low pace of inflation will also be due to the following factors:. a prudent fiscal policyrelatively low energy prices on the global marketshigher productivity of the Ukrainian economy.In 2020 economic growth will accelerate to 3.5%, up from 3.3% in 2019, while accelerating to around 4% in the following years. The monetary policy easing will contribute to the faster economic growth. High private consumption and investment will remain the main economic growth drivers. At the same time, the contribution of net exports to GDP will remain negative on the back of the real sector's considerable need for investment imports. Real household income will grow at a fast pace, which will further narrow the wage gap with neighboring countries and thus make Ukrainians more interested in working in Ukraine rather than abroad. The 20202022 current account deficit will remain acceptable. The deficit narrowed to 0.7% of GDP in 2019. An important factor behind the decrease in the deficit was the compensation received by Naftogaz of Ukraine from Russian Gazprom under a ruling of the Stockholm Arbitration Court. However, apart from that, the current account deficit shrank due to the decreased trade deficit in goods and services, steady growth in services exports, and smaller amounts of repatriated dividends. The current account deficit will range from 3% to 4% in 20202022. In particular, the wider deficit will be caused by large volumes of investment imports and decreased proceeds from natural gas transit. However, this will be offset by greater capital inflows to the private sector amid an improvement in the investment climate. Further cooperation with the International Monetary Fund remains the basic assumption of the macroeconomic forecast. The NBU expects that a new cooperation program with the IMF will be signed in the coming months, after the Ukrainian parliament approves the required draft laws. The new cooperation program, official borrowing and nonresidents' sustained interest in domestic Treasury bonds and bills will sustain the rise in international reserves every year, despite Ukraine going through a period of peak external public debt payments. International reserves will exceed USD 29 billion in 2020, and will continue to rise in 20212022. As before, the NBU believes any delay in entering into a new cooperation agreement with the IMF to be the key risk to the said macroeconomic forecast. Risks to macrofinancial stability also persist. These risks could mainly arise from Ukrainian court rulings on the responsibility and liability of the former owners of insolvent banks to the state. If materialized, these risks could worsen exchange rate and inflation expectations, and make it harder for Ukraine to access the international capital markets in order to repay the heavy debt load of the coming years. There are other significant risks. the continued cooling of the global economy and a further deterioration in terms of tradean escalation of the military conflict in eastern Ukraine and new trade restrictions introduced by Russiaa drop in the harvest of grain, fruit and vegetable crops in Ukraine in the wake of unfavorable weatherthe higher volatility of global food prices, driven by global climate changea decrease in foreign capital inflows.The outlined macroeconomic forecast and the unchanged balance of risks have enabled the NBU Board to cut the key policy rate by as much as 2.5 pp. This monetary policy easing will help revive lending to the real sector and speed up economic growth. In light of the more rapid improvement in Ukraine's macroeconomic conditions, the NBU expects to cut the key policy rate to 7% by the end of 2020. The most pronounced reduction in the key policy rate is expected to take place in H1 of the current year. This will lead to further decreases in interest rates on loans for businesses and households, thus stimulating business activity. That said, if the above inflation risks, both internal and external, materialize, the key policy rate could be decreased more slowly. Conversely, faster implementation of reforms, coupled with significant investment inflows, could enable the NBU to cut the key policy rate at a quicker pace. The decision to cut the key policy rate to 11% was approved by NBU Board Decision No.76-D On the Key Policy Rate, dated 30 January 2020. A summary of the discussion by Monetary Policy Committee members that preceded this decision will be published on 10 February 2020. А new detailed macroeconomic forecast will be published in the Inflation Report on 6 February 2020. The next meeting of the NBU Board on monetary policy issues will be held on 12 March 2020, as scheduled."
Colombia,2020-01-31,"Learn about the considerations of the Board for its decision. In this decision, the Board took into consideration primarily the following information. In December, annual inflation (3.8%) reduced slightly. The supply shocks that have affected inflation are expected to continue fading, and inflation is expected to resume its convergence to the target, as market expectations are reflecting. Core inflation indicators are close to 3.0%. With the new information on economic activity, the Central Bank's technical staff maintained its estimate for economic growth in 2019 at 3.2%, and its forecast for 2020 at 3.3%. Global growth prospects are moderate; in the United States, the Fed maintained its reference interest rate unaltered. The projection of the current account deficit for 2019 remains above 4.0% of GDP, and continues to be funded mostly by foreign direct investment. Based on this information, the Board considered the following factors for its decision. The temporary deviations of inflation from the target, uncertainty about the persistence of depreciation of the peso, and its degree of pass-through to domestic prices. The size of the spare capacity and the pace at which it will reduce. The effects of changing external conditions on the Colombian economy. In this environment, upon assessing the situation of the economy and the risk balance, the Board unanimously decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate unaltered at 4.25%. The Board will continue to carefully monitor inflation and the forecasts of economic activity, as well as the evolution of the balance of payments and the external situation, including, particularly, the economic effects of the recent declaration of international health emergency. Finally, the Board reiterates that monetary policy will continue to depend on the new information available. Press Conference. Watch the video of the press conference delivered on Friday, 31 January after the last meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica in 2020. The benchmark interest rate completes 21 months at 4.25%. The Governor of the Central Bank explains the Decisions reached by the Board of Directors in its January Meeting. Juan Jose Echavarra.

Kazakhstan,2020-02-03,"3 The base rate remains unchanged at 9.25% February 3, 2020 Almaty The National Bank of Kazakhstan has made a decision to maintain the base rate and the interest rate corridor at 9.25% per annum +/- 1 percentage points. Inflation is developed within the target corridor of 4-6%. In January 2020 the annual inflation amounted to 5.6%. The rise in food prices accounted for 9.2%, non-food items  5.2%, and of paid services  for 1.4%. Household inflation expectations remain moderate. In December 2019 they decelerated to 5.6% as compared to 5.8% in November. The consumer and investment demand contribution to the economic activity. The growth in household real disposable income made up 5.8% in annual terms in January-November 2019, the budget spending on the social safety net went up by 26.0% in 2019 and the consumer lending increased by 26.9% over 2019. In 2019 investments expanded by 8.5%. At the end of 2019 the short-term economic indicator increased by 5.0% in annual terms. In January 2020 the average price of Brent crude oil in the global market was USD 63.7 per barrel; the FAO food price index increased by 2.5% in December 2019. The annual inflation in Russia accounted for 3%, in the EU member countries  for 1.6%; this restrains the growth in prices for imported goods. Over the short-term horizon, there will be pro-inflationary risks due to the effect of the increase in excises for the sale of gasoline and of the rise in prices for regulated services. For the rest of this year and in the medium term, inflationary processes are expected to gradually weaken and the annual inflation is projected to slowdown to the mid-point of the target corridor of 4-6% and below by the end of 2020. Further decisions about the base rate will be made based on whether the actual and forecasted inflation dynamics are in line with the inflation targets as well as on the balance of domestic and external risks. If the situation develops in line with the National Bank's expectations and the Government and local executive authorities take actions to boost competition in the food markets and to pursue an optimal tariff policy, monetary conditions may ease. The next decision on the base rate will be announced on March 16, 2020 at 15:00 Nur-Sultan time."
Brazil,2020-02-05,"In its 228th meeting, the Copom unanimously decided to lower the Selic rate to 4.25% p.a. The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario:. Data on economic activity released since the previous meeting indicate the continuation of the process of gradual economic recovery. Regarding the global outlook, despite the recent increase in uncertainty, the provision of monetary stimulus in major economies has been able to generate relatively favorable environment for emerging economies. The Committee judges that various measures of underlying inflation are running at levels compatible with meeting the inflation target at the relevant horizon for monetary policy. Inflation expectations for 2020, 2021, and 2022 collected by the Focus survey are around 3.4%, 3.75%, and 3.5%, respectively. The Copom's inflation projections in the hybrid scenario with interest rate path extracted from the Focus survey and constant exchange rate at R$4.25/US$* stand around 3.5% for 2020, and 3.7% for 2021. This scenario assumes a path for the Selic rate that ends 2020 at 4.25% p.a. and rises to 6.00% p.a. in 2021; and. The scenario with constant interest rate at 4.50% p.a. and constant exchange rate at R$4.25/US$* yields inflation projections around 3.5% for 2020, and 3.8% for 2021. The Committee emphasizes that risks to its baseline scenario remain in both directions. On the one hand, the high level of economic slack may continue to produce a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory. On the other hand, the current degree of monetary stimulus, which affects the economy with lags, may produce a higher-than-expected path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy. Risk intensifies in case of an increase in the monetary policy power due to the changes in credit and capital markets, a deterioration of the outlook for emerging economies, or a possible frustration with the continuation of reforms and the perseverance in the necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to lower the Selic rate to 4.25% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation and the associated balance of risks, and it is consistent with convergence of inflation to its target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, which includes 2020 and, with increasing weight, 2021. The Copom reiterates that economic conditions prescribe stimulative monetary policy, i.e., interest rates below the structural level. The Copom sees progress in the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy. The Committee emphasizes that persevering in this process is essential to allow for the consolidation of the reduction of the structural interest rate and for a sustainable economic recovery. The Copom stresses that the perception of the continuation of the reform agenda affects current expectations and macroeconomic projections. The Copom judges that the current stage of the business cycle recommends caution in the conduct of monetary policy. In light of the lagged effects of the monetary easing cycle that began in July 2019, the Committee deems appropriate to interrupt the monetary easing process. The Committee emphasizes that its next steps will continue to depend on the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, and inflation projections and expectations, with increasing weight for 2021. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Roberto Oliveira Campos Neto (Governor). Bruno Serra Fernandes. Carolina de Assis Barros. Fabio Kanczuk. Fernanda Feitosa Nechio. Joao Manoel Pinho de Mello. Mauricio Costa de Moura. Otavio Ribeiro Damaso, and Paulo Srgio Neves de Souza. *Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average R$/US$ exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the Friday prior to the Copom meeting."
Poland,2020-02-05,"Warsaw, 5 February 2020 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 4-5 February 2020 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: ▪ reference rate at 1.50%; ▪ lombard rate at 2.50%; ▪ deposit rate at 0.50%; ▪ rediscount rate at 1.75%. Incoming data from the global economy indicate a stabilisation of economic growth at a relatively low level. At the same time, uncertainty about the global outlook in the coming quarters persists, despite some indicators suggesting some improvement in sentiment. In the euro area, economic growth declined in 2019 Q4, amidst the ongoing downturn in industry. In the United States, economic conditions continue to be relatively strong, although the weaker activity in industry had a curbing effect on economic growth in 2019 Q4. In China. GDP growth stabilised in 2019 Q4 at a lower level than in previous years. In the recent period, global oil prices have fallen, following their previous substantial rise. At the same time, the prices of many food commodities have increased in recent months. As a result, inflation in the external environment of the Polish economy has risen somewhat. The European Central Bank is keeping the deposit rate below zero, while conducting asset purchases and signalling the maintenance of loose monetary policy in the coming quarters. After the 2019 interest rate cuts, the Federal Reserve is keeping the rates unchanged. In Poland, economic conditions remain good, despite a slowdown in economic growth. Based on the Statistics Poland GDP flash estimate for 2019, it could be estimated that GDP growth in 2019 Q4 decreased. GDP growth is supported by the steady consumption growth, albeit slightly slower than before, fuelled by favourable labour market conditions, strong consumer confidence and social benefit payments. At the same time, incoming data indicate further growth in investment and exports. CPI inflation stood at 3.4% y/y in December 2019. Inflation in December was driven up by rising food and fuel prices. At the same time, accelerated service price growth boosted core inflation, which nevertheless remained moderate. In the Council's assessment, the outlook for economic conditions in Poland remains favourable, yet GDP growth will probably be weaker than in previous years. There remains uncertainty about the scale and persistence of the slowdown abroad and its impact on domestic economic activity. Current forecasts show that inflation may exceed the upper limit of band for deviations from the target in the coming months. The temporary rise in price growth will be driven by supply-side and regulatory factors, i.e. ones remaining beyond the direct impact of domestic monetary policy. As the impact of these factors fades and GDP growth weakens, inflation will gradually decrease. In the monetary policy transmission horizon inflation will be close to the target. The Council judges that the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability, while at the same time enabling to meet the inflation target in the medium term."
Thailand,2020-02-05,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 1/2020 Mr. Titanun Mallikamas. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 5 February 2020 as follows. The Committee voted unanimously to cut the policy rate by 025 percentage point from 125 to 100 percent effective immediately. In deliberating their policy decision, the Committee assessed that the Thai economy would expand at a much lower rate in 2020 than the previous forecast and much further below its potential due to the coronavirus outbreak, the delayed enactment of the Annual Budget Expenditure Act, and the drought. Headline inflation was projected to be below the lower bound of the inflation target throughout the forecast horizon. Financial stability became more vulnerable due to the prospect of economic slowdown. In this situation, there was an urgent need to coordinate monetary and fiscal measures. The Committee viewed that a more accommodative monetary policy stance would alleviate the negative impacts. Monetary accommodation would also support liquidity provision and debt restructuring for businesses and households severely affected from the economic slowdown, both of which should be urgently implemented. The Committee thus voted to cut the policy rate at this meeting. The Committee viewed that the Thai economy would expand at a slower rate in 2020 than previously forecasted and much further below its potential due to the outbreak of coronavirus, the delayed enactment of the Annual Budget Expenditure Act, and the drought that would affect a large number of related businesses and employment. Tourist figures were expected to grow at a much lower rate than the previous forecast. Exports of goods would decline in line with trading partner economies and potential impacts of regional supply chain disruptions. Regarding domestic demand, public expenditure would grow at a lower rate owing to the delayed enactment of the Annual Budget Expenditure Act which remained subject to high uncertainty. Furthermore private consumption would be restrained by moderating household income in the services, agricultural, and manufacturing sectors as well as by elevated household debt. Consequently the Committee would continue to monitor the downside risks from the coronavirus outbreak, the delayed budget disbursement, and the drought that could be more severe than previously assessed, together with trade tensions and geopolitical risks that remained highly uncertain. The annual averages of headline inflation in 2020 and 2021 were projected to be below the lower bound of the inflation target throughout the forecast horizon due to moderating core inflation resulted from subdued demand-pull inflationary pressures and lower-than-expected energy prices in tandem with declined oil demand due to the coronavirus outbreak. However fresh food prices were expected to increase slightly due to the drought. Financial conditions over the previous period had been accommodative. Real interest rates remained low. Government bond yields declined. Liquidity in the financial system remained ample. Nevertheless loans extended to businesses decelerated in tandem with the economic outlook. With regard to exchange rates, although the baht somewhat depreciated compared with trading partner currencies, the baht might not be consistent with economic fundamentals and would likely remain volatile. The Committee would closely monitor developments of exchange rates and capital flows amid high external uncertainties as well as the effectiveness of the relaxation of foreign exchange regulations to facilitate capital outflows. The Committee encouraged the Bank of Thailand to continue implementing additional measures in collaboration with the government and related agencies. There were more vulnerabilities in the financial system, especially related to debt servicing capability of households and SMEs due to the prospect of economic slowdown. The Committee viewed that monetary and fiscal measures that were urgently implemented by the government and the Bank of Thailand directly targeted those vulnerabilities. The Committee would closely monitor the effectiveness of these measures. In addition, the Committee would also monitor debt accumulation and debt servicing capability of households and SMEs, search-for-yield behavior in the prolonged low interest rate environment, growth in assets held by saving cooperatives and the interconnectedness among saving cooperatives, and leverage by large corporates that might underprice risks. The Committee viewed that microprudential and macroprudential measures should be combined at the appropriate timing to ensure financial stability. Looking ahead, the Committee would monitor developments of economic growth, inflation, and financial stability, together with associated risks, especially the coronavirus outbreak, the delayed enactment of the Annual Budget Expenditure Act, and the drought in deliberating monetary policy going forward. The Committee would stand ready to use policy tools as appropriate. In addition, the Committee would monitor structural problems that affect competitiveness and economic growth outlook, which should be firmly addressed by all related parties."
Czech Republic,2020-02-06,"At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank increased the two-week repo rate by 25 basis points to 2.25%. At the same time, it increased the Lombard rate to 3.25% and the discount rate to 1.25%. Four members voted in favour of this decision, and three members voted for leaving rates unchanged.. The decision adopted by the Bank Board is underpinned by a new macroeconomic forecast. Consistent with the forecast is a rise in domestic market interest rates initially, followed by a decline in the second half of this year. According to the external assumptions of the new forecast, the currently muted economic growth in the effective euro area will be replaced by a gradual acceleration during this year. The recovery in economic growth will be reflected in a gradual increase in foreign producer price inflation. Consumer price inflation in the effective euro area will be below 2% over the entire forecast horizon. The market outlook for short-term euro rates has shifted to less negative levels. According to the assumptions, the price of oil will fall gradually from an initial level of around USD 65 a barrel. However, world prices of oil have decreased markedly in recent days and are now below the assumptions of the forecast. The euro is expected to appreciate only marginally against the dollar. Domestic inflation will increase appreciably above the upper boundary of the tolerance band around the target in the months ahead, mainly due to the price impacts of changes to indirect taxes amid persisting elevated inflation pressures in the domestic economy. These pressures will temporarily increase further at the start of this year, among other things as a result of government measures boosting household consumption. They will subsequently weaken gradually, mainly due to slowing wage growth. A temporary decline in import prices and falling growth in administered prices and subsequently food prices will also have an anti-inflationary effect. Inflation will thus decrease close to the 2% target over the monetary policy horizon, i.e. in the first half of next year. However, the decrease in inflation will be slowed by the assumed price impacts of changes to indirect taxes. Monetary policy-relevant inflation, i.e. inflation adjusted for the first-round effects of changes to indirect taxes, will be lower than headline inflation and will return to the 2% target over the monetary policy horizon. This will be supported by a tightening of the monetary conditions at the start of this year. The growth of the Czech economy slowed in 2019 but will gradually accelerate on the back of a steady recovery in external demand. GDP growth will continue to be driven mainly by rising consumption expenditure of households, reflecting continued, albeit gradually slowing, growth in household income. Fiscal policy will contribute to domestic demand growth via a rise in public sector pay, pensions and other social benefits. Government investment expenditure will also increase, supported by drawdown of EU funds. The current downturn in private investment, reflecting the slowdown in euro area economic growth, will drop out during this year and total investment growth will turn positive again. The recovery in external demand will be reflected in positive contributions of net exports to growth. As a result, economic growth will accelerate gradually and moderately. The unemployment rate will remain close to its current very low levels. Amid persisting labour shortages and weakening demand for labour, employment growth will remain subdued. Wage growth will decrease gradually, but its slowdown will be dampened by a further large increase in both the minimum wage and salaries in the non-market part of the economy from January 2020. After appreciating at the start of 2020, the koruna-euro exchange rate will remain stable for the rest of the year. The effect of a temporary widening of the interest rate differential vis-à-vis the euro area will be offset by only weak economic and price growth abroad, amid only gradually fading negative global sentiment. Next year, the exchange rate will appreciate only slightly. Continued real convergence of the Czech economy will foster appreciation over the entire forecast horizon. Consistent with the forecast is a rise in domestic market interest rates initially, followed by a decline in the second half of this year. The initial increase in interest rates mainly reflects persisting increased domestic inflation pressures, which will be temporarily intensified by a further large increase in the minimum wage and other government measures fostering growth in household consumption. The expected second-round effects of changes to indirect taxes, which will affect inflation in 2020 and early 2021, are also pushing up rates. The subsequent slight decline in domestic interest rates in the forecast will reflect a decrease in domestic inflation pressures in an environment of still very easy monetary policy in the euro area. The headline inflation outlook has been increased by comparison with the previous forecast, owing to a revision of fundamental domestic inflation pressures, faster growth in administered prices and the incorporation of new changes to indirect taxes in 2021. The forecast for growth in domestic economic activity is slightly lower for this year and unchanged for next year. The new forecast predicts marginally higher interest rates in 2021 than the previous one did. Compared with the November forecast, the exchange rate of the koruna will be stronger this year."
India,2020-02-06,"Sixth Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2019-20 Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) Reserve Bank of India On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (February 6, 2020) decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 5.15 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains unchanged at 4.90 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 5.40 per cent. The MPC also decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long as it is necessary to revive growth, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Assessment Global Economy 2. Since the MPC met last in December 2019, global economic activity has remained slow-paced, but is getting differentiated across geographies. Among the key advanced economies (AEs), the US economy grew by 2.1 per cent in Q4:2019, the same pace as in Q3, with slack in consumer spending offset by government expenditure. In the euro area, economic activity slowed down in Q4 as France and Italy shrank unexpectedly amid waning consumer confidence. Growth momentum in the UK appears to have weakened in Q4 as reflected in a decline in industrial production and tepid retail sales. The Japanese economy was weighed down in Q4 by weak retail sales as reflected in subdued consumer spending in the wake of the sales tax hike in October. Industrial production in Japan was pulled down by muted global demand.2 3. Among emerging market economies (EMEs), the Chinese economy slowed down to a 29-year low of 6.1 per cent in 2019, caused by sluggish domestic demand and prolonged trade tensions. In Russia, available indicators point to a loss of momentum in activity in Q4:2019 with industrial production easing, although private consumption may have provided some cushion. In Brazil, activity seems to have slowed down, as reflected in a contraction in industrial production and depressed retail sales. The South African economy recorded a growth of -0.6 per cent in Q3 and is likely to have also contracted in Q4 as industrial production slumped and household spending remained subdued amidst lingering consumer pessimism. Crude oil and gold prices shot up in early January sparked by the US-Iran confrontation, but both softened from mid-January as geo-political tensions eased. By end- January, crude oil prices dipped sharply due to sell-offs triggered by the outbreak of the coronavirus. Gold prices, on the other hand, inched up towards end-January because of safe haven demand. International food prices have been rising on higher demand and supply disruptions from major exporting countries. Reflecting these developments, inflation has edged up in some major AEs and EMEs. Global financial markets remained resilient in December 2019 and for the most part of January 2020 as thawing US-China trade relations and improved prospects of an orderly Brexit buoyed investors' sentiment. Equity markets rallied across AEs and EMEs, turning bearish towards end-January with the outbreak of the coronavirus as markets braced up for the likely adverse impact on growth prospects, particularly in China. However, equity markets in most economies recovered some of the losses in early February. Bond yields, which had hardened in the US towards the end of 2019 as investors turned to riskier assets, softened in January 2020, especially after the US Fed left the policy rate unchanged and assured the extension of repo operations. In the euro area, bond yields sank further into negative territory in January. Yields also softened across several EMEs. In currency markets, the US dollar strengthened in January against major advanced economies in sympathy with factors impacting US bond markets. EME currencies, which were generally trading with an appreciating bias, have depreciated since the last week of January. Domestic Economy 6. Moving on to the domestic economy, the first advance estimates (FAE) released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on January 7, 2020 placed India's real gross domestic product (GDP) growth for 2019-20 at 5.0 per cent. In its January 31 release, the NSO revised real GDP growth for 2018-19 to 6.1 per cent from 6.8 per cent given in the provisional estimates of May 2019. On the supply side, growth of real gross value added (GVA) is estimated at 4.9 per cent in 2019-20 as compared with 6.0 per cent in 2018-19. Turning to more recent indicators, both production and imports of capital goods  two key pointers of investment activity  continued to contract in November/December, though at a moderate pace compared with the previous month. Revenue expenditure of the Centre (excluding interest payments and subsidies) remained robust in Q3, indicative of the counter- cyclical buffer to domestic demand being provided by government final consumption. As per3 revised estimates given in the Union Budget, growth in revenue expenditure of the Centre (excluding interest payments and subsidies) is estimated to be lower in Q4 compared with Q3. On the supply side, rabi sowing has been higher by 9.5 per cent up to January 31, 2020 compared with a year ago. The north east monsoon rainfall was above normal. Storage in major reservoirs  the main source of irrigation during the rabi season  was 70 per cent of the full reservoir level (as on January 30, 2020) as compared with 45 per cent a year ago. Based on the first advance estimates, horticulture production is estimated to have risen 0.8 per cent to a record level in 2019-20. Production of vegetables is estimated to have increased by 2.6 per cent in 2019-20 due to higher production of onions, potatoes and tomatoes. Industrial activity, measured by the index of industrial production (IIP), improved in November after contracting in the previous three months. The output of core industries returned to positive territory in December after four months of contraction, buoyed by five out of eight of its constituents  coal; refinery products; fertilisers; steel; and cement. Capacity utilisation (CU) in the manufacturing sector, measured by the Reserve Bank's order books, inventory and capacity utilisation survey (OBICUS), fell to 69.1 per cent in Q2 from 73.6 per cent in Q1; seasonally adjusted CU also eased to 70.3 per cent from 73.4 per cent. The Reserve Bank's industrial outlook survey points to weak demand conditions facing the manufacturing sector in Q3:2019-20. The Reserve Bank's business expectations index suggests an improvement in Q4. This is corroborated by the manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) for January 2020 which picked up sharply to 55.3 from 51.2 in November 2019 on the back of increased output and new orders. Several high frequency indicators of services have turned upwards in the recent period, pointing to a modest revival in momentum, although the outlook is still muted. Amongst indicators of rural demand, while tractor sales grew by 2.4 per cent in December after ten months of a decline, motorcycle sales continued to contract. Domestic air passenger traffic  an indicator of urban demand  posted double digit growth in November, followed by a modest growth in December. Growth in three-wheeler sales and railway freight traffic has accelerated, while port traffic turned around in December. On the other hand, passenger vehicle sales continued to contract. The PMI services index improved to 55.5 in January 2020 from 52.7 in November 2019, boosted by a rise in new business and output. Retail inflation, measured by year-on-year changes in the CPI, surged from 4.6 per cent in October to 5.5 per cent in November and further to 7.4 per cent in December 2019, the highest reading since July 2014. While food group inflation rose to double digits, the fuel group moved out of deflation. Inflation in CPI excluding food and fuel continued to edge up from its October trough. CPI food inflation increased from 6.9 per cent in October to 12.2 per cent in December, primarily caused by a spike in onion prices due to unseasonal rains in October- November. Excluding onions, food inflation would have been lower by 4.7 percentage points and headline inflation by 2.1 percentage points in December. In addition, inflation in several other food sub-groups such as milk, pulses, cereals, edible oils, eggs, meat and fish also firmed up.4 13. The CPI fuel group registered inflation of 0.7 per cent in December, reflecting an increase in prices of electricity and firewood and chips; and in administered prices of kerosene. Together they constitute 68 per cent of the CPI fuel basket. LPG inflation remained in negative territory despite a sharp recovery in prices in November-December. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel rose from a low of 3.4 per cent in October to 3.8 per cent by December 2019, driven by an increase in inflation in mobile phone charges, petrol, diesel, transportation fares and clothing. Housing inflation moderated further in December reflecting subdued demand. Households' inflation expectations eased in the January 2020 round of the Reserve Bank's survey  after a sharp pick-up in the previous round  with the 3-month ahead and 1- year ahead inflation expectations falling by 60 basis points (bps) and 70 bps, respectively. Based on the Reserve Bank's consumer confidence survey, consumer spending on non- essential items of consumption contracted from a year ago; however, overall spending is expected to rise, going forward, reflecting an increase in prices. The December 2019 round of the Reserve Bank's industrial outlook survey suggests that the input and output prices of manufacturing firms remained subdued in Q3:2019-20 and are likely to remain so in Q4. Overall liquidity in the system remained in surplus in December 2019 and January 2020. Average daily net absorption under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) amounted to 2.61 lakh crore in December 2019. In January 2020, the average daily net absorption of surplus liquidity soared to 3.18 lakh crore. The Reserve Bank conducted four auctions involving the simultaneous purchase of long-term and sale of short-term government securities under open market operations (OMOs) for a notified amount of 10,000 crore each during December and January (December 23 and 30, 2019 and January 6 and 23, 2020). Reflecting these operations, the 10-year G-sec yield softened cumulatively by 15 bps between December 19, 2019 and January 31, 2020. During the intervening period, however, the yields fell by as much as 25 bps. The weighted average call rate (WACR) traded below the policy repo rate (on an average) by 10 bps in December and by 19 bps in January on easy liquidity conditions. Monetary transmission across various money market segments and the private corporate bond market has been sizable. As against the cumulative reduction in the policy repo rate by 135 bps since February 2019, transmission to various money and corporate debt market segments up to January 31, 2020 ranged from 146 bps (overnight call money market) to 190 bps (3-month CPs of non-banking finance companies). Transmission through the longer end of government securities market was at 73 bps (5-year government securities) and 76 bps (10-year government securities). Transmission to the credit market is gradually improving. The 1-year median marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) declined by 55 bps during February 2019 and January 2020. The weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans sanctioned by banks declined by 69 bps and the WALR on outstanding rupee loans by 13 bps during February-December 2019. After the introduction of the external benchmark system, most banks have linked their lending rates for housing, personal and micro and small enterprises (MSEs) to the policy repo rate of the Reserve Bank. During October-December 2019, the WALRs of domestic (public5 and private sector) banks on fresh rupee loans declined by 18 bps for housing loans, 87 bps for vehicle loans and 23 bps for loans to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). Export growth continued to contract in November-December 2019, reflecting the slowdown in global trade. Import growth slumped in November-December 2019, with contraction in both oil and non-oil non-gold imports. While the latter reflected the underlying weakness in domestic demand and was spread across categories such as transport equipment, coal, iron and steel and chemicals, outgoes on account of oil imports were lower due to a cut back in oil import volume. Gold imports also declined in December 2019. On the financing side, net foreign direct investment rose to US$ 24.4 billion in April-November 2019 from US$ 21.2 billion a year ago. Net foreign portfolio investment was of the order of US$ 8.6 billion in 2019-20 (up to February 4) as against net outflows of US$ 14.2 billion in the same period last year. In addition, net investments by FPIs under the voluntary retention route have aggregated US$ 7.8 billion since March 11, 2019. External commercial borrowings were higher at US$ 13.4 billion during April-December 2019 as compared with US$ 2.5 billion during the same period a year ago. India's foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 471.4 billion on February 4, 2020  an increase of US$ 58.5 billion over end-March 2019. Outlook 20. In the fifth bi-monthly resolution of December 2019. CPI inflation was projected at 5.1-4.7 per cent for H2:2019-20 and 4.0-3.8 per cent for H1:2020-21, with risks broadly balanced. The actual inflation outcome for Q2 at 5.8 per cent overshot projections by 70 bps, primarily due to the intensification of the onion price shock in December 2019 on account of unseasonal rains in October-November. Going forward, the inflation outlook is likely to be influenced by several factors. First, food inflation is likely to soften from the high levels of December and the decline is expected to become more pronounced during Q4:2019-20 as onion prices fall rapidly in response to arrivals of late kharif and rabi harvests. Higher vegetables production, despite the early loss due to unseasonal rain, is also likely to have a salutary impact on food inflation. On the other hand, the recent pick-up in prices of non-vegetable food items, specifically in milk due to a rise in input costs, and in pulses due to a shortfall in kharif production, are all likely to sustain. These factors could impart some upward bias to overall food prices. Second, crude prices are likely to remain volatile due to unabating geo-political tensions in the Middle East on the one hand, and the uncertain global economic outlook on the other. Third, there has been an increase in input costs for services, in recent months. However, subdued demand conditions, muted pricing power of corporates and the correction in energy prices since the last week of January may limit the pass-through to selling prices. Fourth, domestic financial markets remain volatile reflecting both global and domestic factors, which may have an influence on the inflation outlook. Fifth, base effects would turn favourable during Q3:2020-21. Sixth, the increase in customs duties on items of retail consumption in the budget may result in only a marginal one-time uptick in inflation. Taking into consideration these factors, and under the assumption of a normal south west monsoon in 2020-21, the CPI inflation projection is revised upwards to 6.5 per cent for Q4:2019-20; 5.4-5.0 per cent for H1:2020-21; and 3.2 per cent for Q3:2020-21, with risks broadly balanced (Chart 1).6 22. Turning to the growth outlook, real GDP growth for 2019-20 was projected in the December 2019 policy at 5.0 per cent  4.9-5.5 per cent in H2. GDP growth for H1:2020-21 was projected at 5.9-6.3 per cent. For 2020-21, the growth outlook will be influenced by several factors. First, private consumption, particularly in rural areas, is expected to recover on the back of improved rabi prospects. The recent rise in food prices has shifted the terms of trade in favour of agriculture, which will support rural incomes. Second, the easing of global trade uncertainties should encourage exports and spur investment activity. The breakout of the coronavirus may, however, impact tourist arrivals and global trade. Third, monetary transmission in terms of a reduction in lending rates and financial flows to the commercial sector has progressed vis-à-vis the last policy, and this could spur both consumption and investment demand. Fourth, the rationalisation of personal income tax rates in the Union Budget 2020-21 should support domestic demand along with measures to boost rural and infrastructure spending. Taking into consideration the above factors. GDP growth for 2020-21 is projected at 6.0 per cent  in the range of 5.5-6.0 per cent in H1 and 6.2 per cent in Q3 (Chart 2). The MPC notes that inflation has surged above the upper tolerance band around the target in December 2019, primarily on the back of the unusual spike in onion prices. Over the coming weeks and months, onion prices are likely to ebb as supply conditions improve. The salutary effects on headline inflation are, however, likely to be tempered by hardening of prices of other food items, notably those of pulses and proteins. Meanwhile adjustments to telecom charges are imparting cost-push pressures to CPI inflation excluding food and fuel. Going forward, the trajectory of inflation excluding food and fuel needs to be carefully monitored as the pass-through of remaining revisions in mobile phone charges, the increase in prices of drugs and pharmaceuticals and the impact of new emission norms play out and feed into inflation formation. The MPC anticipates that the combination of these factors may keep headline inflation elevated in the short-run, at least through H1:2020-21. Overall, the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain. Accordingly, the MPC will remain vigilant about the7 potential generalisation of inflationary pressures as several of the underlying factors cited earlier appear to be operating in concert. At the same time, the MPC observes that the economy continues to be weak and the output gap remains negative. While some high-frequency indicators have turned around and point to a lift in the momentum of economic activity, there is a need to await incoming data to gauge their sustainability. Financial flows to the commercial sector have improved in recent months. The Union Budget 2020-21 has introduced several measures to provide an impetus to growth. While the emphasis on boosting the rural economy and infrastructure should help the growth momentum in the near-term, the corporate tax rate cuts of September 2019 should help boost the growth potential over the medium-term. The fiscal deficit of the Central Government for 2019-20 is placed at 3.8 per cent of GDP in the revised estimates as against 3.3 per cent of GDP in the budget estimates. The higher fiscal deficit in 2019-20 has not resulted in an increase in market borrowings compared to the budget estimates. The fiscal deficit is budgeted to decline to 3.5 per cent of GDP for 2020-21. Fresh gross market borrowings are budgeted to increase by 70,000 crore to 7.8 lakh crore in 2020-21 from 7.1 lakh crore in 2019-20. The MPC notes that while there is a need for adjustment in interest rates on small saving schemes, the external benchmark system introduced from October 1, 2019 has strengthened monetary transmission. These developments should amplify the effects of the cumulative policy rate reductions undertaken by the Reserve Bank since February 2019 and pull up domestic demand going forward. The MPC recognises that there is policy space available for future action. The path of inflation is, however, elevated and on a rising trajectory through Q4:2019-20. The outlook for inflation is highly uncertain at this juncture. On the other hand, economic activity remains subdued and the few indicators that have moved up recently are yet to gain traction in a more broad-based manner. Given the evolving growth-inflation dynamics, the MPC felt it appropriate to maintain status quo. Accordingly, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged and persevere with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive growth, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target. Dr.Chetan Ghate. Dr.Pami Dua. Dr.Ravindra H. Dholakia. Dr.Janak Raj. Dr. Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted in favour of the decision. The minutes of the MPC's meeting will be published by February 20, 2020. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during March 31. April 1 and 3, 2020.

Romania,2020-02-07,"In its meeting of 7 February 2020, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided the following:. The annual CPI inflation rate went up in December 2019 to 4.0 percent from 3.8 percent in November, i.e. above the variation band of the flat target and slightly higher than the forecast. The rise versus end-Q3, when it dropped to 3.5 percent, owes mainly to the faster dynamics of fuel prices, inter alia amid a base effect, but also to the notable hike in fruit prices, as well as to the acceleration in core inflation. The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate (which excludes from the CPI inflation administered prices, volatile prices, and tobacco product and alcoholic beverage prices) continued to increase in December to a higher-than-forecasted level, reaching 3.7 percent from 3.5 percent in November and 3.4 percent in September. The advance reflected almost entirely the trend seen on the food segment, affected by the rise in some international agri-food prices, which overlapped with the significant inflationary pressures from demand and unit labour costs. In December, the average annual CPI inflation rate remained at the 3.8 percent level reported in November; calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, the average annual rate picked up to 3.9 percent from 3.8 percent in October and November. The new statistical data reconfirm the deceleration in the annual pace of economic growth to 3 percent in 2019 Q3 from 4.4 percent in the previous quarter. On the demand side, the contribution of household consumption posted a stronger decline to 2.6 percentage points compared to the previous estimate (3 percentage points) from 3.8 percentage points in Q2, whereas the contribution of gross fixed capital formation to GDP growth widened according to the revised data to 6.3 percentage points (compared to 5.9 percentage points from 3.9 percentage points in Q2). Conversely, net exports saw their negative contribution to GDP dynamics rise, given the more pronounced reacceleration in the growth of imports relative to that of exports of goods and services. The latest statistical data point to mixed developments for consumption, investment and production October through November: on the one hand, a further robust advance in retail sales and a faster annual growth rate of services to households, as well as a further swift rise in the volume of construction works, albeit mildly slower, and on the other hand, a larger contraction in industrial production and falling new orders in manufacturing. Moreover, the most recent balance-of-payments data highlight the slower year-on-year worsening of the trade balance in October-November versus Q3, in the context of a sharper decline in the growth rate of imports compared to that of exports of goods and services. The current account deficit continued to widen, on the back of the deterioration of the primary and secondary income balances, while its coverage by foreign direct investment and capital transfers continued to narrow. The annual growth rate of credit to the private sector slowed somewhat more visibly in December, to 6.6 percent from 7.2 percent in November, its average for Q4 overall declining to 7.1 percent versus 7.9 percent in Q3. With the advance in the leu-denominated component moderating only slightly and the foreign currency component posting a larger contraction, the share of domestic currency loans in total private sector credit widened further, hitting a post-May 1996 high of 67.6 percent in December. In today's meeting, the NBR Board examined and approved the February 2020 Inflation Report, which incorporates the most recent data and information available. The new forecast broadly reconfirms the coordinates of the previous medium-term projection. Thus, the annual inflation rate is expected to decline significantly in the early months of 2020 and stay in the upper half of the variation band of the target until the end of the forecast horizon, on a trajectory resuming a slightly upward movement in the latter part of this year. Heightened uncertainties and risks surrounding the inflation outlook stem from the future fiscal and income policy stance, especially given the 2020 election calendar, while the level and trend of the current account deficit and of the fiscal deficit are particularly concerning. Rising uncertainties are also generated by the low dynamics of the euro area and global economies, as well as by the growing risks to their outlook, inter alia amid the coronavirus outbreak. Further relevant are also the ECB's and the Fed's monetary policy decisions, as well as the stance of central banks in the region. In today's meeting, based on the currently available data and assessments, the NBR Board decided to keep the monetary policy rate at 2.50 percent per annum, while maintaining strict control over money market liquidity. Moreover, the NBR Board decided to leave unchanged the deposit facility rate at 1.50 percent per annum and the lending (Lombard) facility rate at 3.50 percent per annum. Given the developments in foreign currency lending and the adequate level of forex reserves, the NBR Board decided to cut the minimum reserve requirement ratio on foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions to 6 percent from 8 percent starting with the 24 February  23 March 2020 maintenance period. The measure also aims to continue the harmonisation of the minimum reserve requirements mechanism with the relevant standards and practices of the European Central Bank and the major central banks across the European Union. The minimum reserve requirement ratio on leu-denominated liabilities remains unchanged at 8 percent. The NBR Board's decisions aim to ensure and preserve price stability over the medium term in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth and amid safeguarding financial stability. The NBR Board underlines that the balanced macroeconomic policy mix and the implementation of structural reforms designed to foster the growth potential over the long term are of the essence in preserving a stable macroeconomic framework and strengthening the capacity of the Romanian economy to withstand potential adverse developments. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be presented to the public in a press conference on 11 February 2020, at 11:00 a.m. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR's website on 14 February 2020, at 3:00 p.m. The next monetary policy meeting of the NBR Board is scheduled for 3 April 2020."
Russia,2020-02-07,"On 7 February 2020, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to cut the key rate by 25 bp to 6.00% per annum. Inflation slowdown is overshooting the forecast. Households' inflation expectations and price expectations of businesses remain stable overall. In 2019 H2, the growth rate of the Russian economy picked up. Risks of a substantial global economic slowdown persist. Disinflationary risks still exceed pro-inflationary risks over the short-term horizon. In this context, given the monetary policy stance, annual inflation will come in at 3.54.0% in 2020 and will remain close to 4% further on. If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia holds open the prospect of further key rate reduction at its upcoming meetings. In its key rate decision-making, the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic developments over the forecast horizon, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. Inflation dynamics. Inflation slowdown is overshooting the forecast. The annual consumer price growth rate declined to 2.4% in January (from 3.0% in December 2019) as a result of both factoring out the effect of the VAT rate hike and moderate price growth in January. January results show that annual core inflation decreased to 2.7% as compared to 3.1% in December. According to the Bank of Russia's estimates, inflation indicators reflecting the most sustainable price movements are close to or below 3%. In January, disinflationary factors continued to exert considerable influence on inflation. Annual growth in prices of food products and non-food goods continued to decline. Expanded supply in individual food market segments helps maintain low monthly (seasonally adjusted) and annual growth rates of food prices. The 2019 ruble appreciation alongside with inflation slowdown in Russia's trading partners limits growth of import prices. Subdued demand continues to influence inflation, including external demand. In January, households' inflation expectations somewhat abated, while remaining elevated. Business price expectations remain stable. Annual inflation slowdown paves the way for a future decline in inflation expectations of households and businesses. In accordance with the Bank of Russia forecast, given the monetary policy stance, annual inflation will come in at 3.54.0% in 2020 and will remain close to 4% further on. Monetary conditions. Monetary conditions have continued to ease. OFZ yields and deposit and lending rates continued to decline. The Bank of Russia's decisions to cut the key rate and the decline in OFZ yields create conditions for a further reduction in deposit and lending rates; this will support the expansion of corporate and mortgage lending. At the same time, consumer lending gradually slows down, which is to a large extent driven by the tightening of non-price conditions under the influence of the Bank of Russia's macroprudential measures. The Bank of Russia will assess the effect of the adopted key rate decisions on monetary conditions and inflation movements. Economic activity. Rosstat's flash estimate shows that 2019 GDP growth totalled 1.3%, which corresponds to the upper bound of the Bank of Russia's forecast of 0.81.3%. The dynamics of final consumption expenditure made a major contribution to GDP growth in 2019. The decline in export quantities in turn exerted considerable negative influence on GDP dynamics. In Q4, economic activity indicators mainly continued to improve. At end—2019, investment activity was supported by an accelerated increase in capital budget expenditure, including owing to the implementation of national projects. Annual retail trade turnover and industrial production continued to grow. However, leading indicators point to a still weak business sentiment in industrial sector, which is mostly specific of export orders. Economic activity continues to be constrained by weakening external demand for Russian exports on the back of a global economic slowdown. The labour market creates no additional inflationary pressure. The fact that unemployment remains near historic lows is not driven by expanding labour demand but rather by a simultaneously contracting number of employees and the labour force. The Bank of Russia has left the 20202022 GDP growth forecast unchanged. The GDP growth rate will gradually increase from 1.52.0% in 2020 to 23% in 2022. This will be possible should the Government's measures for overcoming structural constraints, including the implementation of national projects, be realised. However, reduced global economic growth expected over the forecast horizon will continue to exert a constraining impact on growth of the Russian economy. Inflation risks. Disinflationary risks still exceed pro-inflationary risks over the short-term horizon. This is primarily related to the state of domestic and external demand. Disinflationary risks associated with movements in the prices of certain food products persist, including on the back of a rising supply. The 2019 ruble appreciation may continue to influence price growth. The reaction of both consumer and investment demand of the private sector to the easing of monetary conditions and accommodative fiscal measures may be limited by the moderate sentiment of consumers and businesses. Meanwhile, pro-inflationary factors should be taken into consideration. Risks that food market trends may reverse cannot be ruled out, given that the ratio of temporary and permanent factors for this market is hard to estimate. At the same time, the monetary policy easing that has already been undertaken may have a stronger upward effect on inflation than the Bank of Russia estimates. Risks associated with trade disputes have somewhat abated. Nonetheless, the risk of a further slowdown in global economic growth persists, including under the influence of geopolitical factors, intensified volatility in global commodity and financial markets, which may affect the exchange rate and inflation expectations. The coronavirus situation will be an additional uncertainty factor over next quarters. According to Bank of Russia estimates, the implementation of additional social measures announced in January will not have a considerable pro-inflationary impact. At the same time in 2020, inflation dynamics will be shaped by the schedule of budget expenditure. A number of internal conditions continue to pose pro-inflationary risks over a longer-term horizon. Significant risks are posed by elevated and unanchored inflation expectations. The mid-term inflation dynamics may also be affected by fiscal policy parameters, including decisions on the investment of the liquid part of the National Wealth Fund in excess of the threshold level set at 7% of GDP. The Bank of Russia leaves mostly unchanged its estimates of risks associated with wage movements and possible changes in consumer behaviour. These risks remain moderate. If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia holds open the prospect of further key rate reduction at its upcoming meetings. In its key rate decision-making, the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic developments over the forecast horizon, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. In the follow-up to the Board of Directors meeting of 7 February 2020 the Bank of Russia released its medium-term forecast. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next key rate review meeting on 20 March 2020. The press release on the Bank of Russia Board decision is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time. The reference to the Press Service is mandatory if you intend to use this material."
Mexico,2020-02-13,"Economic activity in Mexico has remained stagnant for several quarters, with a generalized weakness in aggregate demand components. Thus, slack conditions have continued to widen. Based on most recent data. GDP in 2020 is foreseen to grow less than estimated in the Quarterly Report July-September 2019, with a balance of risks biased to the downside. Between November 2019 and January 2020 annual headline inflation rose from 2.97% to 3.24%, mainly due to the increase in the non-core component from 0.98% to 1.81%, while core inflation did so from 3.65% to 3.73%. Core inflation was affected by the increase in the prices subject to the excise tax (IEPS, for its acronym in Spanish) and continues to show resistance to decline. Short-, medium- and long-term headline inflation expectations have remained relatively stable, albeit at levels above 3%, while core inflation expectations for the same terms were revised upwards. In light of the recent behavior of the factors affecting the foreseen path of inflation, headline and core inflation are expected to be moderately above the forecasts published in the last Quarterly Report. Regarding risks to the foreseen trajectory for inflation, those prevailing to the upside include: core inflation's resistance to decline; wage increases affecting the labor market and prices; a possible exchange rate adjustment due to external or domestic factors; increases in agricultural and livestock prices greater than expected; and a deterioration of public finances. As for downside risks: a further appreciation of the peso exchange rate; lower international prices of energy goods due to the coronavirus outbreak; and a greater economic slack. In this context, uncertainty still persists regarding the balance of risks for the referred trajectory of inflation. With the presence of all its members. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board decided unanimously to lower the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to 7%. To this end, the current levels of headline inflation, the inflation outlook within the time frame in which monetary policy operates, the greater amount of economic slack, and the recent behavior of external and domestic yield curves, were considered. The Governing Board will take the necessary actions based on incoming data so that the policy rate is consistent with the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to Banco de Mexico's target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates. To strengthen the macroeconomic framework and the country´s growth capacity, in addition to a prudent monetary policy, public finances must be consolidated in a sustainable way."
Peru,2020-02-13,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT FEBRUARY 2020 BCRP MAINTAINED REFERENCE RATE AT 2.25% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to maintain the reference at 2.25 percent, in light of the following developments: Year-on-year inflation is expected to be around 2.0 percent over the forecast horizon, with a moderate downside bias due to the possibility of a lower-than expected increase in domestic demand. Monthly inflation was 0.05 percent in January, consequently, year-on-year inflation remained at 1,9 percent in January 2020. With monthly inflation excluding food and energy at 0.07 percent in January, the year-on-year figure also remained at 2.3 percent. One-year ahead expected inflation as of January decresed from 2.23 to to 2.05 percent. The weak performance of primary industries and public investment in 2019 was attenuated by the activity in non-primary industries. Public investment improved in January and economic activity indicators point to a gradual closure of the output gap, while business conditions expectations improved respect to December. Global growth risks from trade tensions have attenuated, although the impact of the coronavirus is still uncertain. The BCRP Board pays close attention to new information on inflation and its determinants in assessing future changes in the monetary policy stance. The Board also decided to maintain the interest rates on BCRP off-auction credit and deposit operations in domestic currency with financial entities. Overnight deposits: 1.00 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 2.80 percent per year for financial entities' first 10 operations over the last 12 months; and the rate fixed by the BCRP Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations Committee for operations other than financial entities' first 10 operations over the last 12 months. Dollar swaps: a fee equal to a minimum annual effective cost of 2.80 percent. The BCRP Board's next monetary policy session will take place on March 12, 2020."
Turkiye,2020-02-19,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to reduce the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) from 11.25 percent to 10.75 percent. Recent data indicate that recovery in economic activity continues. Sectoral diffusion of economic activity continues to improve. Despite signs of recovery, investment and employment remain weak. While favorable effects of improved competitiveness prevail, weakening global economic outlook tempers external demand. As the contribution of net exports to economic growth declines, economic recovery is expected to be sustained with the help of the ongoing disinflation process and improvement in financial conditions. Nevertheless, developments in credit growth and its composition are closely monitored for their impact on external balance and inflation. Going forward, sustaining a moderate course in current account balance, which has recently recorded significant improvement, is considered as a crucial element of the macroeconomic policy mix. Weakness in global economic activity and low levels of global inflation strengthen expectations regarding the continuation of expansionary monetary policies in advanced economies. On the other hand, recently elevated uncertainties regarding global economic outlook lead to volatility in the demand for emerging market assets and the risk appetite. Rising protectionism, uncertainty regarding global economic policies, geopolitical developments and the recent outbreak of an epidemic disease are closely monitored for their impact on capital flows, international trade and commodity prices. Developments in inflation expectations, domestic demand conditions and producer prices have contributed to a mild trend in core inflation indicators. The improvement in macroeconomic indicators, inflation in particular, supports the fall in country risk premium and helps contain cost pressures. The course of inflation is considered to be broadly in line with the year-end inflation projection. Accordingly, considering all factors affecting the inflation outlook, the Committee decided to make a more measured cut in the policy rate. At this point, the current monetary policy stance remains consistent with the projected disinflation path. The Committee assesses that maintaining a sustained disinflation process is a key factor for achieving lower sovereign risk, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery. Keeping the disinflation process in track with the targeted path requires the continuation of a cautious monetary stance. In this respect, monetary stance will be determined by considering the indicators of the underlying inflation trend to ensure the continuation of the disinflation process. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability and financial stability objectives. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Egypt,2020-02-20,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release February 20, 2020 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 1225 percent, 1325 percent, and 1275 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 1275 percen. Annual headline urban inflation recorded 72 percent in January 2020 compared to 71 percent in December 2019, as monthly inflation recorded 07 percent in January 2020 compared to 06 percent in January 201. Monthly headline inflation in January 2020 was mainly driven by higher food prices as well as by higher non-food prices but with a lesser exten. Meanwhile annual core inflation increased to 27 percent in January 2020 compared to 24 percent in December 201. Annual inflation rates came in line with the expectations of the Central Bank of Egyp. Real GDP growth stabilized around 56 percent in 2019 H2 compared to its level in FY2018/1. Monetary policy continued to support private domestic demand, which has outpaced net exports as the main driver of economic activity in the first three quarters of 2019, driven by the acceleration in private investment growt. While the expansion of global economic activity stabilized, financial conditions and uncertainty regarding trade policies eased somewha. However disruptions to global economic activity following the recent coronavirus outbreak could weigh on the global economic outlook, at least in the near ter. Meanwhile international oil prices declined due to lower demand, yet remain subject to volatility due to potential supply-side factors that include geopolitical risk. Regarding the labor market, the unemployment rate recorded 80 percent in 2019 Q4 compared to 78 percent and 75 percent in 2019 Q3 and Q2, respectivel. Nevertheless employment continued to recover on a quarterly basis for the fourth consecutive quarte. Against this background, and following the cumulative reduction of 350 basis points during the second half of 2019, the MPC decided that keeping key policy rates unchanged remains consistent with achieving the inflation target of 9 percent (±3 percentage points) in 2020 Q4 and supporting the disinflation path over the medium-ter. The MPC closely monitors all economic developments and will not hesitate to resume its easing cycle subject to further moderation of inflationary pressure.

Israel,2020-02-24,"The inflation environment continues to be low. The January CPI was lower than expected, and inflation over the past 12 months remains 0.3 percent. Inflation excluding energy and fruits and vegetables also remains low. The moderation of inflation is largely influenced by the appreciation of the shekel. It is possible that in the coming months, the year over year inflation rate will be negative, but it is expected to move back toward the lower bound of the target range in the second half of the year. Since the previous interest rate decision, the shekel has strengthened by approximately 3 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, a development that continues to weigh on the return of inflation to the target range. The economy continues to grow at around its long-term growth rate. According to the Research Department's assessment, the growth rate in the fourth quarter, netof the volatility in vehicle imports, was about 3.5 percent, and the growth encompassed virtually all sectors. Indicators of economic activity in January point to continued growth, and the labor market remains tight. The interim budgetis expected to have a markedly contractionary effect in the first half of 2020, and there is continuing uncertainty regarding budgetary policy after the elections. The most recent data published regarding global economic activity indicate low growth in Europe and negative growth in Japan, while the US continues to exhibit positive growth. Global growth forecasts for 2020 were revised slightly downward, and the slowdown in world trade continues. The outbreak of the coronavirus in China is casting uncertainty regarding future economic activity globally and in Israel, and regarding the impact on inflation and on the financial markets. The baseline scenario guiding the assessments of most international financial institutions is that the spread of the virus will be halted in the coming months, and the overall impact on the global economy is expected to be limited. The Bank of Israel's assessment in this scenario is that no significant macroeconomic impact is expected in Israel. If the crisis persists and spills over into additional countries, and particularly if strict preventative measures are required in Israel, it is expected to have a more significant impact. In such a scenario, the Monetary Committee has a range of tools to make monetary policy more accommodative. The Monetary Committee's assessment is that in view of the inflation environment in Israel, the monetary policies of major central banks, developments in the global economy and the risks to the domestic economy, and the development of the exchange rate, it will be necessary to leave the interest rate at its current level for a prolonged period or to reduce it in order to support a process at the end of which inflation will stabilize around the midpoint of the target range, and so that the economy will continue to grow strongly. Furthermore, the Committee is taking additional steps to make monetary policy more accommodative. The Bank of Israel continues to monitor developments in inflation, the real economy, fiscal policy, the financial markets, and the global economy, and will act to attain the monetary policy targets in accordance with such developments. For the file of figures accompanying this notice, clickhere. The CPI reading for January declined by 0.4 percent, a greater decline than expected, and year over year inflation remained below the target range. In the past 12 months, the inflation rate was 0.3 percent (Figure 1 in the attached file of figures), and inflation excluding energy and fruit and vegetables stabilized at a low level, which indicates a low basic inflation rate (Figure 2). The moderation of inflation does not reflect weakness in demand, and is largely influenced by the appreciation of the shekel. Inflation of nontradable goods prices remained moderate, and inflation in the prices of tradable goods remained negative. Inflation is expected to remain low in the coming months, and may even become negative, but it is expected to move back toward the lower bound of the target range in the second half of the year. Most one-year forecasts and expectations remain around the lower bound of the target range or slightly below it (Figure 4). Medium-and long-term forward inflation expectations derived from the capital market continue to be largely stable since the previous interest rate decision (Figure 5). An analysis of the risk premium in 5-10-year expectations shows that excluding the premium,inflation is expected to be above 2 percent in this range. Since the previous interest rate decision, the shekel has strengthened by about 3 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate (Figure 6), a development that continues to make it difficult to return inflation to the target range. The economy continued to grow at a stable pace around the long-term growth rate. According to the first estimate of National Accounts data for the fourth quarter. GDP grew by 4.8 percent (Figure 11), while according to an assessment by the Bank of Israel's Research Department, the growth rate net of volatility in vehicle imports was about 3.5 percent. The growth encompassed virtually all sectors. Exports (excluding diamonds and startups) grew by 5 percent, driven by services exports, but the prolonged weakness in goods exports continues. Investment grew by 5.9 percent, while investment in residential construction again contracted (Figure 12). The Business Tendency Survey (Figure 13) and the Composite State of the Economy Index (Figure 14) for January point to continued solid growth at the beginning of 2020. The labor market remains tight: The unemployment rate remained low, while the employment and participation rates increased (Figure 17). Wage increases continue, but their rate of growth slowed somewhat (Figure 19). The interim budget is expected to have a markedly contractionary effect in the first half of 2020, and uncertainty remains regarding budgetary policy following the elections and its implications for economic activity and inflation. For most of the period since the previous interest rate decision, equity markets in Israel were relatively stable, but in recent days, there have been sharp price declines. Long-term government bond yields declined since the previous interest rate decision, similar to declines in yields in Europe and the US, and the declines have grown stronger in recent days (Figure 7). Home prices increased in the past year by about 3 percent. The number of home purchases grew, led by first-home purchasers and buyers upgrading their housing situation. Mortgage volume continued to expand, with some increase in leverage levels, and mortgage interest rates continued to decline. The most recent data published regarding global economic activity indicate low growth in Europe and negative growth in Japan, while the US economy continues to exhibit positive growth. Investment houses' global growth forecast for 2020 were revised slightly downward, while the revision for growth in China is more significant (Figure 20). The slowdown in world trade continues (Figure 21), but the political risks have moderated in view of the signing of the first stage of the trade agreement between the US and China, and the decline in uncertainty surrounding the progress of the Brexit process. Headline inflation in the major economies increased, but inflation continues to be lower than the central banks' guiding targets (Figure 23). The US economy grew by 2.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019. The Federal Reserve kept the federal funds rate unchanged, and signaled that the rate is expected to remain at its current level unless there is a significant change in the state of the economy. In Europe, growth remains low, with contraction in France and Italy, and near-zero growth in Germany, and the manufacturing sector continues to weigh on activity. The ECB left its interest rate unchanged, and signaled that it expects to leave its policy in place for a considerable time. In Japan, there was significantly negative growth in the fourth quarter following a number of one-off effects, and there are signs that the slowdown will continue. Data on 2019 activity in China were positive, but the long-term trend of moderation continues, and the outbreak of the coronavirus is expected to weigh on growth in Asia at leastin the short term. Prices of oil and commodities used in manufacturing declined in view of an expectation of a significant decline in demand from China (Figure 24). The outbreak of the coronavirus in China is casting uncertainty over a range of areas: future economic activity globally and in Israel, andthe impacts on inflation and on the financial markets. The baseline scenario guiding the assessments of most international financial institutions is that the spread of the virus will be halted in the coming months, and the damage to the Chinese economy will be restricted mainly to the first quarter of 2020. In this scenario, the growth rate in later quarters is expected to compensate, so that the overall effect on the global economy will be limited. According to the Bank of Israel's assessment, beyond the impact on specific companies, this scenario is not expected to have a significant macroeconomic effect in Israel, even though China is a significant trading partner in a range of industries. If the crisis persists and flows over into other countries, and particularly if strict preventive measures will be required in Israel, it is expected to have a more significant impact, the scope of which is difficult to assess at this stage. The decline in global demandfor various goods is expected to slow the rate of inflation, but on the supply side, the shortage of goods and raw materials imported from China may serveto increase inflation somewhat. Until recently, the reaction in the financial markets was moderate, but in recent days, the uncertainty has increased and there have been sharp declines in equity markets. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on March 9, 2020. The next decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Monday. April 6, 2020, followed by a press briefing by the Governor."
South Korea,2020-02-27,"Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period. This press release is the English version of the Bank of Korea's policy statement. In the case of any inconsistency, the original version in Korean will prevail. The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Board considers that the pace of global economic growth has continued to slow with the ongoing sluggishness in trade. Volatility in global financial markets has increased. Government bond yields and stock prices have fallen in major countries and the US dollar has strengthened with the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak. Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and the global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak and developments in global trade protectionism and geopolitical risks. The Board judges that economic growth in Korea has weakened. Although the sluggishness in facilities investment has eased, consumption has contracted and exports have slowed owing to the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak while the adjustment in construction investment has continued. Employment conditions have continued to improve, with the increase in the number of persons employed having risen. GDP is forecast to grow at the lower-2% level this year, below the November projection (2.3%), and the Board judges that uncertainties regarding the future growth path are high due to the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. Consumer price inflation has risen to the mid-1% level, due largely to an upturn in the prices of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products and to the larger increase in petroleum product prices. Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) has increased to the upper-0% range, and the inflation expectations of the general public have remained at the upper-1% level. Looking ahead, it is forecast that consumer price inflation will run at the lower-1% level and then fall slightly to record around 1% during this year, and core inflation will run at the upper-0% level. Volatility in domestic financial markets has increased. Long-term market interest rates and stock prices have fallen sharply and the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has risen considerably, affected by the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak. The rate of household loan growth has risen slightly, and housing prices have increased at a relatively high rate, especially in the areas surrounding Seoul. Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As it is expected that domestic economic growth will be moderate and it is forecast that inflationary pressures on the demand side will remain at a low level, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance. In this process it will judge whether to adjust the degree of monetary policy accommodation, while thoroughly assessing the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak, its impact on the domestic economy, and changes in financial stability including household debt growth. Also, the Board will closely monitor developments in global trade disputes, the economies of major countries, and geopolitical risks."
Malaysia,2020-03-03,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to reduce the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) by 25 basis points to 2.50 percent. The ceiling and floor rates of the corridor of the OPR are correspondingly reduced to 2.75 percent and 2.25 percent, respectively. Global economic conditions have weakened in the recent period. The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has disrupted production and travel activity, especially within the region. This has also led to greater risk aversion, resulting in tighter financial conditions and a resurgence in financial market volatility. Downside risks to the global growth outlook have increased, particularly in the near term. However, a number of countries have implemented policy responses. With further anticipated policy measures, these actions are expected to mitigate the economic impact of COVID-19. The Malaysian economy grew at a moderate pace of 4.3% in 2019. Looking ahead, growth, particularly in the first quarter, will be affected by the COVID-19 outbreak primarily in the tourism-related and manufacturing sectors. The weakness in the agriculture sector is also likely to persist in the first quarter. For 2020, private and public sector activities will be supportive of growth. Household spending is expected to grow at a slower pace amid moderate employment and income growth. Investment activity is projected to record a modest recovery, underpinned by ongoing and new projects, both in the public and private sectors. The 2020 economic stimulus package will also provide some support to economic activity. Although domestic growth is expected to gradually improve in the second half of the year, there are key downside risks, mainly stemming from the evolving nature and prolonged impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, and continued weakness in commodity-related sectors. In 2020, headline inflation is expected to average higher but remain modest. The trajectory of headline inflation will be dependent on global oil and commodity price developments and the timing of the lifting of the domestic retail fuel price ceilings. Underlying inflation is expected to be more moderate, amid limited demand pressures despite the continued expansion in economic activity. The reduction in the OPR is intended to provide a more accommodative monetary environment to support the projected improvement in economic growth amid price stability. The MPC will continue to monitor and assess the balance of risks surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation. Bank Negara Malaysia 03 March 2020."
United States,2020-03-03,"EST March 3, 2020 The fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong. However, the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity.

Poland,2020-03-04,"Warsaw, 4 March 2020 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 3-4 March 2020 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: ▪ reference rate at 1.50%; ▪ lombard rate at 2.50%; ▪ deposit rate at 0.50%; ▪ rediscount rate at 1.75%. Incoming data from the global economy indicate a stabilisation of economic growth at a relatively low level. In the euro area, economic growth declined in 2019 Q4, amid the ongoing downturn in industry. In contrast, in the United States GDP growth remained stable in this period, despite the subdued activity in industry. In China. GDP growth stabilised in 2019 Q4 at a lower level than in previous years, and economic activity growth weakened markedly at the beginning of 2020. Due to the spread of coronavirus, uncertainty about the global economic outlook has increased and sentiment in the financial markets deteriorated recently. Global oil prices have fallen considerably. In turn, the prices of many food commodities remain high. As a result, inflation in the global economy, including the external environment of the Polish economy, has risen in the past few months. The US Federal Reserve lowered interest rates in March 2020.The European Central Bank is keeping the deposit rate below zero, while conducting asset purchases and signalling the maintenance of loose monetary policy in the coming quarters. In Poland, economic conditions remain good despite a slowdown in economic growth. In 2019 Q4, real GDP growth stood at 3.2%. GDP growth was supported by the steady consumption growth, albeit slightly slower than before, fuelled by favourable labour market conditions, strong consumer confidence and social benefit payments. At the same time, investment continued to rise and the contribution of net exports to GDP growth remained positive. According to the preliminary GUS data, inflation rose to 4.4% y/y in January 2020. The rise in inflation above the upper bound for deviations from the inflation target was driven by regulatory and supply-side factors that remain beyond the influence of domestic monetary policy. These comprised, in particular, higher electricity prices, higher fuel prices, an increase in waste disposal charges and in the excise tax on alcohol and tobacco, as well as a further rise in the prices of unprocessed food. The favourable financial situation of households and the resulting rise in consumption demand also put an upward pressure on price growth. The Council became acquainted with the results of the March projection of inflation and GDP, prepared under the assumption of unchanged NBP interest rates. The March projection takes into account data and information published up to 18 February 2020. In line with the March projection based on the NECMOD model, there is a 50% probability that inflation will be in the range of 3.1-4.2% in 2020 (compared to 2.1-3.6% in the November 2019 projection), 1.7-3.6% in 2021 (against 1.6-3.6%) and 1.3-3.4% in 2022. At the same time, the annual GDP growth  according to this projection  will be with a 50% probability in the range of 2.5-3.9% in 2020 (compared to 2.7-4.4% in the November 2019 projection), 2.1-3.9% in 2021 (against 2.3-4.2%) and 1.8-3.7% in 2022. In the Council's assessment, the outlook for economic conditions in Poland remains favourable, yet GDP growth in the coming quarters will probably be weaker than in the previous years. In the recent period, however, uncertainty about the scale and persistence of the economic slowdown abroad and its impact on domestic economic activity has increased. In the coming quarters, the annual inflation may remain above the upper bound for deviations from the inflation target due to supply-side and regulatory factors, i.e. ones remaining beyond the direct influence of domestic monetary policy. As the impact of these factors fades and GDP growth weakens, inflation will gradually decrease. In the monetary policy transmission horizon inflation will be close to the target. Such an assessment is supported by the results of the March projection of inflation and GDP. The Council judges that the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability, while at the same time enabling to meet the inflation target in the medium term. The Council adopted the Inflation Report  March 2020."
Kazakhstan,2020-03-10,"Press release 7 The base rate raised to 12.0% March 10, 2020 Almaty The National Bank of Kazakhstan has made an unplanned decision regarding the base rate due to the need to maintain the price stability in the context of the negative affect of risks from the external sector. From March 10, 2020 the base rate is set at the level of 12% per annum with the expansion of the corridor to +/- 1.5p.p. Consequently, the rate for the liquidity provision standing facilities amounts to 13.5% and for the liquidity withdrawal standing facilities  10.5%. The decision on increasing the base rate was made as the response to the sharp change of the situation in the world economy. Significant geographical expansion of coronavirus COVID-19 has become the main factor of deterioration of the economic development prospects of countries  main consumers of Kazakhstan's export such as China and European Union. On March 9, 2020 Brent oil price decreased dramatically due to the disagreement of the participants of OPEC+ meeting on the terms of cutting the oil production. Its price situated in the range of 31-36.5 US dollars per barrel with the maximum decrease by more than 30% throughout the day. The monetary policy of the NBK, implemented in the framework of inflation targeting, is aimed to prevent the transmission of the external shock to the national economy and to ensure the macroeconomic stability and the protection of tenge assets. The NBK remains committed to the free floating exchange rate regime of the national currency. For the purpose of ensuring the stability of the financial market. FX interventions will take place if necessary. The NBK continuously monitors the situation in the domestic money and FX market segments, as well as in the world commodity markets. Should the need arise, the NBK will take additional measures to ensure the financial stability. The next decision of the NBK on the base rate will be announced on March 16, 2020 at 15:00 Nur-Sultan time."
Mongolia,2020-03-11,"MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Lowering the policy rate, setting the reserve requirements on liabilities in togrog and the interest rate corridor Number: 2020/01 Date: 11th of March 2020 The Monetary Policy Committee meeting was held on the 11th of March 2020. The Committee decided to lower the policy rate by 1 percentage point to 10 percent, lowering the reserve requirement on banks' liabilities in togrog by 2 percentage points to 8.5 percent, and changing the range of interest rate corridor to be +1, -1 percentage points from the policy rate. Annual headline inflation reached 5.6 percent nationwide and 6.0 percent in Ulaanbaatar city as of January 2020. The demand induced inflation is expected to be moderate in line with resuming downward trend in economic growth. However, supply-driven volatility in inflation could arise if supplies of some imported foods are hindered. The increased uncertainties regarding the spread of Covid-19 have emerged the risk of aggravating the slowdown in economic growth due to weaker external demand, lower commodity prices, and sluggish external and domestic economic activities. Furthermore, the impact of Covid- 19 on the economy would depend on the scale of the virus' spread, length of containment period, and policy measures to prevent the spread of the virus. While the possibility of weaker export revenue looms, a continued decline in the consumer imports and a sharp fall in oil price at the global market would reduce the depreciation pressure on the exchange rate. The Monetary Policy Committee decided to take the above mentioned comprehensive policy measures to relieve financing costs of banks, to support financial intermediation, and to stimulate economic growth by considering the current macroeconomic and financial outlook and its prospects, main driving factors, and uncertainties and risks in the domestic and external environment. The decision is aimed to ensure economic and financial stability while keeping the inflation rate around the target rate. Extracts of the meeting minutes will be released in two weeks on the Bank of Mongolia's official website. MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE."
Peru,2020-03-12,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT MARCH 2020 BCRP MAINTAINED REFERENCE RATE AT 2.25% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to maintain the reference at 2.25 percent, in light of the following developments: Year-on-year inflation is expected to be around 2.0 percent over the forecast horizon, with a downside bias due to a lower increase in domestic demand. Monthly inflation was 0.14 percent in February, consequently, year-on-year inflation remained at 1,9 percent in Februrary 2020. With monthly inflation excluding food and energy at 0.15 percent in Februrary, the year-on-year figure remained at 2.3 percent. One-year ahead expected inflation as of February decresed from 2.1 to 2.0 percent. In the first two months of the year public investment rose and economic activity indicators show a modest recovery. However, business expectations deteriorated in February. The risks regarding global and local economic activity have been accentuated by the impact of COVID-19, and volatility in international financial markets has increased significantly. The BCRP Board pays close attention to new information on inflation and its determinants to expand the monetary stimulus when appropriate. The Board also decided to maintain the interest rates on BCRP off-auction credit and deposit operations in domestic currency with financial entities. Overnight deposits: 1.00 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 2.80 percent per year for financial entities' first 10 operations over the last 12 months; and the rate fixed by the BCRP Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations Committee for operations other than financial entities' first 10 operations over the last 12 months. Dollar swaps: a fee equal to a minimum annual effective cost of 2.80 percent. The BCRP Board's next monetary policy session will take place on April 16, 2020."
Ukraine,2020-03-12,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to cut the key policy rate to 10% per annum effective 13 March 2020. The NBU continues its monetary policy easing, as predicted, in order to bring inflation back to its target range of 5% +/- 1 pp and to support economic growth in Ukraine amid a cooling global economy. The first months of the year show that inflationary pressures are waning faster than the NBU expected. In JanuaryFebruary, consumer inflation declined faster than foreseen in the forecast trajectory (reaching 3.2% yoy in January and 2.4% in February), remaining below the target range of 5% +/- 1 pp. Core inflation was also lower than forecast during this period. The faster disinflation was driven by the sustained effects of the last year's hryvnia appreciation on prices of goods, large supplies of the majority of raw foods, and lower energy prices. These factors offset the effect of robust consumer demand, which was bolstered by the continued growth in real household income. In January the NBU forecast inflation at 4.8% as of the end of 2020, but this forecast may be reviewed in April depending on further developments. So far, the global spread of the novel coronavirus has had a limited or neutral impact on the economy of Ukraine. Ukraine's exports continue to rise. Further increases in physical volumes of exports have more than offset certain declines in prices for some of the goods the country exports. At the same time, import prices (especially energy prices) are declining even faster than export prices. Uncertainty over the spread of the novel coronavirus, and stronger turbulence on financial and commodity markets saw the Ukrainian FX market respond with deteriorated sentiment and increased nervousness. However, the following consequences of the spread of the coronavirus have not yet impacted the economic activity and inflation in Ukraine:. the downward pressure on prices and cooling of the global economymonetary policy easing by central banks of the leading economies and Ukraine's trading partners in response to these processesmeasures taken by governments to prevent the spread of COVID-19.Apart from the drop in global prices caused by the coronavirus, disinflation in Ukraine will be driven by the recent rise in competition between crude oil producers. This will keep energy prices at record lows, which will also impact prices for Ukrainian exports. Overall, the effect of all these factors on economic growth and inflation in Ukraine will be mixed, adding to the uncertainty. The NBU Board relied on the key assumption that cooperation with the IMF continues. Signing a new agreement with the IMF will make the Ukrainian economy less vulnerable in a time of turbulent global markets and during a period of heavy public debt repayments. Investors' perception of Ukraine will also depend on Ukrainian court rulings on the responsibility and liabilities to the state of the former owners of insolvent banks. The risk arising from the global spread of the novel coronavirus could, if realized, drive the global economy into a recession and cause a significant slowdown in the Ukrainian economy. A dramatic decline in global demand and investors' revaluation of risks related to developing economies could negatively affect Ukraine's external trade and make it more difficult for Ukraine to obtain financing. There are other significant risks. an escalation of the military conflict in eastern Ukraine and new trade restrictions being introduced by Russiaa drop in the harvest of grain, fruit and vegetable crops in Ukraine in the wake of unfavorable weatherthe higher volatility of global food prices, driven by global climate changeTherefore, the NBU Board made its key policy rate decision when inflationary pressures were decreasing faster than expected, and the economy needed further support. In view of the above, the NBU Board continued its monetary policy easing cycle by cutting the key policy rate by 1 pp, to 10%, as envisaged by the central bank's January forecast. This will give the required impetus to the economy. As before, the NBU plans to decrease its key policy rate to 7% by the end of the current year. In deciding on the pace of key policy rate cuts to that level, the NBU will closely monitor:. the spread of the coronavirus around the world and in Ukraine, and its impact on the domestic and global economythe response of governments and central banks to these developmentsany progress achieved in negotiating a new aid agreement with the IMF, which will shape the expectations of financial market participants, and determine the prices of Ukrainian assets.If there are favorable developments, and if the new Ukrainian government speeds up reform, the NBU will be able to ease its monetary policy more quickly. Conversely, if the above risks materialize, the NBU will respond quickly by deploying the monetary policy tools it has at its disposal. The decision to cut the key policy rate to 10% was approved by NBU Board Decision No.172-D On the Key Policy Rate, dated 12 March 2020. A summary of the discussion by Monetary Policy Committee members that preceded this decision will be published on 23 March 2020. The next meeting of the NBU Board on monetary policy issues will be held on 23 April 2020 as scheduled."
United States,2020-03-15,"EDT March 15, 2020 The coronavirus outbreak has harmed communities and disrupted economic activity in many countries, including the United States. Global financial conditions have also been significantly affected. Available economic data show that the U.S. economy came into this challenging period on a strong footing. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January indicates that the labor market remained strong through February and economic activity rose at a moderate rate. Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Although household spending rose at a moderate pace, business fixed investment and exports remained weak. More recently, the energy sector has come under stress. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation have declined; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The effects of the coronavirus will weigh on economic activity in the near term and pose risks to the economic outlook. In light of these developments, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals. This action will help support economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation returning to the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective. The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including information related to public health, as well as global developments and muted inflation pressures, and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the stance of monetary policy, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its (more) For release at 5 p.m. EDT March 15, 2020maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. The Federal Reserve is prepared to use its full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and thereby promote its maximum employment and price stability goals. To support the smooth functioning of markets for Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities that are central to the flow of credit to households and businesses, over coming months the Committee will increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $500 billion and its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $200 billion. The Committee will also reinvest all principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities. In addition, the Open Market Desk has recently expanded its overnight and term repurchase agreement operations. The Committee will continue to closely monitor market conditions and is prepared to adjust its plans as appropriate. Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H Powell. Chair; John C Williams. Vice Chair; Michelle W Bowman; Lael Brainard; Richard H Clarida; Patrick Harker; Robert S. Kaplan; Neel Kashkari; and Randal K Quarles. Voting against this action was Loretta J Mester, who was fully supportive of all of the actions taken to promote the smooth functioning of markets and the flow of credit to households and businesses but preferred to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate to 1/2 to 3/4 percent at this meeting. In a related set of actions to support the credit needs of households and businesses, the Federal Reserve announced measures related to the discount window, intraday credit, bank capital and liquidity buffers, reserve requirements, and—in coordination with other central banks—the U.S. dollar liquidity swap line arrangements. More information can be found on the Federal Reserve Board's website."
Chile,2020-03-16,"Monday, 16 March 2020 Special Monetary Policy Meeting  March 2020 At its special monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to lower the monetary policy interest rate by 75 basis points (bp) to 1%, and implement a set of additional measures aimed at safeguarding the good functioning of the financial market. The decision regarding the MPR was endorsed by the favorable vote of Governor Mario Marcel. Vice-Governor Joaquín Vial and Board member Pablo Garcìa. Board Members Alberto Naudon and Rosanna Costa voted for a reduction of 50 bp. The decision regarding the additional measures was unanimous. The macroeconomic scenario facing the Chilean economy has deteriorated rapidly and significantly in connection with the global expansion of COVID-19 and the associated financial turmoil, which is taking a big toll on the economy, affecting households and businesses. In response to these developments, several central banks have anticipated their monetary policy decisions and announced a number of complementary measures aimed at facilitating the provision of liquidity and the normal operation of credit markets Although Chile's economic indicators are yet to reflect the effects of these disruptions, the pace of the propagation of the disease in the country, the sanitary measures already adopted by the authority and a look into how it is unfolding in other countries, suggest that the impacts on sales and cash flows of the affected companies could be substantially, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises. In these circumstances, the Board has decided to carry out a set of actions aimed at mitigating the negative impacts of these events and smooth the process of adjustments that the Chilean economy will have to deal with. In addition to lowering the MPR by 75 basis points to 1%, the Board agreed to adopt the following measures to ensure the normal functioning of credit markets and the effective transmission of the increased monetary stimulus: [INF*RES*AS] First, a conditional funding facility (FCIC) will be opened to banks, as detailed below: • Validity: six months. • Maturities of the loans granted via the FCIC: up to four years. • Initial loan amount: 3% of commercial and consumer loan portfolio as reported by the Financial Market Commission for 29 February 2020 (benchmark portfolio). • Additional loan amount: the additional resources channeled through the FCIC will be proportional to the increase of each institution's loans with respect to their benchmark portfolio. This expansion factor will be higher for smaller credits. • Interest rate: banking firms using this facility will pay an interest rate equal to the MPR in effect the day they access it. In case the MPR is changed during the six months of the program, the rate for the outstanding portion of the loan will be adjusted to the lower value of that period. Second, corporate bonds will be included as eligible collateral for all the effective liquidity operations in pesos, including the FCIC. Third, a banking bond purchase program will be established for SOMA system participants, for an amount in the UF equivalent of up to 4 billion US dollars. Fourth, the term of the foreign currency sale program will be extended until 9 January 2021. The operating details and specific dates for the implementation of these measures will be disclosed in the coming days. The Board estimates that this set of measures will help the economy adjust to this new scenario, by mitigating its impact on households and businesses. Future changes in monetary policy or additional measures will hinge on the evolution of the macroeconomic outlook, the proper functioning of the financial markets and the fulfillment of the Bank's inflation target and financial stability objectives. This monetary policy meeting's minutes will be published at 8:30 a.m.Monday 30 March 2020. The next monetary policy meeting is scheduled for Tuesday 31 March and the statement thereof will be published at 18:00 hours the same day. The Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2020-03-16,"Bank of Korea announces 50bp Base Rate cut and measures to stabilize economic and financial conditions The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower the Base Rate by 50 basis points, from 1.25% to 0.75%, effective March 17, 2020. In a related set of actions, the Board has decided to lower the interest rate on the Bank Intermediated Lending Support Facility from 0.50-0.75% to 0.25%, effective March 17, 2020. To manage liquidity in the financial market at a sufficient level, the Board will also broaden the eligible collateral for open market operations to include debentures issued by banking institutions. This press release is the English version of the Bank of Korea's policy statement. In the case of any inconsistency, the original version in Korean will prevail. Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower the Base Rate by 50 basis points, from 1.25% to 0.75%, effective March 17, 2020. Since the last Monetary Policy Board meeting, concerns about global economic slowdown have deepened with COVID-19 spreading globally. The spread of the outbreak has also resulted in a significant increase in the volatility of major price variables, including stock prices and exchange rates, in domestic and global financial markets and a sharp fall in international oil prices. The Board, therefore, judged that further monetary policy accommodation is called for in order to ease volatility in the financial markets and reduce the effects on future economic growth and inflation. Considering the high level of uncertainties regarding financial and economic conditions at home and abroad, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance going forward so as to reduce the downside risks to the real economy and ease volatility in the financial markets. Interest Rate Cut for Bank Intermediated Lending Support Facility In addition to lowering the Base Rate by 50 basis points, the Monetary Policy Board also lowered the interest rate on the Bank Intermediated Lending Support Facility. The decision is expected to strengthen the incentives for banks to lend to SMEs, alleviating the interest burden of SMEs and improving their financial conditions. In particular, this interest rate cut (0.75% → 0.25%, 50bp) on the support programs for regional SMEs and SMEs affected by COVID-19 is anticipated to reinforce financial assistance to business owners and regional SMEs. Bank Intermediated Lending Support Facility Interest Rates Before After Program Adjustment Adjustment ▪ Support Program for Trade Financing ▪ Support Program for New Growth Engine Development and Job Creation 0.50% ▪ Support Program for Small-scale Business Owners (Abolished) 0.25% ▪ Support Program for Regional Enterprises ▪ Support Program in response to COVID-19 0.75% ▪ Support Program for Facilities Investment (Abolished) 3. Broadening of Eligible Collateral for Open Market Operations The Board decided today to broaden the eligible collateral for open market operations to include bank financial debentures that are not credit risk-free, as follows: Debentures issued by banking institutions established by the Bank Act. Korea Development Bank. Industrial Bank of Korea, the National Aricultural Cooperative Federation and Nonghyup Bank, the National Federation of Fisheries Cooperatives and Suhyup Bank, and Export- Import Bank of Korea. However, the newly eligible collateral is limited to collateral for RP transactions between the Bank of Korea and its counterparties, and excludes self-issued bonds and bonds issued by related companies. For risk management purposes, the Bank of Korea will set the margin ratios on debt securities whose credit risk is higher than those of government bonds, government guaranteed bonds, and monetary stabilization bonds. Today's measures are expected to have the following effects on the financial markets: They will contribute to the improvement of the short-term financial market by expanding the availability of bank debentures additionally included as eligible collateral of financial institutions. They will improve the issuing conditions for bank debentures and enhance their use by firms and other institutional investors as a means of financing and investment. These measures will be effective on April 1, 2020, and the securities that have been made additionally eligible as collateral will be valid for one year from the effective date."
Kazakhstan,2020-03-16,"Press release 8 On maintaining the base rate at 12.0% and adapting the domestic market to the new macroeconomic realities March 16, 2020 Almaty The National Bank of Kazakhstan has made a decision to maintain the base rate and the interest rate corridor at 12% per annum +/- 1.5 percentage points. In the conditions of uncertainty in the external sector and realization of risks related to the expansion of coronavirus COVID-19, the consequences of trade wars, the increase of geopolitical tensions, according to the estimates of the international institutions and experts the significant and persistent economic growth slowdown is expected. The growth rate of global GDP in 2020 can be the worst since the world financial crisis in 2008. Since the beginning of the last week the significant volatility in the world commodity and financial markets is being observed. The dynamics of oil price is getting formed under the influence of the events caused by the disagreement of the participants of OPEC+ meeting and the unfolding price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia. From March 9, 2020 Brent oil price has fixed in the range of 31- 36.5 US dollars per barrel. In the morning of March 16, 2020 it amounted to 32.8 US dollars per barrel. As the result of investors' negative expectations the world stock market indices have demonstrated the most dramatic drop in the past 30 years. Last week the US Fed announced short term liquidity provision in the amount of 1.5 billion of US dollars and yesterday on an emergency basis reduced the key interest rate to 0-0.25% and announced the launching of the new quantitative easing program in the amount of 700 billion of US dollars. The depreciation of the developing and oil exporting countries' national currencies was observed. Under these conditions in order to maintain the price stability the National Bank of Kazakhstan has taken a number of prompt and proactive measures during the period from March 10 to March 13. The decision made on March 10, 2020 to increase the base rate to the level of 12% has provided a preventive effect to the spread of panic in the market and has timely adjusted the strategies of the market agents, thus allowing to reduce the emerging inflationary risks and protect the tenge assets. At the same time, the expansion of the interest rate corridor to 1.5 pp was intended to reduce the possibility of speculative pressures on exchange rate by the market participants, increasing the cost of tenge borrowing by the banks from the National Bank of Kazakhstan to 13.5%. The National Bank of Kazakhstan on the daily basis provides liquidity to banks without the amount limitations. To stabilize the situation in the FX market under the conditions of sharp change in external terms of trade and the shortage of foreign currency supply, the National Bank of Kazakhstan has conducted the foreign exchange interventions, acting as a sole seller of foreign currency in certain periods. In particular, on March 10, 2020 with an aim to prevent the unfounded volatility of the exchange rate the call auction was activated. The National Bank of Kazakhstan has coordinated and monitored the foreign currency transactions of the quasi-government sectors, commercial banks and exchange offices. It allowed to mitigate the negative influence of the external factors on the exchange rate, which depreciated by 6.1% to 405.62 KZT per 1 US dollar over the period from March 6 to 13, 2020. The National Bank of Kazakhstan is considering the significant deterioration of the global growth perspectives, the decline in demand and the increase of the volatility in the commodity market as the new economic reality. Based on the analysis of the evolving context, the National Bank of Kazakhstan has revised its vision on the future development of the Brent oil price dynamics from 60 to 35 US dollars per barrel. The new price level is regarded as the base scenario till the end of the forecasting period. The deterioration of the scenario has increased the risk of the inflation rate to exceed the upper target boundary for 2020. From this moment forward, taking the new fundamental realities into account, the National Bank of Kazakhstan intends to encourage the formation of the equilibrium exchange rate in accordance with the free floating exchange rate regime and inflation targeting. The National Bank of Kazakhstan has all the necessary instruments to further stabilize the situation in the domestic financial market. Should the need arise, joint and coordinated measures with the Agency for regulation and development of the financial market will take place in order to prevent the negative consequences from the external sector. The National Bank of Kazakhstan continues to monitor the situation and keeps the right to mitigate the exchange rate fluctuations, which do not reflect the influence of the fundamental factors, as well as in case of a threat to the financial stability. In the event of worsening of the situation in the world economy, with an aim to maintain the price stability and stable situation in the FX and financial markets, the possibility of taking the additional measures is not ruled out. The next decision of the National Bank of Kazakhstan on the base rate will be announced on April 27, 2020 at 15:00 Nur-Sultan time."
Armenia,2020-03-17,"PRESS RELEASE 17.03.2020 Refinancing rate cut by 0.25 pp to 5.25% At the March 17 2020 meeting, the CBA Board decided to cut the refinancing rate by 0.25 pp to 5.25%. There was a 0.2% deflation in February 2020 versus 0.6% inflation recorded in the same month last year, with a 12-month deflation rate of 0.5%. The continuous spread of coronavirus worldwide is having a significant negative impact on the global economy and economic growth in partner countries. Uncertainties in the world financial markets have increased substantially, driving the stock exchange indices of the developed countries to continued fall, commodity prices to decline, exchange rates of developing countries to depreciate, the impact of which on the Armenian economy is estimated to be deflationary. According to the CBA estimates, these effects reflected in Armenian economy through simultaneous contraction of aggregate supply and demand. The main impact is incurred by the services sector, especially the sub-sectors related to tourism and entertainment. According to the baseline scenario of the CBA, the economic growth will slow down notably in the short run, but will not affect Armenia's long-term economic potential outlook. Considering the developments of the economy, the CBA Board estimates that the role of monetary policy in current situation is limited, as the toolkit of monetary policy is not able to address the development of specific sectors of the economy and the increase of real economic uncertainty caused by healthcare situation. In this circumstances, it is vital to preserve macroeconomic stability of the country, which would allow to secure the effectiveness of target measures for economic policy the Government is developing. The CBA Board finds that thanks to low-inflationary policy pursued in recent years the inflation expectations are now sufficiently anchored. Therefore, given the CBA's price stability objective and in view of current inflationary developments, global economy future impact and current uncertainties, the Board believes that the refinancing rate needs a 0.25 pp cut. As a result, according to the baseline scenario, inflation will remain relatively low in the upcoming months, gradually approaching the target value. At the same time, the CBA monitors the economy and financial markets on a daily basis, considers various alternative scenarios and is ready to react to any developments in the situation ensuring price stability in the Republic of Armenia. Detailed information underlying the setting of the interest rate can be found in Inflation Report (Monetary Policy Program. Q1, 2020) to be published by March 31 2020."
Pakistan,2020-03-17,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement March 17, 2020. At its meeting on 17th March 2020, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut the policy rate by 75 bps to 12.50 percent. The decision reflected the MPC's view that the outlook for inflation has improved in light of the recent deceleration in domestic food prices, significant decline in consumer price expectations, sharp fall in global oil prices, and slowdown in external and domestic demand due to the Coronavirus pandemic. Average headline inflation is expected to remain within the SBP's 11-12 percent forecast in FY20, before falling to the medium-term target range of 5-7 somewhat earlier than previously forecast. In addition to its decision on interest rates, the MPC noted that the SBP's new ‘Temporary Economic Refinancing Facility (TERF)' for businesses—that provides SBP refinancing for bank lending for plant and machinery for new projects at. percent fixed for 10 years—should provide important additional support to investment in response to the anticipated slowdown in activity due to the Coronavirus pandemic. The MPC emphasized that it stood ready to take further actions if and when needed as more information becomes available on the outlook for inflation and growth. In reaching this decision, the MPC considered key trends and prospects in the real, external and fiscal sectors, and the resulting outlook for monetary conditions and inflation. Key developments since the last MPC meeting. The MPC noted that the dominant development since the last meeting on 28th January 2020 has been the outbreak of the Coronavirus, which has taken significant toll on human life around the world. The outbreak has reduced external and domestic demand, while increasing risk aversion and uncertainty about the future. At the same time global oil prices have plummeted which, if sustained, should help lower domestic inflation and improve the current account. Heightened global risk aversion has recently reduced demand for emerging market assets across the world, and has led to some volatility and depreciation in the domestic foreign exchange market in the past few days, as in other emerging markets. The MPC emphasized that the current market volatility is externally driven and the strengthening in the fundamentals of Pakistan's economy that drove the improvement in Pakistan markets before the Coronavirus outbreak remains intact. As result, they viewed that the volatility in the domestic markets would likely subside once global risk aversion reduces and country-specific fundamentals regain importance. The MPC also noted that staff-level agreement with the IMF on the second review under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) was successfully reached, which will support investor sentiment. Real sector. Recent high-frequency indicators re-affirmed that the decline in most economic sectors was bottoming- out before the Coronavirus outbreak. Large-scale manufacturing (LSM) rebounded strongly in December 2019, moving into positive growth (9. percent y/y) for the first time in the last six months, and indicated strengthening in growing number of industries, especially export-oriented ones. Notwithstanding some improvement relative to last year, agricultural growth is likely to be lower than previously forecast. Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN. In light of recent domestic and global developments. SBP now projects real GDP growth for FY20 of around. percent, while expecting modest recovery next year provided that the spillover impact of the Coronavirus outbreak on global trade and financial markets is moderate and short-lived. In such scenario, the export slowdown and market volatility should be contained while the benign growth and inflation impacts of lower global commodity prices would dominate. Under an adverse scenario, more prolonged and severe phase of weak demand in Pakistan's major export and remittance markets and depressed sentiment among domestic consumers and businesses could have more material impact on growth. In both these scenarios, the impact on the current account was expected to be mildly positive as the savings from low oil prices were expected to offset potential weaknesses in net exports and remittances. External sector. The external sector continues to improve substantially. The current account deficit contracted by 72 percent to US$2.65 billion during Jul-Jan FY20, driven by significant reduction in imports and modest growth in both exports and workers' remittances. The MPC noted that Pakistan's exports have performed better in recent months than most of its competitors despite the challenging external environment. This improvement reflected the benefits of more competitive exchange rate, availability of low-cost funding for export-oriented sectors under the SBP's refinancing facilities, and government efforts to facilitate businesses. Notwithstanding recent volatility in foreign exchange markets, the SBP's FX reserves have maintained strong growth, driven by the narrowing current account deficit. Reserves increased from US$.28 billion at end-June 2019 to US$ 12.76 billion as of end-February 2020 an increase of US$.48 billion. The actual improvement in the country's external position is much larger, given the sizeable reduction in SBP's forward liabilities of US$.20 billion during the same period. The MPC observed that this increase in the net reserve buffers of SBP of US$ 10.68 billion is more than sufficient to cope with any portfolio outflows in an orderly manner. The MPC noted that the SBP continues to monitor developments carefully and stands ready to respond effectively to address any disorderly market conditions. Fiscal Sector 10. Fiscal consolidation remains on track, supporting qualitative improvement in the inflation outlook. During Jul-Feb FY20, tax revenues showed healthy increase of 17. percent over the same period last year. On the expenditure side, increased public spending relative to last year is supporting business activities, especially in construction-allied industries. Going forward, the government could face challenges in achieving revenue targets for this year, especially if there are disruptions in economic activity, and may require increased expenditures in health and social sectors to cushion the impacts of the Coronavirus pandemic. Monetary and inflation outlook 1. Weak economic activity continues to be drag on private sector credit, which expanded at. percent during 1st Jul to 6th Mar FY20, less than half the rate seen during the same period last year. SBP continues to support economic activity through its refinancing facilities, such as its Long-term Financing Facility (LTFF) scheme for export-oriented sectors and its new TERF facility in light of the Coronavirus pandemic. Headline inflation numbers recorded sizable changes since the last MPC meeting, driven by volatile food prices. National CPI inflation surged to 14. percent (y/y) in January 2020, before an equally notable deceleration in February 2020 to 12. percent. The MPC noted that recent weekly outturns in essential food Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN prices reinforced their assessment that the earlier shocks were transitory and that the underlying trend in headline inflation, captured in relatively stable core inflation and declining consumer inflation expectations, would remain moderate in the remaining part of this fiscal year. Currently average national CPI stands at 1. percent during the first eight months of FY20. Barring unforeseen shocks, the inflation momentum is expected to moderate further in coming months. There is high likelihood that average inflation in FY20 will be in the 11-12 percent range forecast by the MPC at the start of the year. With today's reduction in the policy rate, the MPC felt that real interest rates are appropriate on forward-looking basis to achieve the 5-7 percent medium-term inflation target. The MPC also decided to make the interest rate corridor symmetric around the policy rate, in line with international best practices. Page."
Poland,2020-03-17,"Warsaw, 17 March 2020 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 17 March 2020 The Council decided to cut the NBP reference rate by 0.5 percentage points, i.e. to 1.00%. At the same time, the Council set the remaining NBP interest rates at the following levels: ▪ lombard rate at 1.50%; ▪ deposit rate at 0.50%; ▪ rediscount rate at 1.05%; ▪ discount rate at 1.10%. Moreover, the Council decided to decrease the required reserve ratio from 3.5% to 0.5% and to increase the remuneration of the required reserves from 0.5% to the reference rate level. At the beginning of the year the global economy grew at relatively slow, albeit stable pace. Due to the spread of coronavirus the global economic outlook has recently substantially deteriorated. Measures introduced in many countries to counteract the further spread of coronavirus, including restrictions imposed on transport and services sector, along with falling consumer and business confidence weaken the current activity in many economies. The latest forecasts indicate an improvement in economic conditions further ahead, although its pace will depend on effectiveness of epidemic containment measures as well as the impact of current disruptions on the economic agent's incomes and sentiment in the longer run. In these circumstances many countries has announced  apart from measures directly aimed at limiting the spread of the virus  the introduction of fiscal measures to contain economic losses related to coronavirus and temporary suspension of business activity. Due to the deteriorating outlook and increased uncertainty about the durability of coronavirus economic impact, the financial markets sentiment has also deteriorated in recent days. It has been accompanied by considerable fall in global oil prices. The major central banks has substantially eased their monetary policy. The US Federal Reserve lowered interest rates, bringing them close to zero, restarted asset purchases and increased the liquidity in the financial market. Due to already negative interest rates, the European Central Bank eased monetary conditions by, inter alia, increasing the scale of liquidity provision and asset purchases. Many other central banks cut interest rates. In Poland, economic conditions in the first months of the year were relatively favourable. However, coronavirus epidemic, due to its detrimental impact on sentiments, together with measures limiting its' spread  will curtail economic activity in some sectors in the short run. These effects might be amplified by simultaneous slump in economic activity in many countries. At the same time, further ahead, they will probably be mitigated by stimulus packages introduced in many countries. Inflation in Poland stood at 4.7% y/y in February 2020. Expected economic slowdown in the nearest future together with the significant fall in global oil prices will contribute to marked decrease in inflation. Consequently, latest forecasts indicate a higher probability of inflation decreasing more quickly in 2020 than anticipated in the March projection and of inflation falling below the NBP inflation target in the monetary policy transmission horizon. In these circumstance, the Council decided to cut the NBP interest rates. At the same time, in order to limit the risk of current economic disruption weighing on credit supply, the Council cut the required reserve ratio from 3.5% to 0.5% and increased the remuneration of required reserves from 0.5% to the reference rate level. Moreover, in accordance with Monetary policy guidelines for 2020, to limit the risk of tensions in domestic financial market. NBP will provide liquidity to the banking sector using repo transactions. NBP will also purchase government bonds on the secondary market as part of the structural operations that change the long-term liquidity structure in the banking sector and contribute to maintaining the liquidity in the government bond secondary market. Furthermore NBP will offer bill discount credit aimed at refinancing new loans granted to economic entities by banks. In the Council's assessment, all the above-mentioned measures will mitigate the negative economic impact of coronavirus spread, while further ahead they will contribute to recovery in domestic economic activity and will be conducive to inflation running at the level of the NBP inflation target in the medium term."
Turkiye,2020-03-17,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to reduce the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) from 10.75 percent to 9.75 percent. As developments regarding the spread of the coronavirus have weakened global growth outlook, central banks in advanced and emerging economies have taken coordinated expansionary measures. The pandemic disease is closely monitored for its evolving global impact on capital flows, financial conditions, international trade and commodity prices. In the period preceding the coronavirus outbreak. Turkey's macroeconomic indicators improved significantly. A sustained fall in inflation and a sizable adjustment in the current account were achieved. The recovery of economic activity became stronger along with the improvement in financial conditions. In this period, foreign currency indebtedness of nonfinancial firms decreased; liquidity and capital buffers of the banking sector strengthened. The achievements of the rebalancing process have increased the resilience of the Turkish economy against unfavorable shocks. In order to contain negative effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the Turkish economy, it is of crucial importance to ensure the healthy functioning of financial markets, the credit channel and firms' cash flows. Accordingly, with an aim to support financial stability, the central bank will implement a comprehensive set of measures. Developments in inflation expectations, domestic demand conditions and producer prices have contributed to a mild trend in core inflation indicators. Despite the recent depreciation in the Turkish lira due to global developments, the sharp fall in international commodity prices, especially crude oil and metal prices, affects inflation outlook favorably. Furthermore, due to the weakening in global trade and measures such as travel restrictions, the disinflationary effect of aggregate demand conditions has increased to some extent. In this respect, it is considered that downside risks on the year-end inflation projection have increased. Accordingly, the Committee decided to make a 100 basis point cut in the policy rate. The Committee assesses that maintaining a sustained disinflation process is a key factor for achieving lower sovereign risk, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery. Keeping the disinflation process in track with the targeted path requires the continuation of a cautious monetary stance. In this respect, monetary stance will be determined by considering the indicators of the underlying inflation trend to ensure the continuation of the disinflation process. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability and financial stability objectives. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Brazil,2020-03-18,"In its 229th&#160;meeting, the Copom unanimously decided to lower the Selic rate to 3.75% p.a. In its 229th meeting, the Copom unanimously decided to lower the Selic rate to 3.75% p.a. The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario:. Regarding the global outlook, the novel coronavirus pandemic is causing a significant global growth slowdown, a fall in commodity prices, and an increase in asset prices volatility. With this background, the environment for emerging economies has become challenging, despite the additional provision of monetary stimulus in major economies. Data on economic activity released since the previous meeting remains in line with the process of the gradual recovery of the Brazilian economy. However, these data do not yet reflect the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Committee judges that various measures of underlying inflation are running at levels compatible with meeting the inflation target at the relevant horizon for monetary policy. Inflation expectations for 2020, 2021, and 2022 collected by the Focus survey are around 3.1%, 3.65%, and 3.5%, respectively. The Copom's inflation projections in the hybrid scenario with interest rate path extracted from the Focus survey and constant exchange rate at R$4.75/US$* stand around 3.0% for 2020, and 3.6% for 2021. This scenario assumes a path for the Selic rate that ends 2020 at 3.75% p.a. and rises to 5.25% p.a. in 2021; and. The scenario with constant interest rate at 4.25% p.a. and constant exchange rate atR$4.75/US$* yields inflation projections around 3.0% for 2020, and 3.6% for 2021. The Committee emphasizes that risks to its baseline scenario remain in both directions. On the one hand, economic slack may continue to produce a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory. This risk increases if a worsening of the pandemic implies a larger-than-expected, both in magnitude and in length, increase in uncertainty and decline in demand. On the other hand, the increase in monetary policy power, the deterioration of the external scenario, or thefrustration with the continuation of reforms may increase the risk premium and generate a higher-than-expected path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to lower the Selic rate by 0.50 percentage point to 3.75% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation, a higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks, and it is consistent with convergence of inflation to its target over the relevant horizon, which includes 2020 and mainly 2021. The Copom reiterates that economic conditions prescribe stimulative monetary policy, i.e., interest rates below the structural level. The Committee emphasizes that persevering in the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy is essential for a sustainable economic recovery. The Copom also stresses that questions about the continuation of the reform agenda and permanent changes to the fiscal consolidation process could result in a higher structural interest rate. Under such circumstances, additional monetary easing may be counterproductive and result in a tightening of financial conditions. The Copom understands that the current environment recommends caution in the conduct of monetary policy and, at this moment, deems appropriate to keep the Selic rate at its new level. However, the Committee recognizes that the variance of its balance of risks has increased and that further economic data will be essential to determine its next steps. The Banco Central do Brasil stresses that it will continue to deploy its arsenal of monetary, exchange rate and financial stability policies to fight the current crisis. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Roberto Oliveira Campos Neto (Governor). Bruno Serra Fernandes. Carolina de Assis Barros. Fabio Kanczuk. Fernanda Feitosa Nechio. Joao Manoel Pinho de Mello. Mauricio Costa de Moura. Otavio Ribeiro Damaso, and Paulo Srgio Neves de Souza. *Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average R$/US$ exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the Friday before the Copom meeting."
Georgia,2020-03-18,"18.03.2020 The National Bank keeps its policy rate unchanged at 9.0 percent. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on March 18, 2020, and decided to keep the refinancing rate unchanged at 9.0 percent. In January-February, annual inflation stood at 6.4%. According to the forecasts available during the previous Monetary Policy Commette meeting, inflation was expected to decline over the rest of the year and approach the target gradually, while the decline in inflation was ensured by the tight monetary policy stance. However, amid the coronavirus pandemic and the sharp drop in oil prices on the international commodity markets, economic uncertainty significantly increased globaly. It is expected that economic growth rates will slow down in our trading partners as well as in Georgia, but at this stage it is impossible to make accurate estimates based on the available data. It is important to note that various factors are putting pressure on inflation from both side. The volatility of FX markets in Georgia as well as in other countries of the region is high and the depreciation of the nominal effective exchange rate will exert the upward pressure on inflation expectations. Meanwhile, the weak external demand reduces the domestic demand significantly, which will have a downward pressure on inflation. In the medium term, the inflation dynamics will be determined by the interaction of these two factors. If the pressure on inflation from the nominal effective exchange rate turns out to be stronger, the NBG will consider the tightening of monetary policy stance. While, if the decline in external and domestic demand will be so strong and long-lasting that, despite the depreciation of the currency, it will create a downward pressure on inflation, the NBG will start to ease monetary policy stance. Hence, considering high level of uncertainty, the Monetary Policy Committee deemed it appropriate to leave the interest rate unchanged at this stage and to maintain a tight monetary policy. In addition, we approached the International Monetary Fund to increase access to funding in the near future under its Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program. Moreover, additional funds will be allocated by other international donors to mitigate the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Overall, it will help eliminate the external imbalance and will positively impact the nominal effective exchange rate and, consequently, the medium-term inflation dynamics. The NBG continues to actively monitor the developments in the economy and along with the release of new data that will allow us to better assess the situation, the NBG will use all available tools to ensure price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee is scheduled on April 29, 2020. However, if necessary, the Committee will consider the possibility of extraordinary meeting."
Philippines,2020-03-18,"At its meeting on monetary policy today, the Monetary Board decided to cut the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) facility by 50 basis points (bps) to 3.25 percent, effective Friday, 20 March 2020. The interest rates on the overnight lending and deposit facilities were reduced to 3.75 percent and 2.75 percent, respectively. In addition, the Monetary Board authorized the time-bound, temporary relaxation of BSP regulations on compliance reporting by banks, calculation of penalties on required reserves, and single borrower limits. The Monetary Board also approved a temporary reduction in the term spread on rediscounting loans relative to the overnight lending rate to zero. The BSP will issue the detailed guidelines on these monetary measures and regulatory forbearance items by the close of business today, 19 March 2020. Latest baseline forecasts indicate a lower path of inflation for 2020 and 2021, with inflation expectations remaining firmly anchored within the target range of 3.0 percent ± 1 percentage point over the policy horizon. Average inflation is seen to settle at 2.2 percent in 2020 and 2.4 percent in 2021. The latest forecasts are (substantially) below the February monetary policy meeting projections of 3.0 percent for 2020 and 2.9 percent for 2021 due to lower-than-projected inflation outturns in recent months, a sharp decline in global crude oil prices, and the adverse effects of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on global and domestic economic activity. Meanwhile, the balance of risks to the inflation outlook now leans toward the downside for both 2020 and 2021. The uncertainty over the potentially protracted pandemic poses significant downside risks to aggregate demand. The Monetary Board noted that while the enforcement of quarantine measures could help in slowing the spread of the virus, the resulting disruptions to industries and private spending are likely to reduce economic growth in the near term. Moreover. COVID-19 has likewise dampened prospects for the global economy, which could negatively impact tourism and trade. Overseas Filipino remittances, and foreign investments. Given these considerations, the Monetary Board decided that there is a need for a follow-on monetary policy response to address the adverse spillovers associated with the ongoing pandemic. With a manageable inflation environment and stable inflation expectations, the Monetary Board sees enough policy space for an assertive reduction in the policy rate at this juncture to cushion the country's growth momentum and uplift market confidence amid stronger headwinds. The monetary policy easing is also aimed at mitigating the risk of financial sector volatility in light of unfolding global developments by ensuring adequate domestic liquidity and credit in the financial system as well as lowering borrowing costs for affected firms and households. The Monetary Board also recognizes that the health and safety of the Filipino people remains the government's foremost priority. In this regard, the Monetary Board reiterates its support for urgent and carefully coordinated measures with other government agencies to alleviate the spillover effects of the pandemic on people and firms, with a view toward preventing any long-lasting economic and social damage. Going forward, the BSP will remain data-driven as it considers a range of other supplementary measures that may be required to support non-inflationary and sustainable growth over the medium term. These supplemental actions may include, but are not limited to, recalibrating the interest rate corridor settings; reducing the reserve requirement ratios; suspending the term deposit facility (TDF) auctions; and ensuring access to liquidity-enhancing facilities such as the rediscounting windows. The BSP is prepared to use its full range of monetary instruments and to deploy regulatory relief measures as needed in fulfillment of its price and financial stability mandates."
Peru,2020-03-19,"PRESS RELEASE SPECIAL MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT - MARCH 2020 BCRP LOWERS REFERENCE RATE TO 1.25% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to lower the reference interest rate by 100 basis points, from 2.25 to 1.25 percent, in light of the following developments: Economic activity is being temporarily affected by a supply shock and a slowdown in domestic demand caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The risks to global and domestic economic activity have increased in recent days, including the possibility of a global recession in the first half of the year. The BCRP will continue to take the necessary steps to support the payments system and the credit channel. In March the BCRP has implemented liquidity easing via one-day repos (S/ 1,400 million per day on average) and 6 month- and one-year repos (S/ 1,400 and S/ 1,500 million, respectively). Other liquidity injection instruments available to the BCRP are repos using reserve requirements as collateral, currency substitution repos, repos using loans as collateral, and foreign exchange repos. The BCRP is also assessing new liquidity instruments to be used if necessary. The Board pays close attention to new information on inflation and its determinants to continue expanding monetary stimulus. The BCRP, in close coordination with the Ministry of Economy and Finance and with the Superintendence of Banking and Insurance, will take the necessary measures to preserve macrofinancial stability, economic activity, and employment. In the same meeting the Board also decided to maintain the following interest rates on BCRP discount window operations in domestic currency: Overnight deposits: 0.25 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 1.80 percent per year. The BCRP Board's next monetary policy meeting will take place on April 16, 2020."
South Africa,2020-03-19,"South African Reserve Bank PRESS STATEMENT EMBARGO DELIVERY 19 March 2020 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the January meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), the Bank's forecast for inflation has continued to moderate, in line with monthly inflation data and recent lower oil prices. Globally, a once-healthy economic growth outlook has been revised down sharply due to the outbreak and spread of Covid-19. This coronavirus will negatively affect global and domestic economic growth through the first half of 2020, and potentially longer depending on steps taken to limit its spread. The Covid-19 outbreak will have a major health and social impact, and forecasting global and domestic activity presents significant uncertainty. The Chinese economy, where the virus originated, is expected to contract by 1% in the first half of 2020. Economic activity is likely to also contract in the United States and Europe as governments there take actions to contain the spread of the virus. MPC Statement 19 March 2020 Page 1 In financial markets, the sustained global bull market in equities and corporate bonds also ended dramatically last week, with extensive and deep repricing. Prices for emerging market sovereign debt and other risky assets also fell sharply. This will have repercussions for household wealth and income, impacting further on global economic growth. In response to all these developments, the US Federal Reserve, alongside other central banks, took various steps to provide further monetary accommodation. Additional steps have also been taken to provide liquidity and ensure the smooth functioning of markets. Some governments have taken fiscal measures to mitigate the economic effects of the virus. In light of these considerations, we have marked down global growth for 2020 to 1.1%, before rising to around 2.8% in 2021. While a deeper or longer global and domestic contraction is not in our baseline, the Committee did consider a scenario featuring that possibility. Prices for some commodities have fallen as a result of weaker demand globally, with copper and oil being particularly hard hit. The spot price for Brent crude oil is currently around $30 per barrel, but is expected to bounce back to higher levels. For our forecast, the Brent crude oil price is expected to average $40.4 per barrel in 2020 and $44.5 per barrel in 2021, well below previous assumptions. The domestic economic outlook remains fragile. At this point. Covid-19 is likely to result in weaker demand for exports and domestic goods and services, but its impact on the economy could be partly offset by lower oil prices. We also expect disruptions to supply chains and to normal business operations. The Bank now expects the MPC Statement 19 March 2020 Page 2. The Bank now expects the MPC Statement 19 March 2020 Page 2 economy to contract by 0.2% in 2020. Apart from the Covid-19 global pandemic, electricity supply constraints and other sources of uncertainty are expected to keep economic activity muted. Public sector investment has declined and job creation has slowed. Business and household confidence have weakened further. Government and household consumption, and private investment, however, continue to grow, albeit modestly. While export growth is expected to decelerate further in the near term, prices remain high for some export commodities, and could be supported by an early resumption in China's economic activity. The technical recession of the latter half of 2019 contributed to a lower economic growth forecast. In addition. Covid-19 and existing constraints such as loadshedding, imply significant downside risk to the forecast.1 With persistently low inflation, and the coronavirus now hitting economic activity, monetary policy in major advanced economies and China will likely remain accommodative over the medium term. Easy global financing conditions have previously supported the value of the local currency, but financial volatility and a sharp rise in perceived risk has caused the rand to depreciate by 17.2% against the USD since January. The implied starting point for the rand forecast is R15.30 to the US dollar, compared with R14.90 at the time of the previous meeting. The forecast shows the currency strengthening over time, recovering towards its longer-run equilibrium level. 1 The forecast deducts 0.5 percentage points from 2020 GDP for loadshedding, at stage 2. MPC Statement 19 March 2020 Page 3 The Bank' s headline consumer price inflation forecast averages 3.8% for 2020, 4.6% for 2021, and 4. With the downward revision to the forecast, the overall risks to the inflation outlook at this time appear to be balanced. Electricity pricing remains an immediate concern, and there is likely to be higher volatility in prices of other goods and services as a result of sharp changes in demand and supply. Risks to inflation from recent currency depreciation are expected to be muted as pass-through is slow and could be offset by a wider output gap. Food price inflation is expected to remain low, in part due to better weather conditions. Expectations of future inflation have moderated further, on the back of lower services prices, modest food price inflation, and slower-growing nominal wages. Across the different surveys we look at, inflation expectations currently average 4.4% for 2020, 4.6% for 2021 and 4.7% in 2025.2 Market-based expectations have also moderated, with five-year break-even rates currently at about 3.90%.3 Heightened risk sentiment in global markets has amplified domestic and fiscal risks. This has pushed South Africa's sovereign bond yields sharply higher and weakened the domestic currency, increasing risks to monetary policy. The steep drop in global real interest rates implemented by advanced economies in recent days has partly offset those risks.4 2 The latest Bureau for Economic Research (BER) survey has expectations for 2020 down by 0.4ppts to 4.4% and to .4.6% (from 5.0%) for 2021. Five-year-ahead inflation expectations also eased to 4.7% (from 4.9%). Market analysts (Reuters Econometer) expect inflation to be, 4.2% (from 4.4%) for 2020, 4.6% (from 4.7%) in 2021 and 4.5% (from 4.6%) for 2022. 3 Calculated from the break-even inflation rate, which is the yield differential between conventional and inflation-linked bonds. 4 The risk premium starting point increased from 3.2% to 3.8% since January, driving up the neutral real rate by 20 basis points and currency contribution to the neutral by 10 basis points. The weighted global neutral real rate estimated in the QPM fell by 50 basis points, resulting in an overall decline in the neutral by 20 basis points. MPC Statement 19 March 2020 Page 4 Despite the general rise in risk, the significantly lower forecast for headline inflation has created space for monetary policy to respond to the rapid deterioration in economic conditions. Barring severe and persistent currency and oil shocks, inflation is expected to be well contained, remaining below the midpoint of the target in 2020 and close to the midpoint in 2021. Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to cut the repo rate by 100 basis points. This takes the repo rate to 5.25% per annum, with effect from 20 March 2020. The implied path of policy rates over the forecast period generated by the Quarterly Projection Model indicated three repo rate cuts of 25 basis points each in the second and fourth quarter of 2020, as well as in the third quarter of 2021. Monetary policy can ease financial conditions and improve the resilience of households and firms to the short-term economic implications of Covid-19. Our decision and its magnitude seeks to do this in the near term. Monetary policy however cannot on its own improve the potential growth rate of the economy or reduce fiscal risks. Current economic conditions underscore the importance of implementing prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms that lower costs generally, and increase investment opportunities, potential growth and job creation. Global economic and financial conditions are expected to remain highly volatile for the foreseeable future. The Committee will continue to assess risks to inflation, including from weaker economic growth and those arising from wage, price pressures and currency depreciation. As usual, the repo rate projection from the QPM remains a MPC Statement 19 March 2020 Page 5. As usual, the repo rate projection from the QPM remains a MPC Statement 19 March 2020 Page 5 broad policy guide which can change from meeting to meeting in response to changing data and risks.

Romania,2020-03-20,"On 20 March 2020, the Board of the National Bank of Romania convened for an emergency meeting and adopted a package of measures aimed at mitigating the impact of the situation generated by the coronavirus outbreak on households and Romanian companies. In the current domestic and international context and based on the information and analyses on the constantly evolving macroeconomic and financial developments, the NBR Board decided the following:. Depending on how the situation evolves, the NBR Board stands ready to also proceed to cutting the minimum reserve requirement ratios on leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. In view of the elevated uncertainty surrounding economic and financial developments, the NBR Board also decided to suspend the previously announced calendar of monetary policy meetings and hold monetary policy meetings whenever necessary. The NBR Board is closely monitoring the unfolding of the situation, its decisions being aimed at ensuring macroeconomic stability and the proper functioning of the banking system, of financial markets, to the benefit of households and Romanian companies."
Russia,2020-03-20,"On 20 March 2020, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to keep the key rate at 6.00% per annum. In February-March, the situation has been developing with a significant deviation from the Bank of Russia's forecast under the baseline scenario. This is related to changes in external conditions: the spread of the coronavirus epidemic and a sharp drop in oil prices. The ruble's depreciation is a temporary proinflationary factor. It might prompt annual inflation to exceed the target level this year. However, the dynamics of domestic and external demand will exert a meaningful constraining influence on inflation on the back of a pronounced slowdown of global economic growth and increased uncertainty. The package of measures adopted by the Government and the Bank of Russia ensures financial stability and will support the economy. All these factors were taken into account when making the key rate decision. Given the current monetary policy stance, annual inflation will return to 4% in 2021. Moving forward, in its key rate decision-making the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic developments over the forecast horizon, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. Inflation dynamics. In 2020, inflation may temporarily exceed the target level. It is expected to return to 4% in 2021. The temporary acceleration of annual inflation in the coming months will be caused by the weakening of the ruble in February — March, which is related to changes in external conditions: a worsening situation in global financial markets in the face of a threat of a global recession on the back of the coronavirus epidemic and a sharp drop in oil prices. The observed weakening of the ruble and the consecutive acceleration of consumer price growth rates may cause a temporary rise in inflation expectations of households and businesses. However, slowing growth in both domestic and external demand is a significant disinflationary factor. It will have a constraining effect on inflation. In this context, given the current monetary policy stance, annual inflation will return to 4% in 2021. Monetary conditions have tightened under the influence of negative external factors. The worsening situation in the global economy and a sharp drop in oil prices have prompted growth in risk premiums on a wide range of financial assets, including in emerging market economies. In this context. OFZ and corporate bond yields have increased, certain banks have started to raise their loan and deposit interest rates. The Bank of Russia's measures taken to curb financial stability risks and regulatory relaxations adopted will support credit expansion, including in the most vulnerable sectors, and will help limit the scale of tightening of monetary conditions. Economic activity. In February — March, the situation has been developing with a significant deviation from the Bank of Russia's forecast under the baseline scenario. This is related to worsening global growth prospects amid the spreading coronavirus and restrictions on cross-border cargo and passenger traffic, as well as to a rapid deterioration of dynamics in global commodity and financial markets. These factors may cause the moderate growth of the Russian economy in the beginning of the year to change to a downturn of the economic activity in the coming quarters. The Russian economy's growth path will in many ways depend on the scale of the fallout from the further spread of the coronavirus and the action to counter it, alongside with the impact of this action on production, demand and business and consumer sentiment. The Russian economy will gain support from the package of the Government and the Bank of Russia's economic measures to counter the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic and financial market volatility. Domestic demand is set to receive a boost this year from additional social policy measures announced in January, as well as the national projects being implemented as scheduled. Inflation risks. There has been a rise in short-term proinflationary risks, driven by a potentially more pronounced pass-through of the ruble weakening into prices, coupled with the impact of the temporary increase in current demand for a number of products and services, triggered by consumers' drive to accumulate stocks. However, a strong weakening of external demand, a potential decline in consumer activity and lag effects of the tightened monetary conditions may emerge as a source of significant disinflationary risks over a medium-term horizon. Moving forward, in its key rate decision-making the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic developments over the forecast horizon, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. In parallel with its key rate decision, the Bank of Russia took a number of measures towards ensuring financial stability, supporting the economy and the financial sector amid the coronavirus pandemic. These measures are intended to, among other things, maintain access of small and medium enterprises to bank lending, shore up mortgage lending and protect the interests of people affected by the spreading pandemic. In a similar vein, there are plans to take action to relax administrative burden for the financial sector, with a view to supporting the sector's lending capabilities. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next key rate review meeting on 24 April 2020. The press release on the Bank of Russia Board decision and the medium-term forecast are to be published at 13:30 Moscow time.

Thailand,2020-03-20,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 4/2020 Mr. Titanun Mallikamas. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 24 June 2020 as follows. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 050 percent. In deliberating their policy decision, the Committee assessed that the Thai economy would contract in 2020 more than the previous assessment due to the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak that turned out more severe than expected as well as the containment measures implemented by governments in many countries, including Thailand, disrupting global economic activities. The COVID-19 pandemic would also have highly uncertain effects on the economic structure, business operations, and the way people live and work. However economic activities would gradually recover in the second half of the year in countries that could effectively contain the outbreak including Thailand. Meanwhile headline inflation would be more negative than previously assessed but would return to the target in 2021. Financial stability would be more vulnerable given the economic outlook. The Committee viewed that the extra accommodative monetary policy since the beginning of the year as well as the fiscal, financial, and credit measures additionally announced helped alleviate adverse impacts and would support the economic recovery after the pandemic subsided, facilitate the return of inflation to the target, and reduce financial stability risks. The Committee thus voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at this meeting. The Thai economy would contract more than the previous assessment due to the COVID-19 pandemic that was more severe than expected, resulting in governments in many countries including Thailand implementing containment measures which significantly affected tourism and merchandise exports. Meanwhile domestic demand, both private consumption and private investment, would contract more than previously assessed. Employment and incomes were projected to decline. Nevertheless economic activities exhibited signs of improvement following the relaxation of the containment measures. The Committee viewed that targeted and timely fiscal measures along with accommodative monetary policy, credit measures, as well as the speed- up of debt restructuring would remain vital to support employment and businesses and facilitate the economic recovery. In addition, the Committee viewed that the Thai economy needed to have additional supply-side policies to support the changing economic structure and patterns of business operations consistent with the post-COVID environment. The annual average of headline inflation would be more negative in 2020 than the previous assessment. Energy prices collapsed following declining demand due to the dampened global economic activities. Core inflation would remain subdued at a low level. However headline inflation would rise toward the target in 2021 in tandem with gradually rising crude oil prices and the economic recovery. Medium-term inflation expectations remained anchored within the target. Commercial bank lending rates and short-term government bond yields declined following the previous policy rate cuts, whereas corporate bond spreads remained high. Commercial bank loans expanded due to large corporates borrowing to build liquidity buffer for economic uncertainties as well as to substitute for corporate bond issuance. Meanwhile SME and consumer loans decelerated. With the level of overall liquidity remaining ample, the Committee deemed it important that liquidity be better distributed to affected businesses and households. Regarding exchange rates, the US dollar depreciated against major and regional currencies, resulting in the appreciation of the baht against the US dollar. However the Committee expressed concerns over the baht that strengthened and could affect the economic recovery. Therefore the Committee would closely monitor developments in foreign exchange markets as well as assess the necessity of implementing additional appropriate measures. The financial institution system remained sound. Commercial banks had robust capital fund and loan loss provision levels. Nevertheless there remained a need in the period ahead to cope with the highly uncertain COVID-19 situation and the increased risks from deteriorating debt service capability of businesses and households. Meanwhile the Bank of Thailand had implemented the second phase of relief measures to assist retail borrowers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and urged commercial banks to expedite debt restructuring for businesses as well as to accelerate credit extension under various measures previously announced. Looking ahead, the Committee would monitor developments of economic growth, inflation, and financial stability, together with associated risks, including external risks, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the effectiveness of the fiscal, financial, and credit measures, in deliberating monetary policy going forward. The Committee would stand ready to use additional appropriate monetary policy tools if necessary. However economic activities GDP Growth 24 -81 50 exhibited signs of improvement following the (-53) (30) relaxation of the containment measures. Headline Inflation 07 -17 09  Headline inflation was projected to be more (-10) (03) negative in 2020 than expected but would rise Core Inflation 05 00 01 toward the target in 2021.

Monetary Policy Committee's Decision (Special Meeting) On 20 March 2020, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) held a special meeting to assess the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the economic outlook and domestic financial markets functioning. The Committee viewed that the COVID-19 outbreak in the period ahead would be more severe than previously expected and the situation would take some time before returning to normal. This would severely affect the Thai economy. Moreover the outbreak resulted in concerns among global financial markets, affecting liquidity and the functioning of Thai financial markets despite overall stability of the financial system. The Committee thus voted unanimously to cut the policy rate by 025 percentage point, from 100 to 075 percent effective on 23 March 2020, to reduce interest burdens of borrowers affected by the outbreak and to alleviate liquidity strain in the financial markets. This would mitigate the impact on the economy and would also reinforce fiscal measures already implemented and forthcoming. The Committee viewed that the policy rate cut in the previous and today's meetings would benefit the economy if financial institutions took active roles in addressing liquidity problems of borrowers, especially SMEs and households, as well as accelerating debt restructuring to have noticeable and meaningful impact. The Committee urged the Bank of Thailand to closely monitor each financial institution's assistance to borrowers. Moreover the Bank of Thailand would ensure sufficient liquidity, as well as the well-functioning and stability of the financial markets."
United States,2020-03-23,"EDT March 23, 2020 The Federal Reserve is committed to use its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time and thereby promote its maximum employment and price stability goals. The Federal Open Market Committee is taking further actions to support the flow of credit to households and businesses by addressing strains in the markets for Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities. The Federal Reserve will continue to purchase Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning and effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions. The Committee will include purchases of agency commercial mortgage-backed securities in its agency mortgage-backed security purchases. In addition, the Open Market Desk will continue to offer large-scale overnight and term repurchase agreement operations. The Committee will continue to closely monitor market conditions, and will assess the appropriate pace of its securities purchases at future meetings. Voting (by notation) for the monetary policy action were Jerome H Powell. Chair; John C Williams. Vice Chair; Michelle W Bowman; Lael Brainard; Richard H Clarida; Patrick Harker; Robert S Kaplan; Neel Kashkari; Loretta J Mester; and Randal K Quarles. In a related set of actions, the Federal Reserve announced additional measures to support the flow of credit to households and businesses. More information can be found on the Federal Reserve Board's website. (more)In connection with these plans, the Committee voted unanimously to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""Effective March 23, 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee directs the Desk to increase the System Open Market Account holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) in the amounts needed to support the smooth functioning of markets for Treasury securities and agency MBS. The Committee also directs the Desk to include purchases of agency commercial mortgage-backed securities in its agency mortgage- backed security purchases. The Committee also directs the Desk to continue conducting term and overnight repurchase agreement operations to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample and to support the smooth functioning of short-term U.S. dollar funding markets. In addition, the Committee directs the Desk to conduct overnight reverse repurchase operations (and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at an offering rate of 0.00 percent, in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for such operations and by a per- counterparty limit of $30 billion per day."
Nigeria,2020-03-24,"CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO. 129 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING OF MONDAY 23RD AND TUESDAY 24TH MARCH 2020 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on the 23rd and 24th March 2020, amidst heightened uncertainty in the global macroeconomic environment arising from major disruptions associated with the outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) and the oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. The Committee assessed the developments in the global and domestic environments in the first quarter of 2020 and the outlook for the rest of the year, including the threats to capital flows, growing vulnerabilities across global financial markets, the probability of a global recession, risks to price and financial stability as well as the quick intervention by central banks to restore normalcy, with guidance for further action. Ten (10) members of the Committee were in attendance at this meeting. Global Economic Developments The Committee noted with concern, the combined demand and supply shocks to the global economy arising from the outbreak of COVID-19 and the oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. It also noted the weakening performance of global output growth since January 2020, reflected in losses in global stock values; declining primary commodity prices, disruptions to the global supply chain associated with large scale global lockdown of mega metropoles and whole countries; and social distancing. Also there has been adverse shocks to global capital flows; vulnerabilities and uncertainties in major financial markets; as well as rising corporate debt in the advanced economies and public debt in some Emerging Market and Developing 1 Economies (EMDEs). Consequently global output growth in 2020 is projected to fall significantly below the initially projected level of 33 per cent. Inflation in the advanced countries continues to trend below long run targets, except in the United States, especially in the light of prevailing headwinds and heightened global uncertainties. Central banks in the Advanced Economies have thus engaged in a coordinated approach with peers to embrace quantitative easing across every sector, notably in transportation, travel and tourism, health and setting up of social safety net funds, to stem the impact of these headwinds on aggregate demand and supply chains. In the EMDEs, price developments remained mixed with upward inflationary pressure in some of the key economies. Domestic Economic Developments Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that growth in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) continued to improve in Q4 of 2019. Consequently real GDP grew by 255 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with 228 and 238 per cent in the preceding and corresponding quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively. Growth in Q4 2019, was driven largely by the strong performance of the oil sector, which grew by 636 per cent, though lower than 649 per cent recorded in the previous quarter, while the non-oil sector grew by 227 per cent. The Manufacturing and Non- Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Indices (PMI) expanded, though at a lower rate in February 2020, for the 35th and 34th consecutive months to 583 and 586 index points, respectively. Staff projections indicate that real GDP in Q1 and Q2 2020 will slow because of the tepid global demand, resulting from the recent outbreak of COVID-19, depressed global aggregate demand and supply, and the oil price war which has resulted in supply glut and decline in crude oil prices. This muted outlook for the first half of the year may thus, dampen overall growth prospects for 2020. To mitigate this trend, the Bank took decisive action to safeguard the Nigerian financial system and the economy from the emerging headwinds. The key policies include: provision of extended 2 moratorium on loans by an additional 1 year beginning from March 2020. This is to ease pressure on loan repayments. The Bank also reduced interest rates from 9 to 5 per cent on its existing intervention programmes over the next one year; created a N50 billion fund to support households and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) affected by COVID-19; introduced credit support for the healthcare sector; introduced regulatory forbearance to consider temporary and time-limited restructuring of loan terms and tenors to households and businesses affected by COVID-19, and strengthened the loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR) policy. The Bank also announced an intervention fund of N11 trillion to cushion the adverse effects of the Coronavirus outbreak on the economy. The sum of N10 trillion from this amount will be used to support local manufacturing to boost import substitution, while the balance of N100 billion will be used to support the health services sector and products through the provision of loans to the pharmaceutical companies, hospitals and other health practitioners to build new hospitals and health facilities or expand existing ones to first class health centres. This is in addition to the N15 trillion private sector driven Infraco Project fund, designed to target the construction of critical infrastructure across the country. In addition, pharmaceutical companies would be assisted through loan interventions to re-establish drug manufacturing firms in Nigeria and curtail the spread of the corona virus. In summary, it is expected that through these interventions, about N35 trillion would be injected as stimulus to support the Nigerian economy during this trying time. The Committee noted the continued uptick in headline inflation (year-on-year) for the sixth consecutive month to 1220 per cent in February 2020 from 1213 per cent in the previous month. The increase in inflation, was largely attributed to increases in the food and core components, which rose to 1490 and 943 per cent in February 2020, from 1485 and 935 per cent in January 2020, respectively. This was driven by shocks to food prices associated with renewed insurgency in major food producing areas of the Country and persisting infrastructural deficits. The MPC observed that broad money supply (M3) contracted for the second consecutive month by 229 per cent (year-to-date) in February 2020, reflecting the decline in Net Foreign Assets and Net Domestic Assets. Specifically the contraction in M3 was driven primarily by a decline in securities other than shares and currency outside depository corporations in the review period. Net Aggregate Credit, however, grew by 134 per cent in February 2020. The Committee noted with satisfaction the growth in aggregate credit by N235 trillion since the inception of the LDR policy, reflecting the potency of the policy and thus urged the Management of the Bank to sustain the current momentum of improved flow of credit to the private sector in Nigeria. It emphasized the need for coordination with the fiscal authorities, to strengthen access to credit to some critical sectors of the economy, including the weak and vulnerable population, particularly those in the informal sector through the setting up of a special fund, as well as support the enforcement of credit recovery. Accordingly sectoral distribution of credit between end-May 2019 and end-February 2020 was as follows: Manufacturing (N53306 billion); General Retail and Consumer Loans (N38071 billion); General Commerce (N22987 billion); Agriculture. Forestry and Fishing (N16304 billion); Information and Communications (N16369 billion); Finance and Insurance (N13120 billion); Construction (N11225 billion); and Transportation and Storage (N4542 billion), amongst others. The Committee noted the dismal performance in the equities market as the All-Share Index (ASI) decreased by 1730 per cent and Market Capitalization (MC) by 1073 per cent between end-December 2019 and March 20, 2020. The decline was largely attributed to profit taking and divestment by foreign portfolio investors, the delisting of shares of three quoted companies and capital outflow associated with the COVID-19 and subdued global economic activity. The MPC noted the continued resilience of the banking system, evidenced by the further moderation in the ratio of Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) from 659 4 per cent in January to 654 per cent in February 2020. Although the ratio remained above the prudential benchmark of 50 per cent, the Committee expressed confidence in the Bank's regulatory regime and commitment to maintaining stability in the banking system. Outlook The overall medium-term outlook for the global economy remains uncertain with increased deterioration in financial market conditions and weak global output growth. The major headwinds to the current projection for global growth includes: disruption to the global supply chain arising from the COVID- 19 pandemic; oil price downturn as a result of subdued global demand, vulnerabilities in major financial markets; rising corporate debt in the advanced economies and public debt in some Emerging Market and Developing Economies; as well as broad uncertainties leading to adverse shocks to foreign investment flows. On the domestic front, available data on key macroeconomic variables indicate the likelihood of subdued output growth for the Nigerian economy in 2020. Based on the current downturn in oil prices, staff projections indicate that output in the 2020 would be less than earlier envisaged. The major downside risks to this outlook, however, include: the continued spread of COVID-19; further decline in crude oil prices and the reduction in accretion to external reserves; reduced government revenue leading to weak aggregate demand; declining non-oil receipts; as well as infrastructural and security challenges. These headwinds will, however, be partly mitigated by: the timely and effective response of the monetary and fiscal authorities in containing the spread of the COVID-19 viral infection, the recalibration and adjustment of the 2020 Federal Budget to the revised thresholds while pegging expenditure to critical sectors of the economy, adoption of a new fiscal regime to encourage the build-up of fiscal buffers; sustained CBN interventions in selected sectors; enhanced flow of credit to the real sector and deliberate policies to diversify the Nigerian economy. The Committee's Considerations The Committee reviewed the prevailing adverse conditions in the global economy such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the oil price shock as well as the likelihood of continued oil supply glut into the near future, focusing on the impact of these headwinds on the Nigerian economy. The Committee observed that not only will the COVID-19 pandemic result in health crises, it will also result in massive economic crises that will force many countries into recession, including the leading industrialised countries. The MPC took into cognisance the impact of the decline in oil prices on accretion to external reserves and the emergence of exchange rate pressures. The Committee thus commended and endorsed the Management of the Bank for its prompt response with the adjustment of the exchange rate to uniform market rates and the removal of distortions. It however, took note of the likely impact of the exchange rate adjustment on the economy. The Committee noted the weakened revenue position of the Federal Government, arising from the sharp drop in oil prices. It reiterated the need for government to urgently reduce reliance on oil revenue by gradually diversifying the economy and improving tax collection. To this end, the MPC noted the speedy response of the Federal Government to the oil price shock by the revision of the 2020 budget downwards by N15 trillion and the oil price benchmark to US$30 per barrel. The MPC urged the NASS to fully cooperate with the Federal Government in coming up with a budget that reflects our new realities. In addition, the Committee noted the introduction of price modulation measures, resulting in reduction in the pump price of PMS from N145 to N125 per litre and its contributory effect in boosting aggregate demand, lowering inflation and improving the welfare of the ordinary Nigerians. The MPC further noted the persistence of inflationary pressures attributed to a combination of monetary and structural factors, and thus urged the Federal 6 Government to leverage on Public Private Partnership (PPP) to intensify investment in infrastructure to increase output and employment. The Committee cited the potentials for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flows to the Nigerian auto manufacturing, aviation and rail industries, which could take advantage of these viable and untapped domestic and regional markets. The Committee noted the sustained improvement in the financial soundness indicators, applauding the continued decline in the ratio of non-performing loans, growth in assets of the banking system and profitability of the industry in the light of increasing global uncertainties. It also recognised the success of the Bank's loan-to-deposit ratio policy and its potential to alleviate production shortfalls, reduce unemployment and boost aggregate demand, urging the Bank to pursue this and other related policies to a conclusive end. The MPC underscored the COVID-19 pandemic as a public health crisis which will continue to undermine any monetary or fiscal stimulus unless appropriate measures are taken to trace, test, isolate and treat infected persons in order to curtail the spread, while ensuring the that migration across the country is significantly reduced. The MPC, therefore, called on the Federal Government to take the necessary steps to safeguard the population through close monitoring and emergency readiness measures to identify and care for infected persons in the country, including compulsory restriction of movement to curtail spread of the pandemic. On the choices before the Committee, the MPC noted the recent actions of the Bank, targeted at strengthening the resilience of the financial system and alleviating the initial impact of the crisis. In its wisdom, the Committee felt that tightening would result in reining in the rising trend in inflation, and that it would support reserve accretion. However it would reduce money supply and limit DMBs credit creation capacity, thus resulting in increasing the cost of credit, with adverse impact on output growth. Tightening would also result in a reduction in aggregate demand as a fall in disposable income results in output 7 compression; whereas at this time, policy emphasis should be on stimulating aggregate supply and demand, both already weakened by COVID-19. With respect to loosening, whereas the Committee felt it would stimulate the economy in the short term, and boost aggregate supply and demand, the Committee nevertheless, was of the view that there was a need to be cautious in loosening given the fact that it would exacerbate an already worsening inflationary condition, resulting in massive pressure on reserves and the exchange rate. Based on the balance of these arguments, the MPC, in taking note of the recent actions already taken by the Management of the Bank in response to the COVID-19, resolved to allow time for the measures to permeate the economy while allowing the pandemic to wear out its plateau before deciding on further supporting policy measures to boost and strengthen aggregate demand and supply in the recovery phase of the economy. The choice to hold also considered the subsisting LDR and the DCRR policies, which sterilize excess liquidity in the banking system, hence an increase in the MPR would be counter-productive. The monetary policy stance arrived at this meeting took cognisance of the need to address the unfolding unfavourable macroeconomic developments, rein in inflation, support growth and employment through the extant interventions and recent initiatives, check capital outflows and support external reserves accretion, and dampen pressure and ensure foreign exchange market stability. review of the policy options indicates relative tightness of the current monetary policy stance. The CRR was increased at the last MPC meeting. Time is required for its full effects to manifest. Increasing the MPR will be contradictory to the recent reduction of interest rate in the CBN intervention windows from 9 to 5 per cent. Besides an increase in MPR will be taken by the Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) as in invitation to increase lending rates and this 8 will be most undesirable at this point in time when efforts are being made to avert a recession. Besides a reduction in the MPR, will not encourage the DMBs to reduce lending rates. But other strategies of the CBN are making the DMBs to reduce lending rates in furtherance of the growth objective. The Committee's Decision The Committee noted the continued rise in domestic prices; the glut in oil supplies and low oil prices in the wake of the current global shocks; exchange rate pressure and other domestic monetary and fiscal responses to the evolving crises. In view of the foregoing, the Committee decided by a unanimous vote to retain the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) at 135 per cent and to hold all other policy parameters constant. In summary, the MPC voted to: I Retain the MPR at 135 per cent; II. Retain the asymmetric corridor of +200/-500 basis points around the MPR; III. Retain the CRR at 275 per cent; and IV. Retain the Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent. Thank you. Godwin I Emefiele Governor. Central Bank of Nigeria 24th March 2020 9."
Thailand,2020-03-25,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 2/2020 Mr. Titanun Mallikamas. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 25 March 2020 as follows. The Committee voted 4 to 2 to maintain the policy rate at 075 percent. Two members voted to cut the policy rate by 025 percentage point. One MPC member attended the meeting through video conference but did not vote. Due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, the Thai economy would significantly contract in 2020 and headline inflation would become negative. Nonetheless the financial system was sound overall, with financial markets starting to function normally. The Committee viewed that the spreading of the COVID-19 in the period ahead would be severe and the situation would take some time before returning to normal. In this situation, the Committee supported the government's implemented measures to alleviate adverse impacts especially on the affected groups. In addition to the policy rate cut at the previous special meeting, addressing liquidity strains and accelerating debt restructuring for borrowers, especially households and SMEs, must be urgently implemented to have meaningful impacts. The Committee viewed that targeted measures designed to address liquidity needs would be of great importance. Most members thus voted to maintain the policy rate at this meeting. However two members voted to cut the policy rate by 025 percentage point due to the significant economic contraction. The Committee viewed that the Thai economy would markedly contract in 2020 as tourist figures and merchandise exports were severely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak, the slowdown of trading partner economies, and supply chain disruptions in many countries. Business and household incomes were increasingly affected. As a result, domestic demand, both private investment and consumption, was projected to contract. In this situation, fiscal measures must be a key mechanism to alleviate the impact on the economy and assist various groups affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. Furthermore financial institutions' assistance measures to borrowers would alleviate the impact on borrowers as well as contribute to the Thai economic expansion next year should the outbreak subside. Meanwhile the annual average of headline inflation was projected to be negative this year in tandem with declining energy prices and the contracting economy. The Committee would closely monitor external risks and the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, together with the effectiveness of the government's relief measures and each financial institution's assistance to borrowers. Stability of Thai financial markets, especially the bond markets, improved after the Bank of Thailand implemented measures to enhance liquidity in financial markets, although developments still warranted close monitoring. Declines in commercial banks' lending rates following the previous policy rate cuts partly helped reduce interest burdens of borrowers. Regarding exchange rates, the baht depreciated against trading partner currencies, in particular the major currencies, and would likely be volatile. The Committee viewed that Thailand's external stability remained robust, reflected in a high level of international reserves, and would continue to closely monitor developments in the financial markets as well as foreign exchange markets amid high uncertainties. The financial system remained sound overall. Commercial banks had robust capital fund and loan loss provision levels. Nonetheless vulnerabilities increased in some pockets, especially those related to debt servicing capability of households and SMEs that could deteriorate owing to the significant economic contraction. In this situation, coordination between financial and fiscal measures was urgently needed to support households and SMEs. Looking ahead, the Committee would monitor developments of economic growth, inflation, and financial stability, together with associated risks, especially the impact of COVID-19 outbreak, in deliberating monetary policy going forward. The Committee would stand ready to use additional policy tools in an appropriate and timely manner. Such tools included the policy rate and other monetary measures that would help enhance the policy rate transmission as well as loan extension by financial institutions to reach the target groups."
Czech Republic,2020-03-26,"At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank unanimously lowered the two-week repo rate by 75 basis points to 1.00%. At the same time, it lowered the Lombard rate to 2.00% and the discount rate to 0.05%. The Bank Board decided to cut interest rates further in reaction to the expected impacts of the coronavirus pandemic on the Czech economy.. The impact of the coronavirus pandemic dramatically changes the current outlooks for the global and Czech economy. The measures to stop the coronavirus pandemic adopted by individual governments are having a very negative effect on global trade and the production and consumption patterns of economic agents. The rapid changes in the situation imply huge uncertainty in the creation and updating of outlooks. Any point estimates of future developments should therefore be regarded as highly uncertain in the current situation. For its March monetary policy meeting, however, the CNB Bank Board had at its disposal an extraordinary internal update of the macroeconomic forecast, which served as a basis for its decision. It was complemented by additional relevant analyses and considerations from the financial stability area and information about the situation in each segment of the financial market and financial sector. The expected significant decline in foreign economic activity and inflation alone would have a strong impact on the Czech economy. Beyond that, however, the measures taken by the Czech government to counter the spread of the coronavirus are also having extraordinary direct demand and price effects on the domestic economy. All this will lead to a downturn of the Czech economy and a decline in inflation. The drop in external demand and the impacts of domestic measures will result in a strong domestic recession, in which the Czech economy will probably remain for the rest of this year. This will have a pronounced anti-inflationary effect. The koruna exchange rate, which has depreciated significantly as a result of the worse economic outlook and financial market panic, will partly offset the anti-growth and anti-inflationary impacts of the coronavirus pandemic. However, its impact probably will not materialise to a larger extent until after the situation returns to normal. Despite the markedly weaker exchange rate levels, these developments overall warrant a significant reduction of interest rates this year. This, in combination with the government's budget policy measures and the favourable supply-side effect of the drop in oil prices, will support the recovery of the economy from the current shock after the quarantine measures are relaxed. The Bank Board confirms that the capital position of the domestic banking sector is currently robust thanks to capital buffers and voluntary capital surpluses. The banking sector as a whole can cope with the consequences of even significantly adverse economic developments. However, owing to the coronavirus contagion and the related preventive measures, economic activity will significantly deteriorate during 2020. This is highly likely to have an adverse effect on the quality of institutions' loan portfolios. In this situation, a gradual release of the existing countercyclical capital buffer is one of the measures that - in combination with the postponement of dividend payments announced by banks - can support banks' ability to finance the real economy without interruption. Therefore, the CNB Bank Board lowered the countercyclical capital buffer rate to 1.00% with effect from 1 April 2020. The CNB remains ready to release the buffer fully were the banking sector's unexpected losses to rise. Due to the high uncertainty regarding future economic developments, the CNB also expects in the current situation that not only credit institutions, but also insurance companies and pension management companies will refrain from making any dividend payouts or taking any other steps that might jeopardise individual institutions' resilience. This should happen with immediate effect and last until both the acute and longer-term consequences of the novel coronavirus pandemic fade away. In view of the extraordinary nature of the present situation, the Bank Board announces that it is prepared to lower interest rates further and adopt measures to address any potential liquidity problems in the Czech financial sector. The CNB will continue to act within the boundaries of its legal mandate. However, the Bank Board is convinced that broadening the CNB's range of financial instruments and eligible counterparties would significantly help to maintain financial stability."
Colombia,2020-03-27,"In its meeting on 27 March, the BDBR deliberated about the monetary policy stance and made the following decisions. Juan Jos Echavarra. Governor, and Hernando Vargas. Deputy Technical Governor, answer questions from analysts and journalists related to the decision reached today by the Board of Directors. The country and its economy are experiencing an extraordinary and unprecedented situation. The BDBR has prioritized ample and timely provision of liquidity both in pesos and in US dollars, as the situation demands.p>. In its meeting today, the Board deliberated on the monetary policy stance and made the following decisions. Access to severance funds managers to auctions for the purchase of private debt instruments and to repo auctions with private debt instruments. Access to the Fondo Nacional del Ahorro to repo auctions with public and private debt instruments. The call for new auctions of dollar futures by USD $1,000 million and swaps by USD $400 million. Consistent with the priority measures taken to increase liquidity and ensure the proper operation of financial markets, the Board deemed appropriate to reduce the benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point to 3.75% in order to contribute to the future recovery in domestic demand once the operation of the markets is normalized. The Board considers that the reduction in the interest rate will also contribute to alleviate the financial burden on households and businesses in the current situation. The BDBR will continue to permanently monitor the situation and will make all the decisions necessary in its competence to contribute to the proper operation of the economy. Fecha de publicacion."
India,2020-03-27,"Seventh Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2019-20 Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) Reserve Bank of India On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (March 27, 2020) decided to: reduce the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 75 basis points to 4.40 per cent from 5.15 per cent with immediate effect; accordingly, the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate stand reduced to 4.65 per cent from 5.40 per cent; further, consequent upon the widening of the LAF corridor as detailed in the accompanying Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Polices, the reverse repo rate under the LAF stands reduced by 90 basis points to 4.0 per cent. The MPC also decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long as it is necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of coronavirus (COVID-19) on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Assessment Global Economy 2. Global economic activity has come to a near standstill as COVID-19 related lockdowns and social distancing are imposed across a widening2 swathe of affected countries. Expectations of a shallow recovery in 2020 from 2019's decade low in global growth have been dashed. The outlook is now heavily contingent upon the intensity, spread and duration of the pandemic. There is a rising probability that large parts of the global economy will slip into recession. Financial markets have become highly volatile from January onwards due to the outbreak of COVID-19. Panic sell-offs have resulted in wealth destruction in equity markets across advanced and emerging economies alike. In the former, flight to safety has pulled down government bond yields to record lows with some hardening in recent days. In the latter, the rush to exit has rendered fixed income markets illiquid and resulted in firming up of yields. Emerging and advanced economy currencies are experiencing severe depreciation pressure on a daily basis because of fire sales due to extreme risk aversion. At this point, only the US dollar remains safe haven in a highly uncertain outlook. Japanese yen and gold  the other two safe havens till the early part of March  have given way to a flight to cash. International crude prices initially traded with a softening bias from January in anticipation of demand weakening due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Production cut disagreements among key oil producers, however, set off retaliatory supply scale-ups and a price war that plunged international Brent crude prices to a low of US$ 25 per barrel on March 18, 2020. These developments are likely to dampen inflation across advanced and emerging economies. Central banks and governments are in war mode, responding to the situation with several conventional and unconventional measures targeted at easing financial conditions to avoid a demand collapse and to prevent financial markets from freezing up due to illiquidity. Domestic Economy 4. The second advance estimates of the National Statistics Office released in February 2020 implied real GDP growth of 4.7 per cent for Q4:2019-20 within the annual estimate of 5 per cent for the year as a whole. This is now at risk from the pandemic's impact on the economy. High frequency indicators suggest that private final consumption expenditure has been hit hardest, even as gross fixed capital formation has been in contraction since Q2:2019-20. On the supply side, the outlook for agriculture and allied activities appears to be the only silver lining, with foodgrains output at 292 million tonnes being 2.4 per cent higher than a year ago. A pick-up in manufacturing and electricity generation pulled industrial production into positive territory in January 2020 after intermittent contraction and/or lacklustre activity over the past five months; however, more data will need to be watched to assess whether the recent uptick will endure in the face of COVID-19. Meanwhile, most service3 sector indicators for January and February 2020 moderated or declined. Since then anecdotal evidence suggests that several services such as trade, tourism, airlines, the hospitality sector and construction have been further adversely impacted by the pandemic. Dislocations in casual and contract labour would result in losses of activity in other sectors as well. Retail inflation, measured by the consumer price index, peaked in January 2020 and fell by a full percentage point in February 2020 to 6.6 per cent, as the ebbing of onion prices brought down food inflation from double digits in the preceding two months. Price pressures, however, remain firm across protein-rich items, edible oils and pulses; but the shock to demand from COVID-19 may weaken them going forward. While fuel inflation increased sharply in February on the back of the delayed domestic adjustment to international LPG prices, the plunge in international crude prices in March may bring a measure of relief to the extent it is allowed to pass-through. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel eased in February under the weight of softer prices of transport and communication, and personal care. Households' inflation expectations a year ahead softened by 20 bps in the March 2020 round of the Reserve Bank's survey. Domestic financial conditions have tightened considerably, with equity markets facing massive sell-offs by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs). In the bond market too, yields have risen on sustained FPI selling, while redemption pressures, drop in trading activity and generalised risk aversion have pushed up yields to elevated levels in commercial paper, corporate bond and other fixed income segments. In the forex market, the Indian rupee (INR) has been under continuous downward pressure. Under these conditions, the Reserve Bank has endeavoured to keep financial markets liquid, stable and functioning normally. Systemic liquidity surplus, as reflected in net absorptions under the LAF, averaged ₹2.86 lakh crore in March (up to March 25, 2020). In addition, the Reserve Bank undertook unconventional operations in the form of auctions of what is called ‘operation twist' involving the simultaneous sale of short-term government securities (of ₹28,276 crore) and purchase of long-term securities (of ₹40,000 crore), cumulatively injecting a net amount of ₹11,724 crore. The Reserve Bank also conducted five long term repo auctions of 1 year and 3 years tenors of a cumulative amount of ₹1.25 lakh crore so far to inject liquidity and improve monetary transmission. It also conducted two sell-buy swap auctions to inject cumulatively US dollar liquidity into the forex market to the tune of US$ 2.71 billion on March 16 and 23. Open market purchase operations of ₹10,000 crore on March 20 and ₹15,000 crore each on March 24 and March 26 have been conducted to bolster liquidity and smoothen financial conditions.4 7. In the external sector, merchandise exports expanded in February 2020 after posting six consecutive months of contraction. Import growth also moved into positive territory after eight months of continuous decline. Consequently, the trade deficit widened marginally on a year-on-year basis although it was lower than its level a month ago. On March 12, the Reserve Bank released balance of payments data which showed the current account having moved to near balance in Q3:2019-20 with a deficit of only 0.2 per cent of GDP. On the financing side, net FDI inflows at US$ 37.8 billion during April-January 2019-20 were substantially higher than a year ago. Portfolio investment recorded net outflows of US$ 5.2 billion during 2019-20 (up to March 25), down from US$ 6.6 billion a year ago. India's foreign exchange reserves reached a level of US$ 487.2 billion on March 6, 2020  an increase of US$ 74.4 billion over their end-March 2019 level. Outlook 8. In the sixth bi-monthly resolution of February 2020. CPI headline inflation was projected at 6.5 per cent for Q4:2019-20. The prints for January and February 2020 indicate that actual outcomes for the quarter are running 30 bps above projections, reflecting the onion price shock. Looking ahead, food prices may soften even further under the beneficial effects of the record foodgrains and horticulture production, at least till the onset of the usual summer uptick. Furthermore, the collapse in crude prices should work towards easing both fuel and core inflation pressures, depending on the level of the pass-through to retail prices. As a consequence of COVID-19, aggregate demand may weaken and ease core inflation further. Heightened volatility in financial markets could also have a bearing on inflation. Turning to growth, apart from the continuing resilience of agriculture and allied activities, most other sectors of the economy will be adversely impacted by the pandemic, depending upon its intensity, spread and duration. If COVID- 19 is prolonged and supply chain disruptions get accentuated, the global slowdown could deepen, with adverse implications for India. The slump in international crude prices could, however, provide some relief in the form of terms of trade gains. Downside risks to growth arise from the spread of COVID-19 and prolonged lockdowns. Upside growth impulses are expected to emanate from monetary, fiscal and other policy measures and the early containment of COVID-19. The MPC is of the view that macroeconomic risks, both on the demand and supply sides, brought on by the pandemic could be severe. The need of the hour is to do whatever is necessary to shield the domestic economy from the pandemic. Central banks across the world have responded with monetary and regulatory measures  both conventional and unconventional.5 Governments across the world have unleashed massive fiscal measures, including targeted health services support, to protect economic activity from the impact of the virus. To mitigate the economic difficulties arising out of the virus outbreak, the Government of India has announced a comprehensive package of ₹1.70 lakh crore, covering cash transfers and food security, for vulnerable sections of society, including farmers, migrant workers, urban and rural poor, differently abled persons and women. The MPC notes that the Reserve Bank has taken several measures to inject substantial liquidity in the system. Nonetheless, the priority is to undertake strong and purposeful action in order to minimise the adverse macroeconomic impact of the pandemic. It is in this context that the MPC unanimously votes for a sizable reduction in the policy repo rate, but with some differences in the quantum of reduction. Furthermore, the MPC also notes that the Reserve Bank has decided to undertake several measures to further improve liquidity, monetary transmission and credit flows to the economy and provide relief on debt servicing. It also underscores the need for all stakeholders to fight against the pandemic. Banks and other financial institutions should do all they can to keep credit flowing to economic agents facing financial stress on account of the isolation that the virus has imposed. Market participants should work with regulators like the Reserve Bank and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to ensure the orderly functioning of markets in their role of price discovery and financial intermediation. Strong fiscal measures are critical to deal with the situation. All members voted for a reduction in the policy repo rate and maintaining the accommodative stance as long as it is necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target. Dr.Ravindra H. Dholakia. Dr.Janak Raj. Dr.Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted for a 75 bps reduction in the policy repo rate. Dr.Chetan Ghate and Dr.Pami Dua voted for a 50 bps reduction in the policy repo rate. The minutes of the MPC's meeting will be published by April 13, 2020.

Chile,2020-03-31,"Tuesday, 31 March 2020 Monetary Policy Meeting  March 2020 In its monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to lower the monetary policy interest rate by 50 basis points, to 0.50%. The decision was adopted by the unanimous vote of its members. The external scenario has deteriorated significantly after the rapid global expansion of Covid-19. The sanitary control measures implemented around the world have triggered important disruptions in supply and demand, whose effects are being felt already. The uncertainty about the magnitude of the economic impact of the pandemic has favored a substantial increase in the markets' risk aversion. This has reflected on increased demand for safe and short-term assets, escalating volatility and risk indicators, widespread stock market falls, capital outflows from emerging economies, across-the-board depreciation of currencies against the US dollar, and a sharp decline in the prices of commodities, copper included. The monetary and fiscal authorities have launched considerable stimulus plans to address the worsening circumstances, which has eased the markets' reaction in the most recent past. While in January and February activity indicators showed a faster than expected recovery than had been forecast in the December Monetary Policy Report, the sudden change in macroeconomic conditions generated by the Covid-19, including the spread of the pandemic into Chile, leads to assume that the economy entered a process of severe contraction in the second half of March that will extend throughout the second quarter. The markets have been steadily trimming their growth projections for this year and the latest estimates point to a y-o-y fall. The government has announced an important stimulus package that couples with the cut to the MPR and the measures adopted by the Bank to facilitate personal and corporate access to credit. [INF*RES*AS] The local financial market has been aligned with these developments. Major corrections have been observed in the IPSA stock index and the exchange rate, while liquidity and fixed-income interest rates have also fluctuated reflecting the search for safe assets. To facilitate the normal flow of credit and the proper functioning of the markets, the Board, among other measures, extended access to liquidity programs already in place, initiated the purchase of bank bonds from SOMA system participants; established the Conditional Financing Facility for Increased Loans (FCIC) expanding eligible collateral; activated the Liquidity Credit Line (LCL) and relaxed liquidity requirements for maturity mismatches. As of today, all these measures are in operation. In February, annual inflation rose to almost 4% while core inflation remained slightly above 2.5%. This steadily changing scenario significantly reduces medium-term inflationary pressures, given the widening of the activity gap that has resulted. Additionally, the important drop in the oil price counteracts the cost pressures derived from the peso depreciation. Incoming figures of recent days for market inflation expectations have lowered expected levels one year ahead, while two years ahead they are still at 3%. The Board's decision to bring the MPR to its technical minimum of 0.5% is made in a scenario in which medium-term inflationary pressures have dissipated substantially and that the efforts to overcome the sanitary crisis will have major effects on activity and employment, among other variables. Accordingly, the Board estimates that for inflation to converge to the 3% target, monetary policy needs to remain highly expansionary for an extended period. Together with the above, the Board decided to extend the program in place for the purchase of banking bonds by US$ 4 billion and eliminate the maturity constraints of the eligible instruments. Thus, the purchase balance outstanding of that program has changed to an amount of up to US$5.5 billion. The Board will continue to implement every measure necessary to promote the proper functioning of the financial markets and compliance with the Bank's inflationary and financial stability objectives. The March Monetary Policy Report containing the projections and analyses that sustain the Board's decision will be published tomorrow. Wednesday 1 April 2020 at 8:30 AM. The minutes from this monetary policy meeting will be published at 8:30 AM of Thursday 16 April 2020. The next monetary policy meeting will take place on Tuesday 5 and Wednesday 6 May 2020 and the statement thereof will be released on Wednesday 5 at 6:00 PM. The Spanish original prevails."
Egypt,2020-04-02,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release April 02, 2020 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 925 percent, 1025 percent, and 975 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 975 percen. Annual headline urban inflation declined to 53 percent in February 2020 from 72 percent in January 2020, supported by favorable base effect as well as contained underlying inflationary pressure. The decline of annual headline inflation was mainly driven by lower annual food contribution, mainly volatile food items, while the contribution of non-food items remained broadly stabl. Meanwhile annual core inflation declined to 19 percent in February 2020 from 27 percent in January 2020, the lowest rate on recor. Real GDP growth had stabilized around 56 percent in 2019 H2, which was the same level recorded in FY2018/1. Meanwhile the unemployment rate had recorded 80 percent in 2019 Q4 compared to 78 percent in 2019 Q3. Nevertheless, employment had been recovering on a quarterly basis for the fourth consecutive quarte. However the COVID-19 outbreak as well as the associated containment measures induce a considerable disruption to economic activity and financial markets globall. Furthermore international oil prices witnessed substantial decline affected by weaker demand in addition to the lack of agreement between OPEC and non-OPEC members on additional production cut. The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) moved preemptively, within its mandate, to support economic activity especially businesses and household. This should support employment in these exceptional times which is essential in order to avoid a prolonged slowdown in economic activity and help speed the recovery once the outbreak is containe. Against this background, and following the reduction of 300 basis points during the previous unscheduled MPC meeting on March 16, 2020, the MPC decided that keeping key policy rates unchanged remains consistent with achieving the inflation target of 9 percent (±3 percentage points) in 2020 Q4 and price stability over the medium ter. The MPC closely monitors all economic developments and will not hesitate utilize all available tools to support the recovery of economic activity, within its price stability mandate, supported by the previous macroeconomic reform.

Kazakhstan,2020-04-03,"Press release 15 The base rate reduced to 9.5% April 3, 2020 Almaty The National Bank of Kazakhstan has made an unplanned decision to reduce the base rate to the level of 9.5% per annum with the expansion of the corridor to +/- 2 percentage points. Consequently, the rate for the liquidity provision standing facilities is 11.5% and for the liquidity withdrawal standing facilities  7.5%. This decision takes effect from April 6, 2020. The NBK's decisions on the increase of the base rate to 12% and the formation of the tenge exchange rate on the equilibrium level, which took place in March 2020 due to the double drop of oil prices, the uncertainty regarding the further perspectives on OPEC+ agreement and the pandemic of COVID-19 were aimed to stabilize the inflation expectations and to limit the transition of the external shocks to the financial market. With an aim to mitigate the effect of the external shocks the President of Kazakhstan K.K Tokayev has initiated two packages of the anti-crisis stimulus measures in the amount of 4.4 tln tenge to ensure the socio-economic stability in the country. To implement these initiatives the key parameters of the fiscal policy were reconsidered and significant expenses for funding the anti-crisis measures were implied by the Government of Republic of Kazakhstan. In this regard, the NBK believes that the further prolonged maintenance of the base rate on the current level may have the restricting effect on the economic activity. Nevertheless, simultaneous supply and demand shocks of the external sector resulting from the expansion of the COVID-19 pandemic, the dramatic drop of oil price to the long-standing minimum and the limited domestic supply led to the increase of the inflation rate level. As of the end of March 2020, the annual inflation rate amounted to 6.4%, overshooting the target corridor of 4-6%. At the end of the current year we expect that the annual inflation rate will be in the range of 9-11% with the further deceleration in 2021. The estimates of the NBK demonstrate that the economic growth rate in the current year will be negative under the present conditions. The present decision is one of the measures taken by the NBK aimed to ensure the financial stability, to limit the risks for our economy and to encourage its adaptation to the changed conditions of the external and internal environment. The reduction of the base rate in conjunction with other measures taken by the NBK including the expansion of the Program “Economy of simple things” to 1 tln tenge and the adoption of Program of the soft-lending to the entities of the small and medium scale enterprises in the amount of 600 bln. tenge will allow to mitigate the influence of the coronavirus consequences on the Kazakh economy and to support the economic activity. The NBK continuously monitors the internal and external situation and will flexibly adjust its monetary policy should the necessity arise. The NBK has all the required instruments and possibilities to ensure the financial stability and is ready to take the adequate decisions in case of the significant deterioration of the situation in the world economy. The next decision of the National Bank of Kazakhstan on the base rate will be announced on April 27, 2020 at 15:00 Nur-Sultan time."
Israel,2020-04-06,"To put a new monetary instrument into operation: Provision of monetary loans to banks for a term of 3 years, with a fixed interest rate of 0.1 percent. The loans are contingent on extending credit to small and micro businesses. The expansion of the plan through which repo transactions are carried out vis-C 3A 0-vis financial entities, so that the agreements can include corporate bonds (in addition to government bonds) as security. This step will strengthen the plan's support ofliquidity and the orderly functioning of the financial markets. The coronavirus crisis halted the trend of growth and the economy has shifted into contraction. More than one-third of the economy is shut down, private consumption is lower by about one-quarter relative to the pre-crisis period, and approximately 1 million workers, 24 percent of the workforce, have claimed unemployment benefits. According to the Research Department's assessment. GDP contracted by approximately 5 percent in the first quarter (quarterly terms). Based on the Department's macroeconomic forecast, assuming that the main part of the coronavirus restrictions are removed gradually by the end of June, negative growth of approximately 5 percent is expected in 2020, with an unemployment rate of 6 percent (annual average). The beginning of a recovery in the third quarter will lead to growth of 9 percent in 2021, though the unemployment rate is expected to decline gradually and only toward the end of 2021 will it approach the low pre-crisis levels. The debtto GDP ratio is expected to reach about 75 percent in 2020. Note that there is considerable uncertainty regarding the forecast crisis, in view of the lackof clarity about the length and magnitude of the crisis. Global growth is expected to contract markedly in 2020, and the spread of the crisis has led to very strong policy responses by central banks and governments. Commodity prices collapsed by tens of percent. In China, a recovery in economic activity is starting to be observed. The crisis led to a shock in capital markets in Israel and worldwide, with steep declines in equity prices and an increase in volatility and risk. In Israel, the sharp increase in government bond yields and in corporate bond spreads was halted following measures taken by the Bank of Israel and the halt of mutual fund withdrawals. There was exceptionalvolatility in the exchange rate, against the background of dollar liquidity distress in Israel and worldwide. The swap transactions carried out by the Bank of Israel moderated the volatility, and at the end of the period, the shekel had weakened by 5.8 percent against the dollar and by 3.4 percent in terms of the effective exchange rate. The inflation environment that was low even prior to the crisis declined sharply. The 1-year inflation expectations decreased further, but expectations for longer terms remained stable. In the short term there could be difficulty in measuring the inflation rate. In addition, the Committee decided on 2 additional steps:. An expanded explanation of these two steps is published in a separate press release. In view of the magnitude of the crisis's adverse impact on economic activity, the Committee is utilizing a range of tools in order to increase the extent of the monetary policy accommodation and to ensure the orderly functioning of the financial markets. The Committee will expandthe use of the existing tools, including the interest rate tool, and will be able to operate additional ones, to the extent that the crisis lengthens and it is necessary to achieve the monetary policy goals and to moderate the negative economic impact created as a result of the crisis. Full data file. For the file of figures accompanying this notice, clickhere. The coronavirus crisis halted the trend of growth, and in March, the economy started to contract. Approximately 1 million workers claimed unemployment benefits during March, 850,000 more than in February, with 90 percent of them on the basis of being placed on unpaid leave, and the number of people seeking work makes up about 24 percent of the labor force. An analysis of the negative impact on private consumption: in accordance with the magnitude of the Ministry of Health's limitations on the various consumption items and the weight of each item in the household consumption basket: indicates that private consumption is about 27 percent lower than its pre-crisis level. Anindustry-by-industry analysis of the impact of the crisis on GDP and employment in the economy's industries indicates that given the current guidance by the Ministry of Health, the total adverse impact on GDP is about 37 percent. The scope of the shutdown is particularly high in industries in which wages are low, so that the abilityof workers in those industries to bear a long shutdown is relatively limited. The same analysis indicates that the negative impact on the labor input is about 45 percent, and in addition to employees who were laid off or were placed on unpaid leave, it reflects the scope of part time work among workers who remain employed or who were placed on paid leave. These estimates suggest that in the first quarter, the economy contracted by 5 percent compared with the previous quarter (in quarterly terms). The Bank of Israel's Companies Survey points to a sharp decline in the net balance of the business sector, with most industries reporting a sharp negative impact on demand, while the negative impact on supply is focused on the hotels industry (against the background of financing constraints) and construction (a shortage of workers). Based on the Research Department's macroeconomic forecast, assuming that there won't be a further increase in the severity of the coronavirus restrictions in Israel beyond those already imposed, and that the main part of the limitations that are barriers to economic activity will be removed gradually by the end of June, the economyis expected to contract by 5.3 percent in 2020, and to grow by 8.7 percent in 2021, though the unemployment rate is expected to decline gradually and only return to the low pre-crisis levels toward the end of 2021. The government budget deficit is expected to increase to 11 percent of GDP in 2020, taking into account the budget plan announced by the government to deal with the crisisand the expected decline in revenues due to a slowdown in activity. The debt toGDP ratio is expected to increase to 75 percent. The Research Department emphasized that the crisis is unprecedented and it is therefore difficult to assess the extent and magnitude of its economic ramifications, and it assesses that a deferral of an additional month in removing the limitations and a further deterioration in world trade will lead to contraction of 8.8 percent in GDPin 2020, and will increase the average unemployment rate for 2020 by 2 additional percentage points. In March, there were shocks in capital markets in Israel and abroad. Equity market indices in major economies declined by approximately 30 percent, and afterward most of them offset part of the decline against the background of steps by central banks and the governments. Yields in government and corporate bond markets were particularly volatile and there was a sharp rise in risk spreads. In Israel, the Tel Aviv 35 Index declined by approximately 25 percent, and the steep increase in government bond yields and in corporate bond spreads was halted after the announcement of the Bank of Israel's program in the government bond market and the halt in the trend of mutual fund withdrawals, which at its height reached NIS 8 billion per day. Beforethe outbreak of the coronavirus crisis, there was an additional decline in the inflation environment. The CPI declined by 0.4 percent in January and by 0.1 percent in February, so that the year over year inflation rate continued to fall, reaching 0.1 percent, with a moderate decrease in inflation expectations, from all sources, as well. With the outbreak of the crisis, 1-year inflation expectations declined further. While inflation expectations derived from the capital market are apparently impacted by trading conditions in the bond market, there was a decline in expectations from the other sources as well, partly as a result of the rapid decrease in global prices of oil and other commodities. Expectations for longer terms did not change markedly. Although the adverse impact in the supply chain of many goods may lead to price increases from the supply side, the effect of the decrease in demand is apparently more notable, and is expected to lead to a decline in inflation in the coming months. The depreciation will offset the forces for a decline in inflation. However, a methodological difficulty is expected in calculating the CPI and in analyzing the meaning of the inflation rate so long as the strict limitations on economic activity lead to numerous goods and services not being consumed, and their prices not being able to be measured (this difficulty is relevant to 20 percent of the weight of CPI components). There was a sharp change in the composition of households' consumption basket. There was anomalous volatility in the exchange rate during March, against the background of the dollar liquidity distress resulting from dollar margin calls after the sharp declines in global equity markets. From the previous interest rate decision through March 17 th, the shekel weakened by 11 percent in effective exchange rate terms. However, after the Bank of Israelconducted the shekel/dollar swap transactions, the volatility declined and the shekel weakness moderated to about 5.8 percent against the dollar and 3.4 percent in terms of the effective exchange rate since the previous interest rate decision. The depreciation is expected to support the profitability of exports, particularly manufacturing exports. Aroundthe world, more than 1 million people have already contracted the coronavirus and tens of thousands have died, and it remains difficult to estimate the magnitude of the negative economic impact. According to assessments by the international institutions, global growth is expected to contract markedly in 2020 and a very sharp decline in world trade is expected, but the range of the forecasts is extremely wide. Sentiment indices also point to contraction in activity. In China, the slowdown in the spread of the virus enabled authorities there to reduce the restrictions on the population, and data indicate a gradual return of economic activity, so that moderate but positive growth is expected in 2020. The spread of the crisis led to a sharp policy response by central banks and governments. Most central banks reduced interest rates markedly and adopted a range of expansionary measures and supply of liquidity to the markets. Governments announced extensive plans to expand public expenditure, compensation for those adversely impacted by the crisis, and the extension of credit to the business sector. The slowdown in economic activity led to a sharp decline in commodity prices, and the price of oil dropped by tens of percent, against the background as well of a lack of agreement between the main oil producers to cut output. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on April 20, 2020. The next decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Monday.

Hungary,2020-04-07,"In the current extraordinary economic circumstances, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank's mandate is still to achieve and maintain price stability, to preserve financial stability, as well as to support the Government's economic policy. Consistent with this, mitigating the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the real economy and financial markets and creating the conditions for restarting the economy have become the MNB's key priorities. The MNB has recently responded to the emerging challenges by taking a series of coordinated measures, which will be complemented by additional actions to address the latest developments in money markets, the government securities market and the real economy. In particular, the MNB has adjusted its policy instruments and modified its operational framework. These changes will allow the MNB to provide liquidity to the major sub-markets and to influence monetary conditions in a targeted manner. At its current meeting, the Monetary Council decided to make the interest rate corridor symmetrical. The Monetary Council left the base rate and the overnight deposit rate unchanged at 0.9 percent and -0.05 percent, respectively, and raised the overnight and one-week collateralised lending rates to 1.85 percent. The one-week deposit rate is currently still equal to the 0.9 percent base rate; however, the Monetary Council decided to allow the interest rate on the instrument to deviate from the base rate upward or downward within the interest rate corridor. The Bank will set the interest rate on the instrument each weak, at the time of the actual tender's announcement. The Monetary Council also decided to launch a government security purchase programme in the secondary market to restore the stable liquidity position of the government securities market, and to relaunch its mortgage bond purchase programme to improve the long-term supply of funding to the banking sector. Details of the programmes will be published later. Consistent with the changes to the MNB's monetary policy instruments, from the second quarter of 2020 the Council will not set a target amount of banking sector liquidity to be crowded out of the instruments bearing interest at the base rate. By changing its policy instruments, the MNB has increased its room for monetary policy manoeuvre, so as to be able to address money market challenges in a flexible and timely manner. To ensure access to required, affordable funding for domestic small and medium-sized enterprises available for a wide variety of purposes, the Monetary Council will launch the Funding for Growth Scheme Go! on 20 April 2020, raising the current allocation amount by HUF 1,000 billion. Including HUF 500 billion undrawn under the FGS fix, the MNB will make available up to HUF 1,500 billion of cheap and stable source of lending to the SME sector under the FGS Go!. The new Scheme is identical to the earlier phases of the FGS in terms of its key parameters and the method of implementation. The MNB will continue to provide refinancing loans to credit institutions at a zero interest rate, and interest to be paid by SMEs will continue to be maximum 2.5 percent. Investment loans (including leasing) will still be available; however, in order to secure the financing of protracted investment projects with a slower payback period, the maximum maturity of refinancing loans will be set at 20 years. To ensure the liquidity needs of enterprises, it will be possible to provide working capital loans, with a wide range of purposes for maturities up to three years. In addition, debtors will have the chance to redeem earlier loans, in order to reduce their debt service burden. To preserve the stability of larger participants of the SME sector, the maximum amount of loan available for an SME will be HUF 20 billion. The time for banks to make credit decisions will be limited to two weeks, in order to ensure that funding is made available for companies as soon as possible. After the last crisis, the FGS has played a crucial role in avoiding a credit crunch and turning around the declining trend in lending to SMEs since 2013. The central bank transforms and extends the Scheme this time with the same view: to provide SMEs with the necessary funding and prevent credit market disruptions. The FGS has become a very popular and well-known credit product to SMEs and financial institutions in recent years; therefore, it may remain a key instrument to satisfy changed demand for loans in the coming period. The total amount available under the Bank's corporate bond purchase programme, the Bond Funding for Growth Scheme, will remain unchanged at HUF 450 billion. Half of the total amount has been utilised, and as a result, over HUF 200 billion is still available for the MNB to purchase bonds issued by non-financial corporations headquartered in Hungary. Although the amount available under the Bond Funding for Growth Scheme is currently sufficient, the MNB may help increase liquidity further in the corporate bond market by modifying certain conditions of the Scheme. Raising the Bank's maximum amount of exposure to a given group of corporations from HUF 20 billion to HUF 50 billion will help the corporate sector rely more on other methods of funding as an alternative to bank loans. Increasing the maturities of securities eligible for purchase under the Scheme from 10 years to 20 years will create the opportunity to provide the corporate sector with sustainable, stable and long-term funding, similarly to European competitors. The Bank will sterilise the additional money created under the FGS Go! and BGS using the preferential deposit facility. As a result, the schemes are expected to have a neutral effect in terms of monetary policy. To encourage credit institutions to maintain their lending activity despite growing credit risks, the preferential deposit facility will bear tiered interest for a transitional period beginning from 4 May 2020 until the end of June 2021, in line with the Monetary Council's decision. The MNB will pay an interest rate of 4 percent, higher than the base rate, for additions to the stocks of loans and bonds made after 7 April 2020 under the FGS Go! and the BGS. The Magyar Nemzeti Bank assesses continuously the incoming data and prospects in this volatile environment. In line with its statutory mandate, the Bank will use every instrument at its disposal to achieve price stability and to support the Hungarian economic and financial system."
Poland,2020-04-08,"Warsaw, 8 April 2020 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 8 April 2020 The Council decided to cut the NBP reference rate by 0.50 percentage points, i.e. to 0.50%. At the same time, the Council set the remaining NBP interest rates at the following levels: ▪ lombard rate at 1.00%; ▪ deposit rate at 0.00%; ▪ rediscount rate at 0.55%; ▪ discount rate at 0.60%. NBP will continue  apart from basic operations  to provide liquidity to the banking sector using repo transactions. At the same time. NBP will purchase government securities and government-guaranteed debt securities on the secondary market as part of the structural operations. The timing and scale of the operations will depend on the market conditions. Furthermore. NBP will offer bill discount credit aimed at refinancing loans granted to enterprises by banks. The incoming information suggest that COVID-19 pandemic and measures introduced to counteract its further spread contribute to the fast deepening fall in activity in many economies as well as to a very strong deterioration of sentiment. At the same time, global economic growth forecasts, including those for Poland's main trading partners, have been substantially revised downwards. In order to mitigate the negative economic effects of the pandemic and ensure conditions for fast economic recovery after current disruptions abate, many countries introduce wide-ranging fiscal stimulus packages. Chinese economy shows first signs of economic recovery after a strong fall in activity at the begging of the year. Many central banks have substantially eased monetary conditions by lowering interest rates, providing liquidity to the banking sector and pursuing asset purchases. Recent forecasts indicate that after the abatement of the current disruptions the global economic conditions should improve, supported by fiscal measures and monetary easing. At the same time, the pace and scale of the improvement will depend on the impact of disruptions on economic agents' income and sentiment in the longer run. In the financial markets  due to the globally deteriorating economic outlook  risk aversion remains high leading to increased price volatility of many assets and tightened financial conditions. At the same time, global oil prices have fallen significantly since the begging of the year, accompanied by decreasing prices of some food commodities. In Poland, economic conditions in the first months of the year were relatively favourable. However, measures aimed at limiting the spread of epidemic contribute to the reduction of economic activity. In the short run, the scale of activity drop could be very sizable. This will be accompanied by a deteriorating situation in the labour market and a fall of disposable income of households. Further ahead, economic activity should, however, gradually recover, supported by fiscal measures introduced in Poland and many other countries as well as strong macroeconomic fundamentals of the Polish economy related to its low internal and external indebtedness and high competitiveness together with geographical and sectoral diversification of Polish exports. Expected global economic downturn together with lower commodity prices and weaker domestic demand will contribute to a marked deceleration of price growth. Consequently, despite recent monetary policy easing introduced by NBP, the risk of inflation falling below the NBP inflation target in the monetary policy transmission horizon prevails. Considering the above-mentioned circumstances, the Council decided to ease monetary conditions. Thus, the Council cut the NBP interest rates further. NBP will purchase government securities and government- guaranteed debt securities on the secondary market as part of the structural operations. These operations are aimed at changing the long-term liquidity structure in the banking sector, ensuring the liquidity in secondary markets for the purchased securities and enhancing the impact of the NBP interest rate cuts on the economy, i.e. strengthening the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Furthermore NBP will offer bill discount credit aimed at refinancing loans granted to enterprises by banks. The measures undertaken by NBP are aimed at easing financing conditions in the economy and mitigating the negative economic impact of pandemic, thus being conducive to maintaining macroeconomic and financial stability. Those measures will also contribute to recovery in domestic economic activity after the abatement of current disturbances. Consequently, they will reduce the risk of inflation falling below the NBP inflation target in the medium term."
South Korea,2020-04-09,"Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 0.75% for the intermeeting period. This press release is the English version of the Bank of Korea's policy statement. In the case of any inconsistency, the original version in Korean will prevail. The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 0.75% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Board considers that the global economy has contracted significantly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Volatility in global financial markets has increased sharply. Stock prices in major countries have fallen considerably while government bond yields and exchange rates have fluctuated widely, due to concerns of a recession and the sharp drop in global oil prices. Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the pathway of the pandemic, as well as by national policy responses and their effects. The Board judges that economic growth in Korea has slowed considerably. Consumption has decreased substantially and the recovery in facilities investment has been subdued. The correction in construction investment has continued while exports have declined slightly. As for employment, the number of persons employed had continued to rise at a high rate until February, but the number of persons on temporary leave has increased due to the contraction in economic activity. GDP growth is projected to fall considerably below the February forecast of 2.1%, and uncertainties around the future path of GDP growth are also judged to be very high. Consumer price inflation has slowed to the 1% level due to slower growth in the prices of industrial products. Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) has moved down slightly within the mid-0% range, and the inflation expectations of the general public have remained at the upper-1% level. It is forecast that consumer price inflation and core inflation will run considerably below the February projection (1.0% and 0.7%, respectively) due to the drop in global oil prices and weakening demand-side inflationary pressure. In domestic financial markets, stock prices have fallen sharply due to the spread of COVID-19 and heightened volatility in global financial markets. The Korean won to US dollar exchange rate rose steeply but then decreased after the establishment of a currency swap arrangement with the Federal Reserve, while long-term market interest rates have fluctuated around the lower-1% level. The rate of household loan growth has risen, while the rate of increase in housing prices has moderated since mid-March. The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth is sustained and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. In view of the mounting economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Board will conduct monetary policy in an accommodative manner in order to mitigate downside risks to the economy and ease volatility in financial markets. In this process it will judge whether to adjust the degree of monetary policy accommodation, while thoroughly assessing the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak, its impact on the domestic economy and financial markets, and changes in financial stability."
Peru,2020-04-09,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT - APRIL 2020 BCRP LOWERS REFERENCE RATE TO 0.25% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to lower the reference interest rate by 100 basis points, from 1.25 to 0.25 percent, in light of the following developments: Annual inflation is expected to approach the lower bound of the target range over the forecast horizon due to a significant weaking in domestic demand. Monthly inflation was 0.65 percent in March; consequently, year-on-year inflation decreased from 1.9 percent in February to 1.8 percent in March. With monthly inflation excluding food and energy at 0.42 percent in Februrary, the year-on-year figure decreased from 2.3 percent in February to 1.7 percent in March. One-year ahead expected inflation as of March was 2.0 percent. Economic activity is being severely affected by simultaneous temporary supply and demand shocks. The risks to global economic activity have increased, including the possibility of a global recession in the first half of the year. The BCRP will continue to take the necessary steps to support the payments system and the credit chain. In this context, the BCRP has implemented liquidity easing operations such as security and currency repos in March and so far in April. The BCRP has several additional liquidity injection instruments. The Board pays close attention to new information on inflation and its determinants to continue expanding monetary stimulus under different modalities. In the same meeting the Board also decided to reduce the following interest rates on BCRP discount window operations in domestic currency: Overnight deposits: 0.15 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 0.50 percent per year. The BCRP Board's next monetary policy meeting will take place on May 7, 2020."
Mongolia,2020-04-13,"MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Lowering the policy rate and extending the maturity of consumer loans Number: 2020/02 Date: 13th of April 2020 The Monetary Policy Committee held an unscheduled meeting on the 13th of April 2020. The Committee decided to lower the policy rate by 1 percentage point to 9 percent and to extend the maturity limit on consumer loans up to 12 months for lenders experiencing difficulty in their loan repayments. Annual headline inflation reached 6.4 percent nationwide and 6.9 percent in Ulaanbaatar city as of February 2020. The demand induced inflation is expected to be subdued as the economic growth slacks this year. The supply-driven volatility in inflation is anticipated to decline if the supply of some imported foods remains stable, along with a falling domestic price of fuel following the drop in global oil price. The continued spread of COVID-19 has changed the external and domestic economic conditions in a short span of time, aggravating uncertainties, contracting business activities in the economy, weakening domestic demand, and resulting in difficulties in loan repayments. Therefore, necessary monetary and macroprudential policy measures are being implemented to lessen the consequences of difficulties triggered by the disease and to support economic activities. Considering the current macroeconomic and financial outlook, its prospects, and uncertainties in the domestic and external environment, the Monetary Policy Committee decided on the comprehensive policy measure of lowering the policy rate to stimulate economic growth and extending the maturity on consumer loans once up to 12 months for lenders experiencing difficulties, hence reducing the monthly loan repayments. The monetary policy decision is aimed at ensuring economic and financial stability while keeping the inflation rate around the target rate. Extracts of the meeting minutes will be released in two weeks on the Bank of Mongolia's official website. MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE."
South Africa,2020-04-14,"South African Reserve Bank PRESS STATEMENT EMBARGO DELIVERY 14 April 2020 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the March meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), the Covid-19 pandemic has spread globally and its impact is being felt through all economies. Current estimates from the IMF show global growth contracting this year by about 2.9%.1 Economic contractions are expected to be deepest in the second quarter of 2020, with some recovery expected in the third quarter of the year. The strength of the recovery into the fourth quarter and 2021 will depend on how quickly countries are able to open up for economic activity safely, requiring sustainable social distancing rules, safety processes put in place by businesses and public institutions, and capacity of hospitals to accommodate those in need. Current indications from the World health 1 Global growth in the QPM model is a trade-weighted average. MPC Statement 14 April 2020 Page 1 Organisation are that the pandemic is unlikely to end quickly, with shorter, less virulent waves hitting over time. The uncertainties of the crisis have led to extremely high volatility in financial asset prices, with sharp and deep market sell-offs followed by a partial recovery. At this stage, the sustainability of that recovery remains uncertain, and global markets remain in risk-off mode. This has implications for emerging markets and South Africa in particular, as investor appetite for rand-denominated equities and bonds is expected to remain weak. Policy responses to the crisis have generally been robust, with the magnitudes dependent on the degree of policy space available to countries. The US Federal Reserve has taken further steps to expand its balance sheet. The European Central Bank (ECB) has made similar commitments. Emerging and developing economies generally have less policy space available and credit is more expensive, and for this reason, the International Financial Institutions (the IMF, the World Bank) and others have made available extraordinary levels of emergency financial support. The Covid-19 outbreak will have a major health and social impact, and forecasting domestic economic activity presents unprecedented uncertainty. With that in mind, the Bank expects GDP in 2020 to contract by 6.1%, compared to the -0.2% expected just three weeks ago. South Africa's lockdown has been extended by an additional 14 days, bringing the total lockdown period to 35 days. Both the supply and demand effects of this extension reduce growth and deepen it in the short-term, as businesses stay shut for longer and households with income spend less. This will likely also increase job losses, with MPC Statement 14 April 2020 Page 2. This will likely also increase job losses, with MPC Statement 14 April 2020 Page 2 further consequences for aggregate demand. The impacts will be particularly severe for small businesses, and individuals with earnings in the informal sector. Some factors will support growth, including where businesses are able to open under the current rules, new jobs being created to service more needs under the lockdown, and sustained government spending, both through normal operations and crisis- related spending and programmes. The faster the global economy recovers from the crisis, as China appears to be gradually doing now, the more positive growth spillovers will strengthen for South Africa, including healthy price levels for commodity exports. Nonetheless, prices for many commodities have fallen as a result of weaker demand globally. The spot price for Brent crude oil is currently around $31 per barrel, despite a new agreement reached by Opec and other producers to make large oil production cuts. For our forecast, the Brent crude oil price is expected to average $42 per barrel in 2020 and $45 per barrel in 2021, very close to the March forecast. As noted earlier, while advanced economies conduct exceptionally accommodative policies, global financing conditions are no longer supportive of emerging market currency and asset values. Credit risk has risen back to 2008 levels and about R100 billion of local assets have been sold by non-resident investors. The rand has depreciated by 22.6% against the USD since January and by 17.3% since the March meeting of the MPC. The implied starting point for the rand forecast is R17.80 to the US dollar, compared with R15.40 at the time of the previous meeting. Slightly lower oil prices and sharply lower domestic growth pulls down on the inflation forecast, while negative global sentiment and fiscal risks have led to equally aggressive currency depreciation and upside pressure on inflation. The timing and size of these contradictory impulses suggests that they are not perfectly offsetting. MPC Statement 14 April 2020 Page 3. The timing and size of these contradictory impulses suggests that they are not perfectly offsetting. MPC Statement 14 April 2020 Page 3 with weaker inflation in the near term likely giving way to higher inflation later in the forecast period. The Bank' s headline consumer price inflation forecast averages 3.6% for 2020, 4.5% for 2021, and 4. The overall risks to the inflation outlook at this time appear to be to the downside. Electricity pricing remains a concern but has moderated somewhat. Risks to inflation from recent currency depreciation are expected to be muted as pass-through is slow. Global producer price inflation has decelerated. Lower oil prices will reduce petrol prices in the near term. International food prices have eased and local food price inflation is expected to remain low, in part due to higher domestic production levels. Expectations of future inflation broadly remain around the mid-point of the band, although market-based expectations have recently ticked up in response to the depreciation of the currency.2 Weaker domestic growth and greater fiscal risks have resulted in a downgrade by Moody's credit rating agency and confirmation of a negative outlook by Fitch, a weaker currency and higher borrowing costs for government, banks and firms. South Africa's risk profile has increased. Despite this rise in country risk, the Committee notes that the more prolonged lockdown and slower recovery creates downside risk to inflation and allows further 2 The latest Bureau for Economic Research (BER) survey has expectations for 2020 down by 0.4ppts to 4.4% and to .4.6% (from 5.0%) for 2021. Five-year-ahead inflation expectations also eased to 4.7% (from 4.9%). Market analysts (Reuters Econometer) expect inflation to be, 4.2% (from 4.4%) for 2020, 4.6% (from 4.7%) in 2021 and 4.5% (from 4.6%) for 2022. Market-based rates are calculated from the break-even inflation rate, which is the yield differential between conventional and inflation-linked bonds. These sit at 4.7% for the 5-year and well over 6% on the 10-year breakeven. MPC Statement 14 April 2020 Page 4 space for monetary policy to respond to the virus-induced demand shock to the economy. Barring severe and persistent currency and oil shocks, inflation is expected to be well contained, remaining below the midpoint of the target in 2020 and close to the midpoint in 2021. Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to cut the repo rate by 100 basis points. This takes the repo rate to 4.25% per annum, with effect from 15 April 2020. The implied path of policy rates over the forecast period generated by the Quarterly Projection Model indicates five repo rate cuts of 25 basis points extending into the first quarter of 2021. Monetary policy can ease financial conditions and improve the resilience of households and firms to the economic implications of Covid-19. In addition to continued easing of interest rates, the Bank has taken steps to ensure adequate liquidity in money and government bond markets and to ease capital requirements to free capital for onlending by financial institutions. Each of these steps make more capital available to households and firms. Monetary policy however cannot on its own improve the potential growth rate of the economy or reduce fiscal risks. These should be addressed by implementing prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms that lower costs generally, and increase investment opportunities, potential growth and job creation. Such steps will further reduce existing constraints on monetary policy and its transmission to lending. Global economic and financial conditions are expected to remain highly volatile for the foreseeable future. In this highly uncertain environment, future decisions will continue MPC Statement 14 April 2020 Page 5. In this highly uncertain environment, future decisions will continue MPC Statement 14 April 2020 Page 5 to be highly data dependent, sensitive to the balance of risks to the outlook and will seeks to look through temporary price shocks. As usual, the repo rate projection from the QPM remains a broad policy guide which can change from meeting to meeting in response to changing data and risks.

Philippines,2020-04-15,"In its meeting on 16 April 2020, the Monetary Board assessed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Philippine economy. During the meeting, the Monetary Board decided to cut the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) facility by 50 basis points (bps) to 2.75 percent, effective Friday, 17 April 2020. The interest rates on the overnight lending and deposit facilities were reduced to 3.25 percent and 2.25 percent, respectively. This Monetary Board decision substitutes for the scheduled monetary policy meeting on 21 May 2020. According to BSP Governor Benjamin E Diokno, “The off-cycle rate cut is meant to strongly encourage lending to various sectors, especially the most vulnerable, amid the COVID-19 pandemic.”. “Knowing that monetary policy works with a lag, it is better for the Monetary Board to act now rather than later,” BSP Governor Diokno said. In addition, the Monetary Board approved a package of measures to further reduce the financial burden on loans to micro-, small-, and medium-scale enterprises (MSMEs). In particular, loans granted to MSMEs shall be counted as part of banks' compliance with reserve requirements. The BSP will subsequently issue the detailed guidelines on this and other related measures. The Monetary Board observed that the COVID-19 health crisis has severely disrupted economic activity across the country. Meanwhile, the outbreak continues to worsen overseas, thus, sharply reducing prospects for global economic growth for the rest of the year. The Monetary Board also assessed that it would take time before the situation stabilizes. Given these developments, the Monetary Board believes that a further reduction in the policy interest rate as well as increased support for lending to MSMEs would ensure adequate liquidity in the financial system and help reduce borrowing costs. These measures should thus mitigate the adverse impact of the outbreak on the economy by reinforcing the health and fiscal measures already being rolled out by the National Government. The monetary initiatives will also quicken economic recovery as the pandemic fades. Looking ahead, the BSP will continue to support urgent and carefully coordinated measures with other government agencies in responding to the needs of Filipino households and businesses amid these challenging times. Going forward, the BSP stands prepared to use its full range of monetary instruments and to deploy regulatory relief measures as needed in line with its price and financial stability mandates."
Pakistan,2020-04-16,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement April 16, 2020. At its last meeting on 24th March 2020, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) noted the worsening outlook for global and domestic economic activity in the wake of the Corona pandemic. Given the unfolding situation, the MPC noted that it “remains ready to take whatever further actions become necessary in response to the evolving economic impact of the Coronavirus. Since the last MPC meeting, the global and domestic outlook has further deteriorated. The world economy is expected to enter into the sharpest downturn since the Great Depression, contracting by as much as percent in 2020, according to projections released this week by the IMF. This is much deeper recession than the.07 percent contraction during the global financial crisis in 2009. Moreover there are severe risks of worse outcome. In addition, global oil prices have plummeted further, with futures markets suggesting low prices will persist. Domestically high-frequency indicators of activity―including retail sales, credit card spending, cement production, export orders, tax collections, and mobility data from Google's recently introduced Community Mobility Reports―suggest significant slowdown in most parts of the economy in recent weeks. On the inflation front, both the March CPI out-turn and more recent weekly SPI releases in April also show marked reduction in inflation momentum. While there is exceptionally high uncertainty about the severity and duration of the Coronavirus shock, the developments discussed above imply further downward revision in the outlook for growth and inflation. The economy is expected to contract by -1. percent in FY20 before recovering to around percent growth in FY21. Inflation is expected to be close to the lower end of the previously announced 11-12 percent range this fiscal year, and to fall to 7-9 percent range next fiscal year. While there are some upside risks to headline inflation in case of temporary supply disruptions or food price shocks, these are unlikely to generate strong second-round effects due to the weakness of the economy. Similarly the inflationary impact of the recent exchange rate depreciation is expected to be contained given low import demand and falling global prices. In light of this reduction in growth and inflation expectations, the MPC decided at its emergency meeting today, to cut the policy rate by further 200 basis points to percent. This reduces forward looking real interest rates (defined as the policy rate less expected inflation) to around zero, which is about the middle of the range across most emerging markets. The MPC was of the view that this action would cushion the impact of the Coronavirus shock on growth and employment, including by easing borrowing costs and the debt service burden of households and firms, while also maintaining financial stability. It would also help ensure that economic activity is better placed to recover when the pandemic subsides. The MPC highlighted that this rate cut would complement other measures recently taken by the SBP to support the economy, including concessional financing to companies that do not lay off workers, one-year extension in principal payments, doubling of the period for rescheduling of loans from 90 to 180 days, and concessional financing for hospitals and medical centers incurring expenses to combat the Coronavirus pandemic.

Mexico,2020-04-21,"Banco de Mexico's Governing Board decided to lower the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 50 basis points to 6%. It also adopted additional measures to foster an orderly functioning of financial markets, strengthen the credit channels and provide liquidity for the sound development of the financial system. In view of the complex economic and financial situation worldwide. Banco de Mexico has been closely monitoring the behavior of domestic financial markets, economic activity and inflation, in order to take the necessary actions in a timely manner. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures adopted to prevent its spread have affected world economic activity considerably. This has led to significant revisions of economic expectations, which incorporate a strong contraction of productive activity during the first half of 2020. In turn, this has led to a sharp fall in commodity prices, especially of crude oil. All of these factors have led several central banks of advanced and emerging economies to significantly lower their interest rates and to implement other extraordinary measures to foster the proper functioning of their financial markets. Likewise, several countries have implemented fiscal stimulus measures to mitigate the adverse effects on employment and on households and firms' income. In this context, global financial conditions have deteriorated significantly, which has generated a recomposition of investors' portfolio towards lower risk assets and to a reduction in holdings of emerging economy assets. This adjustment has led to a depreciation of these economies' currencies and to a high volatility in their foreign exchange markets, including the Mexican peso. In the local government bond market, after having increased significantly, interest rates have adjusted downwards, while remaining volatile. Although domestic financial markets have shown a slight improvement, significant risks to their performance persist. Moreover, three agencies downgraded the sovereign and Pemex's credit ratings, and two of them ranked the latter below investment grade. It is estimated that the negative effects on domestic economic activity resulting from the pandemic may lead to an important contraction of economic activity in Mexico during the first half of the year. Although the magnitude and duration of the effects of the pandemic are still unknown, and since available information is still limited, initial estimates suggest that during the first half of 2020 GDP could fall more than 5% as compared to the same period of the previous year. It is clear that slack conditions are widening considerably, in a context in which the balance of risks for growth is significantly biased to the downside. Inflation would be subject to pressures: to the downside, those stemming from the widening of the negative output gap, and, in the short term, from the decline in energy prices, particularly of gasoline; to the upside, those resulting from the depreciation of the exchange rate, depending on its magnitude and persistence. Although these factors might impact headline inflation at different moments, it is expected to converge to Banco de Mexico's target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates. Nevertheless, uncertainty as to the balance of risks for inflation has increased significantly. 1 Considering the risks resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic for inflation, economic activity and financial markets, major challenges arise for monetary policy and for the economy in general. In light of the foreseen implications, and with the presence of all its members. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board decided unanimously to lower the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 50 basis points to a level of 6%. The Governing Board also decided to implement additional measures to foster an orderly behavior of financial markets, strengthen the credit channels and provide liquidity for the sound development of the financial system. The Governing Board will take the necessary actions on the basis of incoming information so that the policy rate is consistent with the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to Banco de Mexico's target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates. Perseverance in strengthening the macroeconomic fundamentals and adopting the necessary actions, regarding both monetary and fiscal policies, will contribute to a better adjustment of domestic financial markets and of the economy as a whole."
Turkiye,2020-04-22,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to reduce the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) from 9.75 percent to 8.75 percent. As developments regarding the spread of the coronavirus substantially weaken global growth outlook, central banks in advanced and emerging economies continue to take expansionary measures. The pandemic disease is closely monitored for its evolving global impact on capital flows, financial conditions, international trade and commodity prices. Having displayed a strong upward trend in January and February, thanks to the improvement in financial conditions, economic activity has started to weaken in mid-March due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on external trade, tourism and domestic demand. In order to contain negative effects of the pandemic on the Turkish economy, it is of crucial importance to ensure the healthy functioning of financial markets, the credit channel and firms' cash flows. In this respect, recent monetary and fiscal measures will contribute to financial stability and post-pandemic recovery by supporting the potential output of the economy. Current account balance, which recently recorded significant improvement, is expected to follow a moderate course throughout the year due to the restraining effects of commodity prices and imports. Developments in inflation expectations, domestic demand conditions and producer prices have contributed to a mild trend in core inflation indicators. Despite the recent depreciation in the Turkish lira due to global developments, continued sharp decline in international commodity prices, especially crude oil and metal prices, affects inflation outlook favorably. While the rise in unit costs resulting from declining production and sales is closely monitored, the disinflationary effects of aggregate demand conditions are estimated to have increased. In this respect, it is considered that risks on the year-end inflation projection are on the downside. Accordingly, the Committee decided to make a 100 basis point cut in the policy rate. The Committee assesses that maintaining a sustained disinflation process is a key factor for achieving lower sovereign risk, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery. Keeping the disinflation process in track with the targeted path requires the continuation of a cautious monetary stance. In this respect, monetary stance will be determined by considering the indicators of the underlying inflation trend to ensure the continuation of the disinflation process. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability and financial stability objectives. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Ukraine,2020-04-23,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to cut the key policy rate to 8%. The continued monetary easing aims to support the economy during the period of pandemic and quarantine. In MarchApril, inflation was lower than expected, despite the temporary price growth in the first weeks of the quarantine. Last month, consumer inflation declined to 2.3% yoy. Price growth was restrained by three major factors: lower global energy prices, the residual effects of last year's appreciation of the hryvnia, and a larger supply of raw foods. These factors outweighed the opposite pressure on prices from the weakening of the domestic currency in March and the panic buying of some goods after the quarantine was imposed. According to preliminary data from NBU online monitoring, inflation will remain low in April. High demand for basic goods and unrest on the FX market caused by psychological factors waned quickly. As a result, prices for most food products and medicines, which had grown in the first weeks of the quarantine, have declined in recent weeks. In 2020, inflation will remain within the target range of 5% +/- 1 pp. This will not be impeded by monetary and fiscal support to the economy. Inflation will accelerate moderately in the coming months, to reach 6% at the end of 2020, thus remaining within the target range. Fiscal and monetary policy measures that are aimed to support businesses and households will partially offset the decline in consumer demand. However, consumer demand will remain subdued for long after the quarantine ends, keeping inflation from growing above the target level this year. Inflation will also be contained by declining global energy prices, which will continue to influence domestic fuel prices. At the same time, the increase in inflation compared with the current level will be primarily driven by a pass through from the recent depreciation of the hryvnia. In Q1 2021, inflation will temporarily deviate from the target range against a low comparison base. Afterwards, it will decrease and stabilize at the medium-term target of 5%. This level will be achieved thanks to the NBU's prudent monetary policy and a more restrained fiscal policy after the pandemic ends and economic activity recovers. The economy of Ukraine will contract by 5.0% in 2020 in the wake of the quarantine imposed to overcome the pandemic and due to the global crisis. However, it will resume growth at round 4% in the following years. The adverse impact of the pandemic on the Ukrainian economy is expected to be relatively short-term, but strong. The quarantine has already affected business activity, consumption, and employment. A decrease in global demand has also limited export opportunities for Ukraine. According to NBU estimates, the effect of these factors will be the most pronounced in Q2 2020. A gradual lifting of quarantine restrictions will allow the economy to recover in H2 2020. Loose fiscal and monetary policies will contribute to the economic recovery. An increase in budgetary spending by the government to overcome the crisis, along with the NBU's actions to support the banking system, will mitigate the negative impact the pandemic has on the economy. The NBU revised the forecast of current account deficit for 2020 downwards. This year, the current account deficit will be 1.7% of GDP (versus 3.2% in the January forecast). Imports of goods to Ukraine will decrease more than exports. Amid the worldwide quarantine and lower global prices. Ukraine will reduce its purchases of energy and the majority of nonessential goods. The pandemic will affect exports less, as demand for food products is expected to be maintained. At the same time, the decline in remittances from labor migrants will be more than offset by Ukrainians spending less on foreign travel. The current account deficit will widen again once economic activity rebounds globally and in Ukraine. This will be driven by households' pent-up demand for imported goods, the resumption of investment imports by businesses, and the expected decrease in gas transit revenues. Nevertheless, the deficit will continue to range between 3% and 4% of GDP, as envisaged in the NBU's January forecast. Continued cooperation with the IMF remains the key assumption of this macroeconomic forecast. Ukraine is close to having a new aid program approved by the IMF Executive Board. The NBU's revised forecast envisages that Ukraine will receive the first tranche of about USD 2 billion in Q2. First, this will cover the state budget deficit, which has increased to 7.5% of GDP. This will enable Ukraine to confidently pass through the period of peaking debt repayments, and finance measures to support businesses and households at a time when business activity is slowing down, employment and tax revenues are falling, and foreign investors are leaving emerging markets. Second, financing from the IMF and other official international partners will help maintain Ukraine's international reserves at USD 27 to 29 billion this year and in the coming years. In this light, signing a new aid program with the IMF is the main prerequisite for maintaining macro-financial stability in Ukraine during the global crisis. Therefore, the absence of a program with the IMF remains the main risk to this forecast. Another important risk to the outlined forecast could arise from a longer-lasting novel coronavirus pandemic and, consequently, longer-lasting quarantine measures being required to overcome the outbreak. This will have a direct influence on how quickly the global and Ukrainian economies recover. Other risks also remain significant. an escalation of the military conflict in eastern Ukrainea drop in the harvest of grain, fruit and vegetable crops in Ukraine in the wake of unfavorable weatherthe higher volatility of global food prices, driven by global climate change and the risk of stronger protectionist measures.In this light, the NBU Board decided to cut the key policy rate considering that inflationary pressures were moderate, and the economy required substantial support due to the adverse impact of quarantine measures on business activity, consumption and employment. In view of the above, the NBU continued to ease monetary policy, by cutting the key policy rate by 2 pp, to 8%. Together with other measures taken by the NBU, such as expanding its set of liquidity support tools and the introduction of preferential terms for borrowers by banks, this will provide the economy with the impetus required to provide support for households and businesses in these difficult times, and to ensure that business activity picks up quickly once the quarantine is lifted. The NBU expects that the key policy rate to be reduced further, to 7% in the current year. In deciding how quickly the key policy rate can be decreased to that level, the NBU will take into account how talks with the IMF progress, how the coronavirus pandemic develops, how quickly quarantine measures are lifted, and what anti-crisis measures other governments and central banks adopt. The NBU leaves open the possibility of a greater easing in monetary policy if a fall in consumer demand due to quarantine measures and weaker business activity put stronger downward pressure on inflation than is currently expected. The decision to cut the key policy rate, to 8%, was approved by NBU Board Decision on the key policy rate No.289_D, dated 23 April 2020. A new detailed macroeconomic forecast will be published in the central bank's Inflation Report on 30 April 2020. A summary of the discussion by Monetary Policy Committee members that preceded this decision will be published on 4 May 2020. The next meeting of the NBU Board on monetary policy issues will be held on 11 June 2020, as scheduled."
Russia,2020-04-24,"On 24 April 2020, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to cut the key rate by 50 bp to 5.50% per annum. Since the March Board of Directors meeting, the situation has changed dramatically. Significant restrictive measures have been introduced to combat the coronavirus pandemic both in Russia and across the world, which negatively influences economic activity. This creates material and prolonged disinflationary influence on price dynamics from the aggregate demand perspective, which offsets the effect of temporary pro-inflationary factors, including those related to the fall in oil prices. At the same time the situation in global financial markets has stabilised after a period of particularly high volatility in March. The Bank of Russia has reviewed its baseline forecast scenario and is shifting to accommodative monetary policy. According to the Bank of Russia's forecast, given the monetary policy stance, annual inflation will reach 3.8-4.8% in 2020 and will stabilise around 4% later on. If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia holds open the prospect of further key rate reduction at its upcoming meetings. In its key rate decision-making, the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic developments over the forecast horizon, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. Inflation dynamics this year and further on will be largely influenced by a steep decline in domestic and external demand. The drop in demand will become a significant disinflationary factor due to the current and deferred economic effect of the restrictive measures introduced to combat the spread of the coronavirus pandemic in Russia and globally. Inflation expectations of households and businesses have increased, but in the face of falling demand their change will be of a short-term nature. The influence of short-term pro-inflationary factors will be limited. Inflation dynamics data for March and April reflect a temporary response of consumer prices to the weaker ruble and the episodes of increased demand for certain product groups. In March, annual inflation rose to 2.5% (compared to 2.3% in February). According to preliminary data as of 20 April, annual consumer price growth rate was around 3.1%. According to the Bank of Russia's baseline forecast, given the monetary policy stance, annual inflation will reach 3.8-4.8% in 2020 and will stabilise around 4% later on. Monetary conditions remain overall unchanged. Interest rates showed mixed dynamics across different financial market segments. The deposit and credit market largely saw a certain increase in interest rates reflecting the growth of OFZ yields in March on the back of falling prices and rising risk premiums in global financial markets. In April. OFZ yields declined, coming close to the levels observed this February. This was facilitated by the Bank of Russia's measures to support financial stability as well as by declining volatility in global financial markets, including owing to actions taken by central banks. Lower OFZ yields create conditions for reduction in interest rates in other financial market segments. In addition, the Bank of Russia's decision to cut the key rate along with regulatory relaxations will compensate for the tightening of monetary conditions on the back of increased risks. This measure, together with other measures implemented by the Bank of Russia, will support lending, including in the most vulnerable economic sectors. Economic activity. The spread of the coronavirus pandemic in Russia and the restrictive measures in place to address it have combined with a drop in external demand and a further decline in the prices of oil and other export goods to make a substantial negative impact on economic activity. Based on leading indicators, including surveys, activity has seen a steep decline in both the services sector and manufacturing. Both domestic and external markets have registered a contraction in volumes of new orders. Business sentiment and expectations have both deteriorated. In this environment. Q2 GDP is set to decline; however, economic activity is expected to gradually recover as the coronavirus-linked situation normalises and restrictive measures ease both nationwide and across the world. The Bank of Russia has substantially reviewed its baseline scenario parameters. GDP is forecast to decrease by 4-6% in 2020. The Russian economy is thereafter expected to follow a recovery path with growth predicted to total 2.8-4.8% in 2021 and 1.5-3.5% in 2022. The Bank of Russia's baseline scenario assumes the average price of Urals of $27 per barrel in 2020 with its subsequent rise to $35 and $45 per barrel in 2021 and 2022 respectively. The pace of economic recovery will in large measure depend on the amount and efficiency of the Government and Bank of Russia's measures aimed at mitigating the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. Inflation risks. Disinflationary risks under the baseline scenario are substantially driven by the uncertainty as to the spread of the coronavirus pandemic in Russia and globally, the scale of potential measures to fight it and their impact on economic activity, as well as on the speed of a global and domestic economic recovery once restrictive measures have been lifted. The Bank of Russia notes a decline in short-term pro-inflationary risks related to a more considerable potential pass-through of the ruble weakening into prices, as well as to the episodes of high demand for select product categories. However, disruptions in supply chains in connection with the restrictive measures in place may put localised upward pressure on prices. Some periods of heightened volatility in global markets may well feed into exchange rate and inflation expectations. When making its key rate decision, the Bank of Russia also considered the objective of maintaining financial stability, especially in the context of an unsteady environment in international commodity and financial markets. If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia holds open the prospect of further key rate reduction at its upcoming meetings. In its further key rate decision-making, the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic developments over the forecast horizon, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. In the follow-up to the Board of Directors meeting of 24 April 2020 the Bank of Russia released its medium-term forecast. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next key rate review meeting on 19 June 2020. The press release on the Bank of Russia Board decision is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time.

Kazakhstan,2020-04-27,"Press release 16 The base rate remains unchanged at 9.5% April 27, 2020 Almaty The National Bank of Kazakhstan has made a decision to maintain the base rate and the interest rate corridor at 9.5% per annum with +/- 2 percentage points. The situation in April 2020 has been developing under the impact of worsening external economic conditions. Due to the expansion of the coronavirus, the quarantine measures were prolonged. The major world economies are undergoing the contraction of the economic activity, which affects the indicators of the global trade, production and services. The situation in the oil market remains unstable due to the persistent supply-demand imbalance. In March 2020 inflationary risks have started realizing in the Republic of Kazakhstan. Due to the expansion of coronavirus the recession in the global economy is being witnessed. According to the recent outlook of the IMF, in 2020 the global economy is projected to contract by 3.0 percent, including the countries  main trade partners of Kazakhstan. The contraction of EU economy is projected to be 7.5%. Russia  5.5%, the economy of China is estimated to grow at a subdued 1.2%. The volatility in the oil market remains persistent due to the decline in global demand and the growth in the reserves, and also due to the uncertainty about the duration of the epidemic. After the short-term recovery in the beginning of April 2020 when the Brent oil price reached the level of 34.1 US dollars per barrel, on April 22 of this year it has dropped to the values below 16 US dollars per barrel  the minimum price since the beginning of the century. As of 27 April, 2020 the Brent oil price is traded at the price of 20.6 US dollars per barrel. To stabilize the oil market, the participants of OPEC+ reached an agreement to reduce the production by 9.7 mln barrels per day. The further development of the situation in the oil market is linked to the risks of world economy deceleration and the world oil consumption decline and will depend on the actual steps taken by the countries  main oil producers to limit their production and, accordingly, to balance the supply and demand in the oil market, and also on the duration of the recession and recovery rate of the world economy. The decrease of the world aggregate demand is reflected on the economic activity rate in Kazakhstan. According to the preliminary estimates of Statistics Committee of the Ministry of National Economy, the annual real GDP growth in the first quarter of 2020 was 2.7%. The business activity rate, which is estimated on a monthly basis based on the business surveys by the National Bank, has decreased to 41.5% in March 2020 from 49.1% in February and 50.1% in January 2020. According to the updated forecast of socio-economic development by the Government of Republic of Kazakhstan, the contraction of the real GDP will be 0.9 percent. For its part, according to the estimates by the National Bank the contraction might reach the level of 1.3 percent due to the more negative assessments of prospects of the external sector performance. The slower response of the aggregate demand in Kazakhstan to the changes of the external environment is due to its higher rates in the beginning of the current year. The growth in the fixed investments in January-March 2020 slowed down to 5.1% compared to 11.6% in January-February 2020. The measures taken by the State to support the income of the population and employment will stimulate the aggregate demand, which in turn will encourage the phased recovery of the economic activity. The annual inflation in March 2020 increased to 6.4%, overshooting the upper target bound of the 4-6% corridor. The main contribution was made by the price acceleration of the foodstuff to 9.3% (8.6% in February 2020). The non-food inflation didn't changed much and amounted to 5.5%. The prices of the paid services increased by 3.5% as the result of the depletion of the effect of administrative decline of the prices of regulated utility services in the preceding year. Taking into the account the risks of the uncertainty in the world economy performance and the exchange rate pass-through effect on the domestic prices, the inflation rate will be in the corridor of 9-11% at the end of 2020 if the oil prices remain on the current level. The inflationary expectations of the households have also increased following the inflation rate, which is confirmed by the survey. In March 2020 the inflationary expectations increased to 6.4% compared to 5.2% in February 2020. According to the estimates of the National Bank, the growth will be confined due to the imposition of the quarantine and the demand support measures in the economy. The further decisions on the base rate will be made based on the recovery rate of economy, the balance of the inflationary risks, the level of the aggregate demand, and also taking the account the measures ensuring the financial stability. The next decision of the National Bank of Kazakhstan on the base rate will be announced on June 8, 2020 at 15:00 Nur-Sultan time."
Armenia,2020-04-28,"PRESS RELEASE 28.04.2020 Refinancing rate cut by 0.25 pp to 5.0% At the April 28, 2020 meeting, the CBA Board decided to cut the refinancing rate by 0.25 percentage points, setting it at 5.0%. There was 0.5% inflation in March 2020, compared to that of 0.1% registered in the same month of the previous year, with the 12-month deflation rate having reduced to 0.1%. The spread of coronavirus and resultant healthcare measures to fight it are having a major negative impact on the global economy, including the economic growth in partner countries to Armenia, and have added to the volatility of commodity prices. Though joint and concerted efforts by central banks of leading countries have weakened the volatility in financial markets, uncertainties and risks remain high. All this is estimated to continue to leave a deflationary effect on the Armenian economy. On the back of adverse impact of the coronavirus epidemic on the Armenian economy, a decline in economic activity was observable in almost all sectors of the economy in March 2020, compared to the same period last year. According to the CBA, the decline in economic activity will deepen in the second quarter due to reduced supply and demand. There is estimation that aggregate demand will remain sluggish in the near future, which will be partly compensated by the government's offered package of stimulus designed for alleviating social and economic effects. At the same time, uncertainties related to the timing of overcoming the pandemic and economic recovery have increased, and longer-term changes in the structure and outlook of the Armenian economy will only be possible to assess after such uncertainties will diminish. Given the current and projected external and domestic sector developments, weakening demand, currently low inflation environment and stabilizing financial markets, the CBA Board considers it appropriate to add to the monetary stimulus by reducing the refinancing rate. The Board also believes that, in the current situation, keeping the monetary stance expansionary also in the medium term will be needed. As a result, inflation in the short term will remain low, approaching the target only at the end of the forecast horizon. Uncertainties about short-term and long-term economic developments are high at the moment, which the Central Bank is also trying to take into account in its decisions. At the same time, the assessment is that downside risks to inflation deviating from its path are prevailing due to both external and domestic factors. In the event of emergence of any risks, the CBA is ready to adjust the policy accordingly to maintain the price stability in the medium term. Detailed information underlying the setting of the level of interest rate is available in Press Release (Minutes on Interest Rate) to be published by May 13, 2020.

Hungary,2020-04-28,"At its meeting on 28 April 2020, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 29 April 2020:. In the current extraordinary economic circumstances, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank's (MNB's) mandate is still to achieve and maintain price stability, to preserve financial stability, as well as to support the Government's economic policy. Consistent with this, mitigating the negative effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the real economy and financial markets and creating the conditions for restarting the economy have become the MNB's key priorities. The MNB has recently responded to the emerging challenges by taking a series of coordinated measures, transforming and expanding its set of monetary policy instruments. These changes will allow the MNB to provide the required amount of liquidity to the major sub-markets and to set the appropriate monetary conditions in a targeted and flexible manner. In 2019, world economic growth fell to a ten-year low. The coronavirus pandemic hit the global economy in a weakened state. Its negative economic effects appeared quickly in a wide range of countries. Currently, there is an exceptionally large degree of uncertainty in judging the time profile of the health emergency and its macroeconomic consequences. Although sentiment in global financial markets has improved slightly in recent weeks, volatility remains extremely elevated. Risk appetite continued to be influenced by the adverse effects on the real economy and money markets resulting from the spread of the pandemic and the related measures. Capital outflows continued in the emerging markets, but their extent fell. Deteriorating outlook for global demand led to a decline in commodity market prices, including global oil prices, which decreased sharply again in April following the fall in March. Due to the negative economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic, a number of central banks around the world announced further easing measures. The Federal Reserve decided to implement several new lending incentive and liquidity providing instruments. The European Central Bank temporarily loosened its collateral eligibility requirements and eased the conditions of its new bond purchase programme (PEPP). The Czech and the Polish central banks cut policy rates further. The Polish and the Romanian central banks continued to purchase government securities. The effects of the coronavirus pandemic were not yet reflected in the production and sales data of the Hungarian economy in the first two months of 2020. However, the general deterioration in confidence indicators and sector-specific information on past weeks' developments have already shown a decline in economic activity. Based on the data release by the National Employment Service, with the coronavirus disease becoming a pandemic, the number of registered jobseekers rose in Hungary in March. This year's macroeconomic data will show significant volatility and dichotomy. In the first half of 2020, growth is likely to slow significantly, reflecting the negative economic effects of the pandemic; then domestic growth, the labour market, lending and foreign trade are expected to pick up again as the negative effects wane and lost economic activity is regained. In March 2020, inflation returned to the tolerance band. Mainly as a result of the sharp decline in fuel prices, inflation is expected to fall below the central bank target in the coming months, before stabilising gradually at 3 percent. Core inflation excluding indirect tax effects is likely to be around 3.2-3.5 percent on average in 2020, before decreasing gradually to 3 percent. In the past month, the pandemic and the effects of the related measures taken in Hungary and abroad were reflected apparently in the conditions of the Hungarian financial market. Showing high volatility, the forint exchange rate has moved in line with other exchange rates in the region since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. In the past month, the government securities yield curve has flattened. The fundamentals of the Hungarian economy are strong: the economic policy pursued over the past decade has contributed to maintaining the country's macroeconomic balance and has significantly reduced its external and internal vulnerability. Consistent with this, the latest projections by large international organisations (IMF. EBRD) include Hungary among the most resilient economies. In recent years, the domestic household savings rate and the business investment rate have stabilised at high levels, while the country's external financing capacity has remained persistently positive. By the end of 2019. Hungary's net external debt had decreased to below 8 percent of GDP, a historical low; and, looking ahead, its external financing capacity is expected to remain stable. Budget deficit is low, remaining around 2 percent of GDP over the past several years; and the government debt-to-GDP ratio has been falling continuously as well. In line with its mandate, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank decided to implement a series of coordinated measures in the past month. As part of this, the interest rate corridor was widened and became symmetric. The MNB activated its one-week deposit instrument, whose interest rate may be increased even to the upper bound of the interest rate corridor at its tenders. In addition, the MNB introduced a fixed-rate collateralised lending facility with up to five-year maturity, and it also expanded the scope of eligible collateral and granted exemption from reserve requirements to the banking system. Consistent with the changes to the MNB's monetary policy instruments, from the second quarter of 2020 the Council will not set a target amount of liquidity to be crowded out of the instruments bearing interest at the base rate. In addition, at its first April meeting, the Monetary Council decided to launch a government securities purchase programme in the secondary market in order to improve monetary policy transmission and also decided to relaunch its mortgage bond purchase programme to improve the long-term supply of funding to the banking sector. To provide the required funding for domestic companies, the Monetary Council launched the Funding for Growth Scheme Go! (FGS Go!) on 20 April. It also decided to modify certain parameters of the Bond Funding for Growth Scheme (BGS), which may make sustainable and stable funding available for the Hungarian corporate sector over the long term. The MNB will sterilise the additional money created by the FGS Go! and the BGS by using the preferential deposit facility bearing tiered interest for a transitional period and providing higher interest rate for additional lending. At its meeting today, the Monetary Council left the base rate and the overnight deposit rate unchanged at 0.9 percent and -0.05 percent, respectively, and kept the overnight and the one-week collateralised lending rates at 1.85 percent. In addition, the Council made a decision on the details of its asset purchase programme announced earlier. The purpose of the government securities and mortgage bonds purchase programmes is to prevent damage to the monetary policy transmission and manage economic and financial risks arising from the coronavirus pandemic. The MNB's government securities purchases will take place in the secondary market, and may be conducted at auctions organised by the Bank and in individual secondary market transactions. The Bank will make these purchases at market prices. The MNB will not restrict the scope of maturities of government securities to be purchased; however, the purchases will be focused on securities with a minimum maturity of three years. The range of counterparty institutions, eligible to participate in the programme, includes banks and non-banks playing a key role in the government securities market. Mortgage bond purchases will take place in the primary and the secondary markets. Assets to be purchased under this programme are fixed-rate forint mortgage bonds with a minimum original maturity of three years. Both programmes will be launched by the MNB on 4 May. They will continue in terms of their timeframe and amount as long as warranted by economic and financial developments resulting from the coronavirus pandemic. Based on incoming information, the MNB is ready to fine-tune the programmes, when necessary. By actively applying the expanded set of central bank instruments, the MNB seeks to ensure that domestic financial market developments remain stable in the current uncertain economic environment. It also aims to provide all economic agents with the required amount of liquidity with favourable conditions. By modifying the set of instruments, the MNB increased its room for manoeuvre in monetary policy, and ensured that it is able to give quick responses on the required scale to extraordinary challenges in every sub-market in the future as well. The Monetary Council continuously assesses incoming data and changes in outlook. In line with its statutory mandate, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank will use every instrument at its disposal to achieve price stability and to support the Hungarian economic and financial system."
Georgia,2020-04-29,"29.04.2020 The National Bank Of Georgia Cuts The Monetary Policy Rate By 0.50 Percentage Points To 8.50% The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on April 29, 2020, and decided to cut the refinancing rate by 0.50 percentage points to 8.5 percent. Amid the Covid-19 pandemic and the sharp decline in international oil prices, the economic uncertainty in the world remains high. In Georgia, the annual inflation rate in March was 6.1 percent. According to the NBG's forecast, due to temporary factors, inflation will remain high for several months, then gradually decline, and in the first half of 2021 approach the target level. The inflation dynamics are determined by the interaction of the both demand and supply side factors. It should be noted that the reduction in aggregate demand is transmitted to the inflation with a lag, while supply-side factors affect inflation faster. Supply factors caused by logistical constraints will delay the decline in inflation over the coming months, however a sharp decline in external and domestic demand due to pandemic will create a downward preassure on inflation over the course of the year. Given the expected reduction in the demand, there is no need to further maintain such tightened policy stance. Hence, the Monetary Policy Committee started the gradual exit from the tightened policy and reduced the policy rate by 0.5 percentage points. Despite the rate cut, monetary policy remains tight, ensuring a return of inflation to the target level in the medium term. The Monetary Policy Committee will exit the tight monetary policy stance gradually and further steps will depend on how quickly inflation expectations recede. As noted, the sharp decline in demand is expected to exert a downwards preassure on inflation. According to the current forecast, following the decline in domestic and external demand. Georgia's real economic growth will be around -4 percent. According to preliminary data, in March, exports of goods fell by 22 percent and the revenues from international travelers declined by almost 70 percent. There was also a decrease in remittances (-9 percent). At the same time, imports declined by 13 percent, indicating a weakening in domestic demand. From the supply side factors, the delays in production and supply chains affect companies' costs and, consequently, prices. However, assuming that the strict restrictions imposed by the spread of the covid-19 are only temporary, the latter will only have a temporary effect, hence the monetary policy reaction to this type of shock will be counterproductive. At the same time, the sharp decline of oil prices on international markets are being reflected on the gradual decline in gasoline prices in Georgia, exerting a downwards preassure in inflation. In addition, the expected substantial donor support will help mitigate the impact of the shock on the economic activity and inflation. Considering current level of uncertainty, both credit and liquidity risks have increased, that was reflected in the growth of market interest rates. To ensure that liquidity risk does not limit credit to the economy, the NBG introduced additional instruments to provide liquidity. The NBG provides liquidity through swaps operations for both commercial banks and microfinance organizations. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all means and instruments at its disposal in order to ensure the price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee is scheduled on June 24, 2020."
United States,2020-04-29,"EDT April 29, 2020 The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals. The coronavirus outbreak is causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. The virus and the measures taken to protect public health are inducing sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job losses. Weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices are holding down consumer price inflation. The disruptions to economic activity here and abroad have significantly affected financial conditions and have impaired the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term. In light of these developments, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals. The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including information related to public health, as well as global developments and muted inflation pressures, and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the stance of monetary policy, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent (more) For release at 2 p.m. EDT April 29, 2020 - 2 - inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. To support the flow of credit to households and businesses, the Federal Reserve will continue to purchase Treasury securities and agency residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions. In addition, the Open Market Desk will continue to offer large-scale overnight and term repurchase agreement operations. The Committee will closely monitor market conditions and is prepared to adjust its plans as appropriate. Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H Powell. Chair; John C. Williams. Vice Chair; Michelle W Bowman; Lael Brainard; Richard H Clarida; Patrick Harker; Robert S Kaplan; Neel Kashkari; Loretta J Mester; and Randal K Quarles."

Euroarea,2020-04-30,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Executive Vice-President. Mr Dombrovskis. The euro area is facing an economic contraction of a magnitude and speed that are unprecedented in peacetime. Measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) have largely halted economic activity in all the countries of the euro area and across the globe. Survey indicators for consumer and business sentiment have plunged, suggesting a sharp contraction in economic growth and a profound deterioration in labour market conditions. Given the high uncertainty surrounding the ultimate extent of the economic fallout, growth scenarios produced by ECB staff suggest that euro area GDP could fall by between 5% and 12% this year, depending crucially on the duration of the containment measures and the success of policies to mitigate the economic consequences for businesses and workers. As the containment measures are gradually lifted, these scenarios foresee a recovery in economic activity, although its speed and scale remain highly uncertain. Inflation has declined as a result of the sharp fall in oil prices and slightly lower HICP inflation excluding energy and food. The decisive and targeted policy measures that we have taken since early March have provided crucial support to the euro area economy and especially to the sectors most exposed to the crisis. In particular, our measures are supporting liquidity conditions and helping to sustain the flow of credit to households and firms, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and to maintain favourable financing conditions for all sectors and jurisdictions. We welcome the measures taken by euro area governments and the European institutions to ensure sufficient healthcare resources and to provide support to affected companies, workers and households. At the same time, continued and ambitious efforts are needed, notably through joint and coordinated policy action, to guard against downside risks and to underpin the recovery. In line with our mandate, the Governing Council is determined to continue to support households and firms in the face of the current economic disruption and heightened uncertainty, in order to safeguard medium-term price stability. Accordingly, the Governing Council decided today to further ease the conditions on our targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO . Specifically, we decided to reduce the interest rate on TLTRO III operations during the period from June 2020 to June 2021 to 50 basis points below the average interest rate on the Eurosystem's main refinancing operations prevailing over the same period. Moreover, for counterparties whose eligible net lending reaches the lending performance threshold, the interest rate over the period from June 2020 to June 2021 will now be 50 basis points below the average deposit facility rate prevailing over the same period. We also decided on a new series of non-targeted pandemic emergency longer-term refinancing operations (PELTROs) to support liquidity conditions in the euro area financial system and contribute to preserving the smooth functioning of money markets by providing an effective liquidity backstop. The PELTROs consist of seven additional refinancing operations commencing in May 2020 and maturing in a staggered sequence between July and September 2021 in line with the duration of our collateral easing measures. They will be carried out as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment, with an interest rate that is 25 basis points below the average rate on the main refinancing operations prevailing over the life of each PELTRO. Further details on the amendments made to the terms of TLTRO III and on our new PELTROs will be published in dedicated press releases this afternoon at 15:30 CET. Since the end of March we have been conducting purchases under our new pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), which has an overall envelope of €750 billion, to ease the overall monetary policy stance and to counter the severe risks to the monetary policy transmission mechanism and the outlook for the euro area posed by the coronavirus pandemic. These purchases will continue to be conducted in a flexible manner over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions. We will conduct net asset purchases under the PEPP until the Governing Council judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over, but in any case until the end of this year. Moreover, net purchases under our asset purchase programme (APP) will continue at a monthly pace of €20 billion, together with the purchases under the additional €120 billion temporary envelope until the end of the year. We continue to expect monthly net asset purchases under the APP to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of our policy rates, and to end shortly before we start raising the key ECB interest rates. We also intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. In addition, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We expect them to remain at their present or lower levels until we have seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within our projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics. Together with the substantial monetary policy stimulus already in place, these measures will support liquidity and funding conditions and help to preserve the smooth provision of credit to the real economy. At the same time, in the current rapidly evolving economic environment, the Governing Council remains fully committed to doing everything necessary within its mandate to support all citizens of the euro area through this extremely challenging time. This applies first and foremost to our role in ensuring that our monetary policy is transmitted to all parts of the economy and to all jurisdictions in the pursuit of our price stability mandate. We are, therefore, fully prepared to increase the size of the PEPP and adjust its composition, by as much as necessary and for as long as needed. In any case, the Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. The latest economic indicators and survey results covering the period since the coronavirus spread to the euro area have shown an unprecedented decline, pointing to a significant contraction in euro area economic activity and to rapidly deteriorating labour markets. The coronavirus pandemic and the associated containment measures have severely affected the manufacturing and services sectors, taking a toll on the productive capacity of the euro area economy and on domestic demand. In the first quarter of 2020, which was only partially affected by the spread of the coronavirus, euro area real GDP decreased by 3.8%, quarter on quarter, reflecting the impact of the lockdown measures in the final weeks of the quarter. The sharp downturn in economic activity in April suggests that the impact is likely to be even more severe in the second quarter. Looking beyond the immediate disruption stemming from the coronavirus pandemic, euro area growth is expected to resume as the containment measures are gradually lifted, supported by favourable financing conditions, the euro area fiscal stance and a resumption in global activity. Given the highly uncertain duration of the pandemic, the likely extent and duration of the imminent recession and the subsequent recovery are difficult to predict. However, without pre-empting the forthcoming Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, which will be published in June, growth scenarios produced by ECB staff suggest that euro area GDP could fall by between 5% and 12% this year, followed by a recovery and normalisation of growth in subsequent years. The extent of the contraction and the recovery will depend crucially on the duration and the success of the containment measures, how far supply capacity and domestic demand are permanently affected, and the success of policies in mitigating the adverse impact on incomes and employment. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation decreased from 0.7% in March to 0.4% in April, largely driven by lower energy price inflation, but also slightly lower HICP inflation excluding energy and food. On the basis of the sharp decline in current and futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to decline considerably further over the coming months. The sharp downturn in economic activity is expected to lead to negative effects on underlying inflation over the coming months. However, the medium-term implications of the coronavirus pandemic for inflation are surrounded by high uncertainty, given that downward pressures linked to weaker demand may be partially offset by upward pressures related to supply disruptions. Market-based indicators of longer-term inflation expectations have remained at depressed levels. Even though survey-based indicators of inflation expectations have declined over the short and medium term, longer-term expectations have been less affected. Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth increased to 7.5% in March 2020, from 5.5% in February. Money growth reflects bank credit creation for the private sector, which is driven to a large extent by drawing on credit lines, and low opportunity costs of holding M3 relative to other financial instruments, while heightened economic uncertainty appears to have triggered a shift towards monetary holdings, likely for precautionary reasons. In this environment, the narrow monetary aggregate M1, encompassing the most liquid forms of money, continues to be the main contributor to broad money growth. Developments in loans to the private sector have also been shaped by the impact of the coronavirus. The annual growth rate of loans to households stood at 3.4% in March 2020, after 3.7% in February, while the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations stood at 5.4% in March, after 3.0% in February. These developments are also clearly visible in the results of the euro area bank lending survey for the first quarter of 2020, which indicate a surge in firms' demand for loans and for drawing on credit lines to meet liquidity needs for working capital, while financing needs for fixed investment declined. Demand for loans to households for house purchase increased less than in the previous quarter. Credit standards for loans to firms tightened slightly, while credit standards for loans to households tightened more strongly. In both cases, this was related to the deterioration in the economic outlook and a decline in the creditworthiness of firms and households. At the same time, banks expect an easing of credit standards for loans to firms in the second quarter of 2020. Our policy measures, in particular the more favourable terms for TLTRO III operations and the collateral easing measures, should encourage banks to extend loans to all private sector entities. Together with the credit support measures adopted by national governments and European institutions, they support ongoing access to financing, including for those most affected by the ramifications of the coronavirus pandemic. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is necessary for the robust convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Regarding fiscal policies, an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance is critical, in view of the sharp contraction in the euro area economy. Measures taken should as much as possible be targeted and temporary in nature in response to the pandemic emergency. We welcome the endorsement by the European Council of the Eurogroup agreement on the three safety nets for workers, businesses and sovereigns, amounting to a package worth €540 billion. At the same time, the Governing Council urges further strong and timely efforts to prepare and support the recovery. In this regard, we welcome the European Council agreement to work towards establishing a recovery fund dedicated to dealing with this unprecedented crisis."
Malaysia,2020-05-05,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to reduce the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) by 50 basis points to 2.00 percent. The ceiling and floor rates of the corridor of the OPR are correspondingly reduced to 2.25 percent and 1.75 percent, respectively. Global economic conditions have weakened significantly. Measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic have disrupted economic activity across most economies. Recent indicators show that the global economy is already contracting, with global growth projected to be negative for the year. Financial conditions have also tightened amid elevated risk aversion and uncertainty. Substantial policy stimuli introduced by many economies, coupled with the gradual easing of containment measures globally, would partially mitigate the economic impact of COVID-19. Growth prospects should improve in 2021 with the expected containment of the pandemic. For Malaysia, domestic economic conditions have similarly been affected by the pandemic. Widespread containment measures globally, international border closures and the consequent weak external demand environment will exert a larger drag on domestic economic activity. The Movement Control Order, while necessary to contain the spread of the virus, has also constrained production capacity and spending. Labour market conditions are also expected to weaken considerably. Economic conditions would be particularly challenging in the first half of the year. The fiscal stimulus measures, alongside monetary and financial measures will, however, offer some support to the economy. With more businesses allowed to operate under the Conditional Movement Control Order, economic activity is projected to gradually improve. The outlook for growth continues to be subject to a high degree of uncertainty, particularly with respect to developments surrounding the pandemic. Inflationary pressures are expected to be muted in 2020, with average headline inflation likely to be negative this year, due mainly to projections for substantially lower global oil prices. Nevertheless, the outlook remains significantly affected by global oil and commodity prices, as well as evolving demand conditions. Underlying inflation is expected to be subdued given the projections of weaker domestic growth prospects and labour market conditions. The financial sector is sound, with financial institutions operating with strong capital and liquidity buffers. Liquidity remains ample, augmented by liquidity injections by Bank Negara Malaysia. Since March 2020. Bank Negara Malaysia has provided additional liquidity of approximately RM42 billion into the domestic financial markets, via various tools including outright purchase of government securities, reverse repos and the reduction in Statutory Reserve Requirement. Bank Negara Malaysia stands ready to provide liquidity in the interbank market to ensure orderly market conditions, conducive to support financial intermediation activity. With the decision today, the OPR has been reduced by a total of 100 basis points, complementing other monetary and financial measures by Bank Negara Malaysia as well as fiscal measures this year. Together, these measures will cushion the economic impact on businesses and households and support the improvement in economic activity. The MPC will continue to monitor the outlook for domestic growth and inflation. The Bank will utilise its policy levers as appropriate to create enabling conditions for a sustainable economic recovery. Bank Negara Malaysia 05 May 2020."
Brazil,2020-05-06,"In its 230th&#160;meeting, the Copom unanimously decided to lower the Selic rate to 3.00% p.a. In its 230th meeting, the Copom unanimously decided to lower the Selic rate to 3.00% p.a. The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario:. Regarding the global outlook, the COVID-19 pandemic is causing a significant slowdown in global growth, a drop of commodity prices, and an increase in asset prices volatility. Against this backdrop, despite the additional provision of fiscal and monetary stimuli in major economies, and some moderation in financial assets volatility, the environment for emerging economies remains challenging, with capital outflows significantly larger than in previous episodes. Turning to economic activity, data through March reflect only partly the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic over the Brazilian economy. Higher frequency and more timely indicators for April show that the economic contraction will be significantly deeper than forecasted in the previous meeting. Inflation expectations for 2020, 2021, and 2022 collected by the Focus survey are around 2.0%, 3.3%, and 3.5%, respectively. The Copom's inflation projections in the hybrid scenario with interest rate path extracted from the Focus survey and constant exchange rate at R$5.55/US$* stand around 2.4% for 2020 and 3.4% for 2021. This scenario assumes a path for the Selic rate that ends 2020 at 2.75% p.a. and rises to 3.75% p.a. in 2021. It also assumes that Brent oil prices rise about 40% by the end of 2020; and. The scenario with constant interest rate at 3.75% p.a., constant exchange rate at R$5.55/US$*, and the same assumptions regarding oil prices yields inflation projections around 2.3% for 2020 and 3.2% for 2021. The Committee emphasizes that risks to its baseline scenario remain in both directions. On the one hand, economic slack may continue to produce a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory. This risk increases if a worsening of the pandemic implies an increase in uncertainty and precautionary savings and, consequently, implies a decline in aggregate demand that is larger or longer than anticipated. On the other hand, fiscal policy responses to the pandemic that permanently aggravate the fiscal trajectory or a frustration with the continuation of the reform agenda may increase the risk premium and imply a higher-than-expected path for inflation over the relevant horizon for monetary policy. The Committee believes that persevering in the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy is essential for a sustainable economic recovery. The Copom also stresses that doubts regarding the continuation of the reform agenda and permanent changes to the fiscal consolidation process could result in an increase in the structural interest rate. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to lower the Selic rate to 3.00% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation, a higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks, and it is consistent with convergence of inflation to its target over the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2021. Two Committee members pondered that, even with the possibility of an increase in the structural rate, it could be appropriate to provide the overall monetary stimulus immediately, in combination with a guidance of keeping the interest rate constant for the next months, in order to reduce the probability of missing the inflation target for 2021. However, the prevalent view was that, in light of the elevated uncertainty domestically, the remaining scope for monetary policy is unknown and may be small. Therefore, the Copom chose to provide a more moderate stimulus, for the benefit of gathering more information until its next meeting. For the next meeting, conditional on the fiscal scenario and on the economic data, the Committee considers a final monetary adjustment, not larger than this one, to complete the change to the policy rate that it deems adequate to counteract the economic consequences from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the Committee recognizes that the variance of its balance of risks has increased and that further information on the effects of the pandemic in the economy, as well as a decline in fiscal uncertainty, will be essential to determine its next steps. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Roberto Oliveira Campos Neto (Governor). Bruno Serra Fernandes. Carolina de Assis Barros. Fabio Kanczuk. Fernanda Feitosa Nechio. Mauricio Costa de Moura. Otavio Ribeiro Damaso, and Paulo Srgio Neves de Souza. *Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average R$/US$ exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the last day of the week before the Copom meeting."
Chile,2020-05-06,"Wednesday, 6 May 2020 Monetary Policy Meeting  May 2020 At its Monetary Policy Meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 0.50%. The decision was adopted by the unanimous vote of its members. The unfolding of the Covid-19 pandemic and the effects of the sanitary measures adopted to contain it continue to shape the macroeconomic scenario around the world. Currently, the set of projections by public and private organizations anticipate a global recession for this year, with steeper falls in activity than were assumed in the baseline scenario of the March Monetary Policy Report. Early first-quarter GDP figures from the main economies confirm widespread contractions, often deeper than expected, while a significant increase in unemployment is already visible in several countries. Moreover, containment practices are expected to continue for much of the second quarter. In this context, central banks and governments have further strengthened their stimulus policies, aiming to limit the negative impact on the situation of companies, households and financial institutions, and support recovery in the second half of the year. These measures have also helped to limit the deterioration in financial conditions, but a high degree of uncertainty persists, concerning both health and economic developments. In the domestic macroeconomic scenario, the fall of the Imacec in March was in line with the outlook described in the last MP Report, ratifying the onset of an economic contraction process triggered by the health emergency. Thus, a negative impact was observed in a substantial fraction of the economic sectors, especially in retail, education, transportation, and restaurants and hotels activity. The National Statistics Institute's employment survey, plus administrative data and qualitative information from the Business Perceptions Report point to a significant deterioration in the labor market, partly buffered by the special measures adopted by the Government. Consumer expectations (IPEC) fell to record lows and consumption of non- essential goods has fallen dramatically. Business expectations (IMCE) have also worsened. The Capital Goods Corporation (CBC)'s investment project survey reported that projects have been rescheduled to one or more years ahead and imports of capital goods have fallen sharply, all of which confirms a significant drop in investment. In this context, with differences in magnitude, private expectations point to a contraction of the Chilean economy this year and a significant recovery in 2021. [INF*RES*AS] Global financial markets have bounced back from the severe shocks they experienced during March. Thus, reductions in risk premiums, increases in stock markets, some appreciation of currencies against the dollar and declines in long-term interest rates have been observed in an important group of economies. The prices of commodities, particularly metals, have also shown a recovery. The Chilean financial markets have matched these trends: the stock market rose, long rates declined, money market liquidity increased —especially in pesos—, bank spreads narrowed and the peso appreciated with respect to the dollar. Regarding credit to companies, an important increase in the stock of commercial loans in March is worth noting, a behavior that partial data show to have continued during April. The Bank Lending Survey (ECB) for the first quarter shows an increase in the demand for credit by large companies and a decrease by SMEs. However, this latter group have increased their needs to finance working capital. The ECB also points to a tightening of the banks' lending conditions. In the case of household credit, the y-o-y variation in the stock of consumer loans remained in negative territory in March, while mortgage loans continued to grow at around 8%. As for interest rates, consumer and commercial rates have dropped while mortgage rates have risen further. In terms of the measures adopted by the Central Bank, commercial banks have applied to around US$12 billion —nearly 50% of the available funds— under the Conditional Credit Facility for Increased Lending (FCIC), supported by the expansion of collateral. In turn, the bank bond purchase program has accumulated US$3.3 billion of the up to US$8 billion available, while the Central Bank debt buyback has reached just over US$5.6 billion. As of March, annual inflation dropped to 3.7% and the core measure remained at around 2.5%. Medium-term inflationary pressures remain contained, in line with a widening of activity gaps caused by the sanitary emergency, which, coupled with the fall in oil prices since the beginning of the year, offset the cost pressures of the cumulative exchange rate depreciation. One year ahead, measures of inflation expectations have adjusted downwards, while two years ahead they remain at around 3.0%. The Board's decision to keep the MPR at its technical minimum of 0.5% is consistent with the need for monetary policy to remain in this highly expansionary stance for an extended period of time, in order to ensure the convergence of inflation to the 3% target over a two-year horizon. The Board will evaluate options to boost the monetary impulse and sustain financial stability by making use of unconventional tools in case that the evolution of the economy so requires. The minutes stemming from this Monetary Policy Meeting will be published at 8:30 hours of Friday, 22 May 2020. The next Monetary Policy Meeting is scheduled to take place on Tuesday 16 June and the statement thereof will be published at 18:00 hours of that same day. The Spanish original prevails."
Czech Republic,2020-05-07,"At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank lowered the two-week repo rate by 75 basis points to 0.25%. At the same time, it lowered the Lombard rate to 1.00%. The discount rate remains unchanged at 0.05%. Five members voted in favour of this decision, and two members voted for lowering the repo rate by 50 basis points. . The decision adopted by the Bank Board is underpinned by a new macroeconomic forecast. After the sharp fall in domestic market interest rates recorded in March, consistent with the forecast is a further decline in 2020 Q2. It must be stressed that the situation during the preparation of the forecast was exceptional owing to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The uncertainty regarding the external and domestic assumptions of the forecast and the way they are captured by the model system is thus extremely high. The impacts of the coronavirus pandemic and the related measures will lead to a significant decline in global economic output this year. According to the forecast, euro area economic activity will drop markedly in the first half of this year. The situation will stabilise gradually in the second half of the year and the Czech Republic's main trading partner countries will return to economic growth next year. Producer prices are expected to fall substantially this year, owing to the aforementioned drop in economic activity and the collapse of oil prices. Consumer price inflation in the euro area will slow considerably this year. The European Central Bank has launched massive securities purchases. The outlook for short-term euro area interest rates remains negative over the entire forecast horizon. The price of oil dropped by almost two-thirds during the first quarter of this year. According to the forecast, it will stabilise close to USD 40 a barrel. The euro will appreciate slightly against the dollar. The quarantine measures adopted by the government and firms caused the shutdown of a large part of the domestic economy in March. The restrictions are gradually being lifted and most sectors are gradually starting up again during Q2. However, the negative impacts of the subdued external demand and the very unfavourable perception of the economic situation among Czech households and firms will persist. GDP will therefore fall significantly this year and, despite a gradual return to growth, economic activity will not return to the pre-pandemic level before the end of next year. This will be due chiefly to fixed investment. Its return to growth will be dampened by the deep decline in external demand associated with the significant deterioration in global economic sentiment. Exports can also be expected to drop sharply. Following an initial decline, household consumption will fare somewhat better, supported by decreasing but still positive wage growth and massive stabilising fiscal policy measures. In addition to programmes to support the liquidity of households and firms hit by the pandemic, government expenditure will rise owing to a previously approved increase in pensions and non-market sector wages and continued investment activity in the public sector. The labour market will cool quickly in the first half of the year owing to the contraction of the economy and will continue to do so next year despite an economic recovery. Employment will decline appreciably until almost the end of next year. The unemployment rate will increase rapidly, peaking at the start of next year. Inflation will rapidly return into the tolerance band around the target in the coming months, mainly due to the generally anti-inflationary impacts of the coronavirus crisis amid a deep decline of the domestic economy. Appreciably weaker domestic price pressures will outweigh the temporary inflationary effect of a weaker koruna. Inflation will therefore decline towards the 2% target at the end of this year. The decline in inflation will also be fostered by a drop in fuel prices stemming from the collapse of world oil prices and slower growth in administered prices. By contrast, food price inflation will remain high this year. The decline in inflation will also be slowed this year and the next by the price impacts of changes to indirect taxes. As a result, inflation will be close to the CNB's 2% target next year. Monetary policy-relevant inflation will be slightly lower than headline inflation, as the first-round effects of changes to indirect taxes will be slightly positive. The koruna weakened sharply at the end of Q1 following the outbreak of the pandemic. The exchange rate will remain close to its current level over the entire forecast horizon due to the worse foreign and domestic economic outlook and narrower interest rate differential. After the sharp fall in domestic market interest rates recorded in March, consistent with the forecast is a further decline in 2020 Q2 followed by broad stability. This decline in rates reflects the effects of government quarantine measures on the domestic economy as well as the significantly worse external outlook. As already stated, these facts will have significant anti-inflationary consequences. By contrast, the decline in rates will be slowed by the recent sharp weakening of the koruna, which is contributing to an easing of the overall monetary conditions. The outlook for domestic economic activity this year has deteriorated substantially by comparison with the previous forecast. The inflation forecast at the monetary policy horizon is unchanged. The new forecast implies significantly lower interest rates this year and the next and a weaker koruna-euro exchange rate than the previous outlook. The Bank Board assessed the risks to the forecast in the current extraordinary situation as being unprecedentedly high and requiring an even greater easing of the monetary conditions compared with the baseline scenario of the forecast. In the current situation, the risks are naturally connected with the course of the pandemic and especially with the duration and size of the impacts of the quarantine measures on the global and Czech economy. At the moment, the CNB does not see a need to intervene immediately in financial markets by providing liquidity to financial institutions. Nonetheless, following an amendment of the Act on the CNB, it is for preventive reasons preparing a liquidity-providing instrument for some non-bank entities licensed by the CNB. These institutions will newly be able to obtain liquid funds in the form of short-term loans from the CNB. Such loans will be secured on the part of these financial institutions by the same securities that are used as standard collateral by credit institutions in liquidity-providing CNB repo operations, i.e. above all Czech government bonds. In addition, for credit institutions (banks, foreign bank branches and credit unions), the CNB is working on broadening the range of eligible collateral used in existing liquidity-providing operations to include mortgage bonds. Liquidity-providing operations with three-month maturity will also be introduced for credit institutions. The specific parameters of these operations will be published on the CNB website in the coming days. The Bank Board expects these operations to be announced regularly from 18 May 2020. At the same time, the Bank Board expects the relevant institutions to conclude the necessary contractual documents with the CNB or adjust their balance sheets so they are able to fully cover their liquidity needs themselves. The CNB views these new instruments as additions to the range of monetary policy and macroprudential measures contributing to an environment on the Czech financial market that will enable Czech financial institutions and, in turn, the entire Czech economy to better deal with the current economic situation. In its conduct of supervision, the CNB is continuing to take a flexible approach to how the individual supervised entities are to comply with certain regulatory duties. This is in line with the approach of the European supervisory authorities. The aim is to reduce the regulatory burden and thus create room for the individual supervised entities to react more flexibly to changes in the overall economic situation."
Peru,2020-05-07,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT - MAY 2020 BCRP MAINTAINED THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 0.25% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to continue with an expansionary policy stance, maintaining the reference rate at 0.25 percent and implementing further liquidity injection operations, in light of the following developments: Annual inflation is expected to be around the lower band of the inflation target in the forecast horizon, in view of the significant slowdown of domestic demand. Year-on-year inflation fell from 1.8 percent in March to 1.7 percent in April. One-year- ahead expected inflation fell from 2.0 percent in March to 1.5 percent in April. Economic activity continues to be severely affected, on a temporary basis, by adverse shocks in aggregate supply and demand. Business expectations indicators on GDP growth have deteriorated significantly. Risks to global economic activity have materialized and include a global recession in the first half of the year. BCRP will continue to take all necessary actions to sustain the payments system and the credit channel in the economy. Thus, it has been carrying out liquidity injection operations, such as security and currency repos, achieving a considerable reduction in the interest rates of these operations with maturity terms between 6 months and 3 years. In addition, on April 23. BCRP started auctions of government-backed repos, having placed a total of 25.391 billion as of May 7 at an average interest rate of 1.08 percent for the clients of financial entities. The Board considers it appropriate to maintain a strong expansionary monetary stance for an extended period and while the negative effects of the pandemic on inflation and its determinants persist. The Central Bank pays close attention to new information and stands ready to extend monetary stimulus in different ways. The Board also decided to maintain the following interest rates on its window facility operations in domestic currency with financial entities. Overnight deposits: 0.15 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 0.50 percent per year. The BCRP Board's next monetary policy session will take place on June 11, 2020."
Egypt,2020-05-14,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release May 14, 2020 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 925 percent, 1025 percent, and 975 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 975 percen. Annual headline urban inflation increased to 59 percent in April 2020 from 51 percent in March 2020 due to a combination of unfavorable base effect stemming from muted price increases in April 2019 as well as higher prices increases in April 2020 which is broadly attributed to the impact of the outbreak of COVID-19 as well as a stronger seasonal factor due to Ramada. Annual headline inflation in April 2020 was driven by higher annual food contribution, mainly core food items, which more than offset lower annual contribution of non-food item. Accordingly annual core inflation increased to 25 percent in April 2020 from 19 percent in March 202. Real GDP growth continued to stabilize around 56 percent in 2019 Q4, with the recovery in public domestic demand offsetting the moderation in private domestic demand, and the pickup in consumption offsetting the slowdown in investment. Meanwhile leading indicators showed broad improvement on average in January and February 2020, before reflecting a slowdown in economic activity in March and April 202. Nevertheless the diversity of the economy provides some cushion given the resilience of some sector. Globally economic activity and employment have deteriorated significantly, which weighed on the outlook with risks mainly tilted to the downsid. This was also reflected in the weakness of international oil prices, despite production cuts by major producer. Against this background, and following the reduction of 300 basis points during the unscheduled MPC meeting on March 16, 2020, the MPC decided that keeping key policy rates unchanged remains consistent with achieving the inflation target of 9 percent (±3 percentage points) in 2020 Q4 and price stability over the medium ter. The MPC closely monitors all economic developments and will not hesitate to utilize all available tools to support the recovery of economic activity, within its price stability mandat.

Mexico,2020-05-14,"Banco de Mexico's Governing Board decided to lower the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 50 basis points to 5.5%. In view of the complex economic and financial situation worldwide. Banco de Mexico has been closely monitoring the behavior of domestic financial markets, economic activity and inflation, in order to take the necessary actions in a timely manner. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures adopted to prevent its spread have affected world economic activity considerably. This has led to unprecedented revisions of economic expectations, which incorporate a strong contraction of productive activity in 2020. In turn, this has resulted in a sharp fall in commodity prices, especially of crude oil. As a consequence of these factors, several central banks have reduced interest rates significantly and implemented other extraordinary measures to foster the proper functioning of their financial markets. Likewise, several countries have implemented fiscal stimulus measures to mitigate the adverse effects on employment and on households and firms' income. This environment has led to a significant deterioration of global financial conditions, to a recomposition of investors' portfolio towards lower risk assets, and to the greatest contraction ever recorded of holdings of emerging economies' assets, especially of fixed-income instruments. This adjustment contributed to a depreciation of these economies' currencies and to volatility in their foreign exchange markets, including the Mexican peso. The actions adopted by advanced economies to provide liquidity and restore financing have contributed to the more stable behavior observed in international financial markets. Such actions have also contributed to the better performance of domestic financial markets over the last weeks, where lower interest rates on government securities for all terms were registered, while the Mexican peso exchange rate traded in a narrower range. Nevertheless, global and domestic financial conditions will continue to be subject to the outlook for the effects of the pandemic. Available information shows that economic activity in Mexico contracted significantly during the first quarter of the year, incorporating the effects associated with the pandemic in March, which affected the production of goods and services considerably. Although the magnitude and duration of the effects of the pandemic are still unknown, these are expected to intensify during the second quarter, and to result in a significant contraction of employment. Slack conditions thus continue to widen considerably, in a context in which the balance of risks for growth is significantly biased to the downside. Annual headline inflation decreased from 3.25 to 2.15% between March and April 2020 due to declines from 2.19 to -1.96% and from 3.60 to 3.50% in its non-core and core components, respectively. A particularly relevant factor was the decline in the annual change of energy prices, particularly of gasoline. Short-term expectations for headline inflation have decreased, while those for long and medium terms have remained relatively stable, albeit at levels above the 3% target. 1 The challenges for monetary policy posed by the pandemic include both the unprecedented impact on economic activity as well as those associated with the financial shock that we are currently facing. As for the risks to the foreseen trajectory of inflation, the most important to the downside are a significant widening of the negative output gap and the effects of the fall in energy prices. To the upside, a greater or more persistent depreciation of the peso and possible disruptions to chains of production and distribution of certain goods and services. In this context, the balance of risks for inflation remains uncertain. Taking into account the referred risks for inflation, economic activity and financial markets, major challenges arise for monetary policy and for the economy in general. Considering the room for maneuvering that on balance monetary policy has as a result of these implications, and with the presence of all its members. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board decided unanimously to lower the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 50 basis points to a level of 5.5%. The Governing Board will take the necessary actions on the basis of incoming information and considering the large impact on productive activity as well as the evolution of the financial shock that we are currently facing, so that the policy rate is consistent with the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to Banco de Mexico's target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates. Perseverance in strengthening the macroeconomic fundamentals and adopting the necessary actions, regarding both monetary and fiscal policies, will contribute to a better adjustment of domestic financial markets and of the economy as a whole."
Pakistan,2020-05-15,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement May 15, 2020. At its meeting on 15th May 2020, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to reduce the policy rate by 100 basis points to percent. This decision reflected the MPC's view that the inflation outlook has improved further in light of the recent cut in domestic fuel prices. As result, inflation could fall closer to the lower end of the previously announced ranges of 11-12 percent this fiscal year and 7-9 percent next fiscal year. The MPC highlighted that the coronavirus pandemic has created unique challenges for monetary policy due to its non-economic origin and the temporary disruption of economic activity required to combat it. While easier monetary policy can neither affect the rate of infection transmission nor prevent the near-term fall in economic activity due to lockdowns, it can provide liquidity support to households and businesses to help them through the ensuing temporary phase of economic disruption. In particular, the successive policy rate cuts and sizeable cheap loans provided through the SBP's enhanced refinancing facilities have helped maintain credit flows, bolster the cash flow of borrowers, and support asset prices. This has contained the tightening of financial conditions that would otherwise have amplified the initial necessary contraction in activity. The MPC noted the swift and forceful monetary easing of 525 basis point in the two months since the beginning of the crisis and SBP's measures to extend principal repayments, provide payroll financing, and other measures to support liquidity. Together with the government's proactive fiscal stimulus―including targeted support packages for low-income households. SMEs, and construction―as well as assistance from the international community, these actions should provide ample cushion to growth and employment, while also maintaining financial stability. This coordinated and broad-based policy response has provided relief and stability and should provide support for recovery as the pandemic subsides. In reaching its decision, the MPC considered key trends and prospects in the real, external and fiscal sectors, and the resulting outlook for monetary conditions and inflation. Key developments since the last MPC meeting. The MPC noted three key developments since the last MPC meeting on 16th April, 2020. First the government has significantly reduced petrol and diesel prices by 30-40 percent in response to the continued fall in global oil prices, which has improved the outlook for inflation. Second most countries, including Pakistan, have begun easing lockdowns, which should help provide support to economic activity. Nevertheless as elsewhere, the situation remains highly uncertain. possible rise in infections could prompt fresh lockdowns, and the recovery could prove more sluggish than is currently being anticipated. Third due to timely policy actions and international assistance, the initial volatility observed in domestic financial and foreign exchange markets has somewhat subsided in recent weeks, although global financial conditions remain considerably tighter than before the coronavirus outbreak. Recent supportive developments have helped to restore the SBP's foreign reserves position to close to pre-coronavirus levels of over US$ 12 billion. Real sector Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN. Economic data has been consistent with the expected sudden and sharp drop in activity. LSM witnessed steep decline of 23 percent (y/y) in March, due to the withdrawal from economic and social activity aimed at slowing the spread of the virus. High-frequency indicators of demand such as credit card spending, cement dispatches, credit off-take and POL sales also suggest marked contraction in domestic economic activity in both March and April. At the same time, after showing signs of recovery earlier in the year, both consumer and business sentiment have fallen sharply. More recently, the government has initiated phased lifting of restrictions for different economic sectors conditional on the future course of the pandemic. If this easing proceeds smoothly, activity should pick up in coming months. The MPC noted that, in light of preliminary evidence from China and other countries that eased lockdowns earlier than others, activity in service sectors and consumption, which form large part of the domestic economy, could remain subdued for longer. External sector. The current account deficit has continued to narrow, even though both exports and imports have fallen sharply since the coronavirus outbreak. Exports declined by 10. percent (y/y) in March. Imports after indicating some recovery on in recent months, contracted by 19. percent (y/y). The April figures from the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics reveal an even steeper decline in both exports (54 percent) and imports (32 percent). While remittances have so far remained resilient, there are potential downside risks given the economic difficulties across the world, especially in oil exporting countries. Despite challenging global conditions, the outlook for external sector broadly remains stable. The current account deficit should remain bounded and the recent fall in portfolio inflows will be offset by official flows committed by the international community, such that Pakistan's external position remains fully funded. Together these developments, buttressed by the flexible exchange rate regime, should continue to support steady build up in the SBP's foreign exchange reserve buffers. Fiscal sector 10. Like the external sector, the fiscal sector was also on track of much-needed consolidation before the coronavirus outbreak. The primary balance recorded surplus of. percent of GDP in Jul-Mar FY20 against deficit of. percent in the same period of FY19, the first 9-month surplus since FY16. However the substantial fall in economic activity since March has significantly affected tax revenues. After rising by 17. percent (y/y) during Jul-Feb FY20, tax revenues declined sharply by 15 percent (y/y) in both March and April. Moreover given the needed increase in spending to support healthcare, businesses, households and more vulnerable segments of society, the fiscal deficit is expected to widen substantially in Q4. Monetary and inflation outlook 1. The MPC noted the significant reduction in headline inflation since January on the back of sharply decelerating food and energy prices, as well as easing core inflation. Looking ahead, this waning price momentum is expected to be complemented by the recent 30-40 percent cut in domestic petrol and diesel prices, creating room for today's additional rate cut. Today's decision has brought the cumulative reduction in Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN the policy rate to 525 basis points, which was enabled by the fact that both the fall in inflation in Pakistan since January and the expected further decline next year are the highest among comparable emerging markets. The inflation outlook is subject to two-sided risks. Inflation could fall further than expected if economic activity fails to pick up as expected next fiscal year. On the other hand, there are some upside risks from potential food-price shocks associated with adverse agricultural conditions. Price pressures could also emerge if the economy gains greater momentum in the second half of FY21. Overall the MPC felt that with today's rate cut and based on available information, the monetary policy stance should support the economy over the coming months, while ensuring price and financial stability. In line with its previous communications, the MPC has remained data-driven and forward-looking in its interest rate decisions and stands ready to take appropriate actions as the need may arise.

Thailand,2020-05-20,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 3/2020 Mr. Titanun Mallikamas. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 20 May 2020 as follows. The Committee voted 4 to 3 to cut the policy rate by 025 percentage point from 075 to 050 percent effective immediately. In deliberating their policy decision, the Committee assessed that the Thai economy would contract in 2020 more than the previous assessment due to the more-than-expected contraction of the global economy along with the containment measures worldwide. Headline inflation would be more negative than previously assessed. Financial stability would be more vulnerable given the economic outlook. Most members viewed that more accommodative monetary policy would alleviate the negative impacts as well as reinforce the previously announced fiscal, financial, and credit measures. Nevertheless three members voted to maintain the policy rate at this meeting, focusing on expediting the effectiveness of the announced financial and credit measures. The Committee as a whole agreed that financial institutions should work to ensure that debt restructuring, particularly for household and SME borrowers, be carried out on a wider scale. Furthermore lending under the previously announced measures should also be accelerated to address liquidity problems in a targeted and timely manner. The Thai economy would contract more than the previous assessment. Tourism and merchandise exports were affected by trading partners' economies more than expected. Meanwhile domestic demand, both private consumption and private investment, would contract more than previously assessed due to higher unemployment and the containment measures. Nevertheless financial and fiscal measures would help partly to alleviate liquidity problems of households and businesses as well as support the Thai economy to recover gradually. The Committee viewed that targeted and timely fiscal measures would remain vital to support employment and SMEs, and facilitate the economic recovery and potential growth going forward. Meanwhile the annual average of headline inflation would be more negative in 2020 than the previous assessment due mainly to lower energy prices. Core inflation would remain subdued at low levels. The Committee would monitor uncertainties pertaining to the global economy and the COVID-19 outbreak abroad, the relaxation of containment measures and the likelihood of the second wave of outbreak in Thailand, as well as the effectiveness of the fiscal, financial, and credit measures, which would affect the recovery in the period ahead. Financial markets exhibited stability after the Bank of Thailand implemented stabilization measures, including the establishment of the Corporate Bond Stabilization Fund (BSF). Government bond yields declined and corporate bond yields in the secondary market showed lower volatility. Bond market functioning increasingly returned to normal. However the Committee would monitor the situation of saving cooperatives which could be affected by corporate bond investments. Meanwhile commercial bank loans expanded, especially large corporate loans, while consumer loans decelerated somewhat. The level of overall liquidity in the financial system remained ample. However it was deemed important that liquidity be distributed to businesses and households affected by COVID-19. Commercial bank lending rates declined following the previous policy rate cut and the temporary reduction in the Financial Institutions Development Fund (FIDF) contribution. Regarding exchange rates, the baht appreciated against the US dollar and regional currencies. The Committee expressed concerns over the baht that could strengthen and affect the economic recovery. Therefore developments in the financial markets and the foreign exchange markets warranted close monitoring. The financial institution system remained sound. Commercial banks had robust capital fund and loan loss provision levels. Nevertheless there remained a need to monitor the risks that may pose vulnerabilities to the stability of the commercial bank system in the period ahead, particularly defaults by businesses and households after the phase-out of liquidity support measures. The Committee viewed that financial institutions would thus need to accelerate debt restructuring for borrowers and expedite credit extension under various measures previously announced. The Committee also deemed it necessary for the Bank of Thailand and other related regulatory agencies to prepare measures for coping with the increasing risks if debt servicing capability of borrowers were to deteriorate more than expected, as well as to ensure sufficient liquidity and continuation of the well-functioning and stability of the financial institution system. Looking ahead, the Committee would monitor developments of economic growth, inflation, and financial stability, together with associated risks, including external risks, the impacts of COVID-19 outbreak, and the adequacy of the fiscal, financial, and credit measures, in deliberating monetary policy going forward. The Committee would stand ready to use additional appropriate monetary policy tools if necessary."
Turkiye,2020-05-21,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to reduce the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) from 8.75 percent to 8.25 percent. As developments regarding the spread of the coronavirus substantially weaken global growth outlook, central banks in advanced and emerging economies continue to take expansionary measures. While uncertainties on global economic recovery remain high, normalization steps taken by several countries are being watched. The pandemic disease is closely monitored for its evolving global impact on capital flows, financial conditions, international trade and commodity prices. Having displayed a strong upward trend in January and February, thanks to the improvement in financial conditions, economic activity has started to weaken in mid-March due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on external trade, tourism and domestic demand. While the weakening in economic activity became more pronounced in April, high-frequency indicators for the first half of May display signs of bottoming-out following the steps taken towards partial normalization. In order to contain negative effects of the pandemic on the Turkish economy, it is of crucial importance to ensure the healthy functioning of financial markets, the credit channel and firms' cash flows. In this respect, recent monetary and fiscal measures will contribute to financial stability and post-pandemic recovery by supporting the potential output of the economy. Despite the fall in exports and tourism revenues due to the pandemic, current account balance is expected to follow a moderate course throughout the year due to the restraining effects of commodity prices and imports. Developments in inflation expectations and domestic demand conditions have contributed to a mild trend in core inflation indicators. Despite the recent depreciation in the Turkish lira due to global developments, international commodity prices, especially crude oil and metal prices, affect inflation outlook favorably. While the rise in unit costs resulting from declining production and sales is closely monitored, the disinflationary effects of aggregate demand conditions are estimated to have increased. Although consumer inflation might follow a slightly higher course in the short-term due to seasonal and pandemic-related effects on food prices, demand-driven disinflationary effects will be more prevalent in the second half of the year. Accordingly, considering all factors affecting the inflation outlook, the Committee decided to make a measured cut in the policy rate. Under the current monetary policy stance, inflation outlook is considered to be in line with the year-end inflation projection. The Committee assesses that maintaining a sustained disinflation process is a key factor for achieving lower sovereign risk, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery. Keeping the disinflation process in track with the targeted path requires the continuation of a cautious monetary stance. In this respect, monetary stance will be determined by considering the indicators of the underlying inflation trend to ensure the continuation of the disinflation process. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability and financial stability objectives. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
South Africa,2020-05-21,"South African Reserve Bank PRESS STATEMENT EMBARGO DELIVERY 21 May 2020 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the April meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), the Covid-19 pandemic continues to spread globally, with wide-ranging and deep social and economic effects. Current forecasts from the IMF show global gross domestic product (GDP) decreasing by about 3.0% this year.1 Economic contractions are expected to be deepest in the second quarter of 2020, with gradual recoveries in the third and fourth quarters of the year. The strength of the global economic recovery will depend 1 Global growth in the QPM model is a trade-weighted average. MPC Statement 21 May 2020 Page 1 in part on how quickly countries are able to open up for economic activity safely, and in particular how effectively societies comply with social distancing rules. The World Health Organisation advises that further complications from the virus are being identified and the pandemic is unlikely to end quickly, with the virus coming in waves over time. The crisis has caused extreme volatility in financial asset prices with sharp and deep market sell-offs followed recently by a partial recovery. Investor interest in higher- yielding assets has improved somewhat in recent days, but the general environment reflects pronounced levels of risk aversion, in particular for emerging market currencies, equities and bonds. Uncertainty about future global economic prospects, trade relationships and supply chains has increased again. Policy responses to the crisis have generally been robust, with the magnitudes dependent on the degree of policy space available to countries. The US Federal Reserve has taken further steps to expand its balance sheet and the European Central Bank (ECB) has made similar commitments. Emerging and developing economies generally have less policy space available and credit is more expensive. The International Financial Institutions (IFIs) have made available extraordinary levels of emergency financial support to respond to Covid-19.2 The Covid-19 outbreak has major health, social and economic impacts, presenting challenges in forecasting domestic economic activity. The compilation of accurate economic statistics will also remain severely challenged. The Bank currently expects GDP in 2020 to contract by 7.0%, compared to the 6.1% contraction forecast in April. Even as the lockdown is relaxed in coming months, for the year as a whole, 2 About 57 countries have been granted funds from the IMF's Rapid Financing Instrument and the Rapid Credit Facility. MPC Statement 21 May 2020 Page 2 investment, exports and imports are expected to decline sharply. Job losses are also expected to be widespread. Easing of the lockdown will support growth in the near term and some high frequency activity indicators show a pickup in spending from extremely low levels. However, getting back to pre-pandemic activity levels will take time. South Africa's terms of trade remain robust. Commodity export prices have eased in recent weeks, but are still at healthy levels. The spot price for Brent crude oil is currently around $34 per barrel, and is expected to remain around these levels in coming months, contributing to reduced petrol price inflation. For our forecast, the Brent crude oil price is expected to average $37 per barrel in 2020 and $45 per barrel in 2021. Exceptionally accommodative policies and the relaxation of lockdowns in many advanced economies have supported a partial recovery in global financial markets, but financing conditions for emerging markets remain uncertain. Domestically, credit risk associated with public borrowing needs remains very high, contributing to non- resident investors' sales of about R149 billion of local-currency denominated assets. The rand has depreciated by 22.9% against the USD since January and by 0.7% since the April meeting of the MPC. The implied starting point for the rand forecast is R18.40 to the US dollar, compared with R17.80 at the time of the previous meeting. Resident investors have increased purchases of long-term bonds, helping to ease yields in recent days, but the yield curve remains exceptionally steep.3 3 Measured by the spread between the R2036 and R2048 to the R186 bonds. MPC Statement 21 May 2020 Page 3 The Bank's headline consumer price inflation forecast averages 3.4% for 2020 and 4.4% in 2021 and 2022. The overall risks to the inflation outlook at this time appear to be to the downside, but less clearly so compared to conditions in March and April. Global producer price and food inflation appear to have bottomed out. Oil prices remain low but have recovered somewhat. Local food price inflation is also expected to remain contained. Risks to inflation from currency depreciation are expected to stay muted while pass-through remains slow. However, electricity and other administered prices remain a concern. Upside risks to inflation could also emerge from heightened fiscal risks and sharp reductions in the supply of goods and services. Expectations of future inflation continued to soften but broadly remain around the mid- point of the band. Market-based expectations for short and medium-term inflation have fallen, while long-term inflation expectations remain higher.4 Despite sustained higher levels of country financing risk, the Committee notes that the economic contraction and slow recovery will keep inflation well below the midpoint of the target range for this year. Barring inflation risks outlined earlier, inflation is expected to be well contained over the medium-term, remaining close to the midpoint in 2021 and 2022. 4 The latest Bureau for Economic Research (BER) survey has expectations for 2020 down by 0.4ppts to 4.4% and to 4.6% (from 5.0%) for 2021. Five-year-ahead inflation expectations also eased to 4.7% (from 4.9%). Market analysts (Reuters Econometer) expect inflation to be 3.5% (from 4.2%) for 2020, 4.1% (from 4.6%) in 2021 and to remain unchanged at 4.5% for 2022. Market-based rates are calculated from the break-even inflation rate, which is the yield differential between conventional and inflation-linked bonds. These sit at 2.5% for the 5-year and 5% on the 10-year breakeven. 15-year breakeven inflation sits at 6.4%. MPC Statement 21 May 2020 Page 4 Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to cut the repo rate by 50 basis points, taking it to 3.75% per annum, with effect from 22 May 2020. Three members preferred a cut of 50 basis points and two preferred a cut of 25 basis points. The implied path of policy rates over the forecast period generated by the Quarterly Projection Model indicates two repo rate cuts of 25 basis points in the next two quarters of 2020. Monetary policy can ease financial conditions and improve the resilience of households and firms to the economic implications of Covid-19. In addition to continued easing of interest rates, the Bank has eased regulatory requirements on banks and has taken important steps to ensure adequate liquidity in domestic markets. These actions are intended to free up more capital for lending by financial institutions to households and firms. Monetary policy however cannot on its own improve the potential growth rate of the economy or reduce fiscal risks. These should be addressed by implementing prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms that lower costs generally, and increase investment opportunities, potential growth and job creation. Such steps will further reduce existing constraints on monetary policy and its transmission to the broader economy. Global economic and financial conditions are expected to remain volatile for the foreseeable future. In this highly uncertain environment, future decisions will continue to be data dependent and sensitive to the balance of risks to the outlook. MPC Statement 21 May 2020 Page 5 The MPC will seek to look through temporary price shocks and focus on second round effects. As usual, the repo rate projection from the QPM remains a broad policy guide, changing from meeting to meeting in response to new data and risks.

India,2020-05-22,"Monetary Policy Statement, 2020-21: Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) May 20 to 22, 2020 On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (May 22, 2020) decided to: reduce the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 40 bps to 4.0 per cent from 4.40 per cent with immediate effect; accordingly, the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate stand reduced to 4.25 per cent from 4.65 per cent; and the reverse repo rate under the LAF stands reduced to 3.35 per cent from 3.75 per cent. The MPC also decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long as it is necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Assessment Global Economy 2. Since the MPC met in March 2020, global economic activity has remained in standstill under COVID-19 related lockdowns and social distancing. Among the key advanced economies (AEs), economic activity contracted in the US. Euro area. Japan and the UK in Q1:2020. Among emerging market economies (EMEs), the Chinese economy went into a pronounced decline and data on high frequency indicators suggest that activity may have also shrunk in other EMEs such as Brazil and South Africa. Global financial markets calmed after a turbulent period in March, and volatility ebbed as swift and large fiscal and monetary policy responses helped to soothe sentiment. Equity markets recovered some lost ground, while government bond yields2 remained range-bound, although somewhat elevated in some EMEs due to country- specific factors. Portfolio flows to EMEs revived in April and the rush to safe havens eased. With the US dollar weakening, major EME currencies, which had experienced persistent downward pressure, traded with an appreciating bias. Crude oil prices firmed up modestly as oil producing countries (OPEC plus) agreed to cut production, and prospects for revival in demand improved on expectations of imminent easing of lockdowns. Gold prices remained elevated on hedging demand. CPI inflation remained subdued across major AEs and EMEs primarily due to a collapse in oil prices and compression in demand amidst lockdowns, while food inflation picked up due to supply disruptions. Domestic Economy 4. Domestic economic activity has been impacted severely by the lockdown which has extended over the past two months. High frequency indicators point to a collapse in demand beginning March 2020 across both urban and rural segments. Electricity consumption has plunged, while both investment activity and private consumption suffered precipitous declines, as reflected in the collapse in capital goods production and the large retrenchment in the output of consumer durables and non-durables in March. High frequency indicators of service sector activity such as passenger and commercial vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic and foreign tourist arrivals also experienced sizable contractions in March. The only silver lining was provided by agriculture, with the summer sowing of rice, pulses and oilseeds in the country progressing well, with total area sown under the current kharif season up by 43.5 per cent so far, and the rabi harvest promising to be a bumper as reflected in record procurement. Retail inflation, measured by the consumer price index, moderated for the second consecutive month in March 2020 to 5.8 per cent after peaking in January. This was mainly due to food inflation easing from double digits in December 2019  January 2020. In April, however, supply disruptions took a toll and reversed the softening of food inflation, which surged to 8.6 per cent from 7.8 per cent in March. Prices of vegetables, cereals, milk, pulses and edible oils and sugar emerged as pressure points1. The Reserve Bank remained in pro-active liquidity management mode, expanding its array of measures, both conventional and unconventional, to augment system-level liquidity as also to channel liquidity to specific sectors facing funding constraints. Systemic liquidity remained in abundance, with average daily net absorptions under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) increasing to ₹5.66 lakh crore in May 2020 (up to May 20) from ₹4.75 lakh crore in April. During 2020-21 (up to May 20), ₹1,20,474 crore was injected through open market operation (OMO) purchases and ₹87,891 crore through three targeted long-term repo operation (TLTRO) auctions and one TLTRO 2.0 auction. In order to distribute liquidity more evenly across the yield curve, the Reserve Bank 1All India headline CPI was not released for April 2020 in view of limited transactions in non-food items due to the lockdown; data were released only for the food and housing groups.3 conducted one ‘operation twist' auction involving the simultaneous sale and purchase of government securities for ₹10,000 crore each on April 27, 2020. Furthermore, the Reserve Bank has provided ₹22,334 crore as refinance to National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD). Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) and National Housing Bank (NHB) so far (as on May 21, 2020) and ₹2,430 crore to mutual funds through a special liquidity facility (SLF) with a view to easing liquidity constraints and de-stress financial markets. Since February 6, 2020 the Reserve Bank has announced liquidity augmenting measures of ₹9.42 lakh crore (4.6 per cent of GDP). Reflecting the various liquidity management measures, domestic financial conditions have eased appreciably as reflected in the narrowing of liquidity premia in various market segments. Yields on government securities, commercial paper (CP), 91- day treasury bills, certificates of deposit (CDs) and corporate bonds have softened. The weighted average lending rates on fresh rupee loans of commercial banks declined by 43 bps in March 2020 alone. Though credit growth remains muted, scheduled commercial banks' investments in commercial paper, bonds, debentures and shares of corporate bodies in this year so far (up to May 8) increased sharply by ₹66,757 crore as against a decline of ₹8,822 crore during the same period last year. There were net inflows into various schemes of mutual funds in April in contrast to large outflows in March. In the external sector. India's merchandise trade slumped in April 2020, with exports shrinking by 60.3 per cent and imports by 58.6 per cent (y-o-y), respectively. While imports contracted in all 30 commodity groups in April, exports contracted in 28 out of 30 groups. The trade deficit narrowed in April 2020  both sequentially and on a year- on-year basis  to its lowest level in 47 months. On the financing side, net foreign direct investment inflows picked up in March 2020 to US$ 2.9 billion from US$ 0.8 billion a year ago. In 2020-21 so far (till May 18), net foreign portfolio investment (FPI) in equities increased to US$ 1.2 billion from US$ 0.8 billion a year ago. In the debt segment, however, there were portfolio outflows of US$ 3.8 billion during the same period as compared with outflows of US$ 1.4 billion a year ago. By contrast, net investment under the voluntary retention route increased by US$ 0.7 billion during the same period. India's foreign exchange reserves have increased by US$ 9.2 billion in 2020-21 so far (up to May 15) to US$ 487.0 billion  equivalent to 12 months of imports. Outlook 9. The inflation outlook is highly uncertain. As supply lines get restored in the coming months with gradual relaxations in the lockdown, the unusual spike in food inflation in April is expected to moderate. The forecast of a normal monsoon also portends well for food inflation. Given the current global demand-supply balance, international crude oil prices are likely to remain low although they may firm up from the recent depressed levels. Soft global prices of metals and other industrial raw materials are likely to keep input costs low for domestic firms. Deficient demand may hold down pressures on core inflation (excluding food and fuel), although persisting supply dislocations impart uncertainty to the near term outlook. However, volatility in financial markets could have a4 bearing on inflation. These factors, combined with favourable base effects, are expected to take effect and pull down headline inflation below target in Q3 and Q4 of 2020-21. Turning to the growth outlook, economic activity other than agriculture is likely to remain depressed in Q1:2020-21 in view of the extended lockdown. Even though the lockdown may be lifted by end-May with some restrictions, economic activity even in Q2 may remain subdued due to social distancing measures and the temporary shortage of labour. Recovery in economic activity is expected to begin in Q3 and gain momentum in Q4 as supply lines are gradually restored to normalcy and demand gradually revives. For the year as a whole, there is still heightened uncertainty about the duration of the pandemic and how long social distancing measures are likely to remain in place and consequently, downside risks to domestic growth remain significant. On the other hand, upside impulses could be unleashed if the pandemic is contained, and social distancing measures are phased out faster. The MPC is of the view that the macroeconomic impact of the pandemic is turning out to be more severe than initially anticipated, and various sectors of the economy are experiencing acute stress. The impact of the shock has been compounded by the interaction of supply disruptions and demand compression. Beyond the destruction of economic and financial activity, livelihood and health are severely affected. Even as various measures initiated by the Government and the Reserve Bank work to mitigate the adverse impact of the pandemic on the economy, it is necessary to ease financial conditions further. This will facilitate the flow of funds at affordable rates and revive animal spirits. With the inflation outlook remaining benign as lockdown-related supply disruptions are mended, the policy space to address growth concerns needs to be used now rather than later to support the economy, even while maintaining headroom to back up the revival of activity when it takes hold. Accordingly, all members voted for a reduction in the policy repo rate and maintaining the accommodative stance as long as it is necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target. Dr.Pami Dua. Dr.Ravindra H. Dholakia. Dr.Janak Raj. Dr.Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted for a reduction in the policy repo rate by 40 bps, while Dr.Chetan Ghate voted for a reduction by 25 bps. The minutes of the MPC's meeting will be published by June 5, 2020. (Yogesh Dayal) Press Release: 2019-2020/2391 Chief General Manager."
Israel,2020-05-25,"The coronavirus crisis has led to an unprecedented contraction in the scope of economic activity and to a steep increase in the number of jobseekers. The gradual process of removing therestrictions that the government imposed on movement and activity is beginning to be reflected in economic activity, though the adverse impact on theeconomy is still considerable and is expected to persist. The Research Department assesses, under the assumption there won't be an additionalwave of infections and a renewed increase in the severity of the limitations, that after a marked contraction in 2020. GDP growth will recover rapidly in 2021, but that the unemployment rate at the end of 2021 will be higherthan what it was just prior to the crisis. According to the Research Department's assessment, as of the middle of May, the scope of the economy's shutdown had declined by close to half in light of the removal of the restrictions. Real time indicators of economic activity point to a recovery in some industries, though the level of activity continues to be low and in the industries in which the main limitations have not yet been removed it remains around the lowest level, and the recovery is reflected only partly in the labor market. Many countries are in various stages of a gradual return to economic activity under health-related limitations, but the magnitude of the global economic crisis is still high. International institutions revised their forecasts downward, and the economic slowdown is expected to worsen in the second quarter. The magnitude of the crisis has led to a broad and unprecedentedpolicy response by central banks and by governments. The policy steps of central banks worldwide has brought about a partialrecovery in capital markets. The sharp declines in equity markets were to varying degrees reversed and government bond markets have stabilized. The Bank of Israel's own activity has markedly reduced the yield on government and corporate bonds in Israel. Bank credit has increased during the course of the crisis, primarily inlight of the growth in business credit and in mortgages, but credit to small businesses and consumer credit declined. The activity of the funds to extend credit to small and medium sized businesses, with partial government guarantees, led to a decline in the average interest rate on credit to smallbusinesses. After a halt in issuance in the corporate bond market in March, there was a recovery in the issuance in April and May. Since the previous interest rate decision, the shekel has strengthened by 2.2 percent in terms of the effective exchange rate, and the exchange rate is back to its pre-crisis level. To the extent that the exchange rate stabilizes at this level, it will weigh on the recovery of exports, particularly in view of the decline in global demand, and on the return of inflationto within the target range. The downward trend in the inflation environment continues, particularlyagainst the background of the decline in energy prices. In April, the annual inflation rate was -0.6 percent, and short-term inflation expectations are below the target while medium and long-term expectations are within the target range. At this point, there are no signs of an inflationary impact from the adverse shock to supply. Due to the crisis, there is a methodological difficulty in calculating the CPI and in analyzing the meaning of measured changes in prices. <b>In view of the magnitude of the crisis's adverse impact on economic activity, the Committee is utilizing a range of tools in order to increase the extent of the monetary policy accommodation and to ensure the continued orderly functioning of the financial markets. The Committee will expand the use of the existing tools, including the interest rate tool, and will operate additional ones, to the extent that it assesses that the crisis is lengthening and it is necessary to achieve the monetary policy goals and to moderate the negative economic impact created as a result of the crisis. For the file of figures accompanying this notice, clickhere. Full data file (Hebrew). The coronavirus crisis led to an unprecedented contraction in the scope of economic activity and to a steep increase in the number of jobseekers. Based on the first estimate of National Accounts data. GDP contracted by 7.1 percent in the first quarter, in annual terms, as a result of the shutdown of a notable part of economic activity in the middle of March (Figure 1 in the attached data file). The gradual process that has occurred after the Passover holiday, of removing the restrictions that had been imposed by the government on movement and activity in order to halt the spread of the virus, was reflected in economic activity as well, though the recovery is expected to take a long time and the adverse impact on the economy is expected to be notable. According to the Research Department's staff forecast, the scope of the economy's shutdown, which was estimated to be approximately 36 percent of activity at the peak of the crisis, decreased to approximately 19 percent in the middle of May in view of the removal of the restrictions (Figure 4). Indicators of private consumption show a recovery; data on credit card purchases indicate an increase in the scope of purchases in most industriesin which the strict limitations were removed, to close to the pre-crisis level. In industries in which the main limitations have not yet been removed (such as tourism, restaurants, education and leisure), the level of purchases remains near the lowest point (Figure 3). Indicators of the public's mobility show an increase in the scope of mobility to workplaces, retail and recreation, beginning in mid-April (Figure 7). Goods exports declined sharply in March and April. Goods imports contracted as well, but the import of raw materials remained stable in view of the adverse impact on manufacturing being relatively moderate (Figures 8-9). Data on services exports are still not available for the crisis period but a sharp decline is expected in exports of tourism and transportation services. The Business Tendency Survey indicates a deterioration in the economic situation in March and April, in addition to an increase in companies' difficulty in attaining credit (Figure 2). The partial recovery of economic activity is only part reflected in the labor market. At the end of April, there were 1.15 million people claiming unemployment benefits: 28 percent of the economy's workforce. Israel Employment Service data indicate that in May, 141,000 people had returned to work and that there were 41,000 new jobseekers, though apparently the return to work is reported with a lag so that this is very likely to be an underestimation. Real-time surveys among companies, conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics, indicated that in the middle of April, the share of active employees was around 61 percent, and it increased to about 71 percent in the beginning of May, with notable variance among the industries (Figure 5). In view of the ongoing crisis, the Research Department published a special update to its macroeconomic forecast that was published in April. The Department currently expects a contraction in 2020 GDP of 4.5 percent (compared with a contraction of 5.3 percent in the April forecast), and a growth rateof 6.8 percent (as opposed to 8.7 percent in the April forecast) in 2021, assuming that there will not be another wave of infections and a renewed increased severity of the limitations. The unemployment rate in the second half of 2020 is expected to rise to 8.5 percent (compared with 8 percent in the previous forecast) and to decline to 5.5 percent at the end of 2021 (as opposed to 4 percent). In 2020, the government budget deficit is expected to be 11.5 percent of GDP and the debt to GDP ratio is expected to increase to approximately 75 percent. The Research Department assesses that in a case of an outbreak of a second wave of infection in the final quarter of the year. GDP in 2020 is expected to contract even more sharply, by approximately 8 percent, and the unemployment rate is expected to increase to 11 percent in the fourth quarter. There is a continued decline in the inflation environment, and at this stage, no inflationary impact is seen from the negative shock to supply. The March and April CPI readings were slightly higher than expected: theCPI for March increased by 0.4 percent and the CPI for April decreased by 0.3 percent, but the rate of inflation over the past 12 months declined sharply to a negative rate of 0.6 percent, mainly due to the significantly negative contribution of the energy component (Figure 12). The annual inflation rate measured by the CPI excluding energy and fruit and vegetables continued its downward trend, and in April it was 0.2 percent. There is a methodological difficulty in calculating the CPI and in analyzing the meaning of measured changes in prices so long as the strict limitations on economic activity lead to numerous goods and services not being consumed, and their prices not being able to be measured, and there is a sharp change in the composition of households' consumption basket. One-year inflation expectations from most sources continued their trend of decline until the middle of May. In recent days, there was a slight increase, but they are all lower than the target. There was some increase in expectations derived from the capital market for the second year, and those expectations for medium and longer terms did not change markedly and they are anchored within the target range. Since the previous interest rate decision, the shekel strengthened by 2.2 percent in terms of the effective exchange rate, and the exchange rate is similar to its pre-crisis level (Figure 15). To the extent that the exchange rate stabilizes at this level, it will weigh on the recovery of exports, particularly in view of the negative impact on global demand, and on the return of inflation to within the target range. Bank of Israel activity in the financial markets moderated the strong volatility that characterized them at the outbreak of the crisis, and in particular, markedly reduced the yield on government bonds (Figure 16) and on corporate bonds (Figures 18-19), despite the increasein the government deficit and in the risk in business credit. After the strong shock in markets in March, unprecedented policy measures taken by central banks worldwide led to a change in the trend in capital markets. The sharp declines in equity markets were partly corrected (Figure 28). Government bond markets around the world stabilized,. Bank credit increased during the course of the crisis primarily against the background of increases in business credit, mortgage balances, and the activity of funds to extend partially government-guaranteed credit to small and medium sized businesses, which also led to a decline in the average interest rate on credit to small businesses. However, the overall volume of credit to small businesses and of consumer credit contracted, partly in view of the decline in activity and in demand for credit, and partly in view of the increased risk for small businesses in industries negatively affected by the crisis. In contrast, the banks enabled nearly a half-million businesses and households to defer loan repayments for several months, at a total amount of NIS 6.2 billion (Figure 21). In March, there was a steep increase in mortgage volumes as many borrowers rushed to close on the interest rates agreed on prior to the crisis, and in April there was a decline in mortgage volume with some increase in the interest rate. After a halt in the scope of issuance in the corporate bond market in March, there was a recovery in issuance in April and May. Many countries are in various stages of a gradual return to economic activity under health-related limitations, but the magnitude of the global economic crisis is still high, particularly in the services industries. International institutions revised their forecasts downward, and the economic slowdown is expected to worsen in the second quarter (Figure 23). The risks to activity are still notable, and particularly the risk for the outbreak of a second wave of the pandemic. The tension between the US and China and the political risks in Europe are also weighing on a potential recovery. In contrast, the increased magnitude of the crisis led to a broad policy response by central banks and by governments; many central banks reduced interest rates and took additional accommodative monetary steps, some of which were unprecedented. Governments put into operation comprehensive plans for expanding public expenditure, compensating those negatively impacted by the crisis, and extending credit to the business sector. The crisis led to a decline in the inflation rate worldwide and to a sharp decline in commodity prices (Figures 25-26); the price of oil fell sharply although it has recoveredpartly in recent days, with exceptional volatility. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on June 8, 2020. The next decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Monday. July 6, 2020, following which the Governor will hold a press briefing. Due to the crisis, there is a methodological difficulty in calculating the CPI and in analyzing the meaning of measured changes in prices. <b>In view of the magnitude of the crisis's adverse impact on economic activity, the Committee is utilizing a range of tools in order to increase the extent of the monetary policy accommodation and to ensure the continued orderly functioning of the financial markets. Full data file (Hebrew) The coronavirus crisis led to an unprecedented contraction in the scope of economic activity and to a steep increase in the number of jobseekers. Government bond markets around the world stabilized. Bank credit increased during the course of the crisis primarily against the background of increases in business credit, mortgage balances, and the activity of funds to extend partially government-guaranteed credit to small and medium sized businesses, which also led to a decline in the average interest rate on credit to small businesses."
Hungary,2020-05-26,"At its meeting on 26 May 2020, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 27 May 2020:. In the current extraordinary economic circumstances, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank's (MNB's) mandate is still to achieve and maintain price stability, to preserve financial stability, as well as to support the Government's economic policy. Consistent with this, mitigating the negative effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the real economy and financial markets and creating the conditions for restarting economic growth have become the MNB's key priorities. In recent months, the MNB has responded to the emerging challenges by taking a series of coordinated measures, transforming and expanding its set of monetary policy instruments. These changes will allow the MNB to provide the required amount of liquidity to the major sub-markets and to set the appropriate monetary conditions in a targeted and flexible manner. The coronavirus pandemic hit the global economy in a weakened state. Its negative economic effects appeared quickly in a wide range of countries. There remains an exceptionally large degree of uncertainty in judging the time profile of the health emergency and its macroeconomic consequences. In the first quarter, the economic performance of the US. China and the euro area declined substantially. Despite a significant slowdown, several economies in the Central and Eastern European region continued to grow on a year-on-year basis. A number of indicators showed an improvement in sentiment in global financial markets, while volatility has decreased in recent weeks. Risk appetite continued to be influenced by developments related to the pandemic and the growing tension between the US and China. Due to the negative economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic, a number of central banks around the world maintained loose monetary conditions and announced further easing measures. The ECB left its key interest rates unchanged; however, it eased further the conditions of its targeted, longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO , and launched a new refinancing facility (PELTRO) as well. Decision-makers at the Czech central bank cut policy rates once again, while the Polish and Romanian central banks continued to purchase government securities. The effects of the coronavirus pandemic were also reflected in macroeconomic data for Hungary. According to preliminary data, the Hungarian economy still grew by 2.2 percent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2020. It remains a goal to maintain 2-3 percentage point growth surpluses compared to the euro area. The surplus significantly exceeded this in the first quarter. Despite the adverse effects of the coronavirus, market services made the largest contribution to sustained economic growth. This year's macroeconomic data will continue to show significant volatility and dichotomy. In the first half of 2020, growth is likely to slow significantly, reflecting the negative economic effects of the pandemic; then domestic growth, investment, the labour market, lending and foreign trade are expected to pick up again as the negative effects wane and economic activity lost temporarily is regained. In line with expectations, the consumer price index fell below the central bank target in April, primarily reflecting a significant decline in fuel prices. Subsequently, inflation is expected to stabilise gradually at the 3 percent target. Core inflation excluding indirect tax effects is likely to be around 3.2-3.5 percent on average in 2020, before decreasing gradually to 3 percent. Domestic financial market conditions were also influenced by the effects of international measures to manage the pandemic in May, in addition to the steps taken by the MNB. Accompanied by a falling volatility, the forint exchange rate was mainly in line with other exchange rates in the region. Long-term government securities yields declined significantly, the government securities yield curve flattened, and market liquidity improved. The fundamentals of the Hungarian economy are strong: the economic policy pursued over the past decade has contributed to maintaining the country's macroeconomic balance and has significantly reduced its external and internal vulnerability. Consistent with this, the projections by large international organisations (IMF. EBRD) include Hungary among the most resilient economies. In recent years, the domestic household savings rate and the business investment rate have stabilised at high levels. By the end of 2019. Hungary's net external debt had decreased to below 8 percent of GDP, a historical low; and, looking ahead, its external financing capacity is expected to remain stable and positive. Budget deficit is low, remaining around 2 percent of GDP over the past several years; and the government debt-to-GDP ratio has been falling continuously as well. The Magyar Nemzeti Bank has decided to implement a series of coordinated and targeted measures in recent months. The measures ensure that the required amount of liquidity is available for all economic agents at a wide range of maturities and with favourable conditions. The interest rate corridor has become symmetric, the MNB has activated its one-week deposit facility and introduced a fixed-rate collateralised lending facility with up to five-year maturity. At the beginning of May, disbursements of new loans for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises have started under the Funding for Growth Scheme Go! (FGS Go!). The number of contracts signed shows a swift utilisation of the programme. The FGS Go! and the amendment of certain parameters of the Bond Funding for Growth Scheme allow the domestic corporate sector to obtain sustainable, stable and long-term financing. The long-term supply of funding to the banking sector is also supported by the relaunched mortgage bond purchase programme. In order to improve monetary transmission, the Monetary Council launched a government securities purchase programme on 4 May. Since the announcement of the programme, long-term government securities yields decreased significantly. The Monetary Council considers the government securities purchase programme to be a crisis management instrument, which it intends to use for the period and to the extent necessary. In the Monetary Council's view, the current set of monetary policy instruments is appropriate to respond to the economic and financial challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic. In the Council's assessment, the previously set goals have been achieved by the transformed set of instruments. The MNB's steps help to protect the economy during the pandemic and also support its subsequent restart. At its meeting today, the Monetary Council left the base rate and the overnight deposit rate unchanged at 0.9 percent and -0.05 percent, respectively, and kept the overnight and the one-week collateralised lending rates at 1.85 percent. The MNB will continue to set the one-week deposit rate at the weekly tenders. In the Monetary Council's assessment, the 0.9 percent level of the one-week deposit rate is appropriate and in line with the MNB's monetary policy objectives. By transforming and expanding its set of instruments, the MNB increased its room for manoeuvre in monetary policy and ensured that it is able to give quick responses on the required scale to extraordinary challenges in every sub-market in the future as well. The Monetary Council continuously assesses incoming data and changes in outlook. In line with its statutory mandate, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank will use every instrument at its disposal to achieve price stability and to support the Hungarian economic and financial system."
South Korea,2020-05-28,"Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points, from 0.75% to 0.50%. This press release is the English version of the Bank of Korea's policy statement. In the case of any inconsistency, the original version in Korean will prevail. The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points, from 0.75% to 0.50%. Currently available information suggests that the global economy has contracted significantly due to constrained economic activity caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Unease in global financial markets has moderated considerably. Stock prices in major countries have risen, and the volatility of government bond yields and exchange rates has lessened thanks to aggressive fiscal and monetary measures in major economies and expectations of economic reopening. Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the evolution of the pandemic, as well as by the effects of national policy responses. Economic growth in Korea has slowed considerably. Consumption has remained sluggish, and exports have fallen significantly. While the recovery in facilities investment has been subdued, the correction in construction investment has continued. Labor market conditions have worsened with a sharp decline in the number of persons employed, especially in the service sector. The Board expects that domestic economic growth will remain sluggish for some time due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. GDP growth is projected to fall considerably below the February forecast of 2.1% to around 0%, and uncertainties around the future path of GDP growth are also judged to be very high. Consumer price inflation has slowed markedly to the lower-0% level due to declining prices of petroleum products and public services as well as slower growth in the prices of agricultural, livestock, and fisheries products. Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) has also moved down to the lower-0% range, and the inflation expectations of the general public have fallen slightly to the mid-1% level. It is forecast that consumer price inflation and core inflation will run at the lower-0% and mid- 0% level this year, respectively, due to the drop in global oil prices and weakening demand-side inflationary pressures. Volatility in domestic financial markets has declined as a result of improved global financial market conditions as well as decisive market stabilization measures. While long- term market interest rates have fallen, stock prices have risen and the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate has fluctuated within a narrow range. The increase in household loans has slowed, and the rate of increase in housing prices has decelerated. The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to support the economy and stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As economic growth is expected to be sluggish and inflationary pressures on the demand-side are forecast to remain weak due to the COVID- 19 pandemic, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance. In this process it will thoroughly assess developments related to the pandemic, the impact on the economy and financial markets here and abroad, and changes in financial stability."
Nigeria,2020-05-28,"CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO. 130 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING HELD ON THURSDAY 28th MAY 2020 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on 28th May, 2020 in an environment of severe macroeconomic shock caused by the fatal spread of the Novel COVID-19 Pandemic, which first started as a health crisis in December 2019 in China and quickly morphed into a global economic crisis in the ensuing months. The pandemic induced economic shock is mainly characterised by disruptions to the global supply chain, on account of the mitigating measures put in place by various governments to contain the spread of the disease. The effects on the global economy have been unprecedented and indeed severe. These include significant stock market crashes; exchange rate volatilities; rising corporate and public debt; rising levels of unemployment; tightening financial conditions; capital flow reversals; and negative shocks to commodity prices, to mention a few. Under this period of economic crisis, the Committee assessed the developments in the global and domestic economic environments in the first five months of 2020, and the outlook for the rest of the year. Ten (10) members of the Committee were in attendance. Global Economic Developments The Committee reviewed developments in the global economy, noting the swift and widespread monetary and fiscal stimulus responses to mitigate the economic crisis and avoid economic recession. They observed that since the duration of the pandemic is unknown, forecasts for global growth projection 1 for 2020 differs amongst institutions and central banks. While the IMF output growth forecast for 2020 was downgraded by 30 per cent in 2020, compared with an initial growth projection of 33 per cent, the forecast by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) showed a moderation in global output growth from 29 per cent in 2019 to 24 per cent in 2020 and 33 per cent in 2021. Most central banks in Emerging and Developing Economies (EMDEs) have mixed forecasts, reflecting the intensity of the demand and supply shocks, as well as the effectiveness of the mitigating measures and stimulus by their monetary and fiscal authorities. The MPC noted that inflation in most Advanced Economies remained largely below their 20 per cent long-run targets. This was partly due to supressed aggregate demand, occasioned by the lockdown, with resulting low expectations of future income, forcing spending to be directed to only essential goods and services. The Committee, however, noted that, although, recent monetary decisions in most advanced economies had been accommodative, portfolio flow reversals from Emerging and Developing Economies had continued, indicating general rebalancing of portfolios toward cash and gold as safe assets by investors. This development has resulted in renewed pressure on exchange rates of some Emerging and Developing Economies with a likely pass-through to their domestic prices. In addition, a likely medium-term impact of these synchronized liquidity injections and other forms of monetary accommodation is the compounding of the already huge global corporate and public debt portfolios which may result in a spike in global debt post-COVID-19. Domestic Economic Developments Available output data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 187 per cent in the first quarter of 2020 compared with 255 and 210 per cent in the preceding and corresponding quarters of 2019, respectively. This was driven largely by 506 per 2 cent growth in the oil sector and 155 per cent in the non-oil sector. The economy, however, expanded by 227 per cent in 2019, the most since 2015, compared to 191 per cent in 2018. The Manufacturing and non-Manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Indices (PMIs) declined significantly to 424 and 253 index points, respectively, in May 2020, compared with 511 and 492 index points in March 2020. The contraction in the manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMIs was attributed to slower growth in production, new orders, employment level, raw materials and input prices. The employment level index for the manufacturing and non- manufacturing PMIs also contracted further to 255 and 320 index points, respectively, in May 2020 compared with 471 and 473 index points in March 2020. Generally the purchasing managers' activities in May 2020, were largely affected by the lockdown of the global economy to curtail the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the light of the above developments, the Monetary Policy Committee commended the Bank's effort on the recent measures put in place to mitigate the economic impact of the twin shocks on the Nigerian economy. The Committee expressed support for the sustenance of the broad-based stimulus and liquidity facilities to curb the adverse effects of the shocks. The Committee also noted with concern the persisting uptick in inflation for the eighth consecutive month as headline inflation (year-on-year) rose to 1234 per cent in April 2020 from 1226 per cent in March 2020. The uptick largely reflected the increase in both the food and core components, which rose to 1503 and 998 per cent in April 2020 from 1498 and 973 per cent in March 2020, respectively. The MPC noted that the recent increase in inflationary pressure was largely due to a combination of factors including; disruptions in supply chain owing to restrictions on inter-state travels; reduced domestic supply of foreign exchange; continued impact of deteriorating domestic infrastructure; and spillover effects of the Pandemic on global supplies, amongst others. Against this background, the Committee emphasized the 3 need to sustain measures already put in place to maintain price stability. It noted that as the supply of goods and services increase, following the gradual easing of the lockdown and return of economic activities, there would be increase in aggregate supply. On monetary aggregates, the Committee noted the marginal growth in broad money (M3) to 266 per cent in April 2020 from 242 per cent in March 2020, largely due to increases in Net Domestic and Foreign Assets. The growth in M3 was, however, significantly below the indicative benchmark of 1309 per cent for 2020. Aggregate Net Credit also grew significantly by 807 per cent in April 2020 compared with 490 per cent in March 2020, although this remained below the indicative benchmark of 1685 per cent for the year. The Committee, therefore, observed that there was relative scope for increased money supply to fund economic activities and boost output recovery. In the review period, money market rates remained relatively stable reflecting the prevailing high liquidity condition in the banking system. Accordingly weighted average Inter-bank call and Open Buy Back (OBB) rates decreased to 733 and 552 per cent in April from 1029 and 1178 per cent in March 2020, respectively. The Committee observed that though the equities market was largely bearish in the first quarter of 2020, moderate improvement continued to be recorded since the beginning of the second quarter. Consequently the All-Share Index (ASI) and Market Capitalization (MC) increased by 1833 per cent a piece, between end-March 2020 and May 22, 2020. This bullish trend reflected improved investor sentiments in response to the mitigating measures introduced at the onset of the pandemic by the monetary and fiscal authorities and positive outlook in the global oil market. The MPC expressed confidence that the current monetary and fiscal policy measures would further strengthen investor confidence. The Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) ratio decreased to 658 per cent at end-April 2020 compared with 1095 per cent in the corresponding period of 2019 due 4 largely to recoveries, write offs and disposals. The development was adjudged by the Committee as a sign of reasonable stability in the banking system and urged the Bank to maintain its toolkit of prudential and regulatory measures to ensure that NPLs stay below the prudential benchmark of 50 per cent. Outlook The overall medium-term outlook for the global economy remains broadly uncertain as the COVID-19 pandemic and associated containment measures continue to disrupt normal economic activities across the globe. The global economy remains largely confronted with several headwinds, some of which include: weak aggregate demand due to declining consumer and investor confidence; disruption in global supply chains; shocks to oil and other commodity prices; continued lull in global financial markets; adverse shocks to global capital flows; as well as rising corporate debt in the advanced economies and public debt in some Emerging Market and Developing Economies. Available data on key macroeconomic variables in the domestic economy indicate that the economy achieved a positive output growth during the first quarter of 2020. The Committee noted that even if the lag effects of COVID-19 result in a low negative output growth in the second quarter of 2020, it could quickly be reversed to avoid a recession by Q3 2020 based on the far-reaching measures taken by the monetary and fiscal authorities to mitigate the combined effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and oil price shock. Projections by both the IMF and Federal Government indicate that the economy would contract in 2020 by -340 per cent. Given more recent developments, however. CBN Staff projections indicate a somewhat less pessimistic range of contraction. This forecast is underlined by the measures to curtail the rapid spread of COVID-19; improvement in crude oil prices which stood at about US$348 per barrel as at 28th May 2020. The moderate recovery in crude oil prices would reduce the pressure on the external reserves and government 5 revenue. Headwinds to growth, however, remains the legacy issues of the persistent infrastructural and security challenges. The Committee's Considerations Central to the Committee's considerations were the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the oil price shock and the likely short to medium-term consequences on the Nigerian economy. In particular, the Committee acknowledged the gradual improvement in macroeconomic variables particularly the improvement in the equities market, the containment measures of the COVID-19 induced health crisis, as well as, the impact of the increase in crude oil price on the external reserves. The Committee noted the stability in the banking system shown by the increase in total asset by 188 per cent and total deposits by 2552 per cent (year-on- year). The performance of the Loan-to-Deposit Ratio (LDR) policy which was introduced in July 2019 showed that total credits increased by N31 trillion or 2045 per cent, with manufacturing, retail & consumer loans, general commerce and agriculture as major beneficiaries. The Committee recognised that under the N100 billion Healthcare Sector Intervention Fund, the Bank has approved and disbursed N1015 billion for some projects for the establishment of advanced diagnostic and health centres and the expansion of some pharmaceutical plants for essential drugs and intravenous fluids. As part of the N1trillion intervention targeted at Agriculture and Manufacturing firms, the Bank has disbursed N932bn under the Real Sector Support Fund to boost local manufacturing and production across critical sectors. This consists of over 44 greenfield and brownfield projects. The Bank has also approved N109 billion to 14,,331 beneficiaries under the N50 billion Targeted Credit Facility for households and SME's, out of which N41billion has been disbursed to 5,,868 successful beneficiaries. The Committee directed Management to reach out to the banks to encourage them to offer 6 and disburse these funds to those priority sectors of the economy so as to stimulate aggregate demand and create more jobs. The MPC appraised the Federal Government's resolve to maintain the core of its spending plans for 2020 as this remained vital for the attainment of the much-needed economic recovery. It also applauded the government's efforts at revising the oil price benchmark downwards to reflect prevailing conditions. It reiterated the urgent need for the Government to improve tax collections, through a gradual, but purposeful diversification of the economy's revenue base. The Committee also urged Government to remain focused on the implementation of the revised 2020 - 2022 Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) as the basis for sustainable fiscal policy. The MPC emphasized the need for Government to work towards a gradual reopening of the economy in line with recommendations of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) and advice from medical experts, insisting that efforts must be directed at saving not only lives but also livelihoods. This is to enable the resumption of economic activities necessary to stimulate growth, accelerate the pace of recovery and restore livelihoods, particularly the vulnerable in our society. On prices, the MPC expressed concern about the heightened inflationary pressure attributed to a combination of monetary and structural factors. While price stability remains the Bank's primary mandate, the Committee expressed the need for a balanced approach in supporting growth in the face of rising domestic prices. With respect to output, the Committee urged the Federal Government to continue exploring options of partnership with the private sector to fund investment in infrastructure. This would aid employment generation, support production and boost output growth. The Committee also reiterated the need for foreign and domestic investments to support growth in key sectors of our economy, including Nigerian auto manufacturing, aviation and rail industries. The Committee expects that on the backdrop of the various stimulus packages and increased credit at lower interest rates, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic would be relatively less severe than had earlier been expected and the reversal in growth deceleration would become more optimistic. The Committee commended the Bank's role in effective oversight of the banking system, as evidenced by the relative stability in key financial soundness indicators and systemic resilience of the banking sector, in the face of severe external shocks. On the choice before the Committee, the MPC observed the weakening of the global macroeconomic environment due to the adverse impacts of COVID-19 and drop in crude oil prices, which has resulted in negative output in most economies. The MPC also feels that the logical expectation is that to ensure that the global economy reverses from the recession timely, what policy makers must do is to take actions that will necessarily stimulate growth and recovery. For Nigeria, although the Q1 2020 GDP turned out pleasantly at 187 per cent and rate of inflation somewhat moderated. Nigeria may escape a recession if concerted efforts are sustained to stimulate output. Accordingly on balance on whether to hold, loosen, or tighten, the MPC was of the view that tightening of policy stance is for now inappropriate. This is because tightening will result in further contraction of aggregate demand, leading to decline in output. Tightening will also increase cost of credit and reduce investment and impact negatively on output growth. As regards the option of holding previous policy stance, the MPC felt that a hold may indicate that the monetary authorities are insensitive to prevailing weak economic conditions. There is, therefore, the need to signal a direction towards immediate recovery. The Monetary Policy Committee also feels that a hold decision may slowdown the trajectory of the weakened economy, compared with a loosening stance, thereby slackening output growth, 8 On loosening, whereas the Monetary Policy Committee is concerned that excess liquidity engendered by loosening may overshoot the economy's absorptive capacity and accelerate inflationary pressure, it nevertheless feels that given the slow rate of acceleration of inflation, the accommodative stance will stimulate aggregate demand and supply in the short term. This is because an accommodative stance, through a lowering of the policy rate will stimulate credit expansion to critically important sectors that will also stimulate employment and revive economic activity for quick growth recovery. The MPC noted that if all stimulus packages already announced by the Bank such as concessionary rates, loan restructuring, and targeted loans to agriculture, manufacturing and health sector are well utilized, this will produce the desired impetus needed to boost economic recovery in Nigeria. The Committee's Decision After reviewing the three options, the MPC noted that the imperative for monetary policy at the May 2020 meeting was to strike a balance between supporting the recovery of output growth while maintaining stable price development across inflation, the exchange rate and market interest rates. To this end, the Committee noted that the Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR) was recently adjusted upwards as a means of tightening the stance of policy. In its response to the COVID-19 pandemic, however, the Bank reduced interest rates associated with all CBN interventions from 9 to 5 per cent. Increasing MPR at this stage will thus be counter-intuitive and will result in upward pressure on retail market rates. The Committee maintained that although a sharp decline in output growth is expected in Q2 2020 and maybe the third quarter, if the current stimulus initiatives are properly implemented, the economy would reverse to positive growth by the fourth quarter. Hence the optimism on the part of the Committee that the economy may not slide into recession. In view of the foregoing, the Committee decided by a unanimous vote to reduce the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) and to hold all other policy parameters constant. Seven members voted for a reduction of the policy rate by 100 basis points, two members by 150 basis points and one member by 200 basis points.

Poland,2020-05-28,"Warsaw, 28 May 2020 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 28 May 2020 The Council decided to cut the NBP reference rate by 0.40 percentage points, i.e. to 0.10%. At the same time, the Council set the remaining NBP interest rates at the following levels: ▪ lombard rate at 0.50%; ▪ deposit rate at 0.00%; ▪ rediscount rate at 0.11%; ▪ discount rate at 0.12%. NBP will also continue to purchase government securities and government- guaranteed debt securities on the secondary market as part of the structural operations. The timing and scale of the operations will depend on the market conditions. Furthermore. NBP will offer bill discount credit aimed at refinancing loans granted to enterprises by banks. The incoming data confirm that the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a fall in global economic activity. In the economies of Poland's main trading partners this was mirrored by falling GDP in 2020 Q1 as well as a significant drop in industrial production and retail sales in April. It was accompanied by deteriorating labour market situation and sharp weakening of consumer and business sentiment. In order to mitigate the negative economic effects of the pandemic, fiscal measures have been introduced to alleviate the fall in households' and enterprises' income as well as to stimulate economic activity. At the same time monetary policy has been eased by  inter alia  lowering interest rates and pursuing asset purchases. Recent forecasts indicate that in the second half of 2020 global economic conditions should improve, but the level of activity will be lower than before the pandemic. At the same time, there is uncertainty regarding the pace and robustness of the improvement in global economic conditions in the following quarters. As a consequence, the situation in the financial markets remains volatile, although the volatility is being mitigated by monetary policy easing conducted by major central banks. The weakening of current and expected demand leads to falling prices of many commodities. The prices of energy commodities, as well as some food commodities are lower than at the beginning of the year, contributing  together with weaker economic activity  to slower price growth in many countries, including main trading partners of Poland. In Poland, economic conditions in the first months of the year were relatively favourable, but GDP growth on an annual basis decelerated. April data point to a significant fall in economic activity, a decrease in wages and employment in enterprises as well as a deterioration of consumer and business sentiment. At the same time inflation declined markedly and the annual change in producer prices was negative. As the restrictions related to the pandemic are lifted, a recovery in economic activity could be expected. This would be supported by economic policy measures, including monetary policy easing by NBP, that mitigate the fall in employment, supporting incomes of households and financial situation of enterprises. The scale of the expected recovery could be  in turn  curbed by uncertainty regarding the consequences of the pandemic, lower incomes and weaker sentiment of economic agents than in previous years. Weaker activity in the global economy, including in Poland, together with lower commodity prices in international markets will contribute to a further decrease in inflation. Consequently, the risk of inflation falling below the NBP inflation target in the monetary policy transmission horizon prevails. Considering the above-mentioned circumstances, the Council decided to cut the NBP interest rates again. NBP will also continue to purchase government securities and government-guaranteed debt securities on the secondary market as part of the structural operations. These operations are aimed at changing the long-term liquidity structure in the banking sector, ensuring the liquidity in secondary markets for the purchased securities and enhancing the impact of the NBP interest rate cuts on the economy, i.e. strengthening the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Furthermore NBP will offer bill discount credit aimed at refinancing loans granted to enterprises by banks. The NBP monetary policy easing mitigates the negative economic impact of the pandemic, limiting the scale of the economic activity fall and supporting incomes of households and enterprises. Consequently, it alleviates the fall in employment and deterioration of financial situation of enterprises, thus being conducive to quicker recovery after the abatement of the pandemic. The measures undertaken by NBP reduce the risk of inflation falling below the NBP inflation target in the medium term and  due to their positive impact on financial situation of debtors-- are conducive to enhancement of financial system stability."
Colombia,2020-05-29,"Vimeo live broadcast (Only in Spanish). Other measures taken by BR on account of COVID-19. This decision continues with the countercyclical monetary policy stance. The Board of Directors of the Central Bank of Colombia (BDBR), by majority, reduced the benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point to 2.75%. In this way, it continues with the countercyclical monetary policy stance. This decision took the following elements into consideration. n April, inflation stood at 3.5%, the average of core inflation indicators at 2.9%, and inflation expectations continued to decline as a reflection of a weak aggregate demand, the deterioration of employment, and the existence of spare production capacity. The downward revisions of local and global growth suggest a substantial expansion of spare production capacity and greater deterioration of the labor market. The financial markets indicators have corrected in recent weeks, and the country's financing conditions have improved. The measures taken by Banco de la Republica have also contributed to these results, and will continue to pursue this purpose. Under these conditions, the risk balance for monetary policy suggests the convenience of providing an additional boost to the economy. The decision to cut the benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point was approved by five Board Members. The remaining members voted to reduce the interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point.

Romania,2020-05-29,"In its meeting of 29 May 2020, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided the following:. The global economy and its outlook have been strongly affected by the major adverse impact and the unprecedented uncertainty generated by the coronavirus pandemic, alongside the containment measures imposed by the authorities. With a view to cushioning the fallout, many central banks in the advanced and emerging economies, the ECB and central banks in the region included, took measures to ease the monetary policy stance and improve financial conditions, consisting in policy rate cuts, purchases of financial assets and liquidity provision via repurchase transactions, even over the long term. Likewise, the National Bank of Romania's response in this context was prompt. Specifically, the NBR Board convened for an emergency meeting on 20 March 2020 and adopted a package of measures aimed at mitigating the economic impact of the pandemic, but also at consolidating liquidity in the banking system so as to ensure the smooth functioning of the money market and of other financial market segments, as well as the smooth financing of the real economy and the public sector. The package included a cut in the monetary policy rate by 0.50 percentage points, to 2.00 percent, and the narrowing of the corridor defined by interest rates on standing facilities to ±0.5 percentage points from ±1.0 percentage point, which implied leaving the deposit facility rate unchanged at 1.50 percent and lowering the lending facility rate by 1 percentage point to 2.50 percent. In addition, it was decided that the NBR should conduct repo transactions for providing liquidity to credit institutions, as well as purchases of leu-denominated government securities on the secondary market. On the domestic front, the severe economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic  likely to abruptly change the Romanian economy's path in mid-2020  began to reflect in the latest statistical data. The annual CPI inflation rate remained unchanged in March at 3.05 percent and then fell to 2.68 percent in April (from 4.0 percent in December 2019). Behind its decline versus December 2019 stood disinflationary base effects and the plunge in the oil price, alongside the removal of the special excise duty on motor fuels. The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate (which excludes from the CPI inflation administered prices, volatile prices, and tobacco product and alcoholic beverage prices) tended however to increase slightly during the first four months of 2020, contrary to forecasts, reaching 3.7 percent in April from 3.66 percent in December 2019. The evolution owed to changes in consumption structure brought about by social distancing measures, associated also with probable disruptions and cost increases in production and supply chains, overlapping persistent demand-pull and wage cost-push inflationary pressures. Average annual CPI inflation rate and average annual inflation rate calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices dropped to 3.7 percent in March and 3.6 percent in April from 3.8 percent and 3.9 percent respectively reported December 2019 through February 2020. According to preliminary data, economic growth slowed down visibly in 2020 Q1 to 2.7 percent from 4.3 percent in the previous quarter, in spite of remaining particularly robust in the first two months of the year. At the same time, the trade deficit posted a markedly faster widening amid a steeper decline in exports than in imports of goods and services. Consequently, the dynamics of the current account deficit regained momentum, the improvement in the primary and secondary income balances notwithstanding. Financial market conditions improved after the adoption of the monetary policy decisions and after overcoming at end-March the peak of tensions generated by the COVID-19 crisis. Key interbank money market rates witnessed a significant downward adjustment in the closing 10-day period of March and afterwards continued to decline gradually, while interest rates on leu-denominated government securities went down progressively, amid the increased volume of liquidity injected by the NBR through bilateral repo operations and through purchases of leu-denominated government securities on the secondary market. At the same time, the EUR/RON exchange rate saw lower fluctuations, moving in a narrow range, inter alia amid an improvement in global financial market sentiment. Lending remained relatively strong in March, before coming under the influence of the pandemic crisis in April. Thus, the stock of credit to the private sector contracted slightly, its annual dynamics slowing to 5.7 percent from 6.9 percent a month earlier. The share of domestic currency loans in total private sector credit narrowed slightly to 67.1 percent against 67.6 percent in December 2019. In today's meeting, the NBR Board examined and approved the May 2020 Inflation Report, which incorporates the latest available data and information. The current macroeconomic forecasts were made under extremely uncertain and highly difficult conditions, amid multiple unknowns concerning the evolution and implications of the pandemic and the related measures. The new scenario shows a change in the envisaged trajectory of the annual inflation rate, especially in the second part of the forecast horizon. Specifically, after having posted a moderate decline in 2020 Q2, the annual inflation rate is expected to climb again in the upper half of the variation band of the target in the latter half of this year, before repositioning itself and remaining around the mid-point of the target until the end of the projection horizon, amid disinflationary pressures from the aggregate demand deficit. The uncertainty surrounding the inflation outlook is unusually elevated, given the unprecedented nature of such an economic shock domestically and internationally, implying an abrupt lockdown on businesses and sectors, but also consumer behaviour shifts. Major sources of uncertainty are also the speed of economic recovery following the gradual removal of containment measures and the effectiveness of support programmes and actions addressing companies and households. On the domestic front, significant uncertainties relate to the fiscal and income policy stance, as well as to the functioning of the monetary transmission mechanism in the context of legislative initiatives targeting the banking system. Increased uncertainty and risks also stem from the euro area and world economy contraction and from the international financial market developments amid the coronavirus pandemic crisis. In today's meeting, based on the currently available data and assessments, but also in light of the extremely high uncertainty, the NBR Board decided to cut the monetary policy rate to 1.75 percent per annum from 2.0 percent per annum starting 2 June 2020. Moreover, it decided to lower the deposit facility rate to 1.25 percent per annum from 1.50 percent per annum and the lending (Lombard) facility rate to 2.25 percent per annum from 2.50 percent per annum. Furthermore, the NBR Board decided to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. Given the liquidity shortfall on the money market, the Board decided to further conduct repo transactions and continue to purchase leu-denominated government securities on the secondary market, keeping financial market stability. Moreover, the central bank will seek to maintain international reserves, forex ones included, at an optimal level. The NBR Board decisions aim to ensure and preserve price stability over the medium term in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth and amid safeguarding financial stability. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be published on the NBR's website at 5:00 p.m. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR's website on 12 June 2020, at 3:00 p.m. Given the elevated uncertainty surrounding economic and financial developments, the NBR Board decision to suspend the previously announced calendar of monetary policy meetings remains in place and monetary policy meetings will be held whenever necessary."
Euroarea,2020-06-04,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Executive Vice-President. Mr Dombrovskis. Incoming information confirms that the euro area economy is experiencing an unprecedented contraction. There has been an abrupt drop in economic activity as a result of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the measures to contain it. Severe job and income losses and exceptionally elevated uncertainty about the economic outlook have led to a significant fall in consumer spending and investment. While survey data and real-time indicators for economic activity have shown some signs of a bottoming-out alongside the gradual easing of the containment measures, the improvement has so far been tepid compared with the speed at which the indicators plummeted in the preceding two months. The June Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections see growth declining at an unprecedented pace in the second quarter of this year, before rebounding again in the second half, crucially helped by the sizeable support from fiscal and monetary policy. Nonetheless, the projections entail a substantial downward revision to both the level of economic activity and the inflation outlook over the whole projection horizon, though the baseline is surrounded by an exceptional degree of uncertainty. While headline inflation is suppressed by lower energy prices, price pressures are expected to remain subdued on account of the sharp decline in real GDP and the associated significant increase in economic slack. In line with its mandate, the Governing Council is determined to ensure the necessary degree of monetary accommodation and a smooth transmission of monetary policy across sectors and countries. Accordingly, we decided on a set of monetary policy measures to support the economy during its gradual reopening and to safeguard medium-term price stability. First, the Governing Council decided to increase the envelope for the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) by €600 billion to a total of €1,350 billion. In response to the pandemic-related downward revision to inflation over the projection horizon, the PEPP expansion will further ease the general monetary policy stance, supporting funding conditions in the real economy, especially for businesses and households. The purchases will continue to be conducted in a flexible manner over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions. This allows us to effectively stave off risks to the smooth transmission of monetary policy. Second, we decided to extend the horizon for net purchases under the PEPP to at least the end of June 2021. In any case, we will conduct net asset purchases under the PEPP until the Governing Council judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over. Third, the Governing Council decided to reinvest the maturing principal payments from securities purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2022. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance. Fourth, net purchases under our asset purchase programme (APP) will continue at a monthly pace of €20 billion, together with the purchases under the additional €120 billion temporary envelope until the end of the year. We continue to expect monthly net asset purchases under the APP to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of our policy rates, and to end shortly before we start raising the key ECB interest rates. Fifth, we intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. Sixth, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We expect them to remain at their present or lower levels until we have seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within our projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics. Together with the substantial monetary policy stimulus already in place, today's decisions will support liquidity and funding conditions in the economy, help to sustain the flow of credit to households and firms, and contribute to maintaining favourable financing conditions for all sectors and jurisdictions, in order to underpin the recovery of the economy from the coronavirus fallout. At the same time, in the current rapidly evolving economic environment, the Governing Council remains fully committed to doing everything necessary within its mandate to support all citizens of the euro area through this extremely challenging time. This applies first and foremost to our role in ensuring that our monetary policy is transmitted to all parts of the economy and to all jurisdictions in the pursuit of our price stability mandate. The Governing Council, therefore, continues to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. The latest economic indicators and survey results confirm a sharp contraction of the euro area economy and rapidly deteriorating labour market conditions. The coronavirus pandemic and the necessary containment measures have severely affected both the manufacturing and services sectors, taking a toll on the productive capacity of the euro area economy and on domestic demand. In the first quarter of 2020, when containment measures were only in place from mid-March in most countries, euro area real GDP decreased by 3.8%, quarter on quarter. Information from surveys, high-frequency indicators and incoming hard data all point to a further significant contraction of real GDP in the second quarter. Most recent indicators suggest some bottoming-out of the downturn in May as parts of the economy gradually reopen. Accordingly, euro area activity is expected to rebound in the third quarter as the containment measures are eased further, supported by favourable financing conditions, an expansionary fiscal stance and a resumption in global activity, although the overall speed and scale of the rebound remains highly uncertain. This assessment is also broadly reflected in the June 2020 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. In the baseline scenario of the projections, annual real GDP is expected to fall by 8.7% in 2020 and to rebound by 5.2% in 2021 and by 3.3% in 2022. Compared with the March 2020 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real GDP growth has been revised substantially downwards by 9.5 percentage points in 2020 and revised upwards by 3.9 percentage points in 2021 and 1.9 percentage points in 2022. Given the exceptional uncertainty currently surrounding the outlook, the projections also include two alternative scenarios, which we will publish on our website following this press conference. In general, the extent of the contraction and the recovery will depend crucially on the duration and the effectiveness of the containment measures, the success of policies to mitigate the adverse impact on incomes and employment, and the extent to which supply capacity and domestic demand are permanently affected. Overall, the Governing Council sees the balance of risks around the baseline projection to the downside. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation decreased to 0.1% in May, down from 0.3% in April, mainly on account of lower energy price inflation. On the basis of current and futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to decline somewhat further over the coming months and to remain subdued until the end of the year. Over the medium term, weaker demand will put downward pressure on inflation, which will be only partially offset by upward pressures related to supply constraints. Market-based indicators of longer-term inflation expectations have remained at depressed levels. While survey-based indicators of inflation expectations have declined over the short and medium term, longer-term expectations have been less affected. This assessment is also reflected in the June 2020 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation in the baseline scenario at 0.3% in 2020, 0.8% in 2021 and 1.3% in 2022. Compared with the March 2020 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for HICP inflation has been revised downwards by 0.8 percentage points in 2020, 0.6 percentage points in 2021 and 0.3 percentage points in 2022. Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth increased to 8.3% in April 2020, from 7.5% in March. Strong money growth reflects bank credit creation, which is driven to a large extent by the acute liquidity needs in the economy. Moreover, high economic uncertainty is triggering a shift towards money holdings for precautionary reasons. In this environment, the narrow monetary aggregate M1, encompassing the most liquid forms of money, continues to be the main contributor to broad money growth. Developments in loans to the private sector continued to be shaped by the impact of the coronavirus on economic activity. The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations rose further to 6.6% in April 2020, up from 5.5% in March, reflecting firms' need to finance their ongoing expenditures and working capital in the context of rapidly declining revenues. At the same time, the annual growth rate of loans to households decreased to 3.0% in April, from 3.4% in March, amid consumption constraints due to the containment measures, declining confidence and a deteriorating labour market. Our policy measures, in particular the very favourable terms for our targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO , should encourage banks to extend loans to all private sector entities. Together with the measures adopted by national governments and European institutions, they support ongoing access to financing, including for those most affected by the ramifications of the coronavirus pandemic. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is necessary for the robust convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Regarding fiscal policies, an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance remains critical, in view of the sharp contraction in the euro area economy. Measures taken should as much as possible be targeted and temporary in nature in response to the pandemic emergency. The three safety nets endorsed by the European Council for workers, businesses and sovereigns, amounting to a package worth €540 billion, provide important funding support in this context. At the same time, the Governing Council urges further strong and timely efforts to prepare and support the recovery. We therefore strongly welcome the European Commission's proposal for a recovery plan dedicated to supporting the regions and sectors most severely hit by the pandemic, to strengthening the Single Market and to building a lasting and prosperous recovery."
Kazakhstan,2020-06-08,"Press release 21 The base rate remains unchanged at 9.5% June 8, 2020 Almaty The National Bank of Kazakhstan has made a decision to maintain the base rate at 9.5% per annum with the interest rate corridor of +/- 2 percentage points. The situation in the world economy has stabilized and recovery is observed in selected goods and financial markets. The oil consumption has started to resume due to the certain economic recovery signs of China, easing of the quarantine measures in some EU countries and USA. OPEC countries reached a preliminary agreement on the extension of the oil production deal. Oil production cuts by 9.7 mln barrels per day will last until the end of July 2020. Along with that, both the COVID-19 and restrictive measures against the spread of the infection taken in many countries all around the world continue to negatively influence the world economy. In May 2020 the business activity indicators were close to the historical minimum. This situation negatively affects the economic activity and the inflationary processes in Kazakhstan. Apart from the external situation, the pressure on the consumer prices in Kazakhstan is also being applied by the internal factors. The significant fiscal and quasi-fiscal impulse increases the inflationary pressure, caused by the exchange rate pass-through and weakly anchored inflation expectations. At the same time, the weak consumer demand has a deterrent effect on the inflationary processes. The further monetary policy decisions will be based on the dynamics of the development factors in the world commodity markets, the recovery of the economic activity, and also the extent of deviation of the actual dynamics of inflation from the forecasted trajectory. The annual inflation rate is exceeding the targeted range of 4-6% set for 2020-2021. In May 2020 the annual inflation rate amounted to 6.7% (6.8% in April 2020). The inflationary processes get formed under the influence of the quarantine measures in Kazakhstan and in the countries-main trade partners and also of the tenge depreciation and its pass-through into the domestic prices. The main contribution to the dynamics of the inflationary processes is made by the rise of food prices, which increased by 10.7% in annual terms, reaching the maximum level since October 2016. Acceleration of the food inflation resulted from both the increased demand for the certain goods and the limited supply due to the disruption of commodity and goods supply chains under conditions of compliance with the quarantine measures. The dynamics of non-food inflation remains moderate; the annual increase was 5.3%. Increase of the prices on the paid services slowed down to 3.0% as the result of the negative contribution of regulated utility prices. The National Bank has reconsidered its forecast of inflation until the end of the current year. In the framework of developing the forecast of economic development of Kazakhstan for 2020-2024, which assumed the scenario with the oil price level in the range of 20-25 US dollars per barrel, which was considered as the base scenario by the Government for the aims of anti-crisis plan, the inflation rate was estimated to be in the range of 9-11% by the end of the current year. According to the updated estimates for the oil market and base scenario of the National Bank, setting the oil prices at the level of 35-40 US dollars per barrel on average in 2020, the annual inflation rate is forecasted to be in the range of 8.0-8.5% as of the end of 2020. The inflation expectations remain relatively stable. After the increase of the quantitative assessment of the inflation expectations for a year ahead to 6.4% in March 2020, it was in the range of 6.0-6.2% in April-May, reflecting the improvement of the consumption sentiments associated with positivity increase regarding the perspectives of the economic development and the financial condition due to the gradual easing of the quarantine measures. The share of the survey participants, expecting the maintaining the current rate of price increase and its decrease, increased from 56% in April to 62% in May. Nevertheless, the inflation expectations remain weakly anchored, which in the short-term perspectives might influence the consumer prices. The declaration of the state of emergency and the introduction of the quarantine measures against the pandemic COVID-19 in the country contributed to the deterioration of the economic activity. According to the data of Statistics Committee of Ministry of National Economy, in January-April 2020 the GDP has decreased by 0.2% in annual terms as the result of the decline in the wholesale and retail trade by 34.8%, transport services  36.6% in April. The deceleration of the economic activity in certain sectors of the manufacturing industry due to the external and domestic demand drop was being observed. However, the transfer of workers to the remote work and the introduction of the online learning led to the expansion of the communication and delivery services. The positive contribution was also made by the industries of healthcare, public administration, extraction sector and agriculture. In spite of the gradual easing of the quarantine measures in May-June 2020, the economic activity remains under the negative influence of the imposed restrictions. Nevertheless, some economic recovery is being confirmed by the rise of the business activity indicator, according to the preliminary data, to 44.0 points in May 2020 (in April 2020  37.2) which is formed based on the monthly business surveys conducted by the National Bank. The aggregate demand in the second quarter of 2020 remains suppressed, constraining the inflationary pressure. According to the assessment data of the Statistics Committee of Ministry of National Economy, there was a sharp decline of salary growth rates coupled with the increase of the number of people who turned to the employment authorities for the job-placement assistance. The investment activity in the economy is decelerating. In January-April 2020 the growth of investments in fixed assets amounted to 0.9% in annual terms. According to the baseline forecast of the National Bank, as the result of the negative influence of the internal supply and the net export the real GDP in 2020 will decrease by 1.8%, taking into the account the support that will be provided by the significant growth of the consumption by the public administration sector (fiscal and quasi-fiscal impulse). Subsequently, the economy will recover to the potential level in a context of the expected improvement of the epidemiological situation in the country, labor market recovery, and also household income growth. The investment activity will recover as the result of the internal and external demand growth, improvement of the price level in the world commodity markets, and also the recommencement of the investment projects that were postponed this year. Estimates of growth prospects of the countriesmain trade partners of Kazakhstan remain negative. According to the forecasts by Consensus Economics in 2020 the economy of EU 2 will contract by 7.7%. Russia  by 4.1%, economy of China  1.4%. Next year the quick recovery of the indicators in all countries-partners is expected. Thus, the economy of EU will expand by 6.2%, economy of Russia  by 3.8%, economy of China  by 8.1%. Situation in the oil market is improving, however the price level remains relatively low and the outlined dynamics is still unstable. The average monthly price for Brent oil was 32.4 US dollars per barrel in May 2020, i.e. increased by 20.7% over a month. The positive influence on the price level in the world oil market is done by the enactment of the OPEC agreement since May 1, 2020 and the reduction of the oil production in the non-OPEC countries and also by the recovery of the oil consumption, production and transport services in China, the easing of the quarantine measures in some European countries and USA. The additional positive impulse to the oil market is expected to be as the result of the extension of the high reduction of the production by the OPEC countries until the end of July 2020. Nonetheless, the risks, arising from the breach of discipline by some of the OPEC countries, the high level of oil reserves in the world and the possible deterioration of relations between the USA and China, persist. In the first quarter of 2020, according to the preliminary data, the current account had a surplus in the amount of 1.2 bln US dollars as the result of the high oil production level and relatively high futures prices formed in the fourth quarter of 2019. However, in 2020 the National Bank expects the significant deterioration of the current account with the deficit, which is caused by the oil and metal prices drop, the contraction of their production, the reduction of the external demand for the export goods of Kazakhstan due to the deceleration of the world economic activity. Reduction in import will be less significant because of the implementation of the state programs and initiatives. The deepening deficit of the current account will put pressure on tenge exchange rate. As the uncertainty on key trends in the external markets decreases and provided that the situation develops in accordance with the estimates of the National Bank, the easing of the monetary policy conditions is not being ruled out. The next decision of the National Bank of Kazakhstan on the base rate will be announced on July 20, 2020 at 15:00 Nur-Sultan time."
United States,2020-06-10,"EDT June 10, 2020 The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals. The coronavirus outbreak is causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. The virus and the measures taken to protect public health have induced sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job losses. Weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices are holding down consumer price inflation. Financial conditions have improved, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term. In light of these developments, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals. The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including information related to public health, as well as global developments and muted inflation pressures, and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the stance of monetary policy, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. EDT June 10, 2020 - 2 - To support the flow of credit to households and businesses, over coming months the Federal Reserve will increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities at least at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions. In addition, the Open Market Desk will continue to offer large-scale overnight and term repurchase agreement operations.

Peru,2020-06-11,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT  JUNE 2020 BCRP MAINTAINED THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 0.25% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to continue with an expansionary policy stance, maintaining the reference rate at 0.25 percent and implementing further liquidity injection operations, in light of the following developments: Inflation this year would be below the target range due to the significant weakening of domestic demand. One-year-ahead expected inflation fell from 2.2 percent at the end of December 2019 to 1.5 percent in May. Year-on-year inflation rose from 1.72 percent in April to 1.78 percent in May, while inflation excluding food and energy prices fell from 1.87 percent to 1.85 percent. Economic activity continues to be severely affected by the effects of social isolation measures. Business expectations indicators on GDP growth have recovered slightly in May, in line with the gradual resumption of economic activities. Risks to global economic activity have materialized, including a global recession this year. BCRP will continue to take all necessary actions to sustain the payments system and the credit channel in the economy. As of June 10, the liquidity injection operations carried out by BCRP amount to S/ 44.3 billion, of which S/ 20.6 billion was Government-backed repo operations. In addition. BCRP has approved repo operations that promote credit rescheduling, thereby injecting liquidity and promoting a more quickly passthrough of the reductions in the reference interest rate to the interest rates of the new credits granted by the financial system enterprises. The Board considers it appropriate to maintain a strong expansionary monetary stance for an extended period and while the negative effects of the pandemic on inflation and its determinants persist. The Central Bank pays close attention to new information and stands ready to extend monetary stimulus in different ways. The Board also decided to maintain the following interest rates on its window facility operations in domestic currency with financial entities. Overnight deposits: 0.15 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 0.50 percent per year. The BCRP Board's next monetary policy session will take place on July 9, 2020."
Ukraine,2020-06-11,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to cut the key policy rate from 8% to 6% effective 12 June 2020. This is the lowest level of the key policy rate since Ukraine gained its independence. Consumer and investment demand is most likely to remain subdued for longer than forecast in April. On the one hand, this will keep inflation below the target level for longer than projected in the April forecast. On the other hand, this means that the Ukrainian economy will face a deeper contraction than expected. This requires the central bank to continue its monetary policy easing in order to support the economy as the country gradually lifts quarantine measures. Inflation in AprilMay hovered around 2%, being lower than expected and below the target range of 5% ± 1 pp. Inflationary pressures remained weak primarily due to a significant drop in consumer demand for food and nonessential goods. Moreover, price growth was restrained by lower energy prices, increased supply of vegetables, and frozen prices for many services during the quarantine. These factors offset the effects of the hryvnia's weakening in March and the sustained high demand for some goods in early April  these effects having completely vanished as of now. Further on, inflation will grow moderately, albeit likely heading towards the target range more slowly than expected. First, consumer and investment demand remain subdued, although business activity has started to pick up gradually as the quarantine restrictions are eased. The fiscal and monetary policy measures taken with the aim of supporting businesses and households will only partially offset the decline in consumer demand. The recovery of consumer demand will be gradual even after the quarantine is lifted. Second, the FX market, which has a major impact on the price of the basket of goods, is favorable for low inflation. Since the start of April, the supply of foreign currency on the interbank market has exceeded demand. Imports of goods remain below pre-crisis levels across almost all categories of goods, while exports are declining more slowly. As a result, the hryvnia strengthened and since early April the NBU has used this opportunity to purchase around USD 1.8 billion in order to increase international reserves. In such a way, the NBU has become a net buyer of foreign currency since the start of the year, having compensated for the outflow of foreign currency from international reserves in March due to high demand for foreign currency. Third, inflation expectations are improving among households and financial analysts. According to the NBU, their current expectations of inflation in 12 months have aligned with the NBU's medium-term target. At the same time, the NBU's key assumption of continuing cooperation with the International Monetary Fund has realized. On 9 June, the IMF Executive Board approved a new cooperation program with Ukraine  an 18-month Stand-By Arrangement amounting to USD 5 billion. The first tranche of USD 2.1 billion will be received today. This has provided Ukraine with access to financing from the World Bank and the EU, which has already disbursed EUR 500 million to the Ukrainian government. This year, the total amount of official financing is expected to reach over USD 5 billion, with more than half of that amount received from the IMF. These funds would fully finance budget expenditures on counteracting the negative effects from the coronavirus pandemic and quarantine restrictions. In addition, they would increase international reserves, despite there being significant repayments of external public debt this year. A program with the IMF would also facilitate Ukraine's access to the international capital markets. A longer-lasting coronavirus pandemic and the quarantine measures required to overcome it, both in Ukraine and globally, remain the key risk to macrofinancial stability. In addition, it is critically important to continue structural reforms and to maintain a prudent macroeconomic policy. Given the expectation that inflation would be below its target for a longer period of time, the NBU Board cut the key policy rate by 2 pp, to 6%. Overall, the key policy rate has decreased by 7.5 pp since the start of the current year, hitting a historic low in independent Ukraine. Monetary easing and other anti-crisis measures taken by the NBU in recent months will support business activity in the country. Although the contraction has already bottomed out, the NBU estimates that the extent of the recession in Q2 will be greater than expected. Therefore, measures to put the economy back on the track to growth need to be rather decisive. The NBU has also decided to narrow its interest rate band on standing facilities, from the key policy rate +/- 2 pp to the key policy rate +/- 1 pp. This means that with the new key policy rate, overnight refinancing loans will be issued at 7%, and overnight certificates of deposit will be placed at 5%. By changing the width of the band, the NBU will be able to achieve the operational goal of its monetary policy, which is to keep hryvnia interbank rates close to the key policy rate, and within the band of interest rates on standing facilities. A decrease in the key policy rate below its neutral level indicates the end of the cycle of rapid monetary policy easing. Given the high level of uncertainty, the NBU's future monetary policy will mainly depend on:. how great is the fall in consumer demand, which weakens inflationary pressureson the other hand, it will be driven by the speed of the recovery of business activity on the back of relaxed quarantine measures, which will accelerate price growth.The decision to cut the key policy rate, to 6%, was approved by NBU Board Decision on the key policy rate No.397D, dated 11 June 2020. A summary of the discussion by Monetary Policy Committee members that preceded the approval of this decision will be published on 22 June 2020. The next meeting of the NBU Board on monetary policy issues will be held on 23 July 2020 as scheduled."
Armenia,2020-06-16,"PRESS RELEASE 16.06.2020 Refinancing rate reduced by 0.5 percentage points to 4.50% At its June 16, 2020 meeting, the Board of the Central bank of Armenia decided to cut the refinancing rate by 0.5 percentage points to 4.5%. There was 0.1% deflation in May 2020, compared to 0.4% deflation recorded in the same month of the previous year, in which case the 12-month inflation has increased, amounting to 1.2%. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the world economy is expected to register one of its biggest historic downturns. Moreover, the recovery of the world economy is estimated to be slower than expected, and uncertainty over the further course of the pandemic persists. At the same time, commodity prices show signs of stabilization and recovery, owing to the cautiously optimistic expectations for Chinese economy. It is predicted that the external sector will continue having a deflationary effect on the Armenian economy. According to the Central Bank estimates, the decline in economic activity in Armenia in the second quarter will deepen driven by both supply and demand factors. On the supply side, the slowdown is mostly caused by the decline in construction and services, and the decrease in demand will be reflected mainly in the reduction of private expenditures in terms of both consumption and investment. Despite the stimulative impact of the fiscal policy compared to the previous year, the impact of declining private demand will prevail, which is largely determined by persisting uncertainties related to the pandemic. Given the slowdown of the recovery of external and domestic demand, the current low inflationary environment and the adverse impact of increased uncertainty, the Board of the Central Bank deems it appropriate to reduce the refinancing rate by a wider step. The Board estimates that, in the current situation, maintaining the expansionary monetary policy stance in the medium run will be needed, under which the inflation will remain low in the short term, approaching the target only at the end of the forecast horizon. The Board also reckons that, in the current situation, implementing a more expansionary fiscal policy along with a stimulative monetary policy is key to restoring aggregate demand. The Board estimates that the risks of inflation deviating from the projection are still on the downside due to the possible slow recovery of demand and the likely persistence of uncertainty. Should the risks materialize, the Central Bank will stand ready to adjust the policy as needed, ensuring price stability in the medium run. Detailed information underlying the decision on the level of interest rate is available in the Inflation Report (Monetary Policy Program for the second quarter of 2020) to be published on June 30, 2020."
Chile,2020-06-16,"Tuesday, 16 June 2020 Monetary Policy Meeting  June 2020 At its Monetary Policy Meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided, by the unanimous vote of its members, to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 0.50%. The Board also decided to extend the unconventional measures that sustain liquidity and credit. The effects of the Covid-19 pandemic have persisted and intensified further, in particular because of the need to impose quarantines in the country's areas that house nearly half of the national population. The April Imacec showed a significant drop in activity, which will go to new depths in May and June due to the extension and duration of the containment measures decreed in recent months. The labor market has also deteriorated substantially, together with drops in various consumption indicators and markedly pessimistic expectations. On investment, worth noting are the steady decline of capital goods imports and business expectations that persist in clearly negative territory. Accordingly, private growth expectations during this year have been revised downward. In this context, the recent Emergency Plan agreed on by the Government and the extended Finance Commission will play an important role in mitigating the negative economic effects of the pandemic, because of both the measures considered and its medium-term outlook. In the external scenario, confinement measures have been eased in several countries as the contagion indexes and death tolls have decreased. This gradual reopening has led to a slight improvement in some short-term indicators, where worth singling out are the surprises in China's manufacturing data, and in sales and employment in the United States. However, they are still far from their pre-pandemic levels. In some economies, the expectations of households and companies showed a marginal rebound, but most remain on the contractionary side. The monetary and fiscal authorities have made new announcements oriented at underpinning the process of economic recovery and [INF*RES*AS] safeguarding financial stability, mainly those of the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve. Commodity prices, in general, have also increased, albeit with major fluctuations in the case of oil. Copper saw its highest values in late January. Still, a high degree of uncertainty persists surrounding a possible reactivation of the spread of the Covid-19, and great sensitivity to signals suggesting it. The magnitude of fiscal and monetary packages has continued to sustain the performance of the world's financial markets, which nonetheless continue to show high volatility, as demonstrated by the movements of recent days. Compared to the previous Meeting, stock markets and risk premiums scored further improvements, a significant group of currencies appreciated against the dollar and capital outflows from the emerging world tended to reverse. Long-term interest rates remain near minimum values. The Chilean financial markets have followed these same trends, where the appreciation of the peso stands out. With respect to credit, the annual growth of commercial loans has continued to rise in Chile while average interest rates have fallen. There is also a greater focus on credit to smaller companies. The increase in mortgage loans remains stable, while the consumer credit continues to decelerate. Banks have continued to use the resources of the Conditional Facility for Increased Lending (FCIC), having withdrawn nearly 83% of the resources considered. These funds have facilitated more than one million debt restructurings and the granting of somewhat more than one hundred thousand Covid loans —with state guarantee— for the financing of working capital. At May, annual inflation was down to 2.8% and its core component —CPI excluding volatiles— remained slightly above 2.5%. Inflationary pressures have been significantly reduced by the abrupt widening of the activity gap in the second quarter, while exchange rate pressures have been eased by the appreciation of the peso from its peaks a few weeks ago. In this context, the various measures of inflation expectations show setbacks in expected inflation one year ahead. Two years ahead, the expectations measured by Financial Brokers Survey were below 3% and in the Economic Expectations Survey stayed at 3%. The Board estimates that the economy requires an intensification of the monetary boost. Thus, along with keeping the MPR at 0.5% —which is the current technical minimum estimate— it decided to expand its use of non-conventional instruments. First, it agreed to open phase 2 of the FCIC that contemplates an amount of US$16 billion effective for eight months. This program involves strengthening the incentives to lend to small and medium- sized enterprises, and to non-banking credit providers. Second, it agreed to implement a special asset purchase program, in the amount of US$8 billion over a six month period. Thus, through both programs, additional resources will be mobilized of up to 10% of GDP. [INF*RES*AS] The initial amount of asset purchase, the specific dates of startup, financial conditions and other operational aspects will be announced in the coming days. The Board reiterates that it will maintain a high monetary impulse for a prolonged period of time in order to ensure compliance with its objectives. In particular, it estimates that it will keep the MPR at its technical minimum over the entire projection horizon. In addition, if economic developments so require, it will continue to explore options to intensify the impulse and support financial stability, using unconventional instruments. The June 2020 Monetary Policy Report containing the projections and analyses that sustain these Board decisions will be published tomorrow. Wednesday 17 June at 8:30 AM. The minutes emanating from this Monetary Policy Meeting will be published at 8:30 AM Thursday 2 July 2020. The next Monetary Policy Meeting is scheduled to take place on Tuesday 14 and Wednesday 15 July and the statement thereof will be published at 18:00 hours of Wednesday 15.

Poland,2020-06-16,"Warsaw, 16 June 2020 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 16 June 2020 The Council decided to maintain the NBP reference rate at the level of 0.10%. At the same time, the Council set the remaining NBP interest rates at the following levels: ▪ lombard rate at 0.50%; ▪ deposit rate at 0.00%; ▪ rediscount rate at 0.11%; ▪ discount rate at 0.12%. NBP will continue to purchase government securities and government-guaranteed debt securities in the secondary market as part of the structural operations. The timing and scale of the operations will depend on the market conditions. Furthermore. NBP will offer bill discount credit aimed at refinancing loans granted to enterprises by banks. The incoming data confirm that the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a fall in global economic activity, including to a recession in economies being Poland's major trading partners. This was accompanied by a deterioration in labour market situation and a sharp weakening of consumer and business sentiment. In order to mitigate the negative economic effects of the pandemic, fiscal measures have been introduced to alleviate the fall in households' and enterprises' income as well as to stimulate economic activity. At the same time, monetary policy has been eased by  inter alia  lowering interest rates and pursuing asset purchases. The recent period, together with loosening of restrictions imposed in order to contain the pandemic in many countries, has seen a gradual improvement in sentiment. Recent forecasts indicate that in the second half of 2020 global economic conditions should improve, though the level of activity will be lower than before the pandemic. At the same time, there is uncertainty regarding the pace and robustness of the improvement in global economic conditions in the following quarters. Monetary policy easing and fiscal stimulus packages introduced in major advanced economies, along with a certain improvement in sentiment, contributed to increases of some asset prices in the international financial markets which was also reflected in the appreciation of some countries' currencies. Moreover, in the recent period the fall in the prices of some commodities has come to a halt, although they are still considerably lower than at the beginning of the year. This, together with weaker economic activity, contributes to a decline in inflation in many countries, including Poland's main trading partners. In Poland, the April data point to a significant fall in economic activity, a decrease in wages and employment in enterprises as well as weak consumer and business sentiment. Yet, the recent weeks have seen a gradual lifting of economic activity restrictions which has translated into some improvement in sentiment. This has been accompanied by a considerable decline in inflation. Over the near term, a further recovery in economic activity may be expected. Apart from the likely further loosening of the pandemic-related restrictions, this will be supported by economic policy measures, including monetary policy easing by NBP that mitigates the fall in employment, supporting incomes of households and financial situation of enterprises. The scale of the expected recovery could, however, be curbed by uncertainty about the consequences of the pandemic, lower incomes and weaker sentiment of economic agents than in previous years. The pace of the economic recovery could also be mitigated by the lack of visible zloty exchange rate adjustment to the global pandemic shock and to the monetary policy easing introduced by NBP. These operations are aimed at changing the long-term liquidity structure in the banking sector, ensuring the liquidity in secondary markets for the purchased securities and enhancing the impact of the NBP interest rate cuts on the economy, i.e. strengthening the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Furthermore. NBP will also offer bill discount credit aimed at refinancing loans granted to enterprises by banks. The NBP monetary policy easing mitigates the negative economic impact of the pandemic, limiting the scale of the fall in economic activity and supporting incomes of households and enterprises. Consequently, it alleviates the fall in employment and deterioration in financial situation of enterprises, thus being conducive to quicker economic recovery after the abatement of the pandemic. The measures undertaken by NBP reduce the risk of inflation falling below the NBP inflation target in the medium term and  due to their positive impact on financial situation of debtors  are conducive to enhancement of financial system stability."
Brazil,2020-06-17,"In its 231st&#160;meeting, the Copom unanimously decided to lower the Selic rate to 2.25% p.a. In its 231st meeting, the Copom unanimously decided to lower the Selic rate to 2.25% p.a. The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario:. Regarding the global outlook, the COVID-19 pandemic keeps causing a pronounced slowdown in global growth. Against this backdrop, despite the significant provision of fiscal and monetary stimuli in major economies and some moderation in financial assets volatility, the environment for emerging economies remains challenging. Turning to economic activity, the first-quarter data release showed the largest GDP decline since 2015, reflecting the initial effects of the pandemic. Recent indicators suggest the second-quarter economic activity contraction will be even larger. Prospectively, uncertainty about the second-semester economic recovery remains larger than usual. The Committee judges that various measures of underlying inflation are running below the level compatible with meeting the inflation target at the relevant horizon for monetary policy. Inflation expectations for 2020, 2021, and 2022 collected by the Focus survey are around 1.6%, 3.0%, and 3.5%, respectively. The Copom's inflation projections in the hybrid scenario with interest rate path extracted from the Focus survey and constant exchange rate at R$4.95/US$* stand around 2.0% for 2020 and 3.2% for 2021. This scenario assumes a path for the Selic rate that ends 2020 at 2.25% p.a. and rises to 3.00% p.a. in 2021; and. The scenario with constant interest rate at 3.00% p.a. and constant exchange rate at R$4.95/US$* yields inflation projections around 1.9% for 2020 and 3.0% for 2021. The Committee emphasizes that risks to its baseline scenario remain in both directions. On the one hand, economic slack may continue to produce a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory. This risk increases if a lengthening of the pandemic causes an increase in uncertainty and precautionary savings and, consequently, implies a decline in aggregate demand that is larger and longer than estimated. On the other hand, fiscal policy responses to the pandemic that permanently aggravate the fiscal path or a frustration with the continuation of the reform agenda may increase the risk premium. Additionally, the credit and transfer programs implemented in response to the pandemic may cause a smaller-than-estimated decline in aggregate demand, introducing an asymmetry to the balance of risks. This set of factors could potentially result in a higher-than-expected path for inflation over the relevant horizon for monetary policy. The Committee believes that persevering in the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy is essential for a sustainable economic recovery. The Copom also stresses that uncertainty regarding the continuation of the reform agenda and permanent changes to the fiscal consolidation process could result in an increase in the structural interest rate. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to lower the Selic rate to 2.25% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation, a higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks, and it is consistent with convergence of inflation to its target over the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2021. At the present moment, the Committee judges that the magnitude of the monetary stimulus already implemented seems compatible with the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. For the next meetings, the Committee sees as appropriate to evaluate the impact of the pandemic and of the set of credit and transfer programs in place, and foresees that any possible adjustment to the current monetary stimulus would be residual. However, the Copom remains attentive to revisions of the economic scenario and of the inflation expectations for the relevant horizon of monetary policy. The Committee recognizes that the variance of its balance of risks has increased and that further information on the evolution of the pandemic, as well as a decline in fiscal uncertainty, will be essential to determine its next steps. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Roberto Oliveira Campos Neto (Governor). Bruno Serra Fernandes. Carolina de Assis Barros. Fernanda Feitosa Nechio. Joao Manoel Pinho de Mello. Mauricio Costa de Moura. Otavio Ribeiro Damaso, and Paulo Srgio Neves de Souza. *Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average R$/US$ exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the last day of the week before the Copom meeting."
Russia,2020-06-19,"On 19 June 2020, the Bank of Russia decided to cut the key rate by 100 bp to 4.50% per annum. Disinflationary factors have been more profound than expected due to a longer duration of restrictive measures in Russia and across the world. The effect of short-term pro-inflationary factors has been largely exhausted. Financial stability risks related to the situation in global financial markets have declined. Household and business inflation expectations have abated. In these circumstances, there is a risk that in 2021 inflation might significantly deviate downwards from the 4% target. The key rate decision taken by the Bank of Russia is aimed at limiting this risk and maintaining inflation close to 4%. If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia will consider the necessity of further key rate reduction at its upcoming meetings. In its key rate decision-making, the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic developments over the forecast horizon, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. Inflation dynamics this year and in the first half of 2021 will be largely influenced by a steep decline in domestic and external demand occurred in the second quarter. The disinflationary effect of weak demand has strengthened due to both current and deferred economic effect of restrictions. Household and business inflation expectations have abated after a short-lived growth in March-April. The influence of the weaker ruble and the episodes of increased demand for certain product groups in March has been exhausted. According to preliminary data as of 15 June, annual consumer price growth rate was around 3.1%. In the coming months, consumer price dynamics will be additionally contained by the strengthening of the ruble observed in May — early June on the back of stabilising global financial markets and growing oil prices. Current monthly annualised inflation will continue to decline. At the same time, annual inflation rate will rise in 2020 owing to the low base effect of 2019. In the context of prevailing disinflationary factors, there is a risk that in 2021 inflation might significantly deviate downwards from the 4% target. The key rate decision taken by the Bank of Russia is aimed at limiting this risk and maintaining inflation close to 4%. Monetary conditions slightly eased in May-June after some tightening in March-April. OFZ and corporate bond yields dropped below the levels observed at the beginning of the year, including owing to the current monetary policy stance. The country risk premium went down, largely owing to an improved situation in global financial and commodity markets. Interest rates on deposit and housing mortgage loans decreased. At the same time, increased credit risks in the real sector push interest rates up and lead to a tightening of non-price lending conditions in certain market segments. The Bank of Russia's decisions to cut the key rate, along with a notable drop in OFZ yields, pave the way for reduction in interest rates in other financial market segments in the future. Coupled with the Government and other Bank of Russia's measures, this will support lending, including in the most vulnerable sectors of the economy. Economic activity. Some of the previously enforced restrictive measures remain in place. Alongside a considerable drop in external demand, the negative pressure this is exerting on economic activity is more extended than the Bank of Russia assumed in April. There was a significant drop in business activity in the services sector and manufacturing; a sizeable contraction was reported in the numbers of new orders in external and domestic markets; investment declined. Unemployment went up and incomes shrank. There was a considerable drop in retail sales. The phased lifting of restrictions between May and June is helping consumption-oriented sectors gradually recover. However, recent business surveys invariably reflect cautious sentiment. The contraction of GDP in the second quarter could prove more sizeable than expected. At the same time, the Russian economy is gaining support from the Russian Government and the Bank of Russia's additional measures aimed at the mitigation of economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic. In these conditions. GDP will decrease by 4-6% in 2020. Recovery growth of the Russian economy will continue in 2021-2022. Inflation risks. Disinflationary risks prevail over pro-inflationary ones. Under the baseline scenario, disinflationary risks are chiefly connected with uncertainty as to further developments in the coronavirus pandemic situation in Russia and globally, the scale of possible measures to fight it and their impact on economic activity, as well as the speed at which both the global and Russian economies will recover as restrictive measures are mitigated. The short-term pro-inflationary risks connected with a potential sizeable pass-through into prices of the recent ruble weakening as well as with the episodes of increased demand for several product groups have all been exhausted. However, disrupted supply chains as a result of the curbs and the additional costs of protecting personnel and consumers from the coronavirus spread could exert upward pressure on prices. The periods of strengthened volatility in global markets can be reflected in exchange rate and inflation expectations. Medium-term inflation dynamics will be significantly impacted by fiscal policy parameters, in particular, the scale and efficiency of the Government's measures towards mitigating the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic and overcoming structural constraints, as well as the speed of the 2021-2022 budget consolidation. If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia will consider the necessity of further key rate reduction at its upcoming meetings. In its further key rate decision-making, the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic developments over the forecast horizon, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. The Bank of Russia will hold its next key rate review meeting on 24 July 2020. The press release on the Bank of Russia decision is to be published 13:30 Moscow time.

Thailand,2020-06-20,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 6/2020 Mr. Titanun Mallikamas. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 23 September 2020 as follows. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 050 percent. In deliberating their policy decision, the Committee assessed that the Thai economy would contract in 2020 slightly less than the previous forecast, but would expand in 2021 at a lower rate than previously forecasted mainly due to the slow recovery of foreign tourist figures. The Committee would also monitor risks of the second wave of the outbreak. Meanwhile headline inflation would be less negative this year than the previous assessment and would rise gradually in 2021. Financial stability was more vulnerable given the economic outlook. The Committee viewed that the extra accommodative monetary policy since the beginning of the year as well as the fiscal, financial, and credit measures additionally announced helped alleviate adverse impacts, and would support the economic recovery after the pandemic subsided, facilitate the return of inflation to the target, and reduce financial stability risks. The Committee thus voted to maintain the policy rate at this meeting. The Committee viewed that financial institutions should expedite debt restructuring for households and businesses to have a more meaningful impact. The Thai economy would contract in 2020 slightly less than previously forecasted, but would expand in 2021 at a lower rate than the previous forecast mainly due to the slow recovery of foreign tourist figures. Domestic demand, both private consumption and private investment, were expected to improve somewhat while the labor market remained fragile. Employment and household incomes remained weak and would take time to recover, which would result in deteriorating household debt service capability and in turn affect private consumption in the period ahead. Overall economic activities would take at least two years before returning to the pre-pandemic level. Nevertheless the recovery would significantly vary among economic sectors and firms in different segments. The Committee thus viewed that going forward government policies from various agencies needed to be more targeted and timely. Such policies should continuously promote employment, economic restructuring, and economic recovery. Policy coordination among government agencies would be crucial to ensure coherent and consistent measures, namely, fiscal measures as the main driving force of the economy, together with continued accommodative monetary policy, as well as financial and credit measures to support liquidity. The government policies should emphasize on supply-side policies to support the changing economic structure, patterns of business operations, and labor skill development consistent with the post-COVID environment in order to ensure a sustained economic recovery. The annual average of headline inflation would be less negative in 2020 than the previous assessment on the back of increasing energy prices as demand rose after the relaxation of COVID-19 containment measures. Core inflation would remain subdued at a low level. However given the economic recovery, headline inflation would gradually rise and stay close to the lower bound of the target range in 2021. Medium-term inflation expectations remained anchored within the target. Commercial bank lending rates and government bond yields remained at low levels. Meanwhile corporate bond spreads started to decrease for bonds with high credit ratings. Commercial bank loans expanded on the back of large corporate and retail loans. Meanwhile contraction in SME loans improved owing partly to government credit measures and loan repayment holiday. With the level of overall liquidity in the financial system remaining ample, the Committee deemed it important that liquidity be better distributed to affected businesses and households. Regarding exchange rates, although the baht depreciated against the US dollar and most regional currencies since the previous meeting, the Committee viewed that if the baht were to appreciate rapidly, the economic recovery could be affected. Therefore the Committee would closely monitor developments in foreign exchange markets as well as assess the necessity of implementing additional appropriate measures. The financial system remained sound despite increasing vulnerabilities given the economic outlook. Commercial banks had robust capital fund and loan loss provision levels. Nevertheless there remained a need in the period ahead to cope with the impacts from the highly uncertain COVID-19 situation and the increased risks from deteriorating debt service capability of businesses and households. The Committee viewed that commercial banks should expedite debt restructuring for retail borrowers and businesses to a wide extent and accelerate lending under various measures to address liquidity problems in a targeted and timely manner consistent with business restructuring. Looking ahead, the Committee would monitor developments of economic growth, inflation, and financial stability, together with associated risks, including external risks, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the effectiveness of the fiscal, financial, and credit measures, in deliberating monetary policy going forward.

Hungary,2020-06-23,"At its meeting on 23 June 2020, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 24 June 2020:. In the current extraordinary economic environment, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank's (MNB) mandate is still to achieve and maintain price stability, to preserve financial stability, as well as to support the Government's economic policy. Based on incoming data. Hungarian economic performance in 2020 is likely to be more subdued than earlier expected, while the outlook for inflation has shifted downwards persistently. To maintain price stability and support the recovery of economic growth, fine-tuning of monetary conditions has become necessary. The coronavirus pandemic hit the global economy in a weakened state. As a result of the measures taken to prevent the spread of the pandemic, in the second quarter real economic activity declined, while unemployment rates rose worldwide. From the beginning of May economic activity has restarted gradually as the restrictive measures were eased. There remains an exceptionally large degree of uncertainty in judging the time profile of the health emergency and the speed of the global economic recovery. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the outlook for growth in the global economy has deteriorated significantly. Disinflationary effects have strengthened generally. In parallel, the global leading central banks announced further easing measures. The Federal Reserve continued its liquidity-providing and asset purchase programmes. The European Central Bank raised the total amount of its asset purchase programme (PEPP), launched to counteract the effects of the pandemic, to EUR 1,350 billion and extended its horizon. In our region, the decision-makers at the Czech and the Polish central banks cut the policy rates to close to zero as well. In parallel with the restart of economic activity and the easing measures taken by the global leading central banks, financial market sentiment started to improve. The coronavirus pandemic hit the Hungarian economy when its fundamentals were stable, and growth was strong. The economic policy pursued over the past decade has maintained the country's macroeconomic balance and reduced its external and internal vulnerability. In the first quarter of 2020. Hungary's economic growth slowed to 2.2 percent year on year. However, the Hungarian economy's growth surplus compared to the euro area far exceeded the value of around 3 percentage points achieved in recent years. Hungary's defence against the first wave of the coronavirus has been successful, which provides appropriate foundation for the economic recovery. This year's macroeconomic data are expected to show significant volatility and dichotomy. The effects of the pandemic are likely to be the strongest in the second quarter. Following a significant decline in GDP in the spring, a recovery of economic growth is expected from the third quarter. A pick-up in public investment and an expansion in corporate lending are required to a quick ‘V' shape economic recovery in the second half of the year. The moratorium on instalment payments of loans contributes HUF 2,000 billion to maintaining purchasing power and preserving jobs by the end of the year overall. In line with the expected slower recovery in the external environment, production in export-oriented industrial sectors may pick up towards the end of the year. Overall. Hungarian GDP may grow at a restrained pace in 2020. As a result of the cost of protective economic measures and the slower nominal GDP growth the budget deficit in 2020 is likely to rise compared to previous years but remain low in international comparison. The government debt ratio rises temporarily; however, with the quick recovery of the economy, it is expected to return to a downward path from 2021. The current account balance shows a moderate deficit this year as well, but net lending remains positive persistently. Hungary's external debt-to-GDP ratios are expected to decline further. Due to the coronavirus epidemic, strong disinflationary effects have appeared in the Hungarian economy as well. Following a temporary rise at the beginning of 2020, the consumer price index quickly returned into the central bank tolerance band, in line with expectations, before declining to its lower bound. Looking ahead, high volatility in inflation is expected to persist. Nevertheless, inflation is likely to stabilise again around the 3 percent central bank target as the effects of cost-sensitive items fade. Weakening economic activity caused by the coronavirus pandemic reduces core inflation excluding indirect tax effects through several channels. In addition to a weaker external inflation environment, more muted domestic demand compared to previous years is also increasingly restraining underlying inflation. Due to strong disinflationary effects, core inflation excluding indirect tax effects will fall below 3 percent: it is expected to stand at 3.33.5 percent in 2020 and at 2.62.7 percent in 2021. Domestic financial market conditions have improved with the restart of the economy, meanwhile volatility in financial markets has declined further since the Council's previous interest rate decision. For most of the period, the forint appreciated against the euro, in line with other currencies in the region. Liquidity conditions in the government securities market remains stable and auction demand has been strong. The Magyar Nemzeti Bank has decided to implement a series of coordinated and targeted measures in recent months. The measures helped to stabilise domestic money market developments while liquidity with favourable conditions, available to all economic agents, supports the recovery of economic growth. The Bond Funding for Growth Scheme (BGS) and the Funding for Growth Scheme Go! (FGS Go!) ensure the domestic corporate sector to access sustainable, stable and long-term funding, and credit market and investment growth to pick up. In the Monetary Council's assessment, due to strong disinflationary effects the outlook for inflation has shifted downwards persistently, while Hungarian economic performance this year is likely to be more subdued than earlier expected. To maintain price stability and support the recovery of economic growth, the Monetary Council deemed general fine-tuning of interest rate conditions necessary. Accordingly, the Council reduced the central bank base rate by 15 basis points to 0.75 percent. The Monetary Council left the overnight deposit rate at -0.05 percent, and the overnight and the one-week collateralised lending rates at 1.85 percent unchanged. In the Council's view, the current set of instruments provides appropriate room for manoeuvre to respond to emerging challenges in a targeted and flexible manner. The Council continues to consider the government securities purchase programme as a safety net, which it intends to use in case of necessary and to the extent necessary. The MNB will still set the one-week deposit rate at the weekly tenders. In the Council's assessment, in the current macroeconomic environment a similar shift in the one-week deposit rate as in the base rate is warranted. This fine-tuning measure by the Monetary Council jointly supports the maintenance of price stability and the recovery of economic growth. The Council continuously assesses incoming data and changes in the outlook for inflation. In line with its statutory mandate, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank will use every instrument at its disposal to achieve price stability and to support the Hungarian economic and financial system."
Czech Republic,2020-06-24,"At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank unanimously kept interest rates unchanged. The two-week repo rate thus remains at 0.25%, the discount rate at 0.05% and the Lombard rate at 1%.. This decision of the Bank Board is underpinned by the May macroeconomic forecast and by an assessment of information obtained since it was prepared. The latest forecast was prepared in unprecedented conditions of a peaking coronavirus pandemic and related huge uncertainty. Its baseline scenario is largely materialising so far, although the published data may be subject to an increased degree of uncertainty. After the fall in domestic market interest rates in May, consistent with the forecast is broad stability of rates in the following quarters. The Bank Board assessed the risks to the current inflation forecast at the monetary policy horizon as being broadly balanced. The decline in GDP in the effective euro area will be somewhat deeper than forecasted this year. Next year, economic activity will recover all the more markedly. The outlook for foreign prices has not been revised significantly compared with the assumptions of the current forecast. The outlook for the 3M EURIBOR is unchanged, even though the European Central Bank further increased the volume of intended securities purchases and extended their time horizon. Foreign interest rates thus remain negative over the entire forecast horizon. The oil price will be slightly higher this year and the next compared with the assumptions of the current forecast. The outlook for the euro-dollar exchange rate is unchanged. Domestic inflation was slightly above the forecast in April and May, owing mainly to higher-than-expected core inflation. This was counteracted above all by an unexpectedly sharp drop in fuel prices and also by a somewhat slower pass-through of increased excise duty on tobacco to cigarette prices. Food prices and administered prices were in line with the forecast. The current forecast expects inflation to decline to the 2% target at the end of this year. As a result of measures adopted against the pandemic, economic activity dropped by 2% year on year (and 3.3% quarter on quarter) in 2020 Q1. The depth of the decline of the Czech economy in Q1 was in line with the CNB's forecast. The deviations of the individual expenditure items from the forecast offset each other and were relatively slight in the context of the unprecedented situation. Government consumption was higher than forecasted, rising somewhat more markedly than expected. By contrast, year-on-year growth in household consumption halted in line with the forecast as a result of the quarantine measures. The drop in gross capital formation was larger than forecasted. By contrast, net exports decreased less than the CNB had predicted. The decrease in both exports and imports was less pronounced than in the forecast. Owing to the impacts of the pandemic, industrial production recorded an appreciable year-on-year decline in March, which deepened further in April. In particular, the automotive industry recorded a drop in production. The previous growth in construction output came to a halt in March and turned into a year-on-year decrease in April. A deepening year-on-year decline has also been visible in retail sales since March. The employment and unemployment forecast is broadly materialising so far. In 2020 Q1, total employment fell slightly and the unemployment rate stayed close to its all-time low. So far in Q2, the labour market is already cooling visibly in connection with the adverse economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic. The slowdown in wage growth in 2020 Q1 was slightly less pronounced than forecasted. This was due to higher-than-expected wage growth in market sectors due to lower drawdown of attendance allowance and less intensive use of obstacles to work on the employer's part compared with the forecast assumptions. The koruna-euro exchange rate was close to the forecast on average in Q2. Following a sharp weakening in mid-March, the exchange rate mostly fluctuated between CZK 27 and CZK 27.50 to the euro until mid-May and then appreciated to around CZK 26.70 to the euro. The firming of the koruna reflected improvements in the epidemiological situation, the reopening of economies and improvements in global sentiment. Overall, economic developments are largely in line with the forecast so far. The GDP figure for 2020 Q1 confirmed the negative impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the related decrease in external demand and the government's quarantine measures on the domestic economy. Minor upward deviations from the forecast were recorded for wages in the same period and for consumer prices in May. The share of unemployed persons during Q2 is also slightly higher than expected."
Georgia,2020-06-24,"24.06.2020 The National Bank of Georgia (NBG) Cuts the Monetary Policy Rate by 0.25 Percentage Points To 8.25% The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on June 24, 2020, and decided to cut the refinancing rate by 0.25 percentage points to 8.25 percent. In May, annual inflation stood at 6.5 percent. According to the NBG forecasts, inflation will continue to gradually decline over the rest of the year and will reach the target level in the first half of 2021. The inflation dynamics will be determined by the interaction of both demand and supply side factors. On the one hand, the Covid-19 prevention measures led to an increase in the cost of supply of some goods and services. However, the increase in costs has only a short-term effect on inflation rate. On the other hand, the impact of significantly weaker external and domestic demand on inflation will last longer, leading to a reduction in inflation forecasts. At the same time, it should be noted that above target inflation in a long-term creates the risks of rising inflation expectations. Taking these factors into account, the Monetary Policy Committee deemed it appropriate to contiსnue the gradual exit from the tightened monetary policy stance and reduced the rate by 0.25 percentage points. Despite the decline, monetary policy remains tight, ensuring a return of inflation to its target level in the medium term. The pace of further policy normalization will depend on how quickly inflation expectations recede. Preliminary indicators produce mixed signals regarding the expected reduction in aggregate demand. According to current estimates, economic activity in April fell by 16.6 percent annually. At the same time, in May, compared to the previous month, the volume of transactions with payment cards increased by 21 percent, although the annual growth rate is still negative. On the other hand, high annual growth of cash in circulation points to increased economic activity. At the same time, in the wake of the gradual lifting of restrictions, some improvement in credit activity has been observed. All these factors reveal that there is quite some uncertainty about the scale of the expected decline in aggregate demand. In addition, over the year the aggregate demand is expected to be positively impacted by significant fiscal stimulus, including planned partial subsidies on interest charges for mortgage loans. The latter is, in fact, equivalent to additional easing of monetary policy stance. According to forecasts, as a result of the economic downturn in trading partner countries, external demand will remain significantly weakened throughout the year. According to preliminary data, exports of goods in May declined by 31 percent annually, while the tourism revenues fell by 97 percent. Along with the decline in revenues from exports, imports in May also fell by 34 percent year on year. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all instruments at its disposal in order to ensure the price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee is scheduled on August 5, 2020."
Philippines,2020-06-24,"At its meeting on monetary policy today, the Monetary Board decided to cut the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) facility by 50 basis points (bps) to 2.25 percent, effective Friday, 26 June 2020. The interest rates on the overnight deposit and lending facilities were reduced to 1.75 percent and 2.75 percent, respectively.Latest baseline forecasts indicate that inflation could settle near the low end of the target range of 3.0 percent ± 1 percentage point inflation for 2020 up to 2022, with inflation expectations remaining firmly anchored over the policy horizon. Meanwhile, the balance of risks to the inflation outlook leans toward the downside from 2020 up to 2022 owing largely to the potential impact of a deeper and more disruptive pandemic on domestic and global demand conditions. The Monetary Board observed that domestic economic activity has slowed with the enforcement of necessary protocols to slow the spread of the virus in the country. At the same time, the outlook for global growth has deteriorated further as considerable uncertainty still surrounds the extent of the health crisis. The Monetary Board noted that even as economies begin to reopen, the global recovery would likely be protracted and uneven. Hence, there remains a critical need for continuing measures to bolster economic activity and support financial conditions, especially the effective implementation of interventions to protect human health, boost agricultural productivity and build infrastructure. Given these considerations, the Monetary Board decided that a further reduction in the policy rate amidst a benign inflation environment would help mitigate the downside risks to growth and boost market confidence. Even as domestic liquidity dynamics and market function continue to improve owing to prior liquidity-enhancing measures, the Monetary Board believes that keeping an accommodative stance will further ease the cost of borrowing and ensure ample credit and liquidity in the financial system as the economy transitions toward recovery in the coming months. Going forward, the BSP reiterates its support for the health and fiscal programs already being rolled out by the National Government in responding to the needs of Filipino households and businesses. The BSP remains committed to deploying its full range of monetary instruments and regulatory relief measures as needed in fulfillment of its mandate to promote non-inflationary and sustainable growth."
Egypt,2020-06-25,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release June 25, 2020 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 925 percent, 1025 percent, and 975 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 975 percen. Annual headline urban inflation declined to 47 percent in May 2020 from 59 percent in April 2020, supported by muted inflationary pressures as well as favorable base effects where monthly headline inflation recorded zero in May 2020 compared to 11 percent in May 201. The decline of annual headline inflation was mainly driven by lower annual food contribution, supported by favorable base effects stemming mainly from Ramadan and Eid-Al-Fitr being in May in 2019 compared to April and May in 2020, as well as lower annual non-food contribution by a lesser extent as the monthly increases in non-food items were weaker compared to previous yea. Meanwhile annual core inflation declined to 15 percent in May 2020 from 25 percent in April 2020, the lowest rate on recor. Real GDP growth recorded a preliminary figure of 50 percent in 2020 Q1 as expected, down from 56 percent in 2019 Q4, as economic activity in the month of March 2020 was partially affected by the impact of COVID-19 and the resulting containment measure. Additionally the unemployment rate recorded 92 percent in April 2020, compared to 77 and 80 percent in 2020 Q1 and 2019 Q4, respectivel. Nevertheless the recently announced gradual easing of lockdown measures is expected to support the recovery of economic activit. Globally economic activity and employment have deteriorated significantly, which was also reflected in the weakness of international oil prices, despite production cuts by major producer. Meanwhile global financial conditions have improved despite the present uncertaint. In light of the above, and given the preemptive measures taken by the Central Bank of Egypt, including the reduction of 300 basis points during the unscheduled MPC meeting on March 16, 2020, the MPC decided that keeping key policy rates unchanged remains consistent with achieving the inflation target of 9 percent (±3 percentage points) in 2020 Q4 and price stability over the medium ter. The MPC closely monitors all economic developments and will not hesitate to utilize all available tools to support the recovery of economic activity, within its price stability mandat.

Mexico,2020-06-25,"Banco de Mexico's Governing Board decided to lower the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 50 basis points to 5%. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures adopted to prevent its spread have affected world economic activity considerably. The contraction of economic activity observed during the first quarter intensified during the second, although in May certain indicators for various economies exhibited some improvement. Several multilateral organizations and analysts have revised again their economic expectations for 2020 downwards, with a recovery in 2021. These expectations are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. In advanced economies headline and core inflation are below their central bank's targets. In this context, the monetary authorities have reduced policy rates to historically low levels and have used their balance sheets to foster an orderly functioning of financial markets. Likewise, several countries have implemented important fiscal stimulus measures to mitigate the adverse effects on employment and on households and firms' income. Since the last monetary policy decision, global financial markets have exhibited a positive behavior, reflecting the effects of the fiscal, monetary and financial stimuli measures adopted by the advanced economies and the gradual reopening of their productive activities. In Mexico, the peso appreciated in a volatile environment. Government bond yields decreased, especially shorter-term ones. Global and domestic financial conditions will continue to be mainly subject to the effects of the pandemic. Economic activity in Mexico contracted significantly during the first quarter of the year and available information indicates that the impact of the pandemic intensified in April. Although the reopening of certain economic sectors and regions in May and June will foster a slight recovery of economic activity, the impact has been of considerable magnitude and uncertainty persists. For this reason, greater economic slack is expected within the time frame in which monetary policy operates and the balance of risks for growth remains significantly biased to the downside. Annual headline inflation rose from 2.15 to 3.17% between April and the first fortnight of June 2020 due to increases in both its non-core and core components. Expectations for headline inflation for the end of 2020 are still at levels close to the target and those for the medium and long terms have remained relatively stable, albeit at levels above the 3% target. The challenges for monetary policy posed by the pandemic include both the significant impact on economic activity as well as a financial shock. Regarding the foreseen trajectory for inflation, its determinants have slightly reduced it. Among the risks for inflation, the most important are, to the downside: a greater than expected impact of the widening of the negative output gap; and downward inflationary pressures worldwide. To the upside: additional episodes of foreign exchange depreciation; and logistical and supply-related problems concerning certain goods and services, as well as cost- 1 related pressures associated with the adoption of sanitary measures. In this context, the balance of risks for inflation remains uncertain. Taking into account the referred risks for inflation, economic activity and financial markets, major challenges arise for monetary policy and for the economy in general. Based on the foreseen scenarios, and considering the room for maneuvering that on balance these provide to monetary policy, with the presence of all its members. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board decided unanimously to lower the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 50 basis points to a level of 5%. The Governing Board will take the necessary actions on the basis of incoming information and considering the large impact on productive activity as well as the evolution of the financial shock that we are currently facing, so that the policy rate is consistent with the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to Banco de Mexico's target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates. Perseverance in strengthening the macroeconomic fundamentals and adopting the necessary actions, regarding both monetary and fiscal policies, will contribute to a better adjustment of domestic financial markets and of the economy as a whole."
Pakistan,2020-06-25,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement June 25, 2020. At its meeting on 25th June 2020, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to reduce the policy rate by 100 basis points to percent. This decision reflected the MPC's view that the inflation outlook has improved further, while the domestic economic slowdown continues and downside risks to growth have increased. Against this backdrop of receding demand-side inflation risks, the priority of monetary policy has appropriately shifted toward supporting growth and employment during these challenging times. Consistent with its mandate, the MPC re-asserted its commitment to supporting households and businesses through the Covid-19 crisis and minimizing damage to the economy. In this context, the MPC felt that from risk management point of view, prompt response to downside risks to growth was called for given the improved inflation outlook. In addition, the MPC noted that with approximately Rs. trillion worth of loans due to be repriced by early July 2020, this was an opportune moment to take action from monetary policy transmission perspective. In this way, the benefits of interest rate reductions would be passed on in timely manner to households and businesses. The MPC noted that the Covid-19 pandemic is spreading in many emerging markets, including Pakistan, and there are fears of second wave in several other countries. The MPC observed that risks to the global outlook are heavily skewed to the downside and the path of recovery remains uncertain. The MPC also noted that in its update of the World Economic Outlook (WEO) released yesterday, the IMF downgraded its 2020 global growth forecast further to -4. percent,. percentage points lower than in April, and projected more gradual recovery than previously anticipated. Domestically, the moderation of underlying inflation has continued. Notwithstanding seasonal uptick in food prices associated with the Eid holiday, headline inflation declined further to. percent in May on the back of the recent cut in diesel and petrol prices. In addition, month-on-month inflation rates continue to be low. Recent SPI data also suggests continued moderation in overall price pressures in June, despite price increases in some food items, notably wheat. The FY2020/21 budget is also expected to be neutral for inflation as the freeze on government salaries, absence of new taxes, and lower production cost from reduced import duties should offset the decline in subsidies in some sectors. While supply shocks could create some volatility in inflation, the MPC felt that these are likely to be transitory given weak domestic demand, such that monetary policy should generally look past them. Given the absence of demand-side pressures, average inflation could fall below the previously announced range of 7-9 percent for next fiscal year. With the current reduction of the policy rate to percent, the MPC felt that real rates on forward-looking basis (defined as the policy rate less expected inflation) would be kept close to zero, which is appropriate under the current circumstances. On the real side, the decline in LSM deepened to 41. percent (y/y) in April, when lockdowns were still in place. In May, high-frequency indicators of activity such as cement dispatches, automobile sales, food and textile exports, and POL sales also continued to contract, although mostly at lower rate than in the previous two months. Looking ahead, the economy is expected to recover gradually in FY21, supported by easing lockdowns, supportive macroeconomic policies and pick-up in global growth. However risks are skewed to Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN the downside and the recovery will depend critically on the evolution of the pandemic both in Pakistan and abroad. On the external front, the current account swung into surplus in May on the back of reduction in the trade deficit and pick-up in remittances compared to the previous month. Meanwhile portfolio outflows slowed considerably compared to the previous two months and FDI has been resilient, nearly doubling to $2. billion so far in FY20 compared to the same period last year. SBP reserves declined to US$.96 billion as of 19th June 2020 largely due to debt repayments. However since then. SBP has received fresh disbursements from multilateral agencies including around $725 million from World Bank and $500 million from ADB, and another $500 million is expected shortly from the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). During this period of external volatility, the MPC observed that the flexible exchange rate has played its valuable shock absorber role, helping cushion the economy from the tightening of financial conditions associated with capital outflows from emerging markets and deteriorating global sentiment. The MPC noted that the depreciation in the rupee has been lower than in many other emerging markets, reflecting the increased reserve buffers accumulated over the last year. The outlook for the external sector remains stable. Recent data confirms the view that the current account deficit should remain bounded through the Covid-19 crisis due to lower oil prices. In addition, projected official and private inflows are expected to keep the external position fully funded. Today's decision brings the cumulative reduction in the policy rate since mid-March to 625 basis points, commensurate with the decline in inflation during this period. The MPC noted that the take-up of several other SBP initiatives has risen significantly in recent weeks, notably concessional refinancing facilities to protect employment and support the health sector as well as regulatory measures to provide debt servicing relief. Together this strong and data-driven monetary policy response should support growth and employment, while keeping inflation expectations anchored and maintaining financial stability. Page."
Turkiye,2020-06-25,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 8.25 percent. As developments regarding the spread of the coronavirus substantially weakened global growth in the second quarter, normalization steps taken by several countries have contributed to a partial recovery. While uncertainties on global economic recovery remain high, central banks in advanced and emerging economies continue to take expansionary measures. The pandemic disease is closely monitored for its evolving global impact on capital flows, financial conditions, international trade and commodity prices. While the weakening in economic activity became more pronounced in April, economic recovery has started as of May following gradual steps towards normalization. In order to contain negative effects of the pandemic on the Turkish economy, it is of crucial importance to ensure the healthy functioning of financial markets, the credit channel and firms' cash flows. In this respect, recent monetary and fiscal measures contribute to financial stability and economic recovery by supporting the potential output of the economy. Recently, exports and tourism revenues declined due to the pandemic. However, the recovery in exports of goods with the ongoing normalization and low levels of commodity prices will support the current account balance in the upcoming periods. Despite the restraining effects of aggregate demand conditions, pandemic-related rise in unit costs have led to some increase in the trends of core inflation indicators. International commodity prices have continued to restrain consumer inflation, while food inflation has risen due to seasonal and pandemic-related effects. As the normalization process continues, supply-side factors, which have prevailed recently due to pandemic-related restrictions, will phase out and demand-driven disinflationary effects will become more prevalent in the second half of the year. Accordingly, considering all factors affecting the inflation outlook, the Committee decided to keep the policy rate unchanged. The Committee assesses that maintaining a sustained disinflation process is a key factor for achieving lower sovereign risk, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery. Keeping the disinflation process in track with the targeted path requires the continuation of a cautious monetary stance. In this respect, monetary stance will be determined by considering the indicators of the underlying inflation trend to ensure the continuation of the disinflation process. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability and financial stability objectives. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Mongolia,2020-06-26,"MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Keeping the policy rate unchanged and reducing bank deposit dollarization Number: 2020/03 Date: 26th of June 2020 At the scheduled meeting held on 26th of June 2020, the Monetary Policy Committee decided to: 1) Keep the policy rate unchanged, considering the current macroeconomic and financial market developments, their prospects, and uncertainties in the domestic and external environment; 2) Reduce remuneration on MNT reserve requirements issued to banks by the amount corresponding to the ratio of foreign currency-denominated (FX) deposits with relatively higher rates and FX current accounts charging any rate to total FX deposits and current accounts. It will promote financial stability in the banking system by discouraging bank deposit dollarization and maintaining relative returns on the domestic currency. In accordance with “Law on preparedness, response to the COVID-19 pandemic and mitigation of its socioeconomic impact”, under collaborative initiatives with the international financial institutions, the Bank of Mongolia has been taking a set of policy measures to support financial stability and domestic demand. Annual headline inflation reached 3.3 percent nationwide and 3.5 percent in Ulaanbaatar city as of May 2020. Inflation is expected to stay below the target level as a result of demand- driven inflationary pressure remaining subdued, reflecting economic activities slowing down, domestic fuel prices declining in line with oil price developments in the international market and in a case of not emerging supply-related price volatilities. The comprehensive set of fiscal, financial and monetary policy measures pursued following declaration of high-alert preparedness in response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been influencing a positive impact on economic activities. Domestic demand has contracted in the first half of the year, owing to declining external demand and commodity prices; and imposing restrictive measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Despite economic growth decelerating and inflation outlook remaining at low levels in 2020, policy room to further ease monetary policy stance is constrained by the necessity to ensure domestic and external macroeconomic balances. Uncertainties and risks have been exacerbated by continued trade conflicts and COVID-19 spread, resulting in further weakening of external demand and commodity prices. Minutes of the Monetary policy committee meeting will be released in two weeks on the Bank of Mongolia's official website. MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE."
Colombia,2020-06-30,"Other measures taken by BR on account of COVID-19. Vimeo live broadcast (Only in Spanish). This decision was reached by majority, and gives continuity to the countercyclical monetary policy stance. The Board of Directors of. (BDBR), by majority, reduced the Benchmark Interest Rate by half a Percentage Point to 2.50%. In this way, it continues with the countercyclical monetary policy stance. This decision took the following elements into consideration. In May, inflation stood at 2.85%, the average of core inflation indicators at 2.44%, and inflation expectations continued to decline and stood below 3% as a reflection of a weak aggregate demand, the deterioration of employment, and spare productive capacity. The downward revisions of local and global growth suggest a substantial expansion of spare capacity and greater deterioration of the labor market vis--vis a month ago.A slow recovery of the country's main trading partners is expected for the remainder of the year. The conditions of financial markets have improved with respect to the beginning of the crisis, but there remains great uncertainty regarding the global macro-economic context. Under these conditions, the risk balance for monetary policy suggests the appropriateness of providing an additional boost to the economy. The decision to cut the benchmark interest rate by one quarter of a percentage point was approved by five Board Members.

A press release on these measures is being published separately. v The process of removing restrictions has led to an improvement in economic activity, but the level of activity remains low. The increase in the number of new cases of corona in recent weeks is weighing upon the economic recovery process. The removal of restrictions led to an increase in supply, but the level of demand in the economy remains low. According to the Research Department's assessment, the scope of the economic shutdown has narrowed from about 36 percent of activity at the height of the crisis to about 12 percent. The Research Department's assessment is that the economy will contract by about 6 percent in 2020, assuming that there is no further worsening of the restrictions on activity. An analysis conducted by the Research Department shows that between 650,000 and 720,000 workers remain unemployed, either on unpaid leave or dismissed from their workplace, due to the corona crisis. v The difficulty in halting the pandemic in various countries, and the delay in the return to routine economic activity are weighing on the recovery of the global economy, and the international financial institutions have sharply lowered their growth forecasts. The governments of many countries are operating wide-scale assistance programs in order to moderate the negative impact of the crisis and incentivize economic activity. Following the recovery from the peak of the crisis, the capital markets remain volatile, and are supported by unprecedented measures taken by central banks around the world. v The main share indices on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange declined in line with the S&P 500 at the start of the crisis, but the recovery has been more moderate than in other indices around the world. Corporate bond spreads have also started to widen again recently. v The Business Tendency Survey indicates some moderation in companies' difficulty in obtaining credit, but the constraint remains greater than it was prior to the crisis. The volume of bank credit issued during the crisis was higher than it was during the same period last year, particularly regarding credit to medium and large businesses and housing credit. Data onthe fund for government-backed credit to small businesses indicate high demand for credit. v The shekel strengthened since the last interest rate decision by about 1.2 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. The exchange rate is making the recovery of exports difficult, particularly in view of the decline in global demand, and is weighing on the return of inflation to the target range. v There is a continued downward trend in the inflation environment, with inflation significantly lower than the lower bound of the target range. In the coming months, annual inflation is expected to remain negative. Forward expectations of inflation at the end of the second year are slightly below the lower bound of the target range, while longer-term expectations are anchored within the target range. In view of the magnitude of the crisis's adverse impact on economic activity, the Committee is utilizing a range of tools in order to increase the extent of the monetary policy accommodation and to ensure the continued orderly functioning of the financial markets. The Committee will expand the use of the existing tools, including the interest rate tool, and will operate additional ones, to the extent that it assesses that the crisis is lengthening and that it is necessary in order to achieve the monetary policy goals and to moderate the negative economic impact created as a result of the crisis. For the file of figures accompanying this notice, clickhere. The coronavirus crisis led to an unprecedented contraction in the scope of economic activity and to a steep increase in the number of jobseekers. Following the Passover holiday, the government started a gradual process of removing the restrictions on movement and activity, and this led to an improvement in economic activity. However, the level of activity remains low. The increase in corona infections in recent weeks is weighing down on the economic recovery process. The removal of the restrictions led to growth on the supply side of the economy, but the level of demand remains relatively low, as shown by a number of indicators. Electricity consumption remains low despite the removal of most restrictions on business activity (Figure 6 in the attached data file), credit card purchases are about 10 percent lower than the pre-crisis average (Figure 7), real time surveys conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics show improvement in employment alongside a continued negative impact on revenue (Figures 4-5). The index of mobility to places of work stabilized in the first half of June at a level that is still lower than it was prior to the crisis, and declined toward the endof June despite the fact that no new restrictions had been imposed up to that point (Figure 8). According to the Research Department's staff forecast, the scope of the economy's shutdown, which was estimated to be approximately 36 percent of activity at the peak of the crisis, continued to decline as restrictions were removed, and is now approximately 12 percent (Figure 3). Goodsexports continued to recover in May following the sharp decline in March, but remain lower than they were priorto the crisis. All components of goods imports declined in May, including the import of raw materials, which was stable in March and April. Services exports declined sharply in March and April in view of the sharp decline in exports of tourism and transportation services, and despite continued growth in the export of business services (Figures 10-11). The Companies Survey indicates a sharp decline in business sector activity in the second quarter, and the Business Trends Survey shows only a slight improvement in June compared with April and May (Figure 2). Despite the difficulty in precisely assessing the state of the labor market in view of the wide variance in data from different sources, all the data show that the recovery in economic activity is only partially reflected in the labor market. Following the sharp decline in employment in March-April, there was an improvement during May, butthe pace of improvement slowed in June. An analysis conducted by the Research Department based on real-time surveys by the Central Bureau of Statistics shows that between 500,000 and 570,000 workers remain on unpaid leave or were dismissed from their jobs due to the corona crisis, in addition to about 150,000 workers who were unemployed prior to the crisis. The Research Department updated its macroeconomic forecast. The growth forecast for 2020 was revised downward, and GDP is expected to contract by about 6 percent in view of worsening morbidity data that are increasing the uncertainty and weighing on the return to routing economic activity, and in view of developments abroad. In view of the worsening of the growth forecast for 2020, the forecast for 2021 was revised upward, to 7.5 percent (Figure 1). In 2020, the government budget deficit is expected to be about 12 percent of GDP, as a result of the loss of about NIS 55 billion in income due to the slowdown in activity, and an increase of about NIS 60 billion in expenditures in order to finance unemployment benefits and assistance measures announcedby the government. There is a continued downward trend in the inflation environment, with inflation significantly below the lower bound of the target range. The May CPI reading declined by 0.3 percent, and negative year-on-year inflation of 1.6 percent was recorded, mainly in view of the significant negative contribution of the energy component (Figure 12). The year-on-year inflation ratemeasured by the CPI excluding energy and fruit and vegetables was -0.5 percent (Figure 13). There is a methodological difficulty in calculating the CPI and in analyzing the meaning of measured changes in prices so long as the limitations on economic activity lead to certain goods and services not being consumed and their prices not being measurable, and due to the change in the compositionof households' consumption basket. One-year inflation expectations from all of the sources in June were higher than in May (Figure 15), but developments during the period were not uniform. Inflation expectations derived from the capital market declined since the second week in June, and continued to decline after the publication of the May CPI reading, while projections by professional forecasters increased slightly following the CPI publication. In the coming months, year-on-year inflation is expected to remain negative. Forward expectations for inflation at the end of the second year are slightly belowthe lower bound of the target range, and expectations for longer terms are anchored within the target range. Since the previous interest rate decision, the shekel strengthened by about 1.2 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. The exchange rate is delaying the return of inflation to the target range, and making the recovery of exports difficult. The Bank of Israel's activity in the financial markets reduced the strong volatility in the markets at the outbreak of the crisis, and in particular, significantly lowered the yield on government bonds and on corporate bonds. With that, corporate bond spreads again expanded recently (Figures 19-20). The volatility in the equity markets continued. The main indices on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange declined in line with the S&P 500 index at the start of the crisis, but the correction has been more moderate than in other indices around the world. The Business Tendency Survey indicates some moderation in companies' difficulties in obtaining credit, but the constraint remains higher than itwas prior to the crisis. The volume of bank credit issued during the crisis was higher than the volume issued during the same period last year. Most of the growth was in credit to medium and large businesses and in housing credit. The government increased the volume of the fund for the provision of government-guaranteed credit to small and medium businesses by a further NIS 4 billion. Thetotal size of the fund is NIS 18 billion, and requests for credit from the fund totaling about NIS 47 billion have been received (Figure 23). In addition, a NIS 4 billion fund with greater backing has begun operating to provide credit to companies at high risk. The banking system deferred payments for about 530,000 loans, totaling about NIS 6.8 billion to mid-June (Figure 24). There was an increase in consumer credit taken out by households in May following a sharp decline in April. The difficulty in stopping the pandemic in various countries, and the delay in the return to routine economic activity are weighing on the global economy. Global GDP contracted sharply in the first quarter, particularly in the major economies, and indicators for April and May point to an even more significant contraction in the second quarter. The Purchasing Managers Indices indicate some recovery, but they remain below 50, which is the range indicating contraction of economic activity (Figure 27). The International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the OECD sharply lowered their growth forecasts and forecasts of world trade (Figure 25) for the next two years, in view of the continued spread of the pandemic and the slow removal of the closures, so that in 2020, global GDP is expected to contract more sharply than at any time since the aftermath of the Second World War, partly due to the spread of the virus to emerging markets as well. Following the recovery from the peak of the crisis, the capital markets have remained volatile, and are supported by unprecedented measures taken by central banks around the world. In view of the extension of the cut in oil production by OPEC member countries, the price of oil increased during the period, but remains significantly lower than it was at the beginning of the year (Figure 29). The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on July 20, 2020. The next decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Monday. August 24, 2020. The Research Department updated its macroeconomic forecast."
Malaysia,2020-07-07,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to reduce the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) by 25 basis points to 1.75 percent. The ceiling and floor rates of the corridor of the OPR are correspondingly reduced to 2.00 percent and 1.50 percent, respectively. The impact of COVID-19 on the global economy is severe. Global economic conditions remain weak with global growth projected to be negative for the year. Although a trough is expected in the second quarter, broad-based weakness in labour markets and precautionary behaviour by households and businesses could affect the recovery going forward. Several major economies have begun relaxing measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to the gradual resumption of economic activity. Financial conditions have improved, although risk aversion remains elevated. Downside risks to the global outlook remain, especially if a resurgence of the pandemic necessitates the reintroduction of containment measures. For Malaysia, economic activity contracted sharply in the second quarter of the year, due to measures introduced to contain the pandemic globally and domestically. Following the gradual and progressive re-opening of the economy since early May, economic activities have begun to recover from the trough in the second quarter. The fiscal stimulus packages, alongside monetary and financial measures, will continue to underpin the improving economic outlook. The projected improvement in the domestic economy is expected to be further supported by a gradual recovery in global growth conditions. The pace and strength of the recovery, however, remain subject to downside risks emanating from both domestic and external factors. These include the prospect of further outbreaks of the pandemic leading to re-impositions of containment measures, more persistent weakness in labour market conditions, and a weaker-than-expected recovery in global growth. Inflationary pressures are expected to be muted in 2020. Average headline inflation is likely to be negative this year, primarily reflecting the substantially lower global oil prices. The risks of a broad-based and persistent decline in prices are assessed to be limited as economic activity resumes and demand conditions improve. Nevertheless, the outlook remains significantly affected by global oil and commodity prices. Underlying inflation is expected to be subdued and within expectations. The reduction in the OPR provides additional policy stimulus to accelerate the pace of economic recovery. The MPC will continue to assess evolving conditions and their implications on the overall outlook for inflation and domestic growth. The Bank will continue to utilise its policy levers as appropriate to create enabling conditions for a sustainable economic recovery. Bank Negara Malaysia 07 July 2020."
Peru,2020-07-09,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT JULY 2020 BCRP MAINTAINED REFERENCE RATE AT 0.25% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to continue its expansionary policy stance, maintaining the reference rate at 0.25 percent and implementing further liquidity injection operations, in light of the following developments: Inflation in 2020 and 2021 is expected to fall below the target range due to a significant weakening of domestic demand. One-year ahead expected inflation further decreased to 1.4 percent in June. Year-on-year inflation decreased from 1.8 percent in May to 1.6 percent in June, while trend inflation remains in the lower part of the target range. Economic activity has been severely affected by the effects from social confinement. Firm's growth expectations continued to recover in June, in line with gradual economic reopening, although they remain at historic lows. Risks to global economic activity materialized, including a global recession with a partial rebound in the second half of the year. The BCRP will continue to take the necessary steps to sustain the payments system and credit flows. As of July 8th, the BCRP's liquidity injection operations totaled S/ 48 billion, of which S/ 25.8 billion were associated with government-backed repos. In this context, the credit to the private sector grew 13.7 percent year-on-year in May and interest rates decreased significantly. In addition, on June 30th the authorities launched the phase two of the “Reactiva Peru” program, with five auction sessions totaling S/ 17.7 billion at an average interest rate of 1.49 percent and a with greater share of small and micro enterprises. The Board considers it appropriate to maintain a strong expansionary monetary stance for as long as the negative effects of the pandemic on inflation and its determinants persist. The BCRP stands ready to extend monetary stimulus using a range of instruments. The Board also decided to maintain the following interest rates on its window facility operations in domestic currency with financial entities: Overnight deposits: 0.15 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 0.50 percent per year. The BCRP Board's next monetary policy session will take place on August 13, 2020."
Thailand,2020-07-10,"Outcome of the Joint Meeting between the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) and the Financial Institutions Policy Committee (FIPC) on 7 July 2020 The Bank of Thailand (BOT) announced the outcome of the joint meeting between the MPC and the FIPC on 7 July 2020, to assess risks to Thailand's financial stability. Key discussion points were as follows. The committees concluded that Thailand's financial stability remained sound overall, with commercial banks and insurance companies holding substantial capital buffers. Nevertheless financial stability risks had risen due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which remained uncertain as to when the pandemic would end or how prolonged its economic and financial impact would be. Thus buffers still needed to be maintained at high levels. Pandemic containment measures in many countries, including Thailand, had weighed heavily on economic activities in the recent months. Incomes of households and corporates, especially SMEs, dropped severely and would take some time to recover. This in turn, could lead to a broad-based deterioration in households and corporates' debt serviceability. Business models and people's ways of life were also affected, and this would play a key role in reshaping the economic structure going forward. The committees conducted a comprehensive assessment of financial stability risks under multiple scenarios of the COVID-19 outbreak. The focus was on households and corporates, which could face significant liquidity and debt affordability risks going forward. The assessment also focused on corporate bond issuers, which could face credit rating downgrades as their business performance weakened in line with economic conditions. These issues could impact key sectors within the financial system, such as savings cooperatives, insurance companies, mutual funds, and banks through investment exposures and credit provision. The committees also evaluated the adequacy of capital buffers in the banking system, capital markets, and the insurance sector in the cases that the situations deteriorate. Under highly uncertain conditions, the committees highlighted the importance of pre- emptive measures and three priority areas as follows. Evaluation of the measures already implemented to provide liquidity support to households, corporates, and financial markets, to ensure that the measures address liquidity problems in a targeted and timely manner during remedy and recovery periods. This included the first and second phases of debt relief measures by the BOT and financial service providers, which aimed to reduce households' debt servicing burden and to ensure that, once these relief measures expired, borrowers' debt burden would not surge to the extent that they could no longer service debt. Other measures included soft loan programs and the portfolio guarantee scheme by the Thai Credit Guarantee Corporation, which helped provide additional liquidity to SMEs. With regard to financial market liquidity and stability, the BOT and the Office of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had been collaborating in monitoring risks in the mutual fund sector and the corporate bond market. Two important mechanisms had been set up, namely the Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (MFLF) and the Corporate Bond Stabilization Fund (BSF), which played an instrumental role in supporting investors' confidence and improving the functioning of financial markets. The two mechanisms would still be needed as backstops to ensure that the bond market continue to function smoothly amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Speeding up the implementation of proactive debt restructuring to support economic and business restructuring in a new economic context. Debt restructuring measures should be tailored to different types of businesses and the nature of their problems. For example, some firms might face a temporary liquidity shortage but could manage to recover once the COVID-19 situations eased, while others might need to overhaul their business models to remain competitive. The measures must also take into consideration debtors' ability to service debt in the post COVID-19 periods. Furthermore additional measures should be prepared for the possibility of a broad-based deterioration in loan quality in the coming periods. Examples included standardized procedures to support debt restructuring for retail borrowers and SMEs, as well as mechanisms for management of non-performing loans. Additionally the SEC was in the process of developing guidelines for the establishment of high- yield bond funds, which were designed to provide bridge financing for firms that faced liquidity shortage and might need to change their funding structures. The introduction of such funds would also enhance liquidity in the high-yield bond market and provide high-net-worth investors with an option to invest through professionally managed funds, rather than investing directly in these instruments. Further measures to maintain resilience of the Thai financial system. Thanks to prudent supervision and risk management in the recent periods, the Thai financial system was strong enough to withstand economic and financial market shocks. However all stakeholders should give a high priority to assessing the adequacy of buffers under stress conditions, so that they would be prepared should the situations worsen. The BOT had implemented measures to ensure that commercial banks maintain a high level of capital. For example, banks were asked to suspend interim dividend payments in 2020 and stock buybacks. The goal was to ensure that banks could withstand the deterioration in loan quality and could extend loans to support recovery going forward. Meanwhile the SEC was in the process of revising regulations to provide asset management companies with more liquidity management tools. The Office of Insurance Commission (OIC) was also in the process of revising capital regulations to take care of insurance companies' risks, with an aim to encourage a better management of investment risks and a proper diversification between investment and insurance risks. With high uncertainties going forward, the BOT, the SEC, and the OIC would continue to collaborate closely in assessing risks and the effectiveness of measures undertaken. The regulators would stand ready to impose additional measures to prevent a build-up of vulnerabilities that could undermine financial stability, as well as to support economic recovery once the COVID-19 pandemic abated and economic activities resumed. Further cooperation with government agencies would be essential to facilitate both macro-level economic restructuring and firm-level adjustments. Regulations should also be reviewed to ensure that they continue to be appropriate in the “new normal” context of the economic and financial system."
Poland,2020-07-14,"Warsaw, 14 July 2020 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 14 July 2020 The Council decided to keep the NBP reference rate unchanged at the level of 0.10%. At the same time, the Council set the remaining NBP interest rates at the following levels: lombard rate at 0.50%; deposit rate at 0.00%; rediscount rate at 0.11%. discount rate at 0.12%. NBP will continue to purchase government securities and government-guaranteed debt securities on the secondary market as part of the structural open market operations. The timing and scale of the operations will depend on the market conditions. Furthermore. NBP will offer bill discount credit aimed at refinancing loans granted to enterprises by banks. Incoming data confirm that the Covid-19 pandemic contributed to a fall in global economic activity, including recession in the economies of Poland's main trading partners. At the same time, along with a gradual easing of the containment measures, sentiment has improved in many economies, accompanied by a recovery in economic activity. Current forecasts indicate that the second half of 2020 will see a further improvement in the global economic conditions, although the level of activity will be lower than before the pandemic. Uncertainty remains regarding the pace and robustness of the recovery in the global economic conditions in the coming quarters. A further improvement in the global economic conditions will be supported by the fiscal measures introduced as well as the accompanying easing of monetary policy, including the interest rate cuts and asset purchases. Recent weeks have seen a certain improvement in sentiment in global financial markets. This was accompanied by an increase in the prices of some commodities, which, however, remain significantly lower than at the beginning of the year. Along with weaker economic activity, this contributed to the inflation staying at low levels in many countries, including Poland's main trading partners. In Poland, incoming information suggests a gradual improvement in sentiment and a recovery in economic activity, which, however, remains lower than before the pandemic. This is accompanied by a further, although limited, fall in employment and a marked decline in wage growth in enterprises. According to the Statistics Poland (GUS) flash estimate, inflation stood at 3.3% y/y in June. A further recovery in economic activity may be expected over the coming months. This will be supported by an improvement in the economic situation in the environment of the Polish economy and the economic policy measures, including the easing of NBP's monetary policy. At the same time, the scale of the expected recovery in activity may be limited by uncertainty about the effects of the pandemic, lower incomes and weaker sentiment of economic agents than in previous years. The pace of the economic recovery could also be limited by the lack of visible zloty exchange rate adjustment to the global pandemic-driven shock and to the monetary policy easing introduced by NBP. The Council became acquainted with the results of the July projection of inflation and GDP, prepared under the assumption of unchanged NBP interest rates. The July projection takes into account data and information published up to 30 June 2020. In line with the July projection based on the NECMOD model, there is a 50-percent probability that the annual price growth will be in the range of 2.93.6% in 2020 (against 3.14.2% in the March 2020 projection), 0.32.2% in 2021 (compared to 1.73.6%) and 0.62.9% in 2022 (compared to 1.33.4%). At the same time, the annual GDP growth  according to this projection  will be with a 50-percent probability in the range of -7.2  -4.2% in 2020 (against 2.53.9% in the March 2020 projection), 2.16.6% in 2021 (compared to 2.13.9%) and 1.96.0% in 2022 (compared to 1.83.7%). These operations are aimed at changing the long-term liquidity structure in the banking sector, ensuring the liquidity in secondary markets for the purchased securities and enhancing the impact of the NBP interest rate cuts on the economy, i.e. strengthening the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Furthermore. NBP will also continue to offer bill discount credit aimed at refinancing loans granted to enterprises by banks. The NBP monetary policy easing mitigates the negative economic impact of the pandemic, limiting the scale of the fall in economic activity and supporting incomes of households and enterprises. Consequently, it alleviates the fall in employment and deterioration in financial situation of enterprises, thus being conducive to quicker economic recovery after the abatement of the pandemic. The measures undertaken by NBP reduce the risk of inflation falling below the NBP inflation target in the medium term and  due to their positive impact on financial situation of debtors  are conducive to enhancement of financial system stability. The Council adopted the Inflation Report  July 2020."
Chile,2020-07-15,"Wednesday, 15 July 2020 Monetary Policy Meeting  July 2020 At its Monetary Policy Meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided, by the unanimous vote of its members, to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 0.50%. The Board also agreed to maintain the unconventional measures sustaining liquidity and credit. The macroeconomic scenario continues to be conditional upon the evolution of the Covid- 19 pandemic. Domestic second-quarter figures available confirm that the economy has suffered a significant contraction. The May Imacec posted a 15.3% drop in annual terms, with declines observed in almost every sector. Exports have exhibited a greater-than- expected degree of resilience, while imports levels have seen some stabilization after the sharp falls of the previous months. Business and consumer expectations remain in very pessimistic territory. The stricter sanitary containment measures continue to affect a significant part of the country, although the positive evolution of sanitary indicators has allowed some regions to initiate de-confinement processes. Various sources of quantitative and qualitative information report a sharp deterioration of the labor market, most notably a fall in employment and reductions in hours worked and wages. Government measures in place to mitigate the loss of income have become stronger since June. The median of private expectations contained in the July Economic Expectations Survey (EES) anticipates that GDP will fall 6.1% this year, in line with the range of the central scenario described in the last MP Report. However, these estimates continue to show high dispersion. In the external scenario, conjunctural data show improvements in an important group of countries, in line with the gradual reopening of their economies, which is visible in the indicators of manufacturing production, retail sales, the labor market and expectations of both households and companies. This has favored the performance of the financial system [INF*RES*AS] and commodities, whose prices have recovered owing largely to more auspicious prospects for activity in China. In particular, the copper price has come close to US$3 per pound, its highest in the year so far, also influenced by supply factors. These developments are also being sustained by further increases in fiscal and monetary stimulus, such as reinforced unconventional measures in the United States, the Eurozone and the United Kingdom. In any case, activity levels are still well below those prior to the sanitary emergency, while important risks persist associated with the recent Covid-19 resurgence in several countries—particularly strong in the US—and reinstated confinement measures in some of them. The movements in the domestic financial market have reflected both external developments and the greater boost that monetary policy is providing. In particular, the expectations for the MPR aligned themselves with it remaining at its technical minimum for a prolonged period, and the long-term interest rates (i.e. BCP 5 and BCP 10) posted significant drops in the following days, and today stand between 15 and 25bp below their level prior to the last Meeting. Meanwhile, the stock market continued to rise and the peso has fluctuated around the levels that were in effect at the time of the previous Meeting. With respect to credit, in June, the annual variation in commercial loans continued to increase, while that of consumer credit continued to decline. Interest rates remained low in all segments. This occurs in a context where a large proportion of the banks have used up all the resources offered in phase one of the Funding Facility Conditional on Increased Lending (FCIC), and phase-two resources can already be accessed. The second quarter's Bank Lending Survey reflects tighter supply conditions for all credit categories, explained in part by the risks present in client portfolios. Meanwhile, household credit demand decreased substantially, both for consumption and housing. In the corporate segment, demand rose for funds to cover working capital needs, and dropped for funds to finance investment projects. At June, annual headline inflation was down to 2.6% and core inflation (CPI excluding volatiles) dropped to 2.5%. Inflationary pressures are still low due to the abrupt widening of the activity gap over recent months. In this context, inflation expectations derived from the Economic Expectations Survey and the Financial Brokers Survey (FBS) have shown no significant change. One year ahead, both stand below 3%, while two years ahead, the FBS foresees it at 2.6% and the EES at 3%. The Board reiterates that it will maintain a strong monetary impulse for a prolonged period of time, in order to ensure that its objectives are achieved. In particular, it estimates that the MPR will remain at its technical minimum over the entire projection horizon, and agreed to continue with the asset purchase program that will result in purchases of up to US$1.5 billion over the next four weeks. In addition, in case the [INF*RES*AS] evolution of the economy so requires, it will continue to assess other options to intensify such impulse and provide support to financial stability, using unconventional instruments. The minutes of this Monetary Policy Meeting will be published at 8:30 AM on Friday 31 July 2020. The next Monetary Policy Meeting is scheduled for Tuesday 1 September and the statement thereof will be released at 6:00 PM on the same day. The Spanish original prevails."
Euroarea,2020-07-16,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Executive Vice-President. Mr Dombrovskis. Incoming information since our last monetary policy meeting in early June signals a resumption of euro area economic activity, although the level of activity remains well below the levels prevailing before the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the outlook remains highly uncertain. Both high-frequency and survey indicators bottomed out in April and showed a significant, though uneven and partial, recovery in May and June, alongside the ongoing containment of the virus and the associated easing of the lockdown measures. At the same time, actual and expected job and income losses and the exceptionally elevated uncertainty about the evolution of the pandemic and the economic outlook continue to weigh on consumer spending and business investment. Headline inflation is being dampened by lower energy prices and price pressures are expected to remain very subdued on account of the sharp decline in real GDP growth and the associated significant increase in economic slack. Against this background, ample monetary stimulus remains necessary to support the economic recovery and to safeguard medium-term price stability. Therefore, we decided to reconfirm our very accommodative monetary policy stance. We expect them to remain at their present or lower levels until we have seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within our projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics. We will continue our purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) with a total envelope of €1,350 billion. These purchases contribute to easing the overall monetary policy stance, thereby helping to offset the pandemic-related downward shift in the projected path of inflation. The purchases will continue to be conducted in a flexible manner over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions. This allows us to effectively stave off risks to the smooth transmission of monetary policy. We will conduct net asset purchases under the PEPP until at least the end of June 2021 and, in any case, until the Governing Council judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over. We will reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2022. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance. Net purchases under our asset purchase programme (APP) will continue at a monthly pace of €20 billion, together with the purchases under the additional €120 billion temporary envelope until the end of the year. We continue to expect monthly net asset purchases under the APP to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of our policy rates, and to end shortly before we start raising the key ECB interest rates. We intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. We will also continue to provide ample liquidity through our refinancing operations. In particular, the latest operation in the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO has registered a very high take-up of funds, supporting bank lending to firms and households. The monetary policy measures that we have taken since early March are providing crucial support to underpin the recovery of the euro area economy and to safeguard medium-term price stability. In particular, they support liquidity and funding conditions in the economy, help to sustain the flow of credit to households and firms, and contribute to maintaining favourable financing conditions for all sectors and jurisdictions. At the same time, in the current environment of elevated uncertainty and significant economic slack, the Governing Council remains fully committed to doing everything necessary within its mandate to support all citizens of the euro area through this extremely challenging time. This applies first and foremost to our role in ensuring that our monetary policy is transmitted to all parts of the economy and to all jurisdictions in the pursuit of our price stability mandate. The Governing Council, therefore, continues to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Incoming data and survey results suggest that economic activity improved significantly in May and June from its trough in April, alongside the ongoing containment of the virus and the associated easing of the lockdown measures. At the same time, economic indicators remain well below the levels recorded before the pandemic, and the recovery is in its early stages and remains uneven across sectors and jurisdictions. After decreasing by 3.6%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter of 2020, euro area real GDP is expected to have contracted even further overall in the second quarter, broadly in line with the June 2020 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections. Signs of a recovery in consumption have emerged, while there has also been a significant rebound in industrial output. At the same time, subdued labour market conditions and precautionary household saving are weighing on consumer spending. Weak business prospects and high uncertainty are dampening investment, while the weakness in the global economy is hampering foreign demand for euro area goods and services. Euro area activity is expected to rebound in the third quarter as the containment measures are eased further, supported by favourable financing conditions, an expansionary fiscal stance and a resumption in global activity, although uncertainty about the overall speed and scale of the rebound remains high. In general, the extent of the contraction and the recovery will depend crucially on the duration and effectiveness of the containment measures, the success of policies to mitigate the adverse impact on incomes and employment, and the extent to which supply capacity and domestic demand are permanently affected. Overall, the Governing Council assesses the balance of risks to the euro area growth outlook to remain on the downside. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation increased to 0.3% in June, from 0.1% in May, mainly reflecting less negative energy price inflation. On the basis of current and futures prices for oil and taking into account the temporary reduction in the German VAT rate, headline inflation is likely to decline again in the coming months before picking up in early 2021. Over the medium term, weaker demand will put downward pressure on inflation, which will be only partially offset by upward pressures related to supply constraints. Market-based indicators of longer-term inflation expectations have continued to increase from the historical lows reached in mid-March, but overall remain at subdued levels. While survey-based indicators of inflation expectations have declined since the start of the pandemic, longer-term expectations have been less affected than short and medium-term expectations. Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth increased to 8.9% in May 2020, from 8.2% in April. Strong money growth reflects bank credit creation, which continues to be driven to a large extent by the acute liquidity needs in the economy. Moreover, high economic uncertainty is triggering a shift towards money holdings for precautionary reasons. In this environment, the narrow monetary aggregate M1, encompassing the most liquid forms of money, continues to be the main contributor to broad money growth. Developments in loans to the private sector continued to be shaped by the impact of the coronavirus on economic activity. The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations rose further to 7.3% in May 2020, from 6.6% in April, reflecting firms' need to finance their ongoing expenditures and working capital in the context of still anaemic revenues. At the same time, the annual growth rate of loans to households remained unchanged at 3.0% in May, after declining for two consecutive months, amid ongoing constraints on consumption. The results of the euro area bank lending survey for the second quarter of 2020 provide further insights into these developments. With regard to firms, they show a continued strong upward impact of the pandemic on demand for loans, largely driven by emergency liquidity needs, while financing needs for fixed investment declined. Credit standards on loans to firms remained broadly unchanged. The tightening impact of the deterioration in the economic outlook and the associated decline in the creditworthiness of firms was broadly offset by the easing effects of policy measures, particularly the ECB's liquidity-support measures and government guarantees on loans. However, looking ahead, banks expect a net tightening of credit standards on loans to firms, in part related to the expected end of the state guarantee schemes. With regard to loans to households, credit standards tightened, reflecting in particular a deterioration in households' income and employment prospects in the context of the pandemic. Overall, our policy measures, together with the measures adopted by national governments and European institutions, will continue to support access to financing, including for those most affected by the ramifications of the pandemic. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is necessary for the robust convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Regarding fiscal policies, an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance remains critical, in view of the sharp contraction in the euro area economy. Measures taken in response to the pandemic emergency should as much as possible be targeted and temporary in nature. The three safety nets endorsed by the European Council for workers, businesses and sovereigns, amounting to a package worth €540 billion, provide important funding support in this context. At the same time, the Governing Council urges further strong and timely efforts to prepare and support the recovery. We therefore strongly welcome the European Commission's Next Generation EU proposal, which is dedicated to supporting the regions and sectors hardest hit by the pandemic, to strengthening the Single Market and to building a lasting and prosperous recovery. It is important for the European leaders to quickly agree on an ambitious package. In order to reach its full potential, the European Union's Recovery and Resilience Facility will need to be firmly rooted in sound structural policies conceived and implemented at the national level. Well-designed structural policies could contribute to a faster, stronger and more uniform recovery from the crisis, thereby supporting the effectiveness of monetary policy in the euro area. Targeted structural policies are particularly important to rejuvenate our economies, with a focus on accelerating investment in priority areas such as the green and digital transitions."
South Korea,2020-07-16,"The bank of korea. The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 0.50% for the intermeeting period. Currently available information suggests that the global economy has started to rebound moderately from the sharp contraction, as economic activity gradually resumes despite the ongoing spread of COVID-19. In global financial markets, risk aversion has subsided on hopes of economic recovery. Stock prices in major countries have risen and the US dollar has weakened, while government bond yields have fluctuated slightly. Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the evolution of the pandemic, as well as by the effects of national policy responses. Economic growth in Korea has remained sluggish. Although consumption has rebounded with the relaxation of some pandemic-related restrictions on economic activity and the government's stimulus package, exports have continued to decline. While the recovery in facilities investment has been subdued, the correction in construction investment has continued. Labor market conditions have remained weak, with the number of persons employed continuing to decline sharply. Looking forward, facilities and construction investment are expected to grow at a moderate pace; however, the paces of recovery in consumption and exports will be slower than previously forecast. Accordingly. GDP growth this year is likely to be lower than the May forecast of -0.2%. Consumer price inflation recorded around 0%, held down by declining prices of petroleum products and public services. Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) has also remained at the lower-0% range, and the inflation expectations of the general public have stayed at the mid-1% level. It is forecast that consumer price inflation and core inflation will run at the lower-0% level this year, reflecting prolonged effects from the drop in global oil prices and weak demand-side inflationary pressures. Domestic financial markets have been generally stable owing to decreased volatility in global financial markets. Stock prices have risen and the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate has fallen considerably, while long-term market interest rates have fluctuated within a narrow range. The increase in household loans has expanded materially, and housing prices have generally accelerated in all parts of the country. The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to support the economy and stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As economic growth is expected to be sluggish and inflationary pressures on the demand-side are forecast to remain weak due to the COVID19 pandemic, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance. In this process it will thoroughly assess developments related to the pandemic, the impact on the economy and financial markets here and abroad, changes in financial stability, and the effects of the policy measures taken in response to the pandemic."
Nigeria,2020-07-20,"CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO. 131 OF THE 274th MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING HELD ON MONDAY 20TH JULY 2020 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on 20th July 2020, amidst elevated uncertainties across the world. The projected global output contraction was revised downward, as many countries had to extend the lockdown period in the wake of a second wave of coronavirus infections, and continued lack of effective treatment or vaccines for the Novel Coronavirus disease. However there is cautious optimism that the global growth contraction would reverse to positive growth path by 2021, as the pandemic is contained, potential treatment found, and restrictions on business activities are lifted by most economies. The Committee reviewed developments in the global and domestic economic environment in the first half of 2020 and evaluated the monetary policy options to address these challenges. Ten (10) members of the Committee were in attendance. Global Economic Developments Global output growth weakened further, as a result of the persistent headwinds from the COVID-19 pandemic. These headwinds comprised: persisting decline in global aggregate demand and supply; disruptions in global supply chain and trade; rising sovereign and corporate debts; heightened financial market vulnerabilities; low prices of crude oil and other commodities; and rising unemployment. The Committee noted, with concern, the IMF's further downgrade of global economic contraction to -49 per cent from -30 per cent in 2020. The downward revision was based primarily on the amplified negative impact of COVID-19 pandemic on many advanced and emerging market economies, as they witnessed extended lockdown periods and restrictions on economic activities. The Committee noted the general optimism of a V-shaped global growth trajectory due to the expected early abatement of the pandemic and the gradual resumption of economic activities. However the Committee believes that global recovery, while assured for 2021, is more likely to be a U-shaped one. In this regard, it is not surprising that the recovery has been revised downwards from 58 per cent to 54 per cent in 2021. The Committee observed the continued downward trend in inflation in most Advanced Economies, particularly below the 20 per cent long-run target, despite the huge monetary and fiscal 2 stimulus injections during the period. The Committee, however, noted that as the lockdown eases across the advanced economies, aggregate demand is expected to strengthen and inflation would pick up to support the expected output growth. Across the Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs), the Committee observed the divergent inflation trends, with most developing commodity-exporting countries recording increase in inflation compared with other more diversified economies. This development had inadvertently exerted significant pressure on the exchange rates of these economies as the pass-through to domestic prices has been amplified. The Committee observed that the unprecedented increase in public spending to support households and businesses, in the wake of the pandemic, may spur inflationary pressures in some economies, as the supply shortfalls struggle to meet up with the demand build up. Domestic Economic Developments Available data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew marginally by 187 per cent in the first quarter of 2020 compared with 255 and 210 per cent in the preceding and corresponding quarters of 2019. The performance was largely driven by the 506 per cent growth in the oil sector and 155 per cent growth in the non-oil sector. The decline in output growth in the first quarter was largely attributed to the twin 3 effect of the decline in oil prices and the shocks from the Covid-19 pandemic. The Committee observed the gradual, but persistent decline in the Manufacturing and non-Manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Indices (PMI), below the benchmark. The Manufacturing PMI declined to 411 index points in June 2020 from 424 index points in May 2020. Conversely though, the non-manufacturing PMI improved to 357 index points in June 2020 from 253 index points in May 2020. The trend in the manufacturing and non-Manufacturing PMI was attributed, largely, to: slower growth in production levels; new domestic orders; employment rate; raw materials supply; and new export orders. The Committee noted the staff forecast of 103 per cent contraction in growth in Q2 2020, on the back of the continued adverse impact of the pandemic on the economy. The Committee expressed concern over the persistent, albeit marginal, uptick in inflation for the tenth consecutive month, as headline year-on-year inflation rose to 1256 per cent in June 2020 from 1240 per cent in May 2020. The increase in headline inflation was largely driven by the increase in both food and core inflation, which rose marginally to 1518 and 1013 per cent in June 2020 from 1504 and 1012 per cent in May 2020, respectively. The Committee noted the contribution of the legacy structural factors in the persistent uptick in inflationary pressure. These factors included: disruptions to key supply channels due to security challenges from herder-farmer clashes, banditry/kidnapping, inadequate transportation outlay, epileptic power supply, and low 4 technological adaptability. These factors have compounded the supply chain challenges. The Committee reiterated the need for a robust fiscal policy strategy to attract private investment and capital, to finance the huge infrastructure deficit in Nigeria, and strengthen the existing initiatives by the federal government and the CBN in this direction. The Committee recognized the supportive developmental roles of the CBN towards addressing some of these structural issues. The MPC specifically expressed optimism on the future impact of N50 billion Household and SME facility, out of which N49195 billion has been disbursed, to over 92,,000 beneficiaries. The N100 billion healthcare and N10 trillion manufacturing and agricultural interventions to support the rebound in growth from the impacts of the pandemic on the economy. The Committee further commended the CBN coordinated CA-COVID - Private sector intervention scheme - which had mobilized over N32 billion to support the economy, lives and livelihoods. The Committee noted that the CBN had disbursed over N1529 billion to the manufacturing sector to finance 61 manufacturing projects and another N936 billion to the Healthcare sector, amongst many other sector-specific facilities. The Committee is hopeful that upon further drawdown of these intervention facilities, the much needed reset and rebound of the Nigerian economy will become a reality. The Committee noted that broad money supply (M3) grew by 164 per cent in June 2020 from 272 per cent in May 2020, largely due to increases in Net Domestic Assets (NDA) and Net Foreign Assets (NFA). The growth in M3, however, remained well below the indicative benchmark of 1309 per cent for 2020. Aggregate domestic credit (net) grew by 516 per cent in June 2020 compared with 747 per cent in May 2020. The Committee commended the CBN Loan-to-Deposit Ratio (LDR) initiative to address the credit conundrum as the total gross credit increased by N333 trillion from N1556 trillion at end-May 2019 to N1890 trillion at end-June 2020. These credits were largely recorded in manufacturing, consumer credit, general commerce, and information and communication and agriculture, which are productive sectors of the economy. Money market rates remained relatively stable in the review period, reflecting the prevailing liquidity situation in the banking system. The monthly weighted average Inter-bank call and Open Buy Back (OBB) rates increased to 575 and 1131 per cent, respectively, in June 2020 from 522 and 580 per cent, respectively in May 2020. The Committee welcomed the modest recovery recorded in the equities market as the All-Share Index (ASI) and Market Capitalization (MC) increased by 633 and 644 per cent, on April 30 and June 30, 2020, respectively. The modest improvement reflected the resumption of business activities which spurred 6 market confidence, as Government commenced gradual ease of the lockdown. The Committee noted the decrease in NPLs ratio to 64 per cent at end-June 2020 from 94 per cent in the corresponding period of 2019, on account of increased recoveries, write-offs and disposals. The Committee expressed confidence in the stability of the banking system and urged the Bank to monitor the compliance of DMBs to its prudential and regulatory measures to sustain the soundness and safety of the banking industry. In light of the Bank's continued effort to find innovative ways of using local resources to diversify the sources of the country's Foreign Exchange Reserves, the Committee welcomed the decision of the Central Bank of Nigeria to develop a Gold Purchase Framework under the Federal Government's Presidential Artisanal Gold Mining Development Initiative. The standardised gold bars, which would be purchased in Naira from Nigerian miners and refiners would not only create thousands of jobs for the artisans, but would provide a new sources of foreign exchange accretion to our reserves, and ensure the strength and stability of the Naira. The Committee also commended the Federal Government for the approval to establish a CBN-led Infrastructure Development Company, which will leverage local and international funds for rebuilding of critical infrastructure across the country. This entity, which will be wholly focused on Nigeria and Nigerians alone will be co-owned by the CBN, the Africa Finance Corporation (AFC) and the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA), but exclusively 7 managed by an Independent Infrastructure Fund Manager (IIFM) that will mobilize local and foreign capital to support the Federal Government in building the transport infrastructure required to move agriculture and other products to processors, raw materials to factories, and finished goods to markets. The sum of N15 trillion is projected over 5 years for the initial run. The Committee noted with satisfaction the CBN's immediate work on the updates and timelines for the establishment of this much-needed entity. Outlook The outlook for the global economy remains weak. The IMF's earlier expectations that the coronavirus pandemic will wane by the end of the second quarter of 2020, as economies implement the various prevention protocols, were not achieved. Several countries witnessed a second outbreak after the initial ease in lockdown. This necessitated the IMF's downgrade of output growth forecast for both 2020 and 2021. The slow recovery in oil prices, and its attendant volatility, is projected to continue in 2020 and well into 2021. This would further dampen recovery prospects, particularly for most oil-exporting countries. With many central banks, in the advanced economies, exhausting their conventional monetary policy headroom, unconventional monetary policy tools would trigger global liquidity surfeit, with consequences for many emerging market and developing 8 economies, including, volatility in international financial system and markets. Provisional data on key domestic macroeconomic variables indicate that the Nigerian economy may record negative quarterly GDP growth in the 2nd quarter of 2020, but there is cautious optimism that the year may end in marginal negative territory, with strong recovery prospects in 2021. The Committee's Considerations The Committee's considerations were guided by the developments in the global and domestic economic environment. The MPC noted that the current coordinated efforts by the Federal Government to contain the COVID-19 pandemic would reposition the economy on a sustainable path of rapid recovery. The Committee welcomed the government's articulated fiscal stimulus to cushion the impact of the pandemic on households and businesses, through various palliatives and fiscal incentives and reiterated the need for effective and timely implementation. The MPC expressed the utmost need for both the monetary and fiscal authorities to collaborate, for the optimal synergy for measures targeted at reviving the economy. The Committee called on the government to sustain its efforts at diversifying revenue sources and ensure fiscal prudence, particularly, with the use of the recent grants and multilateral concessionary loans. The Committee encouraged the adoption of counter-cyclical fiscal policy framework to shield the economy from persistent revenue shocks. The MPC noted the Bank's overarching commitment to maintaining price stability and encourage the Bank to sustain the current measures targeted at moderating inflation, including addressing some of the supply-side structural challenges. The Committee urged the Bank to continue to give particular attention to its mandate of exchange rate stability, given the recent volatility in the international financial system, to avoid excessive demand pressures in the foreign exchange market. The MPC commended the Bank on its efforts in sustaining the soundness and resilience of the financial system, particularly, in the face of severe economic challenges. The Committee noted the Bank's drive to accelerate credit growth to the private sector, especially to micro, small and medium scale enterprises and the recent monetary stimulus packages to households and businesses affected by the pandemic. The Committee's Decision The Committee reviewed the policy options before it and argued that the option of tightening at this time would contradict the noble initiative of expansion of affordable credit to the real sector, noting that this would heighten the cost of production which will translate to higher prices of goods and services and harder economic condition for people. On the other hand, loosening monetary stance would provide the desired succour for stimulating output growth and rapid recovery, but with implications for domestic private investment and capital 10 mobilisation to support the huge domestic financing gap. Further cut in MPR may not necessarily lead to a corresponding decrease in market interest rate, considering the current economic challenges. The Committee was also mindful of the cut in policy rate at the last MPC meeting and the need to allow time for the transmission effect to permeate the economy. Given the plethora of monetary and fiscal measures recently deployed to address the impending economic crisis, following the COVID-19 outbreak, it would be a relatively cautious option to hold, in order to evaluate the effectiveness of these tools at addressing the current challenges, particularly with the mounting uncertainties within the domestic economy, as well as the external vulnerabilities. After reviewing the three options, the MPC noted that the imperative for monetary policy at the May 2020 meeting was to strike a balance between supporting the recovery of output growth and reducing unemployment while maintaining stable prices. The Committee noted at this meeting that the economic fundamentals have marginally improved by the end of June 2020, following the gradual pick-up of economic activities as the positive impacts of the various interventions permeate into the economy. As a result, the Committee noted that the earlier downward adjustment of the MPR by 100 basis points to 125 per cent to signal the loosening monetary policy stance is yielding positive impact as credit growth increased significantly in the economy. The Committee also noted the positive impact of the various fiscal and monetary interventions on households. SMEs and manufacturing 11 sectors. The Committee also noted that increasing MPR at this stage will thus be counter-intuitive and will result in upward pressure on market rates and cost of production. In view of the foregoing, the Committee decided by a majority vote to retain the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) at 125 per cent and to hold all other policy parameters constant. The Committee decided by a vote of eight members to Hold and two members voted to Reduce MPR. All members voted to retain all other policy parameters. In summary, the MPC voted to: I Retain the MPR at 125 per cent; II. Retain the asymmetric corridor of +200/-500 basis points around the MPR; III. Retain the CRR at 275 per cent; and IV. Retain the Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent. Thank you. Godwin I Emefiele Governor. Central Bank of Nigeria 20th July, 2020 12."
Hungary,2020-07-21,"At its meeting on 21 July 2020, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 22 July 2020:. In the current extraordinary economic environment, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank's (MNB) mandate is still to achieve and maintain price stability, to preserve financial stability, as well as to support the Government's economic policy. Macroeconomic and financial developments continue to be mostly driven by the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Based on the projection in the June Inflation Report. Hungarian economic performance in 2020 is likely to be more subdued than earlier expected, while the outlook for inflation has shifted downwards persistently. The coronavirus pandemic hit the global economy in a weakened state. As a result of the measures taken to prevent the spread of the pandemic, in the second quarter real economic activity declined, while unemployment rates rose worldwide. From the beginning of May economic activity has restarted gradually as the restrictive measures were eased; however, the number of new cases has grown at an increasing pace in several countries in the past month. There remains an exceptionally large degree of uncertainty in judging the time profile of the health emergency and the speed of the global economic recovery. The outlook for growth in the global economy has deteriorated significantly. Disinflationary effects have strengthened. Sentiment in global financial markets has been volatile in the past month. The Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank have continued their liquidity-providing and asset purchase programmes in the recent period. In our region, decision-makers at the Czech and the Polish central banks left policy rates close to zero. The coronavirus pandemic hit the Hungarian economy when its fundamentals were stable and growth was strong. The economic policy pursued over the past decade has maintained the country's macroeconomic balance and reduced its external and internal vulnerability. In the first quarter of 2020. Hungarian GDP growth slowed to 2.2 percent year on year. However, the Hungarian economy's growth surplus compared to the euro area far exceeded the value of around 3 percentage points achieved in recent years. Hungary's defence against the first wave of the coronavirus has been successful, which provides appropriate foundation for the economic recovery. This year's macroeconomic data are expected to show significant volatility and dichotomy. The effects of the pandemic are likely to be the strongest in data for the second quarter. The recovery, started in May following the trough in April, is expected to continue in June. After a significant decline in GDP in the second quarter, a recovery of economic growth is expected from the third quarter. A pick-up in public investment and an expansion in corporate lending are required for a quick ‘V' shape economic recovery in the second half of the year. The moratorium on instalment payments of loans contributes HUF 2,000 billion to maintaining purchasing power and preserving jobs by the end of the year overall. In line with the expected slower recovery in the external environment, production in export-oriented industrial sectors may pick up only towards the end of the year. Overall. Hungarian GDP may grow at a restrained pace in 2020. As a result of the cost of protective economic measures and the slower nominal GDP growth, the budget deficit in 2020 is likely to rise compared to previous years but to remain low in international comparison. The government debt ratio is expected to rise temporarily; then, with the quick recovery of the economy, it is expected to return to a downward path from 2021. The current account balance is expected to show a moderate deficit this year as well, but net lending remains persistently positive. Hungary's external debt-to-GDP ratios are expected to decline further. Due to the coronavirus epidemic, strong disinflationary effects have appeared in the Hungarian economy as well. Following a temporary rise at the beginning of 2020, the consumer price index quickly returned into the central bank tolerance band, before declining to its lower bound in May. In June 2020, inflation rose to 2.9 percent, and core inflation excluding indirect tax effects remained unchanged on the previous month. Higher consumer price inflation primarily reflected a rise in the price index for fuel, partly due to base effects. Incoming inflation data were in line with the MNB's expectations. The coronavirus pandemic has led to significant fluctuations in food and oil prices in global commodity markets, thus high volatility in domestic inflation is expected to persist. Due to these volatile items, inflation is expected to rise temporarily in the coming months, before stabilising again around the 3 percent central bank target as these effects fade. Weakening economic activity caused by the coronavirus pandemic reduces core inflation excluding indirect tax effects through several channels. In addition to a weaker external inflation environment, more muted domestic demand compared to previous years is also increasingly restraining underlying inflation. Due to strong disinflationary effects, core inflation excluding indirect tax effects will fall below 3 percent: it is expected to stand at 3.33.5 percent in 2020 and at 2.62.7 percent in 2021. Domestic financial market conditions have shown a mixed picture since the Council's previous interest rate decision. As in the case of emerging market currencies, the forint depreciated against the euro during the period. In the government securities market, yields at maturities up to 5 years fell and those at longer maturities, in particular over 10 years, rose. Decisions of the Monetary Council in spring months helped to stabilise domestic money market developments while liquidity with favourable conditions, available to all economic agents, supports the recovery of economic growth. The Bond Funding for Growth Scheme (BGS) and the Funding for Growth Scheme Go! (FGS Go!) ensure the domestic corporate sector to access sustainable, stable and long-term funding, and credit market and investment growth to pick up. The MNB extended the range of potential uses of funds granted under the FGS Go! in early July to allow SMEs to have wider access to funds with favourable conditions under the Scheme and thereby to stimulate the economy. At its current policy meeting, to maintain price stability and to support the restoration of economic growth, the Monetary Council reduced the base rate by 15 basis points to 0.60 percent. The Monetary Council left the overnight deposit rate at -0.05 percent and the overnight and the one-week collateralised lending rates at 1.85 percent unchanged. The MNB will continue to set the one-week deposit rate at the weekly tenders. The effects of the interest rate cut in June appeared persistently in the shorter segment of the yield curve. However, it is of key importance from a monetary policy perspective that the effect of the base rate reduction should have its effect on the longer segment of the yield curve as well. Therefore, to improve monetary policy transmission, the Monetary Council decided to reallocate between its instruments affecting longer-term maturities, i.e. its long-term collateralised lending instruments and government securities purchases. Consequently, the Bank will purchase limited amounts of government securities in the segment of over 15-year maturities. In addition to improving the transmission of monetary policy, this measure is intended to support an extension in the maturity structure of government debt. The Council continues to consider the government securities purchase programme as a safety net, which it intends to use if and to the extent necessary. In the Monetary Council's assessment, the 0.60 percent base rate supports price stability, the preservation of financial stability and the recovery of economic growth in a sustainable manner. In the current rapidly changing environment, it is key to maintain short-term yields at a safe distance from a range close to zero. The Council continuously assesses incoming data and changes in the outlook for inflation. In the event of a persistent deterioration in the outlook for growth, the Bank will deliver the required additional economic stimulus using its targeted instruments, i.e. the Funding for Growth Scheme Go! and the Bond Funding for Growth Scheme, providing the most direct support to investment."
Turkiye,2020-07-23,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 8.25 percent. Developments regarding the spread of the coronavirus substantially weakened global growth in the second quarter. While global economic activity has shown signs of partial recovery in the third quarter following the normalization steps taken by several countries, uncertainties on global economic recovery remain high. Advanced and emerging economies continue to take expansionary monetary and fiscal measures. The pandemic disease is closely monitored for its evolving global impact on capital flows, financial conditions, international trade and commodity prices. Economic recovery, which started in May following gradual steps towards normalization, is gaining pace. Recent monetary and fiscal measures that aim to contain negative effects of the pandemic on the Turkish economy contribute to financial stability and economic recovery by supporting the potential output of the economy. Although tourism revenues declined due to the pandemic, easing travel restrictions are expected to contribute to a partial improvement. The recovery in exports of goods and low levels of commodity prices will support the current account balance in the upcoming periods. Despite the restraining effects of aggregate demand conditions, pandemic-related rise in unit costs have led to an increase in the trends of core inflation indicators. International commodity prices have continued to restrain consumer inflation, while food inflation has risen due to seasonal and pandemic-related effects. As the normalization process continues, supply-side factors, which have prevailed recently due to pandemic-related restrictions, will phase out. Indeed, leading indicators show that monthly price increases have started to slow down in services groups that have been subject to capacity constraints during the normalization process. The Committee maintains the view that demand-driven disinflationary effects will become more prevalent in the second half of the year, but risks on the end-year projection are considered to be on the upside due to recent realizations in inflation. Accordingly, considering all factors affecting the inflation outlook, the Committee decided to keep the policy rate unchanged. The Committee assesses that maintaining a sustained disinflation process is a key factor for achieving lower sovereign risk, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery. Keeping the disinflation process in track with the targeted path requires the continuation of a cautious monetary stance. In this respect, monetary stance will be determined by considering the indicators of the underlying inflation trend to ensure the continuation of the disinflation process. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability and financial stability objectives. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Ukraine,2020-07-23,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to keep its key policy rate at 6% per annum. This on the one hand will curb price growth as the economy recovers in 20212022, while on the other hand leaving room for further decreasing the cost of credit to one-digit levels. Inflation is continuing to accelerate gradually, albeit remaining below the 5% ± 1 pp target range. Inflation rose to 2.4% in June, and continued to accelerate in July according to NBU assessments. Inflation was mainly driven by raw food prices, which grew due to unfavorable weather. The inflation expectations of businesses and households have also worsened. At the same time, price growth has been restrained by weak domestic demand, benign FX market conditions, and relatively low energy prices. Inflation will continue to rise gradually and will return to the 5% +/- 1 pp target range this year. In H2 2020, inflation will accelerate somewhat (to 4.7% as of the year-end) due to a number of factors  both external and internal. First, the faster price growth will be driven by loose monetary and fiscal policies, which will mitigate the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and support consumer demand and business activity. Second, higher energy prices and the lower fruit harvest will affect prices. Inflation will remain within the target range in 20212022. The economy of Ukraine will contract by 6% in 2020 but will resume growth at the level of around 4% in subsequent years. The NBU has revised its forecast of how much real GDP will drop in 2020 as a result of the coronavirus crisis, from 5% to 6%. The low-point of the fall was passed in Q2. In H2 2020, the economy started to recover. With the quarantine restrictions eased, there has been a pickup in business activity. The majority of businesses in the most affected sector  services  have already resumed normal operations. The labor market, although in a worse condition than before the crisis, is showing signs of stabilization. Business activity and private consumption were given additional support by the NBU's stimuli, loan repayment holidays, tax relief, and increased unemployment allowances from the budget. However, the pace of economic recovery will be restrained, as consumer and investment demand remain subdued. During the crisis, households significantly cut their spending on non-staple goods, while businesses put their development plans on hold and revised their staffing levels and payroll funds. Considering the high level of uncertainty over the spread of the coronavirus, both the public and businesses are likely to remain cautious about their consumer and investment decisions. The slow exit from the crisis by other countries, including Ukraine's main trading partners, limits the chances of a more rapid recovery of the economy. In 20212022 the Ukrainian economy will grow, thanks to monetary and fiscal stimuli and higher foreign demand. Economic growth will mainly be driven by private consumption. In 2020, the current account of the balance of payments will post a surplus for the first time in five years. The NBU has significantly improved its current account forecast for 2020, from a zero deficit (compared to a deficit of 1.7% of GDP under the old methodology used in the April forecast) to a surplus of 4.4% of GDP. A significant drop in imports due to falling demand for durable goods, closed borders for travel, and low energy prices will contribute to the current account surplus. Given the stable global demand for food, the pandemic will affect exports less than imports. In addition, the amount of remittances from labor migrants to Ukraine will be larger than expected. That said, in the years to come, the current account will return to deficit on the back of pent-up consumer and investment demand and the expected decrease in gas transit. The key assumption of this forecast is that Ukraine continues to cooperate with the IMF, as set forth in the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies. Complying with the terms of a new Stand-By Arrangement with the IMF, including those that require that Ukraine conducts consistent fiscal and monetary policies, will safeguard macroeconomic stability, which is required for a steady and continued economic recovery. Support from the IMF is important for financing budget expenditures on overcoming the effects of the pandemic, repaying government debt in due time and in full, maintaining access to the international capital markets, and ensuring that international investors retain their interest in Ukrainian assets. Financing from the IMF and other official international partners will help Ukraine to significantly increase its international reserves. International reserves are expected to rise to about USD 30 billion in 2020, growing to USD 32 or 33 billion in the coming years. A longer-lasting coronavirus pandemic and the potential return to stricter quarantine measures required to overcome it, both in Ukraine and globally, remain the key risk to this forecast. This could result in a more significant and longer-lasting cooling of both the global and the Ukrainian economy. Other risks also remain significant. the negative impact of certain court rulings on macrofinancial stabilityan escalation of the military conflict in eastern Ukrainethe higher volatility of global food prices, driven by global climate change and the risk of stronger protectionist measures.Given the gradually accelerating inflation and the above balance of risks, the NBU Board kept the key policy rate unchanged, at 6%. The NBU expects to keep the key policy rate at the current low level at least until the end of the current year. Next year, the NBU will take decisions on the key policy rate taking into account whether or not inflationary risks materialize, how social standards change, and at what pace the economy is recovering. Previous key policy rate cuts have not been fully transmitted to the cost of financial resources  the banks are still continuing to cut their loan and deposit rates. However, anchoring interest rates at the single-digit level requires that financial market participants be confident that economic policy is consistent and that there is a reasonable balance between inflation curbing and monetary stimulus. By keeping the key policy rate at 6%, the NBU leaves enough room for monetary stimulus in order to provide the economy with additional impetus for growth if consumer and investment demand recover more slowly than expected. The decision to keep the key policy rate at 6%, was approved by an NBU Board Decision on the key policy rate  No. 488-D, dated 22 July 2020. А new detailed macroeconomic forecast will be published in the Inflation Report on 30 July 2020. A summary of the discussion between Monetary Policy Committee members that preceded the approval of this decision will be published on 3 August 2020. The next monetary policy meeting of the NBU Board will be held on 3 September 2020, according to the confirmed and published schedule."
South Africa,2020-07-23,"South African Reserve Bank PRESS STATEMENT EMBARGO AGAINST DELIVERY 23 July 2020 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the May meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), the Covid-19 pandemic continues to spread globally, with wide-ranging and deep social and economic effects. Current forecasts from the IMF show global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) contracting by about 4.9% this year.1 The deepest contractions are expected in the second quarter of 2020, with gradual recoveries in the third and fourth quarters of the year. The strength of the global economic recovery will depend in part 1 Global growth in the QPM model is a trade-weighted average of South Africa's trading partners. The IMF expects global growth of 5.4% in 2021. MPC Statement 23 July 2020 Page 1 on the control of new virus outbreaks, the extent of supply and demand losses, and expectations of future growth in investment and productivity. The crisis has caused extreme volatility in financial asset prices with sharp and deep market sell-offs followed by a partial recovery. Investor appetite has generally improved, reflected in a weaker USD and stronger capital flows to emerging markets. The general environment continues to reflect pronounced levels of risk aversion, however, due to uncertainty about future global economic prospects. Policy responses to the crisis have generally been robust. This week the European Union agreed to a large, targeted stimulus package primarily to support investment. Other monetary and fiscal authorities continue to provide accommodation and support. Emerging and developing economies are generally constrained by less policy space, currency risk, and tight global financial conditions. The International Financial Institutions (IFIs) continue to make available extraordinary levels of emergency financial support to respond to the pandemic.2 The Covid-19 outbreak has major health, social and economic impacts, presenting challenges in forecasting domestic and global economic activity. The compilation of accurate economic statistics will also remain severely challenged. Our second quarter estimate for output has been revised lower. The Bank currently expects GDP in 2020 to contract by 7.3%, compared to the 7.0% contraction forecast in May. Even as the lockdown is relaxed in coming months, for the year as a whole, investment, exports and imports are expected to decline sharply. Job losses are also expected to rise further. 2 About 72 countries have been granted funds from the IMF's Rapid Financing Instrument and the Rapid Credit Facility. MPC Statement 23 July 2020 Page 2 Easing of the lockdown has supported growth in recent weeks and high frequency activity indicators show a pickup in spending from extremely low levels. However, getting back to pre-pandemic activity levels will take time. GDP is expected to grow by 3.7% in 2021 and by 2.8% in 2022.3 South Africa's terms of trade and commodity export prices remain high. While oil prices are generally low, they have increased since the May meeting. The Brent crude oil price is expected to average about $40 per barrel in 2020, rising to $45 per barrel in 2021 and $50 per barrel in 2022. Exceptionally accommodative policies and the relaxation of lockdowns in many advanced economies have supported a partial recovery in global financial markets. However, financing conditions for emerging markets remain uncertain, contributing to currency weakness. The rand has depreciated by 15.2% against the USD since January and appreciated by 8.8% since the May meeting of the MPC. The implied starting point for the rand forecast is R17.93 to the US dollar, compared with R18.40 at the time of the previous meeting. Resident investors have increased purchases of long-term bonds, helping to ease yields in recent weeks. However, the yield curve is exceptionally steep, reflecting credit risk associated with high public borrowing needs.4 The Bank's headline consumer price inflation forecast averages 3.4% in 2020 and is marginally lower than previously forecast at 4.3% in 2021 and 2022. The forecast for 3 Compared to -7.0%, 3.8% and 2.9%, respectively, in May. 4 Measured by the spread between the R2036 and R2048 to the R186 bonds. MPC Statement 23 July 2020 Page 3 core inflation is lower at 3.3% in 2020, and remains broadly stable at 3.9% in 2021, and 4.1% in 2022. The overall risks to the inflation outlook at this time appear to be balanced. Global producer price and food inflation appear to have bottomed out. Local food price inflation is expected to stay contained. Risks to inflation from currency depreciation are expected to be muted while pass-through remains low. However, electricity and other administered prices continue to be a concern. Upside risks to inflation could also emerge from heightened fiscal risks and sharp reductions in the supply of goods and services. Expectations of future inflation continued to soften for this year but are broadly stable around the mid-point of the target band for 2021. Market-based expectations for short and medium-term inflation have eased slightly, while long-term inflation expectations are higher.5 Despite sustained higher levels of country financing risk, the Committee notes that the economic contraction and slow recovery will keep inflation well below the midpoint of the target range for this year. Barring risks outlined earlier, inflation is expected to be well contained over the medium-term, remaining close to the midpoint in 2021 and 2022. 5 The latest Bureau for Economic Research (BER) survey has expectations for 2020 down by 0.5 ppts to 3.9% and to 4.5% (from 4.6%) for 2021. Five-year-ahead inflation expectations also remained at 4.7%. Household inflation expectations rose from 4.8% to 6.2%. Market analysts (Reuters Econometer) expect inflation to be 3.4% (from 3.5%) for 2020, 4.1% (unchanged) in 2021 and 4.3% in 2022 (from 4.5%). Market-based rates are calculated from the break-even inflation rate, which is the yield differential between conventional and inflation-linked bonds. These sit at 2.5% for the 5-year and 4.8% on the 10-year breakeven. 15-year breakeven inflation sits at 6 %. MPC Statement 23 July 2020 Page 4 Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to cut the repo rate by 25 basis points, taking it to 3.50% per annum, with effect from 24 July 2020. Three members preferred a cut of 25 basis points and two preferred to keep rates on hold. The implied path of policy rates over the forecast period generated by the Quarterly Projection Model indicates one repo rate cut of 25 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2020, remaining unchanged in the first quarter of 2021. Monetary policy can ease financial conditions and improve the resilience of households and firms to the economic implications of Covid-19. In addition to continued easing of interest rates, the SARB has relaxed regulatory requirements on banks and has taken important steps to ensure adequate liquidity in domestic markets. These actions are intended to free up more capital for lending by financial institutions to households and firms. As indicated previously, monetary policy cannot on its own improve the potential growth rate of the economy or reduce fiscal risks. These should be addressed by implementing prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms that lower costs generally, and increase investment opportunities, potential growth and job creation. Such steps will enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy and its transmission to the broader economy. Global economic and financial conditions are expected to remain volatile for the foreseeable future. In this highly uncertain environment, future decisions will continue to be data dependent and sensitive to the balance of risks to the outlook. The MPC will seek to look through temporary price shocks and focus on second round effects. As usual, the repo rate projection from the QPM remains a broad policy guide, changing from meeting to meeting in response to new data and risks.

Russia,2020-07-24,"On 24 July 2020, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to cut the key rate by 25 bp to 4.25% per annum. Disinflationary factors continue to exert considerable influence on inflation. Household and business inflation expectations have overall stabilised following a decrease in May-June. The recovery of the global and Russian economies will be gradual despite the fact that the easing of restrictions revives economic activity. In these circumstances, there is a risk that in 2021 inflation might deviate downwards from the 4% target. A significant easing of monetary policy since April aims at curbing this risk and stabilising inflation close to 4% over the forecast horizon. According to the Bank of Russia's forecast, given the current monetary policy stance, annual inflation will reach 3.7-4.2% in 2020, 3.5-4.0% in 2021 and will stand close to 4% later on. If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia will consider the necessity of further key rate reduction at its upcoming meetings. In its key rate decision-making, the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic developments over the forecast horizon, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. Inflation dynamics this year and in the first half of 2021 will be largely influenced by a steep decline in domestic and external demand occurred in the second quarter. The disinflationary impact of weak demand is caused by the economic effects of restrictions. The strengthening of the ruble since April largely offset its depreciation in March containing the upward pressure of the exchange rate on consumer prices. Household and business inflation expectations have overall stabilised following a decrease in May-June. The dynamics of consumer prices in June was heterogeneous. This was caused, among other things, by the gradual and uneven recovery of goods and services supply as well as by deferred demand given the step-by-step easing of the lockdown regime. The fiscal policy measures supported consumption. Annual inflation increased to 3.2% in June vs 3.0% in May, which is largely explained by a base effect, primarily in movements of prices for fruit and vegetables. According to the estimates as of 20 July, annual inflation was close to 3.3%. According to Bank of Russia estimates, monthly inflation indicators reflecting the most sustainable price movements are close to or below 4% (annualised). Seasonally adjusted monthly growth rates continued to decline in June and will remain low till the year-end amid subdued demand. However, annual inflation will continue to increase in 2020 due to the low base effect of 2019. In the context of prevailing disinflationary factors there is a risk that in 2021 inflation might deviate downwards from the 4% target. A significant easing of monetary policy since April aims at curbing this risk and stabilising inflation close to 4% over the forecast horizon. According to the Bank of Russia's forecast, given the current monetary policy stance, annual inflation will reach 3.7-4.2% in 2020, 3.5-4.0% in 2021 and will stay close to 4% later on. Monetary conditions have softened since the previous meeting of the Bank of Russia Board of Directors. Interest rate dynamics in various segments of the domestic financial market was diverging. Credit and deposit rates decreased, inter alia, under the influence of the earlier made decisions on the key rate reduction. Spreads between OFZ and corporate bond yields dropped reaching the levels of early 2020. At the same time, elevated credit risks hinder the decrease in interest rates. Non-price lending conditions continued to tighten in certain market segments. The Bank of Russia's decisions to cut the key rate, along with a notable yield drop in the OFZ market, as compared with March-April, pave the way for further reduction in interest rates in other financial market segments. Coupled with the Government and other Bank of Russia's measures, this supports lending, including in the most vulnerable sectors of the economy. The volume of deposits continues to grow as positive real interest rates on them remain in place, taking expected inflation into account. Economic activity. The Russian economy will be recovering gradually, as the restrictions are being lifted step-by-step. The revival of business activity is still moderate and uneven across industries and regions. In June, the decline in industrial production, the contraction of orders in both external and domestic market, and the growth of unemployment slowed down. Proxy indicators suggest a slight rebound in investment activity. Recovery continues in retail trade and the services sector. Consumer demand was supported by the fiscal policy measures. At the same time, weak external demand coupled with restrictions under the OPEC+ deal lead to a drop in exports, causing an adverse effect on economic activity. Further economic recovery might be unstable due to a fall in incomes, moderate consumer behaviour, cautious sentiment of businesses and external demand-side restrictions. In these conditions. GDP will decrease by 4.5-5.5% in 2020. The Russian economy is thereafter expected to follow a recovery path with growth predicted to total 3.5-4.5% in 2021 and 2.5-3.5% in 2022. The Russian economy is gaining support from the Russian Government and the Bank of Russia's measures aimed at mitigating economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic, including the monetary policy easing and regulatory measures implemented by the Bank of Russia. Inflation risks. Disinflationary risks prevail over pro-inflationary ones. Disinflationary risks under the baseline scenario are chiefly connected with uncertainty as to further coronavirus pandemic developments in Russia and globally, the scale of possible measures to fight it and their impact on economic activity, as well as the speed at which both the global and Russian economies will recover as restrictive measures are mitigated. Persistent changes in the households' preferences and behaviour together with higher propensity to save might also exert a constraining influence on inflation. In the short run a number of factors may put upward pressure on prices. This includes disrupted supply chains as a result of the remaining restrictions and the additional costs of protecting personnel and consumers from the coronavirus spread. Short-term pro-inflationary risks might also be connected with a more sizeable than expected in the baseline scenario materialisation of deferred demand for goods and services. The periods of strengthened volatility in global markets can be reflected in the exchange rate and inflation expectations. Medium-term inflation dynamics will be significantly impacted by fiscal policy, in particular, the scale and efficiency of the Government's measures towards mitigating the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic and overcoming structural constraints, as well as the speed of the 2021-2022 budget consolidation. If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia will consider the necessity of further key rate reduction at its upcoming meetings. In its further key rate decision-making, the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic developments over the forecast horizon, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. In the follow-up to the Board of Directors meeting of 24 July 2020 the Bank of Russia released its medium-term forecast. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next key rate review meeting on 18 September 2020. The press release on the Bank of Russia Board decision is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time.

Armenia,2020-07-28,"PRESS RELEASE 28.07.2020 Refinancing rate left unchanged  4.50% The refinancing rate was kept unchanged at 4.50%. At the July 28 meeting, the CBA Board decided to keep the refinancing rate unchanged at 4.5%. In June 2020 inflation stood at -1.4%, compared to -1.9% in the same month of the previous year. As a result, the 12-month inflation increased to 1.7%. At the same time, the 12-month core inflation remained at 0.8%, which is the level seen in the previous month. In the external sector, the global economy and the external demand significantly contracted during the second quarter, which was in line with the latest monetary policy program. At the end of the quarter, prices in major commodity markets were slightly higher than anticipated. At the same time, both advanced and developing countries have continued to pursue expansionary monetary policy and highly expansionary fiscal policy. As expected, there will be no significant inflationary impact on the Armenian economy from the external sector. In the second quarter, the contraction of both economic activity and domestic demand caused by the pandemic was in line with the Central Bank's projections. The decrease in output was mainly in the construction and services sectors, while the decline in the industry was less than expected. Due to the high uncertainty related to the timing of the resolution of the pandemic, domestic demand is expected to remain weak in the near term, despite some positive contribution from the higher-than-anticipated inflow of remittances. At the same time, it is estimated that the current fiscal policy, in particular, the recent legislative changes in profit taxation, will have a positive impact on both supply and demand. Taking into account that the actual developments were in line with the forecasts of the latest monetary policy program, the CBA Board deems the current monetary conditions sufficiently expansionary. At the same time, the Board estimates that in the current situation it will be necessary to maintain the expansionary position through the medium term, which will allow inflation to gradually increase and stabilize at the target level by the end of the forecast horizon. The Board agrees that expansionary fiscal policy, especially through the potential-growth- enhancing government expenditures, in the current situation is also essential for the recovery of aggregate demand. The Board of the CBA assesses that due to the possible slowdown in the recovery of demand and probable extension of uncertainty, the risks to inflation are skewed downwards. In case such risks are realized, the Central Bank is ready to respond accordingly to ensure price stability in the medium term."
United States,2020-07-29,"EDT July 29, 2020 The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals. The coronavirus outbreak is causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. Following sharp declines, economic activity and employment have picked up somewhat in recent months but remain well below their levels at the beginning of the year. Weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices are holding down consumer price inflation. Overall financial conditions have improved in recent months, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. The path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus. The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term. In light of these developments, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals. The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including information related to public health, as well as global developments and muted inflation pressures, and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the stance of monetary policy, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and (more) For release at 2 p.m. EDT July 29, 2020 - 2 - inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. To support the flow of credit to households and businesses, over coming months the Federal Reserve will increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities at least at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions. In addition, the Open Market Desk will continue to offer large-scale overnight and term repurchase agreement operations. The Committee will closely monitor developments and is prepared to adjust its plans as appropriate. Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H Powell. Chair; John C. Williams. Vice Chair; Michelle W Bowman; Lael Brainard; Richard H Clarida; Patrick Harker; Robert S Kaplan; Neel Kashkari; Loretta J Mester; and Randal K Quarles."
Colombia,2020-07-31,"Vimeo live broadcast (Only in Spanish). Other measures taken by BR on account of COVID-19. Learn the reasons that led the BDBR #JuntaBanrep to provide an additional boost to the economy. The Board of Directors of. (BDBR) unanimously decided to lower the Benchmark Interest Rate by one fourth of a Percentage Point to 2.25%. This decision took the following elements into consideration. Inflation in June stood at 2.19%, the average of core inflation indicators at 2.03%, and inflation expectations continued to decline. All the indicators and expectations stand below the 3.0% target. The observed aggregate demand is weaker than expected, with higher spare capacity, and strong deterioration of the labor market, within a context of great global macroeconomic uncertainty. The conditions of financial markets have improved with respect to the beginning of the crisis, and the abundant liquidity in global and local markets has been reflected by lower sovereign risk premia and lower foreign-exchange volatility. Under these conditions, the risk balance for monetary policy suggests the appropriateness of providing an additional boost to the economy. The impact of monetary policy will be greater inasmuch as the conditions of the pandemic allow to continue the gradual reopening of the different economic sectors.

Brazil,2020-08-05,"In its 232nd&#160;meeting, the Copom unanimously decided to lower the Selic rate to 2.00% p.a. In its 232nd meeting, the Copom unanimously decided to lower the Selic rate to 2.00% p.a. The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario:. Regarding the global outlook, the COVID-19 pandemic keeps causing the largest economic downturn since the Great Depression. Against this backdrop, despite some promising signs of recovery in major economies, and some moderation in financial assets volatility, the environment for emerging economies remains challenging. Turning to the Brazilian economic activity, recent indicators suggest a partial recovery. Sectors more directly affected by social distancing measures remain depressed despite the offsetting effects of the government transfer programs. Prospectively, uncertainty about economic growth remains larger than usual, especially for the period starting at the end of this year, concurrently with the expected winding up of the emergency transfer programs. The Committee judges that the various measures of underlying inflation remain below the level compatible with meeting the inflation target at the relevant horizon for monetary policy. Inflation expectations for 2020, 2021, and 2022 collected by the Focus survey are around 1.6%, 3.0%, and 3.5%, respectively. The Copom's inflation projections in the hybrid scenario with interest rate path extracted from the Focus survey and constant exchange rate at R$5.20/US$* stand around 1.9% for 2020, 3.0% for 2021 and 3.4% for 2022. This scenario assumes a path for the Selic rate that ends 2020 at 2.00% p.a., rises to 3.00% p.a. in 2021 and 5.00% p.a. in 2022; and. The scenario with constant interest rate at 2.25% p.a. and constant exchange rate at R$5.20/US$* yields inflation projections around 1.9% for 2020, 3.0% for 2021 and 3.7% for 2022. The Committee emphasizes that risks to its baseline scenario remain in both directions. On the one hand, economic slack may continue to produce a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory. This risk increases if a slower reversion of the pandemic effects lengthens the environment of high uncertainty and precautionary savings. On the other hand, fiscal policy responses to the pandemic that permanently aggravate the fiscal path or a frustration with the continuation of the reform agenda may increase the risk premium. Additionally, the credit and transfer programs implemented in response to the pandemic may cause a smaller-than-estimated decline in aggregate demand, introducing an asymmetry to the balance of risks. This set of factors could potentially result in a higher-than-expected path for inflation over the relevant horizon for monetary policy. The Committee believes that persevering in the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy is essential for a sustainable economic recovery. The Copom also stresses that uncertainty regarding the continuation of the reform agenda and permanent changes to the fiscal consolidation process could result in an increase in the structural interest rate. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to lower the Selic rate in 0.25 percentage points to 2.00% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation, a higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks, and it is consistent with convergence of inflation to its target over the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2021 and, to a lesser extent, 2022. The Copom believes that the current economic conditions continue to recommend an unusually strong monetary stimulus but it recognizes that, due to prudential and financial stability reasons, the remaining space for monetary policy stimulus, if it exists, should be small. Consequently, possible future adjustments to the current degree of monetary stimulus would occur with additional gradualism and would depend on the perception of the fiscal trajectory, as well as on new information that changes the Committee's current assessment about prospective inflation. Despite the asymmetry on its balance of risks, the Copom does not foresee reductions in the monetary stimulus unless inflation expectations, as well as its baseline scenario inflation projections, are sufficiently close to the inflation target at the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which currently includes 2021 and, to a lesser extent, 2022. This intention is conditional on the maintenance of the current fiscal regime and on the anchoring of long-term inflation expectations. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Roberto Oliveira Campos Neto (Governor). Bruno Serra Fernandes. Carolina de Assis Barros. Fabio Kanczuk. Fernanda Feitosa Nechio. Joao Manoel Pinho de Mello. Mauricio Costa de Moura. Otavio Ribeiro Damaso, and Paulo Srgio Neves de Souza. *Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average R$/US$ exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the last day of the week before the Copom meeting."
Romania,2020-08-05,"In its meeting of 5 August 2020, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided the following:. Global and European economies started to recover in May amid the gradual lifting of physical mobility restrictions, yet activity remained at much lower levels than prior to the coronavirus spread. At the same time, their pace of recovery remains uncertain in the near run, depending on the pandemic evolution and the associated measures, yet also supported by the fiscal measures that the authorities have implemented, as well by the accommodative monetary policies of central banks in the advanced and emerging economies, including the ECB and central banks in the region. On the domestic front, the incoming data and information since the last NBR Board meeting at end-May have shown a severe impact of the coronavirus pandemic, especially in April, but also the economic and financial effects of the gradual relaxation of the restrictive measures starting in May. The annual CPI inflation rate continued to drop in May to 2.26 percent (from 2.68 percent in April), while in June it went up to 2.58 percent, i.e. slightly above the mid-point of the flat target, amid base effects and the resumed pick-up in the oil price. Compared to the 3.05 percent level reported at the end of the previous quarter, the annual inflation rate followed a downward path  slightly steeper than projected , owing to the markedly larger decline in fuel prices in annual terms. The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate (which excludes from the CPI inflation administered prices, volatile prices, and tobacco product and alcoholic beverage prices) saw only a minor, lower-than-projected, fall in Q2 to 3.7 percent in June from 3.86 percent in March, the significant disinflationary base effect notwithstanding. Its evolution is further marked by the demand-pull and wage cost-push inflationary pressures built up prior to the pandemic crisis outbreak, likely to foster the persistence of this component. In recent months, to these have added the influences of changes in the consumption structure brought about by the pandemic and social distancing, as well as the impact of cost increases associated with bottlenecks in production and supply chains and with the measures to prevent the coronavirus spread. Average annual CPI inflation rate and average annual inflation rate calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices dropped to 3.3 percent and 3.2 percent, respectively, in June from 3.6 percent in April. Economic growth decelerated considerably in 2020 Q1 to 2.4 percent from 4.3 percent in the preceding quarter, but its quarterly dynamics remained in positive territory at 0.3 percent. At the same time, the trade deficit posted a markedly faster widening in this period amid the pronounced decline in exports of goods and services, while the current account deficit coverage by foreign direct investment and capital transfers deteriorated further. The latest developments in high-frequency indicators suggest a severe contraction of the economy in Q2, in line with the forecasts, in view of the strong decline in April  a month fully impacted by containment measures , which has started however to be reversed in May, when the state of emergency was replaced with the state of alert. Thus, in May, retail trade and motor vehicles and motorcycles sales saw a notable narrowing in their particularly large decline in annual terms reported in April, whereas the volume of construction works rose further at a fast pace in the first two months of Q2, albeit markedly slower than in the previous quarter. The revival of services to households was, nevertheless, much more subdued in May, after the massive fall in April, while the annual dynamics of the industrial output and of new orders in manufacturing remained deep in negative territory, in spite of visible increases from April, while net direct investment flows saw a new plunge in annual terms throughout the interval. Moreover, the advance in trade deficit posted only a mild slowdown. Financial market conditions continued to improve amid the new monetary policy decisions taken at end-May. Key interbank money market rates consolidated their decline and subsequently their lower levels, and yields on government securities extended their downward course, given the significant volume of liquidity provided by the NBR via bilateral repo operations and purchases of leu-denominated government securities on the secondary market, in the context of a sizeable liquidity deficit on the money market; the stock of repo operations posted a daily average of lei 4.8 billion June through July 2020 and the volume of government securities purchased by the central bank reached a similar figure, i.e. nearly lei 4.8 billion, at end-July. In turn, the average lending rate on new business followed a clear-cut downtrend in 2020 Q2, while the average remuneration of new time deposits fell only slightly, with the related spread narrowing considerably. At the same time, the EUR/RON exchange rate was further quasi-stable, and even tended to decrease somewhat in July, in step with the movements of other currencies in the region, amid the upbeat sentiment instilled by the EU's major economic recovery plan. The expansion in credit to the private sector saw its deceleration rate slow markedly in June to 4.1 percent, against 4.5 percent in May, due solely to the leu-denominated component, also upheld by the IMM Invest Romania Programme. The share of domestic currency loans in total private sector credit widened to 67.8 percent, hitting a record-high for the post-May 1996 period. In today's meeting, the NBR Board examined and approved the August 2020 Inflation Report, which incorporates the latest available data and information. The new scenario reconfirms the expected trajectory of the annual inflation rate highlighted in the previous forecast, with a slightly downward revision over the near-term horizon. Specifically, the annual inflation rate is anticipated to increase slightly in July as well, and thereafter to remain relatively stable in the upper half of the variation band of the target until the end of this year, before declining and hovering moderately around the mid-point of the target amid the lagged action of disinflationary effects from the aggregate demand deficit; this is expected to open up markedly in 2020 Q2, but then to narrow gradually and somewhat faster than in the previous forecast. The uncertainty surrounding the new macroeconomic projections continues to be extremely elevated in the current environment, triggering two-way risks to the inflation outlook over the projection horizon. Their major source remains, at least in the short run, the coronavirus pandemic  which has resurged of late  and the associated containment measures that weigh on the speed and path of economic recovery, the government's support programmes and the NBR's monetary policy measures notwithstanding. Major uncertainties relate further to the fiscal and income policy stance, given the possibly sharper increase in budget expenditures this year, also as a result of higher social transfers, in the run-up to this year's elections  with consequences for the economy's external position as well. At the same time, the fiscal consolidation that will probably start subsequently may be partly countered in terms of economic impact by the funds allocated to Romania via the EU's recently-agreed economic recovery package and multiannual budget. Significant uncertainties and risks also stem from the external environment, given the somewhat more encouraging signals on the recent developments in Europe's economies, but also amid the resurgent pandemic over the last month, which may have an impact on the pace of recovery of economic activity and global trade. In today's meeting, based on the currently available data and assessments, but also in light of the extremely high uncertainty, the NBR Board decided to cut the monetary policy rate to 1.50 percent per annum from 1.75 percent per annum starting 6 August 2020. Moreover, it decided to lower the deposit facility rate to 1.00 percent per annum from 1.25 percent per annum and the lending (Lombard) facility rate to 2.00 percent per annum from 2.25 percent per annum. Furthermore, the NBR Board decided to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. Given the liquidity shortfall on the money market, the Board decided to further conduct repo transactions and continue to purchase leu-denominated government securities on the secondary market. The NBR Board considers that, given the transmission lags of the lower policy rate impulses, such a calibration of the monetary policy conduct is likely to provide an underpinning to the recovery of economic activity over the projection horizon with a view to bringing and strengthening over the medium term the annual inflation rate in line with the 2.5 percent ±1 percentage point inflation target, while safeguarding financial stability. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be published on the NBR's website on 6 August 2020 at 12:00 p.m. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR's website on 14 August 2020, at 3:00 p.m."
Thailand,2020-08-05,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 5/2020 Mr. Titanun Mallikamas. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 5 August 2020 as follows. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 050 percent. In deliberating their policy decision, the Committee assessed that the Thai economy would gradually recover, in line with the relaxation of COVID-19 containment measures in Thailand and the gradual improvement in global economic activities, and would monitor risks of the second wave of the outbreak. Meanwhile headline inflation would be negative this year but would return to the target in 2021 as previously assessed. Financial stability was more vulnerable given the economic outlook. The Committee viewed that the extra accommodative monetary policy since the beginning of the year as well as the fiscal, financial, and credit measures additionally announced helped alleviate adverse impacts and would support the economic recovery after the pandemic subsided, facilitate the return of inflation to the target, and reduce financial stability risks. The Committee thus voted to maintain the policy rate at this meeting. The Committee viewed that financial institutions should expedite debt restructuring for households and businesses to have a more widespread impact as well as accelerate lending under various measures to address liquidity problems in a targeted and timely manner. The Thai economy would gradually recover in line with the relaxation of the containment measures in Thailand and the gradual recovery of global economic activities. Overall economic activities would take at least two years before returning to the pre-pandemic level. Nevertheless recovery would significantly vary among economic sectors. Merchandise exports started to recover but remained at a low level. The number of foreign tourists would recover more slowly than the previous assessment. Nonetheless the number of domestic tourists picked up owing partly to domestic tourism stimulus measures. Meanwhile domestic demand, both private consumption and private investment, would contract as previously assessed. Employment and household incomes were severely affected by the economic contraction and would take time to recover. The Committee thus viewed that going forward government policies — namely, timely and targeted fiscal measures, continued accommodative monetary policy, as well as financial and credit measures to support liquidity — should continuously support employment and facilitate economic restructuring and recovery. The government policies should also include additional supply-side policies to support the changing economic structure, patterns of business operations, and labor skill development consistent with the post-COVID environment. The annual average of headline inflation edged up somewhat following increasing crude oil prices but would remain negative in 2020. Core inflation would remain subdued at a low level. However headline inflation would rise toward the target in 2021 in tandem with gradually rising crude oil prices and the economic recovery. Medium-term inflation expectations remained anchored within the target. Commercial bank lending rates and government bond yields remained at low levels, whereas corporate bond spreads remained high. Commercial bank loans expanded on the back of large corporates borrowing to substitute for bond issuance. Meanwhile SME and consumer loans decelerated despite some reliefs provided by the loan repayment holiday. With the level of overall liquidity in the financial system remaining ample, the Committee deemed it important that liquidity be better distributed to affected businesses and households. Regarding exchange rates, volatilities of the baht were higher than in the previous meeting. The baht appreciated over the most recent two weeks due to the depreciation of the US dollar. The Committee viewed that if the baht were to appreciate rapidly, the economic recovery could be affected. Therefore the Committee would closely monitor developments in foreign exchange markets as well as assess the necessity of implementing additional appropriate measures. The financial system remained sound despite increasing vulnerabilities given the economic outlook. Commercial banks had robust capital fund and loan loss provision levels. Nevertheless there remained a need in the period ahead to cope with the impacts from the highly uncertain COVID-19 situation and the increased risks from deteriorating debt service capability of businesses and households. The Committee viewed that commercial banks should expedite debt restructuring for retail borrowers and businesses to be in line with the income stream and debt service capability in the post-COVID environment. Banks should accelerate credit extension under various measures such as the provision of soft loans, credit guarantee facilities by the Thai Credit Guarantee Corporation, and lending facilities by specialized financial institutions. Looking ahead, the Committee would monitor developments of economic growth, inflation, and financial stability, together with associated risks, including external risks, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the effectiveness of the fiscal, financial, and credit measures, in deliberating monetary policy going forward. The Committee would stand ready to use additional appropriate monetary policy tools if necessary."
Czech Republic,2020-08-06,"At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank unanimously kept interest rates unchanged. The two-week repo rate thus remains at 0.25%, the discount rate at 0.05% and the Lombard rate at 1%.. The decision adopted by the Bank Board is underpinned by a new macroeconomic forecast. Consistent with the forecast is stability of domestic market interest rates until mid-2021, followed by a gradual rise in rates. In the context of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, it must be stressed that the uncertainty regarding the external and domestic assumptions of the new forecast and the way they are captured by the forecasting system is again high. The world economy is gradually recovering from the quarantine restrictions, although the epidemiological situation is not entirely under control everywhere. Most euro area countries bottomed out in Q2. Fiscal and monetary policy measures are supporting renewed economic growth in the euro area, which is expected from the middle of this year onwards. However, euro area GDP will decline markedly overall this year. Producer prices in the euro area will drop this year owing to low oil prices and weak demand pressures in the production sector. These anti-inflationary effects will fade out next year. Consumer price inflation in euro area countries can also be expected to be subdued this year. The European Central Bank is keeping its monetary policy extremely easy, and short-term euro rates remain negative over the entire forecast horizon. The expected trend of the Brent crude oil price is slightly rising. The euro will appreciate slightly against the dollar. The single European currency should benefit mainly from the massive volumes of fiscal measures aimed at supporting the economy and from a better epidemiological situation compared with the USA. Part of the Czech economy was shut down during the spring months due to measures to combat the coronavirus pandemic. Although the quarantine measures have been almost fully lifted, reduced external demand, a marked rise in unemployment and worse overall perceptions of the economic situation among Czech firms and households will have an adverse effect on the economy in the months ahead. This will lead to a decline in GDP of around 8% overall this year. The economy will return to growth next year, but it will not reach the pre-pandemic level until the end of 2022. The decline in economic activity this year will be due mainly to a drop in private investment. The recovery in investment will be hindered by a deep downturn in external demand reflecting significantly worse global economic sentiment. At the same time, the exports of Czech corporations will decrease. This will be reflected in a negative contribution of net exports. By contrast, the negative impacts of the coronavirus pandemic are being softened by faster growth in government consumption coupled with stabilising budgetary measures, which are supporting household consumption above all. Inflation will stay above the upper boundary of the tolerance band for the rest of this year. The elevated growth in consumer prices is due mainly to buoyant core inflation and rapid growth in food prices. The latter is due, among other things, to still solid consumer demand, international transport restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic, and also to labour shortages in agriculture. The continued price growth in the months ahead will reflect efforts by firms to make up the loss of revenues they suffered during the coronavirus pandemic and for growth in their costs. Over the monetary policy horizon, i.e. in the second half of next year, however, the deep decline in demand and overall economic activity will prevail and inflation will return close to the 2% target. This will be fostered by lower growth in domestic costs, a slightly appreciating koruna and a cooling of the labour market. Consumer price inflation will stay close to the target in 2022. Monetary policy-relevant inflation will be slightly lower than headline inflation, as the first-round effects of changes to indirect taxes will be slightly positive overall. Monetary policy-relevant inflation will be at the 2% target over the monetary policy horizon. The koruna appreciated in late May owing to a change in global sentiment fostered by the easing of the quarantine measures. A relatively moderate course of the pandemic in the domestic economy and in Europe will allow the exchange rate to appreciate gradually further over the forecast horizon. This will be due to renewed growth in external demand and, in turn, domestic economic activity. Consistent with the forecast is stability of domestic market interest rates until mid-2021, followed by a gradual rise in rates. Following a sizeable decrease in market interest rates in the first half of this year, which reflected the Czech National Bank's response to the negative impacts of the coronavirus pandemic, rates will remain stable for a few quarters according to the forecast. The forecast indicates a gradual increase in market interest rates from the second half of next year onwards as domestic economic activity recovers, amid stabilisation of inflation close to the target. The inflation outlook for the next four quarters is higher than in the previous forecast. Over the monetary policy horizon (i.e. in the second half of next year), however, the inflation forecast is virtually unchanged. The outlook for domestic economic activity and interest rates is slightly lower this year and the next. The exchange rate of the koruna against the euro is stronger in both years than in the previous forecast."
India,2020-08-06,"Monetary Policy Statement, 2020-21 Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) August 4 to 6, 2020 On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (August 6, 2020) decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 4.0 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains unchanged at 3.35 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 4.25 per cent. The MPC also decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long as it is necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Assessment Global Economy 2. Since the MPC met in May 2020, global economic activity has remained fragile and in retrenchment in several geographies. While the uneasy and differently-paced withdrawal of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions in some2 countries enabled a sequential improvement in high frequency indicators during May-July, a renewed surge in COVID-19 infections in major economies and threats of a second wave of infections appear to have weakened these early signs of revival. Contractions in economic activity have been more severe in Q2:2020 than in Q1, and the near-term outlook points to a slow, uneven and hesitant recovery pushed into the second half of the year, with risks steeply slanted to the downside. Among advanced economies (AEs), output in the US and the Euro area underwent a deeper contraction in Q2:2020 than in the preceding quarter. Emerging market economies (EMEs) are expected to shrink in Q2 as reflected in high frequency indicators. Global financial markets have rebounded since end-March 2020 with intermittent pauses, shrugging off the volatility and sharp correction recorded in Q1:2020. Portfolio flows returned to EMEs in Q2 after a massive reversal, though there was moderation in July from the previous month's level. EME currencies have also appreciated in close co-movement, tracking weakening of the US dollar. Crude oil prices have remained supported on supply cuts by oil producing countries (OPEC plus) and improved demand prospects on the gradual easing of lockdown restrictions since May. Gold prices have rallied to an all-time high on August 5 on the back of safe haven demand. In AEs, benign fuel prices and soft aggregate demand have kept inflation subdued. In many EMEs, however, cost-push pressures arising from supply disruptions and demand revival have shown up in consumer prices in June 2020. Global food prices are elevated across the board. Domestic Economy 4. On the domestic front, economic activity had started to recover from the lows of April-May following the uneven re-opening of some parts of the country in June; however, surges of fresh infections have forced re-clamping of lockdowns in several cities and states. Consequently, several high frequency indicators have levelled off.3 5. The agricultural sector has emerged as a bright spot. Its prospects have strengthened on the back of good spatial and temporal progress of the south- west monsoon. The cumulative monsoon rainfall was 1 per cent below the long-period average (LPA) up to August 5, 2020. Spurred by the expanding precipitation, the total area sown under kharif crops on July 31 was 5.9 per cent higher than the normal area measured by the average over the period 2014-15 to 2018-19. As on July 30, 2020, the live storage in major reservoirs was 41 per cent of the full reservoir level (FRL), which bodes well for the rabi season. These developments have had a salutary effect on rural demand as reflected in fertiliser production and sales of tractors, motorcycles and fast- moving consumer goods. The pace of contraction of industrial production, measured by the index of industrial production (IIP), moderated to (-) 34.7 per cent in May from (-) 57.6 per cent a month ago, with the easing of lockdowns in different parts of the country. All manufacturing sub-sectors, except pharmaceuticals, remained in negative territory. The output of core industries in June contracted for the fourth successive month though with a considerable moderation. The Reserve Bank's business assessment index (BAI) for Q1:2020-21 hit its lowest mark in the survey's history. The manufacturing PMI remained in contraction, shrinking further to 46.0 in July from 47.2 in the preceding month. High frequency indicators of services sector activity for May-June indicate signs of a modest resumption of economic activity, especially in rural areas, although at levels lower than a year ago. Notably, the decline in passenger vehicle sales moderated to (-) 49.6 per cent in June from (-) 85.3 per cent in May, indicative of tentative urban demand, and faster recovery of sales in rural areas. On the other hand, domestic air passenger traffic and cargo traffic continued to post sharp contraction. Construction activity remained tepid  cement production fell and finished steel consumption moderated sharply in June. Imports of capital goods  a key indicator of investment activity  declined further in June. The services PMI continued in contractionary zone in July to 34.2, although the downturn eased relative to the May and June readings.4 8. The National Statistical Office (NSO) released data on headline CPI for the month of June 2020 on July 13, 2020, along with imputed back prints of the index for April and May 2020. This resulted in a sharp upward revision of food inflation for the month of April and May. During Q1:2020-21 food inflation moderated from 10.5 per cent in April to 7.3 per cent in June 2020. Meanwhile, fuel inflation edged up as international kerosene and LPG prices firmed up. Inflation excluding food and fuel was at 5.4 per cent in June, reflecting a spike in prices across most sub-groups. Inflation in transport and communication, personal care and effects, pan-tobacco and education registered significant increases in June. Headline CPI inflation, which was at 5.8 per cent in March 2020 was placed at 6.1 per cent in the provisional estimates for June 2020. For the second successive round, households' three months ahead expectations remained above their one year ahead expectations, indicating their anticipation of lower inflation over the longer horizon. Producers' sentiments on input prices remained muted as their salary outgoes fell. Their selling prices contracted in Q1 in the April-June round of the Reserve Bank's industrial outlook survey. The contraction in output prices is also corroborated by firms participating in the manufacturing PMI survey. Domestic financial conditions have eased substantially and systemic liquidity remains in large surplus, due to the conventional and unconventional measures by the Reserve Bank since February 2020. Cumulatively, these measures assured liquidity of the order of ₹9.57 lakh crore or 4.7 per cent of GDP. Reflecting these developments, reserve money (RM) increased by 15.4 per cent on a year-on-year basis (as on July 31, 2020), driven by a surge in currency demand (23.1 per cent). Growth in money supply (M3), however, was contained at 12.4 per cent as on July 17, 2020. Average daily net absorptions under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) moderated from ₹5.3 lakh crore in May 2020 to ₹4.1 lakh crore in June as government spending slowed. In July, average daily net absorptions under the LAF moderated further to ₹4.0 lakh crore, as government spending remained subdued. During 2020-21 (up to July 31), ₹1,24,154 crore was injected through open market operation (OMO) purchases. In order to distribute liquidity more evenly across the term structure5 and improve transmission, the Reserve Bank conducted ‘operation twist' auctions involving the simultaneous sale and purchase of government securities for ₹10,000 crore on July 2, 2020. Furthermore, the utilisation of refinance provided by the Reserve Bank to the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD). Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) and the National Housing Bank (NHB) increased to ₹34,566 crore on July 31, 2020 from ₹22,334 crore during the May policy. The transmission to bank lending rates has improved further, with the weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans declining by 91 bps during March-June 2020. The spreads of 3-year AAA rated corporate bonds over G-Secs of similar maturity declined from 276 bps on March 26, 2020 to 50 bps by end-July 2020. Even for the lowest investment grade bonds (BBB-), spreads have come down by 125 bps by end-July 2020. Lower borrowing costs have led to record primary issuance of corporate bonds of ₹2.1 lakh crore in the first quarter of 2020-21. India's merchandise exports contracted for the fourth successive month in June 2020, although the pace of fall moderated on improving shipments of agriculture and pharmaceutical products. Imports fell sharply in June in a broad-based manner, reflecting weak domestic demand and low international crude oil prices. The merchandise trade balance recorded a surplus in June (US$ 0.8 billion), after a gap of over 18 years. The current account balance turned into a marginal surplus of 0.1 per cent of GDP in Q4 of 2019-20 as against a deficit of 0.7 per cent a year ago. On the financing side, net foreign direct investment moderated to US$ 4.4 billion in April-May 2020 from US$ 7.2 billion a year ago. In 2020-21 (till July 31), net foreign portfolio investment (FPI) in equities at US$ 5.3 billion was higher than US$ 1.2 billion a year ago. In the debt segment, however, there were outflows of US$ 4.4 billion during the same period as against inflows of US$ 2.0 billion a year ago. Net investment under the voluntary retention route increased by US$ 0.9 billion during the same period. India's foreign exchange reserves have increased by US$ 56.8 billion in 2020-21 so far (up to July 31) to US$ 534.6 billion  equivalent to 13.4 months of imports.6 Outlook 13. Supply chain disruptions on account of COVID-19 persist, with implications for both food and non-food prices. A more favourable food inflation outlook may emerge as the bumper rabi harvest eases prices of cereals, especially if open market sales and public distribution offtake are expanded on the back of significantly higher procurement. The relatively moderate increases in minimum support prices (MSP) for the kharif crops and monsoon are also supportive of benign inflation prospects. Nonetheless, upside risks to food prices remain. The abatement of price pressure in key vegetables is delayed and remains contingent upon normalisation of supplies. Protein based food items could also emerge as a pressure point, given the tight demand-supply balance in the case of pulses. The inflation outlook of non-food categories is, however, fraught with uncertainty. Higher domestic taxes on petroleum products have resulted in elevated domestic pump prices and will impart broad-based cost-push pressures going forward. Volatility in financial markets and rising asset prices also pose upside risks to the outlook. Taking into consideration all these factors, headline inflation may remain elevated in Q2:2020-21, but may moderate in H2:2020-21 aided by large favourable base effects. Turning to the growth outlook, the recovery in the rural economy is expected to be robust, buoyed by the progress in kharif sowing. Manufacturing firms responding to the Reserve Bank's industrial outlook survey expect domestic demand to recover gradually from Q2 and to sustain through Q1:2021-22. On the other hand, consumer confidence turned more pessimistic in July relative to the preceding round of the Reserve Bank's survey. External demand is expected to remain anaemic under the weight of the global recession and contraction in global trade. Taking into consideration the above factors, real GDP growth in Q2-Q4 is expected to evolve along the lines noted in the May resolution. For the year 2020-21, as a whole, real GDP growth is expected to be negative. An early containment of the COVID-19 pandemic may impart an upside to the outlook. A more protracted spread of the7 pandemic, deviations from the forecast of a normal monsoon and global financial market volatility are the key downside risks. The June release of headline inflation after a gap of two months and imputed prints of the CPI for April-May have added uncertainty to the inflation outlook. The NSO has adopted best practices in producing these imputations for the purpose of business continuity in the face of challenges to data collection due to the nation-wide lockdown. The NSO has, however, not provided inflation rates for April and May. For the purpose of monetary formulation and conduct, therefore, the MPC is of the view that CPI prints for April and May can be regarded as a break in the CPI series. The MPC noted that the economy is experiencing unprecedented stress in an austere global environment. Extreme uncertainty characterises the outlook, which is heavily contingent upon the intensity, spread and duration of the pandemic  particularly the heightened risks associated with a second wave of infections  and the discovery of the vaccine. In these conditions, supporting the recovery of the economy assumes primacy in the conduct of monetary policy. In pursuit of this objective, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative as long as it is necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy. While space for further monetary policy action in support of this stance is available, it is important to use it judiciously and opportunistically to maximise the beneficial effects for underlying economic activity. At the same time, the MPC is conscious that its primary mandate is to achieve the medium-term target for CPI inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent. It also recognises that the headline CPI prints of April-May, 2020 require more clarity. At the current juncture, the inflation objective itself is further obscured by (a) the spike in food prices because of floods in eastern India and ongoing lockdown related disruptions; and (b) cost-push pressures in the form of high taxes on petroleum products, hikes in telecom charges, rising raw material costs reflected in upward revisions in steel prices and rise in gold prices on safe haven demand. Given the uncertainty surrounding the8 inflation outlook and taking into consideration the extremely weak state of the economy in the midst of an unprecedented shock from the ongoing pandemic, it is prudent to pause and remain watchful of incoming data as to how the outlook unravels. Meanwhile, the cumulative reduction of 250 basis points since February 2019 is working its way through the economy, lowering interest rates in money, bond and credit markets, and narrowing down spreads. Financing conditions have eased considerably, enabling financial flows via financial markets, especially at a time when banks remain highly risk averse. Accordingly, the MPC decides to stay on hold with regard to the policy rate and remain watchful for a durable reduction in inflation to use the available space to support the revival of the economy. All members of the MPC  Dr.Chetan Ghate. Dr.Pami Dua. Dr. Ravindra H. Dholakia. Dr.Mridul K. Saggar. Dr.Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das  unanimously voted for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged and continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. The minutes of the MPC's meeting will be published by August 20, 2020."
Mongolia,2020-08-07,"MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Extending the maturity of consumer loans Number: 2020/04 Date: 7th of August 2020 The Monetary Policy Committee held an unscheduled meeting on 7th of August 2020. The Committee decided to prolong the implementation of restructuring and extending the maturity on consumer loans for lenders experiencing difficulties in their loan repayments due to the current economic circumstances by 31st of December 2020. This is a continuation of the decision made by the Committee on 13th of April 2020. Under this decision, lending contracts of around 76 thousand borrowers have been amended for issuance of consumer loans amounting to 663 billion MNT. This measure has been providing support to alleviate the extent of economic contraction by easing negative impact on household consumption and financial burden on borrowers related to the pandemic and ensuring stability of the banking system. Extracts of the meeting minutes will be released in two weeks on the Bank of Mongolia's official website. MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE."
Egypt,2020-08-13,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release August 13, 2020 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 925 percent, 1025 percent, and 975 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 975 percen. Annual headline urban inflation declined to 42 percent in July 2020 from 56 percent in June 2020, the lowest rate recorded since November 201. The decline was due to continued muted inflationary pressures and supported by favorable base effect. Monthly headline urban inflation recorded 04 percent in July 2020 compared to 18 percent in July 2019, which incorporated the impact of the implemented fiscal consolidation measures to reach cost recovery for fuel products in 201. July 2020 monthly headline urban inflation continued to reflect higher non-food prices and lower food prices for the third consecutive mont. In the meantime, annual core inflation declined to 07 percent in July 2020 from 10 percent in June 2020, the lowest rate on recor. Preliminary data show that real GDP growth for FY19/20 recorded 38 percent compared to 56 percent in the first half of the fiscal yea. This reflects the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and the accompanying containment measure. Nevertheless the contribution of the public sector to growth increased in 2020 Q1, particularly in the petroleum manufacturing sector, which supported economic activity during this perio. Meanwhile a number of leading indicators started showing signs of recovery in June and July 2020, in tandem with the easing of the containment measure. The unemployment rate recorded 92 percent in April 2020, compared to 77 and 80 percent in 2020 Q1 and 2019 Q4, respectivel. Globally economic activity remained weak despite some recovery associated with some ease of the COVID-19 related lock-down measures, which partly supported the recent increase of international oil price. Meanwhile global financial conditions continued to improve, supported mainly by policy measures despite the ongoing uncertaint. Annual headline inflation rate is expected to remain below the inflation target's mid-point of 90 percent on average during 2020 Q4. Yet with the ongoing high level of global uncertainty, and given the preemptive measures taken by the Central Bank of Egypt, including the reduction of 300 basis points during the unscheduled MPC meeting on March 16, 2020, the MPC decided to keep key policy rates unchange. The MPC closely monitors all economic developments and will not hesitate to utilize all available tools to support the recovery of economic activity, within its price stability mandat.

Mexico,2020-08-13,"Banco de Mexico's Governing Board decided to lower the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 50 basis points to 4.5%, effective August 14, 2020. Available information indicates that after having declined sharply in March and April, the global economy began to show a slight recovery in May and June. Multilateral organizations and analysts anticipate a strong contraction during this year and a moderate recovery for 2021. These forecasts, however, are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. In advanced economies headline and core inflation are below their central bank's targets. In this context, the monetary authorities have kept policy rates at historically low levels and have continued to use their balance sheets to foster an orderly functioning of financial markets. Likewise, several countries have announced additional fiscal stimulus to mitigate the adverse effects on employment and on households and firms' income. Since the last monetary policy decision, global financial markets continued to exhibit a positive behavior, reflecting the effects of the fiscal, monetary and financial stimuli measures adopted by the advanced economies and the gradual reopening of their productive activities, although the conditions prevailing before the pandemic have not been reached. In Mexico, the peso traded in a narrow range, with some episodes of volatility. Government bond yields decreased throughout the yield curve. Global and domestic financial conditions will continue to be subject mainly to the effects of the pandemic. Timely information indicates that economic activity in Mexico contracted significantly during the second quarter of the year as the negative effects of the pandemic intensified substantially. Various indicators point to a recovery in June from low levels of activity, in response to the reopening of some sectors, the loosening of restrictions to mobility, and a moderate recovery of external demand, although an environment of uncertainty prevails. For this reason, greater economic slack is expected within the time frame in which monetary policy operates and significant risks to the downside persist. Annual headline inflation rose from 3.33 to 3.62% between June and July 2020 due to increases in both its non-core and core components. This results from an increase in energy prices as well as a recomposition of core inflation, with a decrease in services inflation and merchandise inflation accelerating with high annual rates of change in food products. These adjustments are partly associated with the pandemic and led to an increase in headline inflation expectations for the end of 2020, while those for the medium and long terms have remained relatively stable, albeit at levels above the 3% target. The challenges for monetary policy posed by the pandemic include both the significant impact on economic activity as well as a financial shock and their effects on inflation. Although the recent increases in headline and core inflation affect their foreseen trajectories in the short term, both are expected to lay around 3% within the 12-24 month forecast horizon. It is worth noting that these forecasts are subject to considerable risks. To the downside: a greater than expected impact of the widening of the negative output gap; downward inflationary pressures worldwide; and social distancing measures reducing 1 the demand for certain services. To the upside: additional episodes of foreign exchange depreciation; a greater persistence of core inflation; and logistical and supply-related problems concerning certain goods and services, as well as cost-related pressures associated with the adoption of sanitary measures. In this context, the balance of risks for inflation remains uncertain. Taking into account the referred risks for inflation, economic activity and financial markets, major challenges arise for monetary policy and for the economy in general. Based on the foreseen scenarios, and considering the room for maneuvering that on balance these provide to monetary policy, with the presence of all its members, on this occasion. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board decided by majority to lower the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 50 basis points to a level of 4.5%. One member voted for lowering the target to 4.75%. Looking ahead, the available room for maneuver will depend on the evolution of the factors that have an incidence on the outlook for inflation and its expectations, including the effects that the pandemic might have on both factors. The Governing Board will take the necessary actions on the basis of incoming information and considering the large impact on productive activity as well as the evolution of the financial shock that we are currently facing, so that the policy rate is consistent with the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to Banco de Mexico's target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates. Perseverance in strengthening the macroeconomic fundamentals and adopting the necessary actions, regarding both monetary and fiscal policies, will contribute to a better adjustment of domestic financial markets and of the economy as a whole."
Peru,2020-08-13,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT AUGUST 2020 BCRP MAINTAINED REFERENCE RATE AT 0.25% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to continue its expansionary policy stance, maintaining the reference rate at 0.25 percent and implementing further liquidity injection operations, in light of the following developments: Inflation in 2020 and 2021 is expected to fall below the target range due to a significant weakening of domestic demand. One-year ahead expected inflation was 1.5 percent in July. Year-on-year inflation increased temporarily from 1.6 percent in June to 1.9 percent in July, while trend inflation remains in the lower part of the target range. Leading indicators point to a recovery in July relative to the previous month. Firms' growth expectations continued to recover in July, in line with gradual economic reopening, although they remain at historic lows. Risks to global economic activity materialized, including a global recession with a partial rebound in the second half of the year. The BCRP will continue to take the necessary steps to sustain the payments system and credit flows. As of August 12, the BCRP's liquidity injection operations totaled S/ 56.9 billion, of which S/ 36.4 billion were associated with government-backed repos. In this context, credit to the private sector grew 13.3 percent year-on-year in June and interest rates decreased significantly. In addition, phase two of the “Reactiva Peru” program continued in July, with 14 auction sessions totaling S/ 22.8 billion at an average interest rate of 1.64 percent. The Board considers it appropriate to maintain a strong expansionary monetary stance for as long as the negative effects of the pandemic on inflation and its determinants persist. The BCRP stands ready to extend monetary stimulus using a range of instruments. The Board also decided to maintain the following interest rates on its window facility operations in domestic currency with financial entities: Overnight deposits: 0.15 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 0.50 percent per year. The BCRP Board's next monetary policy session will take place on September 10, 2020."
Philippines,2020-08-19,"At its meeting on monetary policy today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) facility at 2.25 percent. The interest rates on the overnight deposit and lending facilities were likewise kept at 1.75 percent and 2.75 percent, respectively. The Monetary Board's decision was based on its assessment that the inflation environment remains benign. While latest baseline forecasts have risen slightly due to the higher-than-expected inflation in July and recent increases in global crude oil prices, the future inflation path remains firmly within the Government's 2-4 percent target. The balance of risks to the inflation outlook also leans toward the downside from 2020 until 2022 owing largely to potential disruptions to domestic and global economic activity amid the ongoing pandemic. Meanwhile, inflation expectations remain broadly consistent with the inflation target. The Monetary Board noted that the outlook for global economic growth remained subdued and uncertain amid a resurgence in COVID-19 cases in many jurisdictions. The MB also noted the sharp contraction in domestic output in the first half of 2020, reflecting the impact of the enforcement of necessary measures to contain the spread of the virus in the country. At the same time, the Monetary Board observed early signs of recovery in domestic economic activity with the gradual easing of lockdown restrictions, supported by ample liquidity in the financial system. Given these considerations, the Monetary Board is of the view that monetary policy settings remain appropriate for the time being. A prudent pause will enable the cumulative 175-basis-point reduction in the policy rate as well as other monetary and regulatory relief measures by the BSP to fully work their way through the economy, even as the National Government continues to implement interventions to bolster economic activity and protect human lives and livelihoods. Going forward, the BSP remains committed to deploying its full range of instruments as needed in fulfillment of its mandate to promote non-inflationary and sustainable growth over the medium term."
Turkiye,2020-08-20,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 8.25 percent. While global economic activity has shown signs of partial recovery in the third quarter following the normalization steps taken by several countries, uncertainties on global economic recovery remain high. Advanced and emerging economies continue to maintain expansionary monetary and fiscal stances. The pandemic disease is closely monitored for its evolving global impact on capital flows, financial conditions, international trade and commodity prices. Economic recovery, which started in May following gradual steps towards normalization, is gaining pace. Recent monetary and fiscal measures that aim to contain negative effects of the pandemic on the Turkish economy contributed to financial stability and economic recovery by supporting the potential output of the economy. While commercial loans have recently started to normalize, consumer loans have remained strong. The recent upturn in imports, which has resulted from deferred demand as well as pandemic-related liquidity and credit policies, is expected to moderate with the phasing out of these policy measures. Although tourism revenues declined due to the pandemic, easing of travel restrictions has started to contribute to a partial improvement. The recovery in exports of goods, relatively low levels of commodity prices and the level of the real exchange rate will support the current account balance in the upcoming periods. Along with the pandemic-related rise in unit costs, exchange rate and credit developments restrain the demand-side disinflationary effects, and the trends of core inflation indicators have increased. As the normalization process continues, supply-side factors, which have prevailed recently due to pandemic-related restrictions, will phase out. The gradual normalization of pandemic-specific financial measures and recent tightening steps taken in liquidity management are judged to support macrofinancial stability. However, depending on the course of the pandemic, uncertainties regarding domestic and external demand conditions remain significant. Accordingly, the Committee decided to keep the policy rate unchanged, while continuing with liquidity measures. The Committee assesses that maintaining a sustained disinflation process is a key factor for achieving lower sovereign risk, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery. Keeping the disinflation process in track with the targeted path requires the continuation of a cautious monetary stance. In this respect, monetary stance will be determined by considering the indicators of the underlying inflation trend to ensure the continuation of the disinflation process. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability and financial stability objectives. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Israel,2020-08-24,"The second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic continues to leave its mark on the economy, and there is a two-way feedback loop between the economic business cycle and the morbidity cycle. According to the National Accounts data, second quarter GDP was approximately 11 percent lower than what would have been expected without the crisis. The main negative impact has been on domestic activity: private consumption and investment: as thenegative impact on exports has been more moderate, while a mitigating factor was the increase in public consumption. Real time indicators of activity show that after the relatively rapid recovery of economic activity in June, the pace of recovery has slowed in July and August. Labor market weakness continued, with the 'broad unemployment rate' at 12 percent. The Research Department's staff forecast describes 2 possible scenarios. In the relatively optimistic scenario, in which control of the spread of the virus is maintained. GDP is expected to contract by 4.5 percent in 2020 and to grow by 6 percent in 2021. In the more severe scenario, in which there is only partial control of the pandemic, accompanied by a further deterioration in the global situation, negative growth of 7 percent is expected in 2020 and growth of only 3 percent in 2021. The debt to GDP ratio in 2021 is expected to be 78 percent in the optimistic scenario and 87 percent under the pessimistic scenario. The global economy contracted sharply in the second quarter of the year. Forecasts by investment houses expect positive growth in the second half of the year, but for the full year of 2020 a marked contraction in GDP is expected in most economies. The removalof closures and reduction in social distancing enacted in many countries led to partial economic recovery. Central banks in advanced economies continue to implement the special monetary measures they announced in response to the crisis. Financial markets remain stable. An improvement is apparent in the credit market's functioning, with stability in interest rates, supported by the Bank of Israel's measures andthe government-guaranteed credit funds. Government bond yields remain low, and Bank of Israel activity in the corporate bond market contributed to a notable decline in spreads. The equity market rose. Since the previous interest rate decision, the shekel weakened by 0.6 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, against the background of depreciation against the euro, but strengthened by 1.1 percent against the dollar. The exchange rateis weighing on the recovery of exports, particularly in view of the decline in global demand, and on the return of the inflation to the target. The inflation environment remained low. The inflation rate in the past 12 months was -0.6 percent. Inflation expectations for the coming year, from all sources, remained below the lower bound of the target range, while forward expectations of inflation at the end of the second year are slightly below the lower bound of the target range, and longer-term expectations are anchored within the target range. In view of the magnitude of the crisis's adverse impact on economic activity, the Committee continues to implement a range of tools in order to increase the extent of the monetary policy accommodation and to ensure the continued orderly functioning of the financial markets. The Committee will expand theuse of the existing tools, including the interest rate tool, and will operate additional ones, to the extent that it assesses that the crisis is lengthening and that it is necessary in order to achieve the monetary policy goals and to moderate the negative economic impact created as a result of the crisis. For the file of figures accompanying this notice, click here. An increase in economic activity causes an increase in morbidity, which in turn leads to social distancing measures, which lower the rate of morbidity and allow a gradual return of economic activity, in a cycle that repeats itself. Economic activity remains moderated, and an analysis of developments shows that the impact of the crisis on demand in the economy is more severe than its impact on supply. According to the first estimate of National Accounts data for the second quarter of 2020 (Figure 1 in the attached data file). GDP contracted by 28.7 percent (in annual terms), and its level is about 11 percent lower than what would have been expected without the crisis. The main adverse impact is on domestic activity: private consumption and investment, particularly investment in residential construction: while the impact on exports is slightly more moderate. There was an increase in public consumption, in view of the response of government policy to the crisis. An analysis of the real time indicatorsof activity shows that after the relatively rapid recovery in June, there was a slowing in the pace of recovery in July and August. The level of credit card purchases in July was lower than the baseline based on data from previous years, but since the beginning of August, there has been an increase in purchases, and as of mid-August, the level is higher than the baseline level (Figure 3). Of particular note have been the increases in credit card expenditure in the restaurant industry and the education and leisure services industry, which until recent weeks had typically been stable at low activity levels, while tourism remains very low. The indices of mobility to workplaces moderated in July to about 20-30 percent below their pre-crisis level, but at the beginning of August, there was an increase in mobility to places of retail and recreation, and leisure (Figure 4). The findings of the most recent real-time survey conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics, at the beginning of July, show a worsening of the adverse impact to business revenue and the share of workers who are employed (Figures 8-9). Uncertainty regarding the ways to deal with the health situation, as well as uncertainty regarding the date on which the budget for 2021 will be approved are liable to have a negative impact on continued economic recovery. Despite the difficulty in precisely assessing the state of the labor market in view of the variance in data from various sources, all the data still indicate significant weakness. According to data published by the Central Bureau of Statistics Labor Force Survey, the 'broad unemployment rate', which includes the unemployed, those temporarily absent from work for reasons related to the Covid-19 crisis, and those dismissed from their positions between March and July who are not looking for work, is about 12 percent (for those aged 15 and above). The Research Department updated its macroeconomic forecast, to reflect two possible scenarios. In the relatively optimistic scenario, in which there is control over the pandemic. GDP is expected to contract by 4.5 percent in 2020, and the 'broad unemployment rate' is forecast to be 11.5 percent. In comparison, in a more severe scenario where only partial control of the pandemic is achieved and there is a further worsening of the situation globally, the forecast expects a contraction of 7 percent and an unemployment rate of 13.6 percent. In the first scenario. GDP is expected to grow by 6 percent in 2021, compared with 3 percent in the more serious scenario. Under the optimistic scenario, the deficit is expected to be 13.2 percent in 2020 and 8.2 percent in 2021, and the debt to GDP ratio is expected to be 75 percent in 2020 and 78 percent in 2021. In the pessimistic scenario, the deficit is expected to be 14.6 percent in 2020 and 12 percent in 2021, and the debt to GDP ratio is expected to be 78 percent in 2020 and 87 percent in 2021. The CPI for June declined by 0.1 percent, while the CPI for July increased by 0.2 percent. Inflation over the past 12 months was -0.6 percent, compared with -1.6 percent in the previous month (Figure 11). The increase in fuel prices made a significant contribution to the increase in annual inflation, by reducing the negative contribution of the energy component in the CPI. The CPI excluding energy, fruit and vegetables showed an inflation rate of -0.4 percent, similar to the level in the previous two months (Figure 12). An analysis by the Research Department shows that adjusting the household consumption basket to reflect changes in consumption patterns due to the crisis results in annual inflation being only about 0.2 percent higher than the official inflation rate. Inflation expectations for the coming year, from all sources, remained below the lower bound of the target range. In the coming months, the annual inflation rate is expected to remain negative. Medium-term forward inflation expectations have increased, such that inflation expectations at the end of the second year are slightly below the lower bound of the inflation target, and longer-term expectations are anchored within the target range. The exchange rate is weighing on the recovery of exports, particularly in view of the decline in global demand, and on the return of the inflationto the target. An improvement is apparent in the credit market's functioning, with stability in interest rates, supported by Bank of Israel measures and the government-guaranteed credit funds (Figures 22-23). Government bond yields remain low, and Bank of Israel intervention in the corporate bond market, which began in July, contributed to a notable decline in spreads on the main Tel Bond indices (Figures 18-19). The equity market was characterized by price increases in line with the global trend. The pace of increase in home and rental prices moderated. Home prices increased in May-June by 0.4 percent following a decline of 0.8 percent in April-May, and the annual rate of increase moderated markedly, froman annual rate of more than 3 percent in the months prior to March-April to an annual rate of 1.9 percent. The increase in rental prices also moderated to 1.2 percent. The global economy contracted sharply in the second quarter of the year, as a result of the pandemic and social distancing measures. Investment houses expect positive growth in the second half of the year, but it will be weaker than the contraction that has taken place, and will provide only a 'partial correction' to the data from the first half of theyear, so that, other than China. GDP is expected to contract significantly in all of the major economies in 2020 (Figure 24). The removal of closures and reductionin social distancing enacted in many countries led to some recovery, but the economy is far from having returned to its pre-crisis activity levels. Evidence of some improvement in the state of the world economy can be found in the global Purchasing Managers Index, which returned in July to the range reflecting growth at a rate similar to the long-term pace (Figure 26). The global inflation environment remained low and far from the central banks' target rates. In particular, oil prices are significantly lower than they were a year ago (Figure 28), but core inflation in the main economies is also low. The global monetary environment remains very accommodative. Central banks in the advanced economies continue to implement the special measures announced in view of the crisis, and some of the central banks in emerging economies, where the monetary interest rate is high, are continuing to lower their interest rates. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on September 9, 2020. The next decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Thursday. October 22, 2020, and will be followed by a press briefing with the Governor."
Hungary,2020-08-25,"At its meeting on 25 August 2020, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 26 August 2020:. In the current extraordinary economic environment, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank's (MNB) mandate is still to achieve and maintain price stability, to preserve financial stability, as well as to support the Government's economic policy. Macroeconomic and financial developments continue to be mostly driven by the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. The coronavirus pandemic hit the global economy in a weakened state. In most of the developed countries, real economic performance declined substantially in the second quarter. Economic activity entered a new phase of gradual recovery from June; however, several countries' infection curve started to rise again. The second wave of the pandemic will cause an increase in risks. There remains an exceptionally large degree of uncertainty in judging the time profile of the health emergency and the speed of the global economic recovery. In the past month, sentiment in global financial markets has been volatile: the dollar exchange rate has depreciated, while long-term yields in developed countries have mostly risen. The Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank have continued their liquidity-providing and asset purchase programmes in the recent period. In our region, the Romanian central bank reduced policy rates, while decision-makers at the Czech and the Polish central banks left them at close to zero. The coronavirus pandemic hit the Hungarian economy when its fundamentals were stable and growth was strong. The economic policy pursued over the past decade has maintained the country's macroeconomic balance and reduced its external and internal vulnerability. Hungary's health defence against the first wave of the coronavirus has been successful. As a result of the economic shutdown, production in most sectors of the national economy declined. Consequently. Hungarian GDP fell by 13.6 percent year-on-year in the second quarter of 2020. Due to the weaker-than-expected GDP data, a revision of the economic outlook for this year has become necessary, which will be made in the projection of the September Inflation Report. Successful health defence continues to provide an appropriate foundation for the economic recovery. This year's macroeconomic data are expected to show significant volatility and dichotomy. The effects of the pandemic were the strongest in data for the second quarter. The recovery started in May following the trough in April. The significant improvement in economic activity was reflected mostly in the June data. A pick-up in public investment and an expansion in corporate lending are required for a ‘V' shape economic recovery in the second half of the year. In line with the expected slower recovery in the external environment, production in export-oriented industrial sectors may pick up only towards the end of the year. In July 2020, inflation stood at 3.8 percent and core inflation excluding indirect tax effects was 4.1 percent. In the period when the economy was restarted, a faster rise in prices was mainly caused by changes in the structure of aggregate supply and demand. In specific sub-markets demand was soaring, while the recovery of disrupted supply caused by the pandemic situation was slow in others. The effects of the changes in indirect taxes contributed to the rise in inflation by a further 0.4 percentage points. Changes in fuel and food prices increased the volatility of inflation while statistical factors constitute unusually stronger measurement uncertainty. The consumer price index is expected to remain around its current level in the coming months, before inflation stabilises at close to the central bank target of 3 percent as economic activity is brought back to normal. Disinflationary effects of the coronavirus pandemic become even stronger over the forecast horizon. Deteriorating economic activity due to the pandemic is likely to reduce core inflation excluding indirect tax effects through several channels. In addition to a weaker external inflation environment, more muted domestic demand compared to previous years is also increasingly restraining underlying inflation. The Monetary Council monitors closely the persistent inflationary effects as the economy recovers. As a result of the rising cost of protective economic measures and the reduction of the tax base, the budget deficit in the first half of the year stood at 5.9 percent of GDP in the first half. The government debt ratio has risen to 71.9 percent of GDP due to a decline in GDP and a higher financing requirement. After the significant rise in government debt, in parallel with the recovery of the economy, the ratio is expected to return to a downward path from 2021. The current account balance is expected to show a moderate deficit this year as well, but net lending remains persistently positive. Hungary's external debt-to-GDP ratios are expected to decline further. In a more favourable sentiment in financial markets the forint appreciated against the euro for most of the period, together with other currencies in the region. After the previous interest rate decision in July, long-term yields and yield spreads declined; however, in recent weeks the effect of the rise in global yields also appeared in domestic yield developments. Decisions of the Monetary Council in spring months helped to stabilise domestic money market developments while liquidity with favourable conditions, available to all economic agents, supports the recovery of economic growth. The Bond Funding for Growth Scheme (BGS) and the Funding for Growth Scheme Go! (FGS Go!) ensure access for the domestic corporate sector to sustainable, stable and long-term funding and help the credit market and investment growth to pick up. The MNB extended the range of potential uses of funds granted under the FGS Go! in early July to allow SMEs to have wider access to funds with favourable conditions under the Scheme and thereby to stimulate the economy. By launching its government securities purchases programme in April 2020, the MNB successfully managed to stabilise developments in the government securities market and to reduce yields. After a temporary break, the MNB made targeted government securities purchases again in the segment of over 15-year maturities from July 2020 to ensure that the base rate cut has its effects on the longer segment of the yield curve as well. The Monetary Council intends to use the government securities purchase programme to the extent and for the time necessary. The global deterioration in recent weeks in the pandemic situation raises external risks, while expenditures related to economic defence result in a higher government financing requirement. To maintain the effectiveness of monetary transmission and the stable liquidity position of the government securities market, the Monetary Council deems it necessary to increase the amount of weekly government securities purchases, in addition to keeping the long-term collateralised lending facility. The Bank will continue to make purchases in the long segment to support an extension in the maturity structure of government debt. At its meeting today, the Monetary Council left the base rate and the overnight deposit rate unchanged at 0.60 percent and -0.05 percent, respectively, and the overnight and the one-week collateralised lending rates at 1.85 percent. The MNB will continue to set the one-week deposit rate at the weekly tenders. In the Monetary Council's assessment, the 0.60 percent base rate supports price stability, the preservation of financial stability and the recovery of economic growth in a sustainable manner. In the current rapidly changing environment, it is key to maintain short-term yields at a safe distance from a range close to zero. The Council continuously assesses incoming data and changes in the outlook for inflation. In the event of a persistent deterioration in the outlook for growth, the Bank will deliver the required additional economic stimulus using its targeted instruments, i.e. the Funding for Growth Scheme Go! and the Bond Funding for Growth Scheme, providing the most direct support to investment."
South Korea,2020-08-27,"The bank of korea. The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 0.50% for the intermeeting period. Currently available information suggests that the global economy has continued to rebound from the severe contraction, but the pace of recovery has somewhat slowed due to the ongoing spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19). In global financial markets, stock prices in major countries have risen amid continuing hopes for economic recovery, while the US dollar has weakened and government bond yields have moved up slightly. Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the evolution of the pandemic, as well as by the effects of national policy responses. Economic growth in Korea has remained sluggish. Although the decline in exports has moderated a bit, the improvement in private consumption has weakened. The recovery in facilities investment has been subdued, and the correction in construction investment has continued. Labor market conditions have remained weak, with the number of persons employed continuing to decline sharply. Looking forward, the recovery of domestic economic growth is likely to be slower than previously forecast, largely due to the domestic resurgence of COVID-19. In the Board's central projection. GDP growth falls to slightly below -1% this year, considerably lower than the May forecast of -0.2%. Uncertainties around the future path of GDP growth are also judged to be very high. Consumer price inflation has risen to the lower-0% level, due to a larger increase in the prices of agricultural, livestock, and fisheries products and to a reduced decline in petroleum product prices. Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) has also increased to the mid-0% level, and the inflation expectations of the general public have risen to the upper-1% range. It is forecast that consumer price inflation and core inflation will run at the mid-0% level this year, reflecting prolonged effects from the drop in global oil prices and weak demand-side inflationary pressures. Domestic financial markets have been generally stable owing to decreased volatility in global financial markets. The Korean won to US dollar exchange rate has fallen, while long-term market interest rates have fluctuated within a narrow range. Stock prices rose sharply but then reversed some of the earlier gains, mainly due to concerns about the coronavirus resurgence since mid-August. The rate of household loan growth has risen, and housing prices have continued to increase in all parts of the country. The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to support the economy and stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As economic growth is expected to be sluggish and inflationary pressures on the demand side are forecast to remain weak due to the COVID19 pandemic, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance. In this process it will thoroughly assess the severity of the coronavirus resurgence and its impact on the economy and financial markets, changes in financial stability, and the effects of the policy measures taken in response to the pandemic."
Colombia,2020-08-31,"Vimeo live broadcast (Only in Spanish). Other measures taken by BR on account of COVID-19. The monetary policy risk balance suggests that it is appropriate to provide an additional boost to the economy. The Board of Directors of the Central Bank of Colombia (BDBR) unanimously reduced the benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point to 2.0%. For this decision, the Board mainly took into account the following elements. Inflation in July stood at 1.97%, and the average of core inflation indicators at 1.76%. Inflation expectations for the end of 2021 from surveys stand at 2.87%, while two-year expectations from public debt instruments are at 1.56%. The growth figure for the second quarter confirms a weak aggregate demand and spare capacity. The data for June reiterate the deterioration of the labor market and the reduction of labor income. Financial market conditions have improved vis--vis the onset of the crisis, and the high liquidity of international and domestic markets has resulted in lower sovereign risk premia and adequate access to external financing. Additionally, the current account deficit has adjusted and is expected to continue doing so throughout the year, reflecting lower external financing needs. Under these conditions, the monetary policy risk balance suggests that it is appropriate to provide an additional boost to the economy. The impact of monetary policy will be greater inasmuch as the conditions of the pandemic allow to continue reopening the different economic sectors gradually.

Chile,2020-09-01,"Tuesday, 1 September 2020 Monetary Policy Meeting  September 2020 At its Monetary Policy Meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 0.50%. It also decided to maintain the unconventional measures to lend support to liquidity and credit. The decisions were adopted by the unanimous vote of all the Board members. In the external scenario, incoming data confirm a recovery in global activity after the lows of April and May, in a context where the sanitary response to the pandemic has improved in several countries, with more tests applied and reduced mortality observed. Despite new outbreaks in some places, measures reinstated are not as restrictive as they were at the beginning of the pandemic. Although they are below their pre-pandemic levels, production, sales, foreign trade flows and expectations are all improving in several economies. The upturn in services, however, has been more limited. Strong monetary and fiscal stimulus measures have been maintained, as has volatility in the financial markets, contributing to the improvement of commodity prices. In recent days the copper price has exceeded US$3, supported mainly by China's investment reactivation in line with a fiscal impulse. On the domestic front, the Imacecs of June and July show that the economy has begun to stabilize, after accumulating falls between March and May, although with activity levels well below those a year before. Some sectors are seeing a recovery, such as retail and manufacturing, while others remain severely affected, particularly those where face-to- face work and human interaction are essential. The evolution of the economy has been influenced by the gradual withdrawal of sanitary control measures, a faster adaptation to changed operating conditions in several businesses, an increase in credit to enterprises and the boost from various measures to provide support to personal income. The latter [INF*RES*AS] have resulted in a reduction in the pessimism observed in business and consumer expectation indicators, and in a rebound of imports of consumer and capital goods. Overall, the sharp deterioration in the labor market continues to stand out, with across- the-board drops in employment, labor income, hours worked and variable labor compensation. Local financial markets essentially followed the external movements. The increase in volatility—observed during the last stages of the Congress discussion on the bill about the withdrawal of part of pension savings—was reversed, with the exception of the stock market indicators, due to the measures adopted by the Central Bank, the decisions of the regulators and the portfolio management of the Pension Funds. With respect to credit, commercial loans have maintained a counter-cyclical behavior, with increases of more than 10% annually in real terms. In contrast, consumer loans have continued to decline. Commercial credit growth has been supported by the high liquidity provided by the Bank through FCIC1-LCL and FCIC2, state guarantees and regulatory changes. Credit market interest rates show no significant changes. In July, headline and core inflation stood at 2.5% annually, similar as in previous months. In the immediate future, inflation will decrease by slightly less than projected because of the temporary effect of income-support measures on consumption. Medium-term, pressures remain low. For one year's time, the Economic Expectations Survey shows inflation expectations that remain at 2.5% while the Financial Brokers Survey places them at 2.3%. Two years ahead, both surveys place them at 3%. The Board reiterates that it will maintain a strong monetary stimulus for an extended period of time to ensure that its objectives are achieved. In particular, it expects the MPR to remain at its minimum level over much of the two-year monetary policy horizon and will maintain the unconventional measures now in place. In particular, it will proceed with the asset purchase program defined in June, reactivating its bank bond component at market prices, at a pace to be announced shortly. In addition, should economic developments so require, it will continue to explore options to adjust the stimulus and sustain financial stability. The September Monetary Policy Report containing the projections and analyses on which the Board's decisions are based will be published tomorrow Wednesday 2 September at 8:30 hours. The minutes from this Monetary Policy Meeting will be published at 8:30 hours of Wednesday 16 September 2020. The next Monetary Policy Meeting will take place on Wednesday 14 and Thursday 15 October and the statement thereof will be released at 18:00 hours of the second meeting day. _ [INF*RES*AS] * The Spanish original prevails."
Ukraine,2020-09-03,"The NBU Board has decided to keep its key policy rate at 6% per annum. Maintaining a loose monetary policy will support economic recovery amid moderate inflation and elevated uncertainty over how the pandemic is going to spread in Ukraine and the world. In JulyAugust, inflation was below the target range of 5% ± 1 pp. The dynamics of core inflation were subdued. The revival in consumer demand and the rise in fuel and natural gas prices in line with global market trends were offset by seasonal adjustments in raw food prices. Future movements in inflation will depend on how fast the economy recovers. Data on imports, the retail trade, and household expenditures on domestic tourism, real estate, and cars indicate a further recovery in consumer demand, which is likely to continue in the coming months. The NBU's monetary policy easing cycle and the government's fiscal stimulus, including changes in social standards, will support this trend. At the same time, energy prices will continue to increase as the global economy gradually recovers from the coronavirus crisis. The statistical effect of the low comparison base formed in the final months of last year will make a significant contribution to the overall rate of inflation. All of this paves the way for inflation to enter the target range by the end of the year. The primary assumption behind the NBU Board's decisions remains that Ukraine will continue to cooperate with the IMF. This cooperation is important not only in terms of financing the state budget deficit, but also from the perspective of receiving support from other international partners and investors. Funds from these sources will go to finance anti-coronavirus measures and infrastructure projects, which will help jump-start the still weak investment activity. As before, a longer-lasting coronavirus pandemic, the further spread of the disease and stricter quarantine measures remain the key risks to macrofinancial stability. The increase in the number of coronavirus cases in Ukraine seen in recent months has not affected the pace of economic recovery. Nevertheless, a new wave of COVID-19 could restrain consumer demand and slow the recovery in domestic-market-oriented sectors, especially the services sector. Other risks also remain significant. the negative impact of certain court rulings on macrofinancial stabilityan escalation of the military conflict in eastern Ukraine or on the country's bordersthe higher volatility of global food prices, driven by global climate change and the risk of stronger protectionist measures.Given the above balance of risks and the steady trend towards a recovery in consumer demand, the NBU Board kept the key policy rate unchanged, at 6%. The fact that the key policy rate is being kept below its neutral level shows that monetary policy is expansionary. The policy also leaves enough room for further interest rate cuts in the economy. Previous key policy rate cuts are continuing to be transmitted to market rates. More specifically, interest rates on hryvnia domestic government debt securities and hryvnia deposits are at record lows. Loan rates are also continuing to fall. The NBU has also intensified its regulatory activities in order to promote lending, as well as activities aimed at reducing the share of nonperforming loans in the banking system. This will bolster the downward trend in interest rates on corporate and household loans. The NBU's future monetary policy will mainly depend on how the COVID-19 pandemic develops. Under current circumstances, the key policy rate of 6% is aimed at keeping the balance between maintaining moderate inflation and stimulating the economy. However, if the adverse impact of the coronavirus pandemic on domestic demand and business activity increases, the NBU will be ready to give the economy additional impetus for growth. Conversely, the NBU could also deploy monetary policy tools to respond to the likely increase in inflation risks in 2021. The decision to keep the key policy rate at 6% was approved by NBU Board Decision No. 559-D on the key policy rate, dated 3 September 2020. A summary of the discussion by Monetary Policy Committee members that preceded the approval of this decision will be published on 14 September 2020. The next monetary policy meeting of the NBU Board will be held on 22 October 2020, according to the confirmed and published schedule."
Kazakhstan,2020-09-07,"38 The base rate remains unchanged at 9.00% September 7, 2020 Nur-Sultan The National Bank of Kazakhstan has made a decision to maintain the base rate at 9.00% per annum with the interest rate corridor of +/- 1.5 percentage points. Consequently, the rate for the liquidity provision standing facilities will be 10.50% and for the liquidity withdrawal standing facilities  7.50%. The decision was made taking into account the balance of inflation risks in the short and medium term. Pro-inflationary risks are expressed in weakly anchored inflationary expectations, in increased volatility in financial markets amid growing sanctions rhetoric against Russia, expectations of a slower recovery in oil demand and the risk of further stimulating economic activity with fiscal and quasi-fiscal measures. At the same time, the impact of disinflationary factors related to the reduction in economic activity, a slowdown in consumer demand and the expected decline in prices for food products in world markets is observed. The current level of the base rate will allow maintaining control over the dynamics of inflationary processes and ensuring a smooth deceleration of annual inflation in the medium term. The annual inflation gets formed in accordance with the estimates. In August, 2020 it amounted to 7.0% in the annual term. The main contribution to the acceleration of inflation was made by the increased prices of the food goods (10.9%). The dynamics of nonfood inflation (5.5%) and inflation of paid services (3.4%) remained relatively stable. The main premise for the acceleration of food inflation was the inertial rise in prices for most food products, including meat, bakery products, fish and seafood, fruits. The annual decline in sugar prices continues to have a moderating effect on food inflation. The re-introduction of quarantine measures led to a smooth dynamics of non-food inflation. The exchange rate depreciation pass-through was offset by suppressed consumer demand for nonfood products and a slowdown in gasoline price growth and an annual decline in diesel prices. The effect of a temporary reduction in utility tariffs was exhausted in the 2nd quarter of 2020, however, this factor was partially offset by a decrease in demand for services due to the quarantine measures. In general, the actual dynamics of annual inflation at the end of August 2020 is in line with the forecast estimates. By the end of the year, the annual inflation is expected to accelerate to 8.0%, closer to the lower limit of the previous forecast of 8.0-8.5%. Inflationary processes will accelerate due to continued high growth in food prices and a slight increase in inflation of paid services. At the same time, the weak dynamics of real incomes of the households and the expected decline in prices for world food products will limit the growth of inflation in 2020. In 2021, inflation will gradually slow down to the upper limit of the target band of 4-6% at the end of the year. The slowdown in inflationary processes will occur due to the high inflation base in 2020 and weak external inflationary pressures. An additional disinflationary effect will be exerted by the normalization of the rise in prices for food products. At the same time, the decline in inflation will be restrained by the additional allocation of a targeted transfer from the national fund of the Republic of Kazakhstan in the amount of 1 trillion tenge in 2021. Inflationary expectations remain high and weakly anchored. The quantitative estimate of inflation for the year ahead was 6.9% (July  6.6%). The share of respondents expecting continued or accelerated price growth over the past 12 months remains at maximum values (in August  65%, in July  64%, in the first quarter - 44%). A rapid rise in prices for food products was noted by 88% of respondents (in June - 89%, in July - 83%), for nonfood products - 7% (in July - 10%). In the structure of paid services for the population, respondents noted an increase in tariffs for housing and utilities, as well as an increase in the cost of domestic services (hairdressing, ateliers). At the end of the seventh month of 2020. Kazakhstan's GDP decreased by 2.9% in annual terms. Strengthening of the decline in economic activity was due to the downturn in the services sector, particularly in trade and transport. In addition, a slowdown in the goods manufacturing sector was due to the decline in the mining industry. The positive contribution to the GDP dynamics was made by the information and communication in light of continuation of distance work and online learning. The growth of the industry in seven months of 2020 amounted to 8.7%. The growth in services of mobile communication (2.2%). Internet networks (13.2%) and services for data transmission via telecommunication networks (18.4%) is observed. Gross agricultural output increased by 2.5% in January-July 2020, due to an increase in livestock production by 2.6% and crop production - by 2.1%. The National Bank worsened its expectations for economic growth in 2020, considering a deeper decline in economic activity in the second quarter of 2020, as well as the introduction of a lockdown in July 2020. According to the updated forecasts of the National Bank, in 2020 Kazakhstan's GDP will decrease by 2.0% -2.3%. In 2021, in conditions of a low base of 2020 and an improvement in the epidemiological situation, economic growth will recover to 3.5-3.8%. It will be contributed by a gradual recovery in external demand, the realization of deferred investment projects, a positive fiscal impulse, an improvement in the labor market and a revival in consumer demand. The decline in consumer and investment activity puts pressure on aggregate demand. The introduced quarantine measures had a negative impact on the income of the households, affecting the decrease in consumer activity. The main factor was the slowdown in the growth of real wages of employees. In addition, the closure and suspension of activities of certain industries led to a deterioration in the situation in the labor market. Fixed capital investment is declining. In July 2020, the reduction in investment activity turned out to be deeper, the annual decline was 16%. The main contribution to the negative dynamics of investment activity from the beginning of the year continues to be made by a decline in investment in the mining industry by 17.2%, due to the suspension of construction work at the Tengiz oil field. The negative dynamics of investments in trade (44%), transport (5%), construction (47.1%) and professional scientific and technical activities (47.9%) persists. In other industries of the real sector and in the government sector, the growth of investments in fixed assets is observed. The situation in the external sector remains uncertain. The preservation of the lockdown regime in many countries of the world as part of the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant reduction of economic activity in both developed and developing countries. According to the World Trade Organization, the global trade declined by 18.5% in annual terms in the second quarter of 2020. However, the reduction in international trade is slowing down as evidenced by a slight improvement in the dynamics of leading indicators of new export orders in industry. The outlook for the development of the world economy are still associated with high uncertainty due to the beginning of the second wave of COVID-19 in some countries. In addition, the growth of volatility in the world financial markets is not excluded taking into account the turbulence expected by investors associated with the upcoming presidential elections in the United States. At the same time, international organizations believe that the largest recession in the global economy took place in the 2 second quarter of 2020, that will be followed by a reversal, and in 2021 the growth rate of the global economy will turn upward. The estimates for the growth prospects of the trading partners of Kazakhstan in 2020 are revised downward. According to Consensus Economics' expectations, the Russian economy in 2020 will contract by 5.1% as the result of longer duration of the restrictions than previously expected. Due to the deterioration of the situation with consumer demand amid the coronavirus pandemic, the EU economy is expected to contract by 7.8% in 2020. Forecasts for the growth of China's economy for 2020 increased to 2.1% in light of improving indicators of the real sector. The Russian ruble is under the influence of geopolitical risks. The risks of new sanctions have risen, which is reflected in the increased volatility of the ruble. The new package of sanctions by the United States and a number of European countries, affecting the national debt and foreign exchange transactions of the largest Russian exporters, may have negative consequences for Russia. Nonetheless, balanced monetary and fiscal policies restrain significant ruble depreciation, reflecting the adaptive nature of the economy. The situation in the world oil market has improved with the remaining uncertainties. The decrease in the world oil production was observed, which is explained by the actions of the OPEC+ participants in the framework of the oil reduction agreement and weaker oil production in the United States and Canada. Taking into account the opening of economies after the lockdown, the dynamics of world oil consumption improved. The growth in oil consumption was recorded in most of the large importing countries. By the end of 2020 and in 2021, oil demand is expected to grow further. Consequently, this may lead to a reduction in accumulated reserves by the end of 2020 and a shortage in the oil market from the first quarter of 2021. The negative factors for oil remain the risks of a larger second wave of coronavirus, which may lead to a slower recovery in demand and the formation of a surplus of oil on the market. This is also the evidence of the state of the labor market in the United States, where, despite the recovery, the unemployment rate remains high (8.4% in August 2020). There are also concerns about the excess of oil production in Iraq. The country will not be able to fulfill the obligations associated with the OPEC+ agreement due to its difficult financial situation. In recent days, the price for Brent oil has decreased by 5% to $42.2 per barrel due to increased OPEC+ production and a possible decline in demand from China. Saudi Arabia's pricing policy for discounts sets the tone for other oil-producing OPEC states, thereby creating additional pressure to lower oil prices. External inflation rose slightly, remaining at a low level. Inflation in the EU amounted to 0.8% in July. The annual price increase in China in July was 2.7%, being below the target. In Russia inflation was around 3.4% in July. External monetary conditions remain stimulating. The Federal Reserve System revised its monetary policy strategy, signaling about a prolonged period of low rates. At the same time, it is worth to mention the statement of the Chairman of the Central Bank of Russia, according to which, as disinflationary risks are exhausted, a return to a neutral monetary policy in the medium term is inevitable. The National Bank will continue to monitor internal and external factors that affect the dynamics of inflation. Further decisions on the base rate will be made taking into account the compliance of the actual inflation dynamics with its forecast, as well as the balance of internal and external risks. The next planned decision of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan about the base rate will be announced on October 26, 2020 at 15:00 Nur-Sultan time. 3 More information for mass media representatives is available at: T: +7 (717) 2 775 205 e-mail: press@nationalbank.kz 4."
Euroarea,2020-09-10,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Executive Vice-President. Mr Dombrovskis. The incoming data since our last monetary policy meeting in July suggest a strong rebound in activity broadly in line with previous expectations, although the level of activity remains well below the levels prevailing before the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. While activity in the manufacturing sector has continued to improve, momentum in the services sector has slowed somewhat recently. The strength of the recovery remains surrounded by significant uncertainty, as it continues to be highly dependent on the future evolution of the pandemic and the success of containment policies. Euro area domestic demand has recorded a significant recovery from low levels, although elevated uncertainty about the economic outlook continues to weigh on consumer spending and business investment. Headline inflation is being dampened by low energy prices and weak price pressures in the context of subdued demand and significant labour market slack. Against this background, ample monetary stimulus remains necessary to support the economic recovery and to safeguard medium-term price stability. Therefore, we decided to reconfirm our accommodative monetary policy stance. We expect them to remain at their present or lower levels until we have seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within our projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics. We will continue our purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) with a total envelope of €1,350 billion. These purchases contribute to easing the overall monetary policy stance, thereby helping to offset the downward impact of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation. The purchases will continue to be conducted in a flexible manner over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions. This allows us to effectively stave off risks to the smooth transmission of monetary policy. We will conduct net asset purchases under the PEPP until at least the end of June 2021 and, in any case, until the Governing Council judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over. We will reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2022. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance. Net purchases under our asset purchase programme (APP) will continue at a monthly pace of €20 billion, together with the purchases under the additional €120 billion temporary envelope until the end of the year. We continue to expect monthly net asset purchases under the APP to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of our policy rates, and to end shortly before we start raising the key ECB interest rates. We intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. We will also continue to provide ample liquidity through our refinancing operations. In particular, the latest operation in the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO has registered a very high take-up of funds, supporting bank lending to firms and households. The monetary policy measures that we have taken since early March are providing crucial support to underpin the recovery of the euro area economy and to safeguard medium-term price stability. In particular, they support liquidity and funding conditions in the economy, help to sustain the flow of credit to households and firms, and contribute to maintaining favourable financing conditions for all sectors and jurisdictions. At the same time, in the current environment of elevated uncertainty, the Governing Council will carefully assess incoming information, including developments in the exchange rate, with regard to its implications for the medium-term inflation outlook. It continues to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro area real GDP contracted by 11.8%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2020. Incoming data and survey results indicate a continued recovery of the euro area economy and point to a strong rebound in GDP growth in the third quarter. Alongside a significant rebound in industrial and services production, there are signs of a notable recovery in consumption. Recently, momentum has slowed in the services sector compared with the manufacturing sector, which is also visible in survey results for August. The increases in coronavirus infection rates during the summer months constitute headwinds to the short-term outlook. Looking ahead, a further sustained recovery remains highly dependent on the evolution of the pandemic and the success of containment policies. While the uncertainty related to the evolution of the pandemic will likely dampen the strength of the recovery in the labour market and in consumption and investment, the euro area economy should be supported by favourable financing conditions, an expansionary fiscal stance and a strengthening in global activity and demand. This assessment is broadly reflected in the September 2020 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. Compared with the June 2020 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real GDP growth has been revised up for 2020 and is largely unchanged for 2021 and 2022. Given the exceptional uncertainty currently surrounding the outlook, the projections include two alternative scenarios, which we will publish on our website following this press conference. Overall, the balance of risks to the euro area growth outlook is seen to remain on the downside. This assessment largely reflects the still uncertain economic and financial implications of the pandemic. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation decreased to -0.2% in August, from 0.4% in July. On the basis of current and futures prices for oil and taking into account the temporary reduction in the German VAT rate, headline inflation is likely to remain negative over the coming months before turning positive again in early 2021. Moreover, in the near term price pressures will remain subdued owing to weak demand, lower wage pressures and the appreciation of the euro exchange rate, despite some upward price pressures related to supply constraints. Over the medium term, a recovery in demand, supported by accommodative monetary and fiscal policies, will put upward pressure on inflation. Market-based indicators of longer-term inflation expectations have returned to their pre-pandemic levels, but still remain very subdued, while survey-based measures remain at low levels. This assessment is broadly reflected in the September 2020 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual inflation at 0.3% in 2020, 1.0% in 2021 and 1.3% in 2022. Compared with the June 2020 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for inflation is unchanged for 2020, has been revised up for 2021, and is unchanged for 2022. The unchanged projection for inflation in 2022 masks an upward revision to inflation excluding energy and food  in part reflecting the positive impact of the monetary and fiscal policy measures  which was largely offset by the revised path of energy prices. Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth continued to rise, reaching 10.2% in July 2020, after 9.2% in June. Strong money growth reflects domestic credit creation and the ongoing asset purchases by the Eurosystem, as well as precautionary considerations which foster a heightened preference for liquidity in the money-holding sector. In this environment, the narrow monetary aggregate M1, encompassing the most liquid forms of money, continues to be the main contributor to broad money growth. Developments in loans to the private sector continued to be shaped by the impact of the coronavirus on economic activity. Following strong increases in the early months of the pandemic, the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations remained broadly stable in July, standing at 7.0%, compared with 7.1% in June. High rates of corporate loan growth continue to mirror elevated liquidity needs of firms to finance their ongoing expenditures and working capital and to further build liquidity buffers, although the rebound in economic activity has resulted in some recovery in their revenues. The annual growth rate of loans to households also remained stable at 3.0% in July  the same rate as observed since April 2020. Growth in loans to the private sector continues to benefit from historically low bank lending rates. Overall, our policy measures, together with the measures adopted by national governments and European institutions, will continue to support access to financing, including for those most affected by the ramifications of the pandemic. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is necessary for the robust convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Regarding fiscal policies, an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance remains critical, in view of the sharp contraction in the euro area economy. Fiscal measures taken in response to the pandemic emergency should as much as possible be targeted and temporary in nature. The three safety nets endorsed by the European Council for workers, businesses and sovereigns, amounting to a total of €540 billion, provide important funding support in this context. The Governing Council also strongly welcomes the Next Generation EU package of €750 billion, which has the potential to significantly support the regions and sectors hardest hit by the pandemic, strengthen the Single Market and build a lasting and prosperous recovery. In order to fully reach its potential, the package will need to be firmly rooted in sound structural policies conceived and implemented at the national level. Well-designed structural policies could contribute to a faster, stronger and more uniform recovery from the crisis, thereby supporting the effectiveness of monetary policy in the euro area. Targeted structural policies are particularly important to revitalise our economies, with a focus on boosting investment in priority areas such as the green and digital transitions."
Malaysia,2020-09-10,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 1.75 percent. The global economy continues to improve, with the easing of containment measures across more economies and strong policy support. The re-opening of production facilities has led to a resumption of manufacturing and trade activity. However, the recovery in the services sector has been slower. Financial conditions have improved, although risk aversion remains elevated. The outlook is still subject to downside risks and uncertainty, primarily due to the risk of a resurgence of the pandemic and weaker labour market conditions. For Malaysia, economic activity continues to recover from the trough in April this year. Latest high frequency indicators show that labour market conditions, household spending and trade activity have continued to improve. Also supporting the economic recovery are the fiscal stimulus packages, alongside monetary and financial measures. Looking ahead, the improvement is expected to continue into 2021, supported by the recovery in external demand and expansion in private sector expenditure. However, the pace of recovery will be uneven across sectors, with economic activity in some industries remaining below pre-pandemic levels, and a slower improvement in the labour market. This outlook is still subject to downside risks, particularly from ongoing uncertainties surrounding the course of the pandemic domestically and globally. Inflationary pressures are expected to remain muted in 2020. Headline inflation is likely to average negative in 2020 given the substantially lower global oil prices, and average higher in 2021, within the earlier projected ranges. The outlook, however, will continue to be significantly affected by global oil and commodity prices. Underlying inflation is expected to be subdued amid spare capacity in the economy. The cumulative 125 basis points reduction in the OPR this year will continue to provide stimulus to the economy. Given the outlook for growth and inflation, the MPC considers the stance of monetary policy to be appropriate and accommodative. The Bank remains committed to utilise its policy levers as appropriate to create enabling conditions for a sustainable economic recovery. Bank Negara Malaysia 10 September 2020."
Peru,2020-09-10,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT SEPTEMBER 2020 BCRP MAINTAINED REFERENCE RATE AT 0.25% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to continue its expansionary policy stance, maintaining the reference rate at 0.25 percent and implementing further liquidity injection operations, in light of the following developments: Inflation in 2020 and 2021 is expected to fall below the target range due to a significant weakening of domestic demand. One-year ahead expected inflation was 1.6 percent in August. Year-on-year inflation decreased from 1.9 percent in July to 1.7 percent in August, while trend inflation remains in the lower part of the target range. Leading indicators point to a recovery in July and August, although they remain below last year's levels. While firms' growth expectations continued to recover in August, most remain in pessimistic territory. Global economic activity is recovering gradually during the second half of the year, but remains below last year's levels. The BCRP will continue to take the necessary steps to sustain the payments system and credit flows. As of September 9, the BCRP's liquidity injection operations totaled S/ 60.7 billion, of which S/ 44.2 billion were associated with government-backed repos. In this context, credit to the private sector grew 14.2 percent year-on-year in July, with interest rates declining steadily since April. Additionally, phase two of the “Reactiva Peru” program continued in August, with 23 auction sessions totaling S/ 24.8 billion at an average interest rate of 1.70 percent. The Board considers it appropriate to maintain a strong expansionary monetary stance for as long as the negative effects of the pandemic on inflation and its determinants persist. The BCRP stands ready to expand monetary stimulus using a range of instruments. The Board also decided to maintain the following interest rates on its window facility operations in domestic currency with financial entities: Overnight deposits: 0.15 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 0.50 percent per year. The BCRP Board's next monetary policy session will take place October 7, 2020."
Mongolia,2020-09-14,"MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Lowering the policy rate and introducing long-term repo financing instrument Number: 2020/05 Date: 14th September 2020 At the scheduled meeting held on the 14th of September 2020, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to lower the policy rate by 1 percentage point to 8 percent; introduce long-term repo financing instrument. Considering the current condition, outlook of the economy and financial market, inherent uncertainties and risks in the domestic and external environment, the MPC decision aims to support new loans issued by the banking sector to the real sector and lower interest rates. The decision is expected to alleviate the current economic downturn and support economic recovery while maintaining inflation around its target level. Annual headline inflation fell to 2.1 percent nationwide and 1.7 percent in Ulaanbaatar city as of August 2020. In the coming months, inflation will increase marginally due to the base effect, while it is expected to remain under the target level in the coming years. As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the economy contracted 9.7 percent in the first half of 2020, and it was below our expectation and the biggest contraction in the past 20 years. However, with the monetary and fiscal policy measures and the improvement in external sector, the economic downturn is expected to dissipate over the second half of the year and the economy is expected to move into the pace of economic recovery next year. The global economic activity has strengthened but have been on uneven path in the second half of the year after a sharp contraction in the first half owing to the Covid-19. This has been reflected in stock market prices, commodity prices, and improved trade activities. However, uncertainty remains high as the outlook of external sector and domestic economy depends critically on the containment of the virus. The monetary and macroprudential policy measures, taken step by step to mitigate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, continue to provide support to the domestic economy and ensure the stability of the banking sector. The MPC will continue to monitor the economic situation and take measures accordingly to support the liquidity of households, banks, and businesses, and to prevent credit supply disruptions in the banking system.

Armenia,2020-09-15,"PRESS RELEASE 15.09.2020 At the September 15 meeting, the CBA Board decided to decrease the refinancing rate by 0.25 pp to 4.25%. Inflation in August 2020 stood at -0.1%, compared to -0.4% in the same month of the previous year. As a result, the 12-month inflation increased to 1.8%. At the same time, the 12- month core inflation somewhat increased to 1.1%․ The global economy in the third quarter is showing signs of gradual recovery. The persistently high uncertainty related to the final resolution of the pandemic will, however, take its toll on aggregate demand and economic activity of Armenia's main trading partners delaying the recovery. Under such conditions, central banks will continue pursuing expansionary monetary policy. As a result, although low inflationary environment prevails in the commodity markets, the Board does not expect inflationary pressures from the external sector. In the first half of 2020, economic growth was in line with the Central Bank's projections. In July, however, the lower-than-expected contraction of economic activity was driven by services sector. At the same time, the contraction of private expenditures in the first half of 2020 was more than expected, which was partially compensated by the expansionary fiscal policy. Taking into account these developments, as well as precautionary behavior of consumption and investment due to the high uncertainty related to the resolution of pandemic, the internal demand and economic activity in the coming quarters will recover at a slower-than-expected pace. Taking into account the low inflationary environment, as well as the somewhat delayed recovery of external and internal demand the CBA Board decided to continue to ease monetary conditions by decreasing the policy rate. Under the expected economic developments, the CBA Board is inclined to continue the monetary policy easing and maintain the expansionary stance in the medium term. This will gradually increase inflation and will stabilize it near the target at the end of the forecast horizon. At the same time, given that, under current circumstances, different sectors of the economy bear disproportionate costs, and monetary policy has a universal impact on the economy, the CBA Board remains confident that along with a stimulative monetary policy implementing a more expansionary fiscal policy is key to restoring aggregate demand. The Board estimates that the risks of inflation deviating from the projection are balanced. In case risks materialize, the Central Bank is ready to respond accordingly to ensure price stability in the medium term. Detailed information underlying the decision on the level of interest rate is available in the Inflation Report (Monetary Policy Program for the third quarter of 2020) to be published on September 30, 2020."
Poland,2020-09-15,"Warsaw, 15 September 2020 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 15 September 2020 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: reference rate at 0.10%; lombard rate at 0.50%; deposit rate at 0.00%; rediscount rate at 0.11%; discount rate at 0.12%. NBP will continue to purchase government securities and government-guaranteed debt securities on the secondary market as part of the structural open market operations. The timing and scale of the operations will depend on the market conditions. Furthermore. NBP will offer bill discount credit aimed at refinancing loans granted to enterprises by banks. Incoming data confirmed that 2020 Q2 had seen a sharp fall in GDP around the world, including among Poland's main trading partners. In the euro area GDP fell by 14.7% y/y. Along with the easing of containment measures in recent months there has been an improvement in the economic situation in many economies, although economic activity in most countries remains lower than before the outbreak of the pandemic. The improvement in the global economic conditions has been supported by fiscal measures introduced as well as the accompanying easing of monetary policy, including interest rate cuts and asset purchases. At the same time, there remains uncertainty about the further course of the pandemic as well as the pace and robustness of the recovery in the global economic conditions. The prices of many commodities on the global markets remain significantly lower than at the beginning of the year. Along with weaker economic activity, this has contributed to inflation staying at low levels in many countries, including among Poland's main trading partners. In Poland. GDP data for 2020 Q2 confirmed a sharp fall in economic activity (GDP fell by 8.2% y/y). In 2020 Q2, both domestic demand, including consumption and investment, and exports fell sharply. This was accompanied by a fall in the number of people employed and a decline in wage growth in the economy. Incoming data suggest an improvement in sentiment and a recovery in economic activity in recent months. At the same time, inflation in August declined to 2.9% y/y. A further recovery in economic activity may be expected over the coming months. This will be supported by a further improvement in the economic situation in the environment of the Polish economy and economic policy measures, including the easing of NBP's monetary policy. At the same time, the scale of the expected recovery in activity may be limited by uncertainty about the further course and effects of the pandemic, lower income growth and weaker sentiment of economic agents than in previous years. The pace of the economic recovery could also be limited by the lack of visible zloty exchange rate adjustment to the global pandemic-driven shock and to the monetary policy easing introduced by NBP. These operations are aimed at changing the long-term liquidity structure in the banking sector, ensuring the liquidity in the secondary markets for the purchased securities and enhancing the impact of the NBP interest rate cuts on the economy, i.e. strengthening the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Furthermore. NBP will also offer bill discount credit aimed at refinancing loans granted to enterprises by banks. The NBP monetary policy easing mitigates the negative economic impact of the pandemic, limiting the scale of the fall in economic activity and supporting incomes of households and enterprises. Consequently, it alleviates the fall in employment and deterioration in the financial situation of enterprises, thus supporting economic recovery. The measures undertaken by NBP reduce the risk of inflation falling below the NBP inflation target in the medium term and  due to their positive impact on the financial situation of debtors  are conducive to enhancement of financial system stability. The Council adopted Monetary Policy Guidelines for 2021."
Brazil,2020-09-16,"In its 233rd meeting, the Copom unanimously decided to maintain the Selic rate at 2.00% p.a. The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario:. Regarding the global outlook, the recovery in major economies, although uneven across sectors, along with a moderation in financial assets volatility, is resulting in a relatively favorable environment for emerging economies. However, there is significant uncertainty regarding the evolution of this scenario due to a possible decline in government stimuli and to the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic itself. Turning to the Brazilian economy, similarly to other economies, recent indicators suggest a partial recovery in economic activity. Sectors more directly affected by social distancing measures remain depressed despite the offsetting effects of the government transfer programs. Prospectively, uncertainty about economic growth remains larger than usual, especially for the period starting at the end of this year, concurrently with the expected unwinding of the emergency transfer programs. The Committee judges that short-term inflation will rise due to a temporary food price increase and to a partial normalization of some service prices, in a context of a recovery in activity and mobility. The various measures of underlying inflation remain below the level compatible with meeting the inflation target at the relevant horizon for monetary policy. Inflation expectations for 2020, 2021, and 2022 collected by the Focus survey are around 1.9%, 3.0%, and 3.5%, respectively. The Copom's inflation projections in the hybrid scenario with interest rate path extracted from the Focus survey and constant exchange rate at R$5.30/US$* stand around 2.1% for 2020, 2.9% for 2021 and 3.3% for 2022. This scenario assumes a path for the Selic rate that ends 2020 at 2.00% p.a., rises to 2.50% p.a. in 2021 and 4.50% p.a. in 2022; and. The scenario with constant interest rate at 2.00% p.a. and constant exchange rate at R$5.30/US$* yields inflation projections around 2.1% for 2020, 3.0% for 2021 and 3.8% for 2022. The Committee emphasizes that risks to its baseline scenario remain in both directions. On the one hand, economic slack may continue to produce a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory, especially when this slack is concentrated in the service sector. This risk increases if a slower reversion of the pandemic effects lengthens the environment of high uncertainty and precautionary savings. On the other hand, fiscal policy responses to the pandemic that permanently aggravate the fiscal path or a frustration with the continuation of the reform agenda may increase the risk premium. Additionally, the credit and transfer programs implemented in response to the pandemic may cause a smaller-than-estimated decline in aggregate demand, introducing an asymmetry to the balance of risks. This set of factors could potentially result in a higher-than-expected path for inflation over the relevant horizon for monetary policy. The Committee believes that persevering in the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy is essential for a sustainable economic recovery. The Copom also stresses that uncertainty regarding the continuation of the reform agenda and permanent changes to the fiscal consolidation process could result in an increase in the structural interest rate. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to maintain the Selic rate at 2.00% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation, a higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks, and it is consistent with convergence of inflation to its target over the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2021 and, to a lesser extent, 2022. The Copom believes that the current economic conditions continue to recommend an unusually strong monetary stimulus but it recognizes that, due to prudential and financial stability reasons, the remaining space for monetary policy stimulus, if it exists, should be small. Consequently, possible future adjustments to the current degree of monetary stimulus would occur with additional gradualism and would depend on the perception of the fiscal trajectory, as well as on new information that changes the Committee's current assessment about prospective inflation. To provide the monetary stimulus deemed adequate to meet the inflation target, but maintaining the necessary caution for prudential reasons, the Copom considered adequate to use forward guidance as an additional monetary policy tool. Therefore, despite the asymmetry on its balance of risks, the Copom does not intend to reduce the monetary stimulus unless inflation expectations, as well as its baseline scenario inflation projections, are sufficiently close to the inflation target at the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which currently includes 2021 and, to a lesser extent, 2022. This intention is conditional on the maintenance of the current fiscal regime and on the anchoring of long-term inflation expectations. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Roberto Oliveira Campos Neto (Governor). Bruno Serra Fernandes. Carolina de Assis Barros. Fabio Kanczuk. Fernanda Feitosa Nechio. Joao Manoel Pinho de Mello. Mauricio Costa de Moura. Otavio Ribeiro Damaso, and Paulo Srgio Neves de Souza. *Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average R$/US$ exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the last day of the week before the Copom meeting."
Georgia,2020-09-16,"16.09.2020 The National Bank keeps its policy rate unchanged at 8.0 percent The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on September 16, 2020, and decided to keep the refinancing rate unchanged at 8.0 percent. Price dynamics in recent months are in line with the forecasts of the NBG. As expected, annual inflation continued to decline, reaching 4.8 percent in August. According to the current forecast, other things equal, the downward trend of inflation will continue over the rest of the year, it will fall below the target level in the first half of 2021 and then approach it from below. The expected change in inflation is largely driven by weak aggregate, largely external, demand. However, the Committee also took into account the risks of inflation expectations, that are associated with increased volatility in foreign exchange markets and persistence of above-the-target inflation for a prolonged period. The potential risks of the supply-side are also noteworthy. Against the backdrop of these factors and still high degree of uncertainty, the Monetary Policy Committee kept the rate unchanged. It should be noted that the aggregate demand is positively affected by a considerable fiscal stimulus, including a partial subsidy of interest expense on mortgage loans, which, in fact, has an impact similar to monetary policy easing. The gradual exit from the tightened monetary policy (normalization) will continue in the future and its pace will depend on inflation expectations and the dynamics of economic activity. Preliminary indicators still point to a weak aggregate demand. According to current estimates, economic activity fell by 5.5 percent in July, year-on-year. However, compared to the previous months, domestic demand continues to recover, which is related to the fiscal stimulus and the better-than- expected dynamics of credit activity and remittances. In contrast, external demand remains significantly reduced. Revenues from international travelers are minimal and, according to preliminary data, in August declined by 96 percent anually. In August, demand for exports decreased by 7 percent annually, however, compared to previous months, some recovery is visible. Along with the decline in export proceeds, imports also fell by 19 percent. The NBG continues to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all available tools to ensure price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on October 28, 2020."
United States,2020-09-16,"EDT September 16, 2020 The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals. The COVID-19 pandemic is causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. Economic activity and employment have picked up in recent months but remain well below their levels at the beginning of the year. Weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices are holding down consumer price inflation. Overall financial conditions have improved in recent months, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. The path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus. The ongoing public health crisis will continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation running persistently below this longer- run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved. The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, over coming months the Federal Reserve will (more) For release at 2 p.m. EDT September 16, 2020 - 2 - increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities at least at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning and help foster accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H Powell. Chair; John C. Williams. Vice Chair; Michelle W Bowman; Lael Brainard; Richard H Clarida; Patrick Harker; Loretta J Mester; and Randal K Quarles. Voting against the action were Robert S Kaplan, who expects that it will be appropriate to maintain the current target range until the Committee is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals as articulated in its new policy strategy statement, but prefers that the Committee retain greater policy rate flexibility beyond that point; and Neel Kashkari, who prefers that the Committee indicate that it expects to maintain the current target range until core inflation has reached 2 percent on a sustained basis."
South Africa,2020-09-17,"South African Reserve Bank PRESS STATEMENT EMBARGO DELIVERY 17 September 2020 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the July meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), the Covid-19 pandemic has abated in South Africa. A range of other countries however continue to experience a rapid spread of the virus. The economic effects of the crisis have been extensive and a recovery to pre-pandemic levels will take several years. Current forecasts from the IMF show global gross domestic product (GDP) contracting by about 4.9% this year, although the general economic outlook has improved somewhat.1 Second quarter GDP outcomes for most economies have been massively negative, as expected. At this stage, third and fourth quarter recoveries for 2020 are expected to be robust. However, the pace of growth into 2021 could be modest, 1 Global growth in the QPM model is a trade-weighted average of South Africa's trading partners. For 2020 this is now at -4.2% (up from -4.7% in July) and revised up to 4.7% for 2021. Based on the June update of the World Economic Outlook, the IMF expects global growth of 5.4% in 2021. MPC Statement 17 September 2020 Page 1. MPC Statement 17 September 2020 Page 1 depending on control of new virus outbreaks, the extent of supply and demand losses, and future growth in investment and productivity. Volatility in financial asset prices remains high, as virus developments and geopolitical events continue to impact heavily on market sentiment. While capital flows to emerging markets have generally picked up compared to the outflows experienced in March and April, the global environment continues to reflect pronounced levels of risk aversion. Policy responses to the crisis have generally been robust across countries. In recent months, many fiscal and monetary authorities have opted to wait for new data to gauge conditions and assess the speed of economic recovery before making further adjustments. The Covid-19 outbreak has had major health, social and economic impacts, presenting difficulties in forecasting domestic and global economic activity. The compilation of accurate economic statistics has and will remain severely challenged. On 8th September. Statistics SA released their estimate of second quarter growth in GDP and revised the first quarter figure slightly. As expected, output was severely negative, with seasonally adjusted and annualised quarterly GDP contracting by 51%, across all sectors except agriculture which expanded. The Bank now forecasts a GDP contraction of 8.2% in 2020, compared to the 7.3% contraction forecast in July. The lower second quarter is followed by revised projections of a stronger expansion in the third and fourth quarters of 2020. Further easing of the lockdown has supported economic growth. High frequency indicators generally show a pickup in economic activity from extremely low levels in MPC Statement 17 September 2020 Page 2. High frequency indicators generally show a pickup in economic activity from extremely low levels in MPC Statement 17 September 2020 Page 2 April and May. However, getting back to pre-pandemic output levels will take time. With a sharp decline in investment, potential growth estimates have been lowered, resulting in a smaller output gap over the forecast period. GDP is expected to grow by 3.9% in 2021 and by 2.6% in 2022.2 South Africa's terms of trade remain robust. Commodity export prices are high, while oil prices remain generally low. The Brent crude oil price increased between July and September, and is expected to average about $42 per barrel in 2020, rising to $47 per barrel in 2021 and $52 per barrel in 2022. The rand has depreciated by 14.5% against the USD since January and remains below its estimated long-run equilibrium value, despite considerable appreciation since June. The implied starting point for the rand forecast is R17.07 to the US dollar, compared with R17.93 at the time of the previous meeting. Risks to the growth outlook are assessed to be balanced, but this is tentative and open to adjustments given the wide range of shocks hitting the economy, uncertainties involving the effectiveness of policy, and the sensitivity of sentiment to news flow. The exceptionally accommodative policies in many advanced economies and improved economic outlooks have supported a partial recovery in global financial markets. But this has so far resulted in only a trickle of fresh capital flows to emerging markets, and financing conditions remain uncertain. The sharp rise in South Africa's public financing needs arising from falling tax revenue and higher spending has been financed by higher private sector savings and borrowing from international financial institutions. Alongside SARB liquidity- 2 Compared to -7.0%, 3.8% and 2.9%, respectively, in July. MPC Statement 17 September 2020 Page 3. MPC Statement 17 September 2020 Page 3 management operations, resident investors, including banks, have increased purchases of sovereign bonds, helping to ease yields in recent weeks. However, the yield curve remains exceptionally steep, reflecting ongoing credit risk associated with high public borrowing needs.3 The Bank's headline consumer price inflation forecast averages 3.3% in 2020 and is lower than previously forecast at 4.0% in 2021 and at 4.4% in 2022. The forecast for core inflation is lower at 3.4% in 2020, and remains broadly stable at 3.7% in 2021, and 4.0% in 2022. The overall risks to the inflation outlook at this time appear to be balanced. Global producer price and food inflation have bottomed out. Local food price inflation is expected to remain contained. Risks to inflation from currency depreciation are expected to stay muted while pass-through remains low. While there are no demand side pressures evident, electricity and other administered prices remain a concern. Additional exchange rate pressures could result from heightened fiscal risks. Importantly, expectations of future inflation continued to soften this year and have shifted slightly below the mid-point of the band for 2021. Market-based expectations for short and medium-term inflation have eased slightly, while longer-term inflation expectations remain higher.4 3 Measured by the spread between the R2036 and R2048 to the R186 bonds. 4 The latest Bureau for Economic Research (BER) survey has expectations for 2020 down by 0.3 ppts to 3.6% and to 4.2% (from 3.9 and 4.5%) for 2021. Five-year-ahead inflation expectations eased from 4.7% to 4.5%. Household inflation expectations down from 6.2% to 5.9%. Market analysts (Reuters Econometer) expect inflation to be 3.3% (from 3.1%) for 2020, 4.2% (from 4.0.%) in 2021 and at 4.4% (from 4.3%) in 2022. Market-based rates are calculated from the break-even inflation rate, which is the yield differential between conventional and inflation-linked bonds. These sit at 3.3% for the 5-year and 5.5% on the 10-year breakeven. 15-year breakeven inflation sits at 6.4 %. MPC Statement 17 September 2020 Page 4. MPC Statement 17 September 2020 Page 4 Despite a higher than expected inflation outcome in July and elevated levels of country financing risk, the Committee notes that the economic contraction and slow recovery will keep inflation below the midpoint of the target range for this year. Barring risks outlined earlier, inflation is expected to be well contained over the medium-term, remaining below but close to the midpoint in 2021 and 2022. Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to keep rates unchanged at 3.5% per annum. Two members of the committee preferred a 25 basis point cut and three preferred to hold rates at the current level. The implied policy rate path of the Quarterly Projection Model indicates no further repo rate cuts in the near term, and two rate increases in the third and fourth quarters of 2021. Monetary policy has eased financial conditions and improved the resilience of households and firms to the economic implications of Covid-19. The Bank has taken important steps to ensure adequate liquidity in domestic markets. Regulatory capital relief has also been provided, sustaining lending by financial institutions to households and firms. Monetary policy however cannot on its own improve the potential growth rate of the economy or reduce fiscal risks. These should be addressed by implementing prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms that lower costs generally, and increase investment opportunities, potential growth and job creation. Such steps will enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy and its transmission to the broader economy. MPC Statement 17 September 2020 Page 5. MPC Statement 17 September 2020 Page 5 Global economic and financial conditions are expected to remain volatile for the foreseeable future. In this highly uncertain environment, future decisions will continue to be data dependent and sensitive to the balance of risks to the outlook. The MPC will seek to look through temporary price shocks and focus on second round effects. As usual, the repo rate projection from the QPM remains a broad policy guide, changing from meeting to meeting in response to new data and risks.

Russia,2020-09-18,"On 18 September 2020, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to keep the key rate at 4.25% per annum. In recent months, price growth rates were slightly higher overall than the Bank of Russia's expectations. This is driven by two key factors: an active recovery of demand after the lockdown as well as the weakening of the ruble on the back of generally increased volatility in global markets and higher geopolitical risks. Inflation expectations of households and businesses remain elevated. Although the effect of short-term proinflationary factors has strengthened, disinflationary risks still prevail in the medium run. As the stage of lively recovery growth owing to restriction lifting and support measures completes, the pace of return of the global and Russian economies to their potential will slow down. This will have a constraining effect on price growth rates. According to the Bank of Russia's forecast, given the current monetary policy stance, annual inflation will reach 3.7-4.2% in 2020, 3.5-4.0% in 2021 and will stabilise close to 4% later on. If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia will consider the necessity of further key rate reduction at its upcoming meetings. In its key rate decision-making, the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic developments over the forecast horizon, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. Inflation dynamics. In recent months, price growth rates were overall slightly higher than the Bank of Russia's expectations. This is driven by two key factors: an active recovery of demand after the lockdown as well as the weakening of the ruble on the back of generally increased volatility in global markets and higher geopolitical risks. In August, annual inflation rose to 3.6% (vs 3.4% in July). According to an estimate as of 14 September, it was 3.7%. According to Bank of Russia estimates, current consumer inflation indicators reflecting the most sustainable price movements are close to 4% (annualised). At the same time, consumer price dynamics continue to be heterogeneous due to an uneven recovery pace in various industries. Inflation expectations of households and businesses remain elevated. Analysts expect that prevailing disinflationary factors will keep inflation in the middle of next year slightly below 4%. Their expectations are anchored close to 4% on a longer horizon. The remaining downward deviation of the economy from its potential creates disinflationary pressure. At the same time, the risks of inflation substantially deviating downwards from the target in 2021 are limited owing to the key rate decisions already made and the accommodating monetary policy pursued. According to the Bank of Russia's forecast, given the current monetary policy stance, annual inflation will reach 3.7-4.2% in 2020, 3.5-4.0% in 2021 and will remain close to 4% later on. Monetary conditions have generally softened since the previous meeting of the Bank of Russia Board of Directors. Loan and deposit rates mainly declined; lending expansion continued. The fact that longer-term OFZ yields rose due to increased volatility in financial and commodity markets and higher borrowing volume failed to produce significant effects on domestic monetary conditions. Apart from key rate reduction, interest rates and lending dynamics are substantially influenced by the preferential programmes implemented by the Government and the Bank of Russia as well as by regulatory relaxations. When making its key rate decisions, the Bank of Russia will assess the impact of cancelling these anti-crisis measures on monetary conditions. Against the backdrop of a substantial decline in interest rates, financial institutions, businesses and consumers are adjusting to changing financial market conditions. Saving models will need some time to adjust, as will the potential redistribution of funds across different financial tools, in a way that does not create risks for consumers, businesses and financial institutions. Economic activity. Q2 GDP was 8.0% lower in annual terms, which is a somewhat better estimate than previously expected. Once restrictive measures were eased, a faster than expected rebound in economic activity is emerging. Recovery is the strongest in sectors focused on consumer demand. However, weak external demand remains a drag on economic activity. Once the first stage of economic recovery growth has petered out, the increase in economic activity will continue in a more gradual manner. The economic growth path will be largely influenced by the upcoming budget consolidation, further coronavirus pandemic developments across the globe and in Russia, as well as by the nature of recovering private demand in the context of potential change in consumer and business behaviour. The recent reduction in the key rate will continue to support the economy this and next year. Inflation risks. Disinflationary risks still prevail over proinflationary ones over the medium-term horizon although proinflationary risks rose somewhat over the short-term horizon. Disinflationary risks under the baseline scenario are chiefly connected with further developments in the coronavirus pandemic situation in Russia and globally, the scale of possible measures to fight it and their impact on economic activity, as well as the speed at which both the global and Russian economies will recover as restrictive measures are mitigated. Persistent changes in consumer preferences and behaviour including a persistent higher propensity to save might exert a constraining influence on inflation. Short-term proinflationary risks are in the first place connected with stronger volatility in global markets, driven by various geopolitical developments, among other factors, which may have an effect on exchange rate and inflation expectations. Upward pressure on prices may also lead to temporary disruptions in production and supply chains in the post-restriction period, as well as to additional corporate costs of protecting staff and consumers from the spread of the pandemic. Uncertainty remains as to rather long-term structural effects of the coronavirus pandemic for the Russian and global economies, specifically, the scale of a decrease in the potential of the national economy. Potential global growth may also come under marked pressure from geopolitical factors including trade conflicts. The extent of the Russian economy's deviation from its potential is, in turn, the core driver of medium-term inflation movements. Medium-term inflation dynamics are significantly impacted by fiscal policy. When making its monetary policy decisions, the Bank of Russia bases on the fiscal policy path stipulated in draft federal budget for 2021-2023. If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia will consider the necessity of further key rate reduction at its upcoming meetings. In its key rate decision-making, the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic developments over the forecast horizon, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next rate review meeting on 23 October 2020. The press release on the Bank of Russia Board decision and the medium-term forecast are to be published at 13:30 Moscow time.

Pakistan,2020-09-21,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement September 21, 2020. At its meeting on 21st September 2020, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at percent. The MPC noted that compared to the time of the last meeting in June 2020, business confidence and the outlook for growth have improved. This reflects the decline in Covid-19 cases in Pakistan and the easing of lockdowns, as well as the timely stimulus provided by the Government and SBP. At the same time, the forecast for inflation has risen slightly, primarily due to recent supply side shocks to food prices. Average inflation is now expected to fall within the previously announced range of percent during FY21, rather than marginally below. The MPC noted that financial conditions continue to be accommodative with real interest rates remaining slightly below zero on forward-looking basis. In addition, the series of targeted measures undertaken by SBP since the Covid-19 outbreak have injected significant liquidity and further lowered funding costs for many businesses and households. Together these monetary measures have injected an estimated stimulus of Rs.58 trillion, or about. percent of GDP, in the cash flow of businesses and households. In addition, the government has undertaken number of significant measures to support economic activity including the Ehsaas emergency cash program, commodity financing, risk-sharing facility for SMEs, and acceleration of tax refunds. Taking into account the changes in the outlook for inflation and growth since the last MPC and the impact of the stimulus measures undertaken by the Government and SBP, the MPC was of the view that the stance of monetary policy remained appropriate to provide needed support to the emerging recovery, while keeping inflation expectations well-anchored and maintaining financial stability. In reaching its decision, the MPC considered key trends and prospects in the real, external and fiscal sectors, and the resulting outlook for monetary conditions and inflation. Real sector. Following deep contraction between March and June, the large-scale manufacturing (LSM) index returned to expansion in July, growing at percent (y/y). High-frequency demand indicators including auto sales, cement dispatches. POL sales, and electricity consumption also reflect an encouraging pick-up in economic activity. Nonetheless the economic recovery remains uneven across industries, with the hospitality and certain services sectors especially lagging, and the level of activity generally still remains below pre- Corona levels. Going forward, growth is projected to recover to slightly above percent in FY21, after falling to -0. percent last year. The recovery is expected to be driven mainly by manufacturing-related activities and construction, which are being supported by various financial policies from SBP including the Temporary Economic Refinance Facility and the government's incentives for the housing and construction sectors. The growth outlook is subject to uncertainty. On the downside, risks include potential second wave of Covid-19 domestic infections, possible sharp increase in infections in the winter months in Pakistan's major export markets in Europe and the US, and the threat to agriculture from locust attacks. On the upside, faster global recovery could lift exports higher. Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN External sector. Despite challenging environment, the external sector has remained resilient since the Coronavirus outbreak. The flexible market-determined exchange rate, introduced in May 2019, has played its valuable role as shock absorber, as witnessed in orderly two-way movement of the currency. Low global oil prices and subdued domestic demand helped to reduce the current account deficit further during the onset of the Coronavirus. More recently, gradual recovery is expected in exports and remittances have performed strongly on the back of orderly exchange rate conditions as well as supportive policy steps taken by the Government and SBP under the Pakistan Remittance Initiative. Remittances rose to record monthly high in July and have topped US$ billion for the last three months. By supporting the current account, which swung into surplus in July, these developments have helped to restore SBP's foreign exchange reserves to their pre-pandemic level of around US$ 12. billion. As result. Pakistan's reserve adequacy is now back above the important global benchmark of months of import cover. Looking ahead, the current account deficit is expected to remain bounded at around percent of GDP. This, together with expected private and official flows, should continue to keep Pakistan's external position stable in FY21. Fiscal sector. Despite severe pressures from the Coronavirus and contrary to expectations, the fiscal deficit for FY20 ended lower than in FY19 and the increase in public debt was contained to around percent of GDP. This largely reflects the strong steps taken by the government to ensure primary surplus in the first nine months of FY20, which helped provide fiscal space to respond to the Coronavirus outbreak. During the first two months of FY21, in line with the gradual pick-up in economic activity, tax revenues returned to positive growth, averaging around. percent (y/y). While far below pre-pandemic growth rates, this recovery in tax collections represents an encouraging turnaround from the double-digit reduction observed during the last quarter of FY20, although risks remain around achieving the revenue target. Federal PSDP-related outlays almost doubled during July-August 2020 compared to the same period last year. Overall in line with this year's budget, the MPC expects that the pre-pandemic path of fiscal consolidation will resume as economic activity recovers in coming quarters. Monetary and inflation outlook. The MPC noted that, notwithstanding an uptick in headline inflation during June and July, core inflation has been relatively stable and demand-side risks to inflation remain well-contained. Like growth, the inflation outlook is also subject to certain risks. On the upside, risks revolve around food prices, especially in the wake of recent flood-related damages and potential locust attacks. On the downside, the main risk stems from lower-than-expected pickup in domestic activity. On the global front, the future trajectory of oil prices will also have an important bearing on the domestic inflation outlook. In the wake of heightened risk aversion from banks due to the Coronavirus pandemic, private sector credit has recently been supported to significant extent by SBP refinance facilities. These facilities, coupled with other supervisory actions related to deferment and restructuring of loans, have ensured the availability of necessary funding to businesses and households, providing important support to growth and employment. Overall the MPC was of the view that the current monetary policy stance is appropriate to support the emerging recovery while safeguarding inflation expectations and financial stability. Page."
Hungary,2020-09-22,"At its meeting on 22 September 2020, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 23 September 2020:. The primary objective of Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) is to achieve and maintain price stability. Without prejudice to its primary objective, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank preserves financial stability and supports the Government's economic policy. Macroeconomic and financial developments continue to be driven mainly by the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Global GDP fell sharply in the second quarter of 2020. With the gradual withdrawal of restrictive measures, world economic activity picked up from June; however, infection curves started to rise again in most countries from the end of the summer. In September, the number of daily infections rose to record levels globally, which made it necessary to reintroduce restrictions. There continues to be an exceptionally large degree of uncertainty surrounding the time profile of the coronavirus pandemic and the speed of the global economic recovery. In the past month, sentiment in global financial markets has been mixed: the US dollar depreciated overall, while long-term yields fell across developed countries. Both the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank continued their liquidity-providing and asset purchase programmes. In August, the Fed announced that it would seek to achieve inflation that averaged 2 percent over time and would adopt an asymmetric response to swings in the labour market. Accordingly, in September decision makers expect the policy rate to remain at its current low level over the next three years. In the CEE region, central banks held policy rates close to zero, and the Polish and Romanian central banks continued their government securities purchase programmes. The world's leading central banks and those in the region are expected to maintain loose monetary conditions over a prolonged period. The coronavirus pandemic hit the Hungarian economy when its fundamentals were stable and growth was strong. Hungary's health defence against the first wave of coronavirus was successful. The severe epidemiological restrictions had their economic effects predominantly in the second quarter. After growing by 2.2 percent in the first quarter. Hungarian economic performance declined by 13.6 percent in the second quarter on a year earlier. Overall, in the first half of 2020 the Hungarian economy exhibited a similar decline to that seen in other countries of the region. The decline in economic performance and the postponement of investments appeared in a wide range of sectors. Companies adjusted to the changing circumstances mainly by reducing working hours and increasing the number of part-time workers, while preserving a large proportion of jobs. As in most other countries in Europe, the number of infections started to increase again in Hungary towards the end of the summer. Due to the second wave of coronavirus, the economic recovery takes longer than earlier expected. Overall. Hungary's GDP is expected to decline by between 5.1 and 6.8 percent in 2020, which may be followed by growth between 4.4 and 6.8 percent in 2021. Economic performance may recover to its pre-crisis level by the turn of 2022. Demand in specific sub-markets soared, while disrupted supply in others only recovered slowly due to the pandemic situation, which caused an increase in inflation during the summer months. Inflation and core inflation excluding the effects of indirect taxes rose to 3.9 and 4.2 percent, respectively, in August 2020. Inflation is expected to stay close to current levels in September, before decreasing gradually towards the end of the year due to the fall in fuel prices and base effect. In the coming quarters, developments in underlying inflation are likely to be driven by the overall balance of supply-demand frictions related to the restart of the economy and the growing disinflationary impact of weak demand. The persistence of inflationary effects arising as a result of the economic recovery will also have an effect on the time profile of the decline in underlying inflation, which the Monetary Council will closely monitor. The government deficit may amount to 7-7.5 percent of GDP in 2020. The debt-to-GDP ratio is likely to rise in 2020, but is expected to move onto a downward path from 2021 once economic growth is restored and the deficit decreases. The current account is expected to show a slight deficit in 2020 and then to improve gradually. With Hungary's net lending position remaining persistently stable, the country's external debt ratios will continue to decrease in the coming years. At its meeting today, the Monetary Council left the base rate and the overnight deposit rate unchanged at 0.60 percent and -0.05 percent, respectively, and the overnight and the one-week collateralised lending rates at 1.85 percent. The MNB will continue to set the one-week deposit rate at the weekly tenders. It is a key priority for the MNB that short-term rates in every sub-market and at all times should develop consistently with the level of short-term rates deemed optimal by the Monetary Council. In order to ensure this, the Bank reintroduced its swap facility providing foreign currency liquidity in September. The MNB may use its international master repurchase agreements providing euro liquidity to finance the swap instrument. At the first tender held on 18 September 2020, the MNB accepted the full amount of EUR 575 million offered by banks. The tender ensured that developments in short-term swap market yields were in line with the MNB's base rate. In August, the MNB increased the amount of weekly government securities purchases to HUF 40 billion to maintain the effectiveness of monetary transmission and the stable liquidity position of the government securities market. The Monetary Council will use the government securities purchase programme through a lasting market presence to the extent required. The Bank will continue to purchase government securities in the long segment. In view of the large-scale utilisation, the Monetary Council raised the amount available under the Bond Funding for Growth Scheme to HUF 750 billion from 23 September. The increased amount may help the Hungarian corporate bond market continue to converge to European and regional averages. 10,000 loan or leasing contracts have already been concluded with 8,000 domestic companies under the FGS Go! scheme for a total amount of nearly HUF 600 billion. The MNB will continue to sterilise the resulting surplus liquidity issued under the programmes in full, using the preferential deposit instrument. In the Monetary Council's assessment, the 0.60 percent base rate supports price stability, the preservation of financial stability and the recovery of economic growth in a sustainable manner. In the current rapidly changing environment, it is key to maintain short-term yields at a safe distance from a range close to zero. The Council remains committed to maintaining price stability during the coronavirus pandemic and pays particular attention to the persistence of inflationary effects arising as a result of the economic recovery. If warranted by a persistent change in the outlook for inflation, the Council will be ready to use the appropriate instruments."
Nigeria,2020-09-22,"CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO. 132 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING HELD ON 21ST AND 22ND SEPTEMBER, 2020 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on Monday, 21st and Tuesday, 22nd September, 2020, in the light of lingering uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and downturn in crude oil prices. These uncertainties which centered primarily on when the pandemic will be fully subdued and the oil market return to normalcy, have resulted in persistent weak aggregate demand, disruptions in global supply chains, mixed price development, volatile and downward trending oil prices, as well as rising unemployment. The Committee reviewed these developments and assessed their impact on the domestic economy in the first three quarters of 2020 and noted the outlook for the rest of the year. Ten (10) members of the Committee were in attendance. Global Economic Developments The Committee observed the moderate improvement in global output performance with widespread recession in the second quarter of 2020. This followed the sharp decline in output growth in the Advanced Economies and some Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs), as well as the risk of further deterioration in global output growth, associated with the lingering shocks from the COVID-19 pandemic. Global exports and international travels, however, showed signs of gradual, but sluggish recovery, as countries relax restrictions to allow for resumption of economic activities. The International Monetary Fund (IMF), therefore, remained cautious of its global growth forecast for 2020, which was hinged on the near-term containment of the pandemic. The likelihood of a second-round spike in the rate of infection is, however, undermining hopes of an early return to normalcy. Oil exporting countries are also likely to face further revenue shortfalls as a result of the decision by OPEC+ to reduce its production ceiling from 96 million barrels per day to 77 million barrels per day. Due to these headwinds, we suspect that the global economy may suffer a deeper contraction in 2020 than the 49 per cent projected by the IMF. This may also dampen the projected recovery in 2021. The MPC observed the huge injection of monetary and fiscal stimulus into the global economy, noting its medium-term inflationary potential. In major advanced economies, inflation mostly remained below their 20 per cent long- run objectives, as the recovery of both global aggregate demand and supply remained stalled. Across the group of Emerging Market and Developing Economies, price development remained mixed, reflecting the diverse structure of these economies. The exchange rates of EMDEs continued to be under pressure as global capital flows were subdued, reflecting investor's preference for gold as a safe haven. With the unprecedented and coordinated injection of liquidity by central banks and fiscal authorities globally, the risk of another financial crisis post-COVID-19 can no longer be overlooked as this may likely crystalize into a double deep global recession when central banks across the globe move to normalize monetary policy. In the global financial markets, conditions remain relatively tight reflecting continued uncertainties. Thus while markets are showing moderate signs of recovery, financial conditions are yet to ease fully as investors remain cautious of the lingering risk of a second-round of lockdown. Domestic Economic Developments Available data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) contracted by 610 per cent in the second quarter of 2020 compared with expansions of 187 and 212 per cent in the preceding quarter of 2020 and the corresponding period of 2019, respectively. The development ended, the three-year trend of low, but positive real GDP 2 growth recorded in Nigeria since the end of the 2016/17 recession. The contraction in Q2 2020 was largely driven by the poor performance of both the oil and non-oil sectors due to the lockdown to contain the spread of the pandemic in Q1 2020. The oil sector contracted by 663 per cent in Q2 2020 from -503 per cent in the previous quarter, while the non-oil sector contracted by 605 per cent in Q2 2020, compared with an expansion of 155 per cent in Q1 2020. The MPC noted the continued weakness in economic activities as indicated by the Manufacturing and non-Manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Indices (PMIs), which remained below the 50-index point benchmark. In August 2020, the Manufacturing and non-Manufacturing PMIs were 485 and 443 index points, respectively, compared with 424 and 433 index points in July 2020. This was attributed to slower growth in production, business activities, new orders, supply delivery time, employment level, new export orders and raw materials and input prices. Similarly the employment level index component of the Manufacturing and non-Manufacturing PMIs in August 2020 was 446 and 443 index points, respectively, compared with 400 and 411 index points in July 2020. The Committee was, however, optimistic that with the easing of the lockdown and gradual resumption of economic activities, the PMIs will improve in the short-to medium term. The Committee expressed deep concern on the continued uptick in inflation for the twelfth consecutive month as headline inflation (year-on-year) rose to 1322 per cent in August 2020 from 1282 per cent in July 2020. The increase in headline inflation was largely driven by the persistent increase in the food component, which rose to 1600 per cent in August 2020 from 1548 per cent in July 2020. The core component also rose to 1052 per cent in August from 1010 per cent in July 2020. These upticks were driven primarily by legacy structural factors such as the inadequate state of critical infrastructure and broad-based security challenges across the country, which dampened production activities. Other factors include the disruptions to supply chains following restriction to movements to curb the spread of the pandemic; adverse weather conditions, 3 which resulted in flooding of farmlands; as well as the inflation pass-through to domestic prices following the depreciation in the exchange rate. The recent increase in energy cost is also expected to further impact the domestic price level in the short-term. The Committee, therefore, stressed the urgent need for a combination of broad-based monetary and fiscal policy measures to curb the rise in inflation and contraction in output growth. This will involve targeted investment by the fiscal authorities to resuscitate critical infrastructure to improve the ease of doing business across the country. In addition, the MPC believes the fiscal authorities can build on earlier efforts and articulate a clear strategy to attract private sector investment. The Bank will, however, continue to take relevant steps to ensure that the detrimental risk of inflation to the economy is contained. The Committee noted the various interventions by the CBN to reflate the economy, improve aggregate supply and drive down inflation. Recent interventions were largely in the areas of Manufacturing. Agriculture. Electricity & Gas. Solar Power and housing constructions among others. It expressed optimism that these initiatives will significantly ease the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and set the economy on a path of recovery. So far, total disbursements from the Bank's interventions in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic amounted to N35 trillion including: Real Sector Funds, (N21687 billion); COVID-19 Targeted Credit Facility (TCF), (N7369 billion); AGSMEIS, (N5466 billion); Pharmaceutical and Health Care Support Fund, (N4447 billion); and Creative Industry Financing Initiative (N293 billion). Under the Real Sector Funds, a total of 87 projects that included 53 Manufacturing, 21 Agriculture and 13 Services projects were funded. In the Health Care sector, 41 projects which included 16 pharmaceuticals and 25 hospital and health care services were funded. Under the Targeted Credit Facility, 120,,074 applicants have received financial support for investment capital. The Agri-Business/Small and Medium Enterprise Investment Scheme (AGSMEIS) intervention has been extended to a total of 14,,638 applicants, while 250 SME businesses, predominantly the youths, 4 have benefited from the Creative Industry Financing Initiative. In addition to these initiatives, the CBN is set to contribute over N18 trillion of the total sum of N230 trillion needed for the Federal Government's 1-year Economic Sustainability Plan (ESP), through its various financing interventions using the channels of Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs). The MPC is, thus, using this medium to appeal to our important economic stakeholders to take advantage of these intervention initiatives to help support a quick rebound in growth. The Bank's policy on Loan to Deposit ratio also resulted in a significant growth in credit to various sectors from N1557 trillion to N1933 trillion between end- May 2019 and end-August 2020, an increase of N377 trillion. This growth in credit was mainly to manufacturing (N86627 billion), consumer credit (N52765 billion), oil & gas (N47765 billion), agriculture (N28711 billion) and construction (N27097 billion). On Monetary Aggregates, broad money supply (M3) rose to 693 per cent (year-to-date) in August 2020 from 523 per cent in July 2020, reflecting the increase in both Net Foreign Assets and Net Domestic Assets. Similarly aggregate domestic credit (net) grew by 694 per cent in August 2020 compared with 943 per cent in July 2020. Money market rates remained relatively stable in the review period with some mild volatility, reflecting the prevailing liquidity conditions in the banking system. The monthly weighted average Inter-bank call rate increased to 738 per cent in August 2020 from 625 per cent July 2020, while the Open Buy Back (OBB) rate decreased to 839 per cent in August 2020 from 1012 per cent in July 2020. The MPC noted the moderate improvement in the equities market in the review period, as the All-Share Index (ASI) increased by 578 per cent from 24,,17475 on July 21, 2020 to 25,,57257 on September 18, 2020. On a year-to-date basis, however, the ASI decreased by 473 per cent compared with 26,,84207 as at December 31, 2019. Market Capitalisation (MC) also increased by 598 per cent from N1261 trillion to N1336 trillion over the same period. As a lead indicator, 5 therefore, this improvement in market indices signposts the commencement of a broad-based economic recovery. The Committee also noted the decrease in the NPLs ratio to 61 per cent at end-August 2020 compared with 94 per cent in the corresponding period of 2019 due largely to recoveries, write offs and disposals. The Committee expressed confidence in the overall stability of the banking system as reflected in the positive performance of the financial soundness indicators (FSIs), despite the persistence of the COVID-19 pandemic. It however, called on the Bank to sustain its regulatory oversight on the industry in the light of the continued fragility of macroeconomic indicators and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the growing risk of cyber-attacks on business and economic activities. On the external sector, the Committee noted the resumption of sales to Bureaux de Change (BDCs) in a bid to improve liquidity and ease demand pressure in the foreign exchange market. Consequently the exchange rate appreciated at all windows. The MPC observed the recent improvement in external reserves and urged the Bank to maintain its prudent allocation of foreign exchange towards balancing supply and demand. Outlook The broad outlook for the global recovery remains uncertain, as the headwinds associated with the COVID-19 pandemic persist, especially due to new indications of a second spike in the rate of infections, continues to dampen prospects of a near term recovery. With several economies contracting deeper than expected, the global economy may eventually contract beyond the -49 per cent earlier projected by the IMF, as the second-round spike in the infection rate has resulted in widespread localized lockdowns in some advanced and emerging market economies. In addition, the persisting volatility in global oil prices, which is likely 6 to continue beyond the end of 2020 as indicated by the deliveries in the oil futures market, signposts the likelihood of a disorderly global recovery. The synchronized monetary policy accommodation by major central banks in both the Advanced and Emerging Market Economies, portends the likelihood of a medium-term debt crisis which may set the global economy into another downturn, if not properly managed. On the domestic economy, staff forecast suggests that the economy may continue to grapple with the effects of the pandemic throughout the rest of the year. With persistent focus on activities meant to reverse the contraction, the MPC projects growth at positive levels in Q4 2020, or at the latest by Q1 2021, based on the anticipated positive results from the coordinated and sustained interventions by both the monetary and fiscal authorities. These interventions include, the coordinated response of the monetary and fiscal authorities to curtail the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, reverse the downturn in the economy, improve sources of revenue in the non-oil sector and encourage the build-up of fiscal buffers. The Committee's Considerations The Committee's considerations focused on the major headwinds exerting downward pressure on output growth and upward pressure on domestic prices. The key factors considered by the MPC as likely to exert upward pressure on domestic prices in the near term include: the prevalence of security challenges in the country; adverse weather conditions causing flooding in some farming regions; the increase in petroleum pump price; deregulation in electricity tariff; low crude oil price; and exchange rate adjustment. The Committee noted that available evidence does not support the view that the rise in inflation was due to monetary factors. Rather there is overwhelming evidence that the inflationary pressure reflects the prevalence of structural rigidities and supply shocks. Hence the traditional tools of monetary policy may not be helpful in addressing current inflationary pressures. Instead the useful 7 policies will be the supply-side measures implemented by the Bank. In the light of this, reducing MPR will signal to the Deposit Money Banks to lend more to stimulate growth, increase aggregate supply, which should dampen prices in the immediate term. Although the MPC remains committed to its primary mandate of ensuring price stability, it however, noted the need to address the structural supply-side issues that are putting upward pressure on production cost and depressing economic growth. To this end, the Committee supports the various intervention programmes of the Bank towards stimulating production in the agricultural and manufacturing sectors to increase aggregate output and lower prices. On Financial Markets, the Committee considered the impact of the dwindling capital inflows on yields in the equities, bonds and money markets. It however, observed the improvement in the equities market from the second quarter of 2020, indicating prospects of medium-term economic recovery. Members also took cognizance of the prevailing low rates in the money market which are also below the lower band of the standing facilities corridor, as being a distortion to money market operations. The Committee noted the increase in aggregate credit and encouraged further expansion in credit to employment-generating sectors to expedite growth recovery. It however, urged the Bank to sustain its regulatory surveillance over the banking system to ensure that Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) remain low. The Committee also noted the rising public debt profile and urged the fiscal authority to strengthen its debt management strategy, explore other sources of revenue, as well as enhance efficiency in public expenditure. It commended the combined effort of the Federal Government and the CBN in providing the required stimulus to contain the pandemic and ease its impact on the Nigerian economy. The Dilemma of Monetary Policy 8 The MPC was at this meeting confronted by policy dilemma. Whereas MPC believes in the primacy of its price and monetary stability mandate, it nevertheless was confronted with what policy direction to focus on, given the contraction in output growth during the second quarter of 2020, which may lead to a recession, if the third quarter of 2020 output growth numbers further show a contraction. It is, therefore, of the view that, if a recession occurs in Q3 2020 the Committee would be confronted with proposing policy options in a period of stagflation. This is because, with the recent removal of subsidy on fuel price, the increase in energy prices, and the adjustment of the exchange rate, inflationary pressure will no doubt persist unless MPC consider options that will deal with the pressure aggressively. The Committee was therefore of the view that, to abate the pressure, it had no choice but to pursue an expansionary monetary policy using development finance policy tools, targeted at raising output and aggregate supply to moderate the rate of inflation. At present, fiscal policy is constrained and so cannot, on its own lift the economy out of contraction or recession given the paucity of funds arising from weak revenue base, current low crude oil prices, lack of fiscal buffers and high burden of debt services. Therefore monetary policy must continue to provide massive support through its development finance activities to achieve growth in the Nigerian economy. This is the reason MPC will continue to play a dominant role in the achievement of the goals of the Economic Sustainability Program (ESP) through its interventionist role to navigate the country towards a direction that will boost output growth and moderate the level of inflation. Similarly given that the currency adjustment was a causal factor in determining the price of petroleum products and energy prices, the MPC believes that the CBN management must take bold actions to stabilize the exchange rate. Management was further enjoined by the MPC to continue to provide funding to sectors that will resolve the supply constraints in petrol pricing, energy pricing and food availability. To support household consumption, the MPC enjoined management to aggressively channel its funding to targeted households. SMEs and consumer credit by further increasing its lending activities through its NIRSAL Microfinance Bank (NMFB). The Management was also directed to ensure that DMBs respond to the reduction in deposit rates by aggressively lowering cost of credit to borrowers. As regards output growth. MPC noted that air and road transportation; entertainment & accommodation; food services; and education subsectors were adversely affected by the lockdown. It therefore suggested that more efforts be put in place to continue to provide relief and funding to these subsectors to catalyse growth and improve the output numbers. Dealing with The Causal Factors of Inflation In the view of the MPC, so far, evidence has not supported the rising inflation to monetary factors but rather, evidence suggests non-monetary factors (structural factors) as the overwhelming reasons accounting for the inflationary pressure. Accordingly the implication is that traditional monetary policy instruments are not helpful in addressing the type of inflationary pressure we are currently confronted with. What is useful is the kind of supply side measures currently being implemented. MPC also expects that a downward adjustment in MPR may be necessary to further put pressure on our deposit money banks to lower cost of credit in aid of growth. The Committee's Decision In the face of declining economic growth and rising inflation, the Committee faced a difficult set of policy choices, requiring trade-offs and sequencing. Following the above considerations, the Committee reviewed the choices before it, bearing in mind its primary mandate of price stability and the need to support the recovery of output growth. Consequently the Committee noted that the likely action aimed to addressing the rise in domestic prices would 10 have been to tighten the stance of policy, as this will not only moderate the upward pressure on prices, but will also attract fresh capital into the economy and improve the level of the external reserves. It however, noted that this decision may stifle the recovery of output growth and thus, drive the economy further into contraction. On easing the stance of policy, the MPC was of the view that this action would provide cheaper credit to improve aggregate demand, stimulate production, reduce unemployment and support the recovery of output growth. The Committee, however, observed that with inflation trending upwards, easing of the policy stance may exacerbate the current inflationary pressure through an increase in money supply. In addition, the MPC noted the tendency of an asymmetric response to downward price adjustments by ‘Other Depository Corporations', thus undermining the overall beneficial impact of a reduction to the cost of capital. In the Committee's view, a hold position will allow the economy to adjust to the ongoing stimulus measures put in place by the monetary and fiscal authorities to curb the downturn and allow more time for the MPC to assess their impact on the economy. After the consideration of the three policy options. Members were of the opinion that the option to loosen will complement the Bank's commitment to sustain the trajectory of the economic recovery and reduce the negative impact of COVID-19. In addition, the liquidity injections are expected to stimulate credit expansion to the critically impacted sectors of the economy and offer impetus for output growth and economic recovery. In view of the foregoing, the Committee decided to reduce the MPR by 100 basis points to 115 per cent and adjust the asymmetric corridor to +100/-700 around the MPR. Six members voted to reduce the MPR by 100 basis points, one member by 500 basis points and three voted to hold. Nine members voted to change the asymmetric corridor while one member voted to hold. 1 All members voted to hold the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) and Liquidity Ratio (LR). In summary, the MPC voted to: I Reduce the MPR by 100 basis points from 125 to 115 per cent; II. Adjust the asymmetric corridor from +200/-500 basis points to +100/-700 basis points around the MPR; III. Retain the CRR at 275 per cent; and. IV. Retain the Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent. Thank you. Godwin I Emefiele Governor. Central Bank of Nigeria 22nd September, 2020 12."
Czech Republic,2020-09-23,"At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank unanimously kept interest rates unchanged. The two-week repo rate thus remains at 0.25%, the discount rate at 0.05% and the Lombard rate at 1%. . This decision of the Bank Board is underpinned by the August macroeconomic forecast and by an assessment of information obtained since it was prepared. The baseline scenario of the forecast is materialising fairly well so far. Consistent with the forecast is stability of domestic market interest rates until mid-2021, followed by a gradual rise in rates. The Bank Board assessed the risks to the forecast as remaining substantial overall, with the current epidemiological situation increasing the uncertainty regarding future economic developments. An update of the foreign outlooks signals that the decline in GDP in the effective euro area will be somewhat smaller than forecasted this year. However, the expected pace of recovery in economic growth in the following two years is broadly unchanged. The outlook for foreign producer prices has been revised towards a rather smaller decrease this year and, conversely, slower growth next year. Expected consumer price inflation is virtually unchanged. The outlook for the 3M EURIBOR rate is also unchanged. Foreign interest rates thus remain negative over the entire forecast horizon. The oil price will be slightly higher for the rest of this year and in the following two years compared with the assumptions of the current forecast. The euro-dollar exchange rate has shifted to stronger levels over the entire forecast horizon. Growth in domestic consumer prices has been broadly in line with the forecast so far in Q3, but most of the main components of inflation deviated from the forecast to a greater or smaller extent. Core inflation was markedly above the forecast. By contrast, slightly weaker food price inflation and a smaller price impact of the March increase in excise duty on cigarettes fostered lower inflation compared with the forecast. In August, these factors were joined by a somewhat bigger-than-expected drop in fuel prices. By contrast, the forecast for administered prices materialised. The current forecast expects inflation to approach the 2% target at the monetary policy horizon, i.e. in the second half of next year. As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, economic activity dropped by 11% year on year and almost 9% quarter on quarter in Q2. This decline was 1 percentage point smaller than forecasted. This deviation can nonetheless be considered insignificant given the unprecedented situation the Czech economy was in during the spring months. Household consumption was approximately in line with the forecast. The contribution of net exports was roughly as expected, amid a smaller decline in both exports and imports. The year-on-year drop in gross capital formation deepened but was weaker than forecasted owing to fixed investment. By contrast, government consumption, which slackened surprisingly, increased more slowly than forecasted. The year-on-year decline in industrial production and total retail sales has been weakening since May. Retail sales excluding the automotive segment even rose slightly in July. Construction was hit by the downturn with a lag, so its recovery is only gradual so far according to the latest data. In Q2, the labour market started to cool in line with the forecast amid the unprecedented drop in economic activity. Growth in unemployment during the spring months was broadly in line with expectations. Total employment declined more markedly than forecasted, but on the other hand wage growth in market and non-market sectors was slightly above the forecast in Q2. The wage bill was thus roughly as predicted. According to Q3 data, the unemployment rate is surprisingly not increasing further so far. Following the approval of a joint stabilisation fund in the EU, the koruna appreciated to almost CZK 26 to the euro during the summer holidays. At the start of September, however, it started to depreciate. This was probably due to a visible deterioration of the epidemiological situation in the Czech Republic as well as in other European countries. Its exchange rate against the euro is now weaker than the forecast expected for Q3. However, the average koruna exchange rate in Q3 is slightly stronger than forecasted. The current forecast is materialising fairly well so far, in an environment of high uncertainty. Inflation was only marginally higher in August compared with the forecast. The depth of the year-on-year decline in GDP in 2020 Q2 was broadly in line with expectations. The share of unemployed persons has remained somewhat below the forecast in Q3 so far. Growth in the average wage halted in Q2, in line with expectations."
Egypt,2020-09-24,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release September 24, 2020 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation by 50 basis points to 875 percent, 975 percent, and 925 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also cut by 50 basis points to 925 percen. Annual headline urban inflation declined to 34 percent in August from 42 percent in July 2020, the second lowest rate recorded in almost 14 years, after October 2019's figur. Annual headline inflation continued to reflect muted inflationary pressures registering below 6 percent since February 202. The decline in annual headline urban inflation was driven by lower annual contribution of food items, which more than offset slightly higher annual contribution of non- food item. This came as prices of fresh vegetables came against their seasonal pattern for the second consecutive mont. Hence monthly headline inflation continued to reflect lower food prices and higher nonfood prices for the fourth consecutive mont. In the meantime, annual core inflation rate recorded 08 percent in August 2020, compared to 07 percent in July 202. In September 2020, annual core inflation is expected to be affected by unfavorable base effect, given the release of the 10th CPI series as well as its linking methodology with the 9th CPI series starting with September 2019 dat. Preliminary figures announced recently show that real GDP growth for FY19/20 recorded 35 percent, down from 56 percent in the previous fiscal yea. Meanwhile the unemployment rate recorded 96 percent in 2020 Q2 up from 77 percent in 2020 Q1. These developments reflect COVID-19's impact on the real econom. However the stability of some leading indicators in August and July after signs of improvement in June point to a gradual recovery in economic activit. Globally economic activity remained subdued despite some recovery, international oil prices broadly stabilized, and global financial conditions continued to improve, supported mainly by policy-measures despite the ongoing uncertaint. As incoming data continues to confirm the moderation of inflation expectations, the reduction of policy rates in today's MPC meeting provides appropriate support to economic activity, while remaining consistent with achieving price stability over the medium-ter. In 2020 Q4, average annual headline inflation is expected to hover around the lower band of the inflation target 9 percent (±3 percentage points. The MPC closely monitors all economic developments and will not hesitate to utilize all available tools to support the recovery of economic activity, within its price stability mandat.

Mexico,2020-09-24,"Banco de Mexico's Governing Board decided to lower the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.25%, effective September 25, 2020. Global economic activity has been recovering, while inflation in advanced economies remains below their central banks' targets. Monetary policy is expected to remain accommodative in those economies for an extended period. Particularly relevant is the announcement by the US Federal Reserve of a new monetary policy strategy that will maintain the monetary stimulus until inflation is moderately above its 2% target. The world economy and international financial markets are subject to several risks, among which are those associated with the pandemic. Since the last monetary policy decision, the Mexican peso appreciated slightly, although it has recently been subject to episodes of high volatility, while short-term interest rates decreased and long-term ones exhibited minor adjustments. After having contracted markedly in April and May, economic activity in Mexico began to recover in June and July, although an environment of uncertainty and downward risks prevails. Ample slack conditions are expected throughout the time frame in which monetary policy operates. Annual headline inflation rose from 3.62% to 4.10% between July and the first fortnight of September 2020, due to increases in both its non-core and core components. Energy prices increased slightly while there was a recomposition of core inflation, with services inflation remaining low and merchandise inflation increasing. Headline inflation expectations for the end of 2020 rose while those for the medium and long terms remained stable at levels above the 3% target. The challenges for monetary policy posed by the pandemic include both the significant impact on economic activity as well as a financial shock and their effects on inflation. Although the recent increases in headline and core inflation affect their foreseen trajectories in the short term, both are expected to be around 3% within the 12-24 month forecast horizon. These forecasts are subject to considerable risks in the short and medium terms. To the downside: a greater than expected impact of the widening of the negative output gap; downward inflationary pressures worldwide; and social distancing measures reducing the demand for certain services. To the upside: additional episodes of foreign exchange depreciation; a high persistence of core inflation; and logistical problems and higher costs associated with the sanitary measures. The balance of risks for the projected trajectory of inflation remains uncertain. Taking into account the referred risks for inflation, economic activity and financial markets, major challenges arise for monetary policy and for the economy in general. Based on the foreseen scenarios for inflation and considering the room for maneuver, although narrow, that on balance these provide to monetary policy, with the presence of all members. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board decided unanimously to lower the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to a level of 1 4.25%. Monetary policy implementation will depend on the evolution of the factors that have an incidence on the outlook for inflation and its expectations, including the effects that the pandemic might have on both of them. The Governing Board will take the necessary actions on the basis of incoming information and considering the large impact on productive activity as well as the evolution of the financial shock that we are currently facing. The latter in order for the policy rate to be consistent with the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to Banco de Mexico's target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates. Perseverance in strengthening the macroeconomic fundamentals and adopting the necessary actions regarding both monetary and fiscal policies will contribute to a better adjustment of domestic financial markets and of the economy as a whole."
Turkiye,2020-09-24,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to increase the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) from 8.25 percent to 10.25 percent. While global economic activity has shown signs of partial recovery in the third quarter following the normalization steps taken by several countries, uncertainties on global economic recovery remain high. Advanced and emerging economies continue to maintain expansionary monetary and fiscal stances. The pandemic disease is closely monitored for its evolving global impact on capital flows, financial conditions, international trade and commodity prices. Economic activity is recovering markedly in the third quarter owing to gradual steps towards normalization and the strong credit impulse. Recent monetary and fiscal measures that aim to contain negative effects of the pandemic on the Turkish economy contributed to financial stability and economic recovery by supporting the potential output of the economy. The normalization trend recently observed in commercial loans has started in consumer loans as well. The recent upturn in imports, which has resulted from deferred demand as well as pandemic-related liquidity and credit policies, is expected to moderate with the phasing out of these policy measures. Although tourism revenues declined due to the pandemic, easing of travel restrictions has started to contribute to a partial improvement. The recovery in exports of goods, relatively low levels of commodity prices and the level of the real exchange rate will support the current account balance in the upcoming periods. Pandemic-related supply-side inflationary factors were expected to gradually phase out during the normalization process and demand-driven disinflationary effects were expected to become more prevalent. Yet, as a result of fast economic recovery with strong credit momentum, and financial market developments, inflation followed a higher-than-envisaged path. The Committee assessed that the tightening steps taken since August should be reinforced in order to contain inflation expectations and risks to the inflation outlook. Accordingly, the Committee decided to increase the policy rate by 200 basis points to restore the disinflation process and support price stability. The Committee assesses that maintaining a sustained disinflation process is a key factor for achieving lower sovereign risk, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery. Keeping the disinflation process in track with the targeted path requires the continuation of a cautious monetary stance. In this respect, monetary stance will be determined by considering the indicators of the underlying inflation trend to ensure the continuation of the disinflation process. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability and financial stability objectives. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Colombia,2020-09-25,"Vimeo live broadcast (Only in Spanish). Other measures taken by BR on account of COVID-19. Learn about the considerations of the BDBR for its decision. For this decision, the Board mainly took into account the following elements. Inflation in August stood at 1.88%, and inflation excluding food and regulated items stood at 1.57%. Inflation expectations from surveys to the end of 2021 stand at 2.75%, while two-year expectations embedded in public debt instruments are at 2.05%. In response to the easing of isolation measures, there is a slower rate of deterioration of the economic activity. Nevertheless, it continues to contract. In this regard, the technical staff at the Central Bank estimates that the economy will contract between 6.0% and 10% in 2020. While July data reflect a slight improvement in the national unemployment rate (19.8%), they show a strong deterioration of the labor market and the available household income. Most interest rates in the financial system have significantly reflected the reduction in the monetary policy rate, in a context in which increases in commercial and consumer credit volumes are evident. External financial conditions remain favorable, and the dynamics of the current account reflect lower external financing needs. Under these conditions, the monetary policy risk balance suggests that it is appropriate to reduce the benchmark interest rate. The decision to reduce the benchmark interest rate by one fourth of a percentage point was approved by four members of the Board. The remaining Board Members voted to maintain the policy rate unaltered. Rueda de prensa de #JuntaBanrep - 25 de septiembre de 2020 from Banco de la Republica - Colombia on Vimeo.

Philippines,2020-09-30,"At its meeting on monetary policy today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) facility at 2.25 percent. The interest rates on the overnight deposit and lending facilities were likewise kept at 1.75 percent and 2.75 percent, respectively.The Monetary Board's decision is based on the assessment that prevailing monetary policy settings remain appropriate. Latest baseline inflation forecasts show a slightly lower path within the Government's 2-4 percent target range. This reflects the lower-than-expected inflation in August, the moderation in global crude oil prices, and the appreciation of the peso. The balance of risks to the inflation outlook also continues to lean toward the downside from 2020 until 2022 owing largely to the risk of potential disruptions to domestic and global economic activity amid the ongoing pandemic. Meanwhile, inflation expectations remain firmly anchored within the inflation target band.The Monetary Board also noted that global economic activity has stabilized in recent weeks. However, uncertainty remains elevated with the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in some jurisdictions. At the same time, the Monetary Board observed encouraging signs of recovery in domestic economic activity, supported by ample liquidity in the financial system.Given these considerations, the Monetary Board is of the view that a continued pause will allow prior measures by the BSP to further work their way through the economy. The gradual easing of restrictions, along with sustained efforts by the Government to protect human health and livelihood, should also help lift market sentiment and aid the recovery of the economy in succeeding months.Looking ahead, the BSP stands ready to deploy its full arsenal of instruments as needed in fulfillment of its mandate to maintain price and financial stability conducive to sustainable economic growth."
Peru,2020-10-07,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT OCTOBER 2020 BCRP MAINTAINED REFERENCE RATE AT 0.25% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to continue its expansionary policy stance, maintaining the reference rate at 0.25 percent and implementing further liquidity injection operations, in light of the following developments: Inflation in 2020 and 2021 is expected to be around the lower limit of the target range due to a significant weakening of domestic demand. One-year ahead expected inflation was 1.5 percent in September. Year-on-year inflation increased from 1.7 percent in August to 1.8 percent in September, while trend inflation remains in the lower part of the target range. Leading indicators point to a significant recovery in the third quarter, although they remain below last year's levels, while firms' growth expectations continued to recover in September. Global economic activity has been improving faster than expected, but remains below last year's levels. The BCRP will continue to take the necessary steps to sustain the payments system and credit flows. As of October 6, the BCRP's liquidity injection operations totaled S/ 60.5 billion, of which S/ 47.8 billion were associated with government-backed repos. In this context, credit to the private sector grew 14.4 percent year-on-year in August, with interest rates declining steadily since April. Additionally, phase two of the “Reactiva Peru” program continued in September, with 29 auction sessions since June 30 totaling S/ 25.1 billion at an average interest rate of 1.72 percent. The Board considers it appropriate to maintain a strong expansionary monetary stance for as long as the negative effects of the pandemic on inflation and its determinants persist. The BCRP stands ready to expand monetary stimulus using a range of instruments. The Board also decided to maintain the following interest rates on its window facility operations in domestic currency with financial entities: Overnight deposits: 0.15 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 0.50 percent per year. The BCRP Board's next monetary policy session will take place on November 12, 2020."
Poland,2020-10-07,"Warsaw, 7 October 2020 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 7 October 2020 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: reference rate at 0.10%; lombard rate at 0.50%; deposit rate at 0.00%; rediscount rate at 0.11%; discount rate at 0.12%. NBP will continue to purchase government securities and government-guaranteed debt securities on the secondary market as part of the structural open market operations. The timing and scale of the operations will depend on the market conditions. Furthermore. NBP will offer bill discount credit aimed at refinancing loans granted to enterprises by banks. Incoming data confirmed that following a sharp fall in global GDP in 2020 Q2, the economic activity has been recovering in recent months. The improvement in the global economic conditions has been supported by earlier easing of containment restrictions, introduced fiscal measures as well as the accompanying easing of monetary policy, including interest rate cuts and asset purchases. Despite the rebound, economic activity in most countries remains lower than before the outbreak of the pandemic. Recently, there has been a renewed increase in number of new Covid-19 infections. As a consequence, the uncertainty about the further course of the pandemic as well as the pace and robustness of the recovery in the global economic conditions has also increased. The growing number of new Covid-19 cases has contributed to some deterioration in global financial market sentiment, mirrored inter alia in depreciation of emerging market currencies. Prices of commodities on the global markets remain significantly lower than at the beginning of the year. Along with weaker economic activity, this has contributed to inflation staying at low levels in many countries, including Poland's main trading partners. In Poland, the incoming data indicated a recovery in economic activity in 2020 Q3, after a significant fall in GDP in 2020 Q2. At the same time, data on retail sales and production in August suggested that the economic recovery has slowed down compared to previous months. This was accompanied by a stabilisation in the number of people employed in enterprise sector, along with wage growth in this sector staying significantly below its pre-pandemic level. At the same time, inflation in September  according to the Statistics Poland flash estimate  stood at 3.2% y/y. A further recovery in economic activity may be expected over the coming months, however its pace may be slower than observed so far. The improvement in the economic situation will be supported by economic policy measures, including the easing of NBP's monetary policy. At the same time, an increase in activity may be curbed by high uncertainty about the further course and effects of the pandemic and weaker sentiment of economic agents than in previous years. The economic conditions in the environment of the Polish economy will also have a significant impact on the activity growth. The pace of the economic recovery could also be limited by the lack of visible and more durable zloty exchange rate adjustment to the global pandemic-driven shock and to the monetary policy easing introduced by NBP. These operations are aimed at changing the long-term liquidity structure in the banking sector, ensuring the liquidity in the secondary markets for the purchased securities and enhancing the impact of the NBP interest rate cuts on the economy, i.e. strengthening the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Furthermore. NBP will also offer bill discount credit aimed at refinancing loans granted to enterprises by banks. The NBP monetary policy easing mitigates the negative economic impact of the pandemic, supports economic recovery and reduces the risk of inflation falling below the NBP inflation target in the medium term. Due to its positive impact on the financial situation of debtors, it is also conducive to strengthening of the financial system stability."
India,2020-10-09,"Monetary Policy Statement, 2020-21 Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) October 7-9, 2020 On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (October 9, 2020) decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 4.0 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains unchanged at 3.35 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 4.25 per cent. The MPC also decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary  at least during the current financial year and into the next financial year  to revive growth on a durable basis and mitigate the impact of COVID- 19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Assessment Global Economy 2. Incoming data point to a recovery in global economic activity in Q3 of 2020 in sequential terms, although downside risks have risen with the renewed surge in infections in many countries. Global trade is expected to be subdued. The rebound could turn out to be stronger among advanced economies (AEs) than in emerging market economies (EMEs). Global financial markets remain supported by highly accommodative monetary and liquidity conditions. Soft fuel prices and weak aggregate demand have kept inflation below target in AEs, although in some EMEs, supply disruptions have imparted upward price pressures. Domestic Economy 3. On the domestic front, high frequency indicators suggest that economic activity is stabilising in Q2:2020-21 after the 23.9 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) decline in real GDP in Q1 (April-June). Cushioned by government spending and rural demand, manufacturing  especially consumer non-durables  and some categories2 of services, such as passenger vehicles and railway freight, have gradually recovered in Q2. The outlook for agriculture is robust. With merchandise exports slowly catching up to pre-COVID levels and some moderation in the pace of contraction of imports, the trade deficit widened marginally sequentially in Q2. Headline CPI inflation increased to 6.7 per cent during July-August 2020 as pressures accentuated across food, fuel and core constituents on account of supply disruptions, higher margins and taxes. One year ahead inflation expectations of households suggest some softening in inflation from three months ahead levels. Selling prices of firms remain muted, reflecting the weak demand conditions. Domestic financial conditions have eased substantially, with systemic liquidity remaining in large surplus. Reserve money increased by 13.5 per cent on a year-on- year basis (as on October 2, 2020), driven by a surge in currency demand (21.5 per cent). Growth in money supply (M ), however, was contained at 12.2 per 3 cent as on September 25, 2020. Banks' non-food credit growth remains subdued. India's foreign exchange reserves stood at US$ 545.6 billion on October 2, 2020. Outlook 6. Turning to the outlook for inflation, kharif sowing portends well for food prices. Pressures on prices of key vegetables like tomatoes, onions and potatoes should also ebb by Q3 with kharif arrivals. On the other hand, prices of pulses and oilseeds are likely to remain firm due to elevated import duties. International crude oil prices have traded with a softening bias in September on a weak demand outlook, but domestic pump prices may remain elevated in the absence of any roll back of taxes. Pricing power of firms remains weak in the face of subdued demand. COVID-19-related supply disruptions, including labour shortages and high transportation costs, could continue to impose cost-push pressures, but these risks are getting mitigated by progressive easing of lockdowns and removal of restrictions on inter-state movements. Taking into consideration all these factors. CPI inflation is projected at 6.8 per cent for Q2:2020-21, at 5.4-4.5 per cent for H2:2020-21 and 4.3 per cent for Q1:2021-22, with risks broadly balanced (Chart 1). Turning to the growth outlook, the recovery in the rural economy is expected to strengthen further, while the turnaround in urban demand is likely to be lagged in view of social distancing norms and the elevated number of COVID-19 infections. While the contact-intensive services sector will take time to regain pre-COVID levels, manufacturing firms expect capacity utilisation to recover in Q3:2020-21 and activity to gain some traction from Q4 onwards. Both private investment and exports are likely to be subdued, especially as external demand is still anaemic. Taking into consideration the above factors and the uncertain COVID-19 trajectory, real GDP growth in 2020-21 is expected to be negative at (-)9.5 per cent, with risks tilted to the downside: (-)9.8 per cent in Q2:2020-21; (-)5.6 per cent in Q3; and 0.5 per cent in Q4. The MPC is of the view that revival of the economy from an unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic assumes the highest priority in the conduct of monetary policy. While inflation has been above the tolerance band for several months, the MPC judges that the underlying factors are essentially supply shocks which should dissipate over the ensuing months as the economy unlocks, supply chains are restored, and activity normalises. Accordingly, they can be looked through at this juncture while setting the stance of monetary policy. Taking into account all these factors, the MPC decides to maintain status quo on the policy rate in this meeting and await the easing of inflationary pressures to use the space available for supporting growth further. All members of the MPC  Dr.Shashanka Bhide. Dr.Ashima Goyal. Prof. Jayanth R. Varma. Dr.Mridul K. Saggar. Dr.Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das  unanimously voted for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged and continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive growth on a durable basis and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. Dr.Shashanka Bhide. Dr.Ashima Goyal. Dr.Mridul K. Saggar. Dr.Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted to continue with this accommodative stance at least during the current financial year and into the next financial year, with Prof. Jayanth R. Varma voting against this formulation. The minutes of the MPC's meeting will be published by October 23, 2020. (Yogesh Dayal) Press Release: 2020-2021/453 Chief General Manager."
South Korea,2020-10-14,"The bank of korea. The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 0.50% for the intermeeting period. Currently available information suggests that the global economy has continued to recover from its earlier sluggishness, but the pace of recovery has slowed due to a resurgence of COVID-19 and measures taken to contain it. In global financial markets, major asset price variables including stock prices and bond yields have fluctuated considerably, due to concerns about a resurgence of the coronavirus and changes in expectations about economic stimulus in major countries. Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the evolution of the pandemic, as well as by the effects of national policy responses. The Korean economy has continued to recover, albeit at a slow pace. Although the slump in exports has eased, gains in private consumption have been tepid as the number of newly confirmed cases increased again. The recovery in facilities investment has been subdued, and the correction in construction investment has continued. Labor market conditions have remained weak, with the number of persons employed continuing to decline sharply compared to the corresponding period last year. Going forward, the economy is likely to recover gradually, led mainly by exports. However, uncertainties surrounding the economic outlook are judged to remain elevated. GDP growth is projected to be generally consistent with the August forecast of -1.3%. Consumer price inflation has risen to around 1%, driven mainly by a large increase in the prices of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products due to severe weather conditions. Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) has also increased slightly within the mid-0% range, and the inflation expectations of the general public have risen to near 2%. It is forecast that consumer price inflation and core inflation will run at the low- to mid-0% level for some time, reflecting various effects such as the drop in global oil prices and weak demand-side inflationary pressures. In domestic financial markets, the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate has fallen sharply, while long-term market interest rates and stock prices have fluctuated considerably, affected by various factors such as global financial market movements. Household loan growth has picked up and housing prices have continued to increase at high rates in all parts of the country. The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to support the economy and stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As the recovery in the Korean economy is expected to be slow and inflationary pressures on the demand-side are forecast to remain weak due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance. In this process it will thoroughly assess the severity of the resurgence of COVID19, the impact on the economy and financial markets here and abroad, changes in financial stability, and the effects of the policy measures taken in response to the pandemic."
Chile,2020-10-15,"Thursday, 15 October 2020 Monetary Policy Meeting  October 2020 At its Monetary Policy Meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 0.50%, and to maintain its unconventional liquidity- and credit-support measures. The decision was adopted by the unanimous vote of its members. On the external front, incoming indicators show some moderation in the speed of recovery of economic activity, especially in developed countries. This is seen in a context where the resurgence of Covid-19 infections has forced to impose intermediate containment measures, with a lower incidence of severe cases in these countries. In the emerging world, the dynamism of activity and demand indicators in China stands out, allowing the copper price to hover around US$3 per pound. In Latin America, meanwhile, economic recovery is lagging behind, but with significant differences among countries in terms of epidemiological, economic and social conditions, which also reflects the different intensity of their respective policy responses. In this context, the financial markets have shown increased volatility, reflecting not only the sanitary situation, but also developments in the global political and economic arena. Compared to the last Meeting, there have been slight falls in stock markets, a depreciation of currencies against the dollar, and limited declines in risk premiums. In the fixed-income market, the rise in interest rates in some Latin American countries stands out. In Chile, the increase in long-term interest rates, the decline in stock prices and the depreciation of the peso stand out. Regarding activity. August's Imacec reported an 11.3% annual drop, sharper than the market expected, although with increasing speed compared to the previous month: 2.8% month-on-month seasonally adjusted. In addition to the negative annual variation in the [INF*RES*AS] mining component, markedly negative figures continued to be observed in the annual comparison for sectors such as services and construction, which were still affected by intense quarantines that extended until the end of August. In contrast, retail trade continued to experience significant improvements, which led to the first positive figures in the year-on-year comparison since last February. The labor market continued to show signs of stabilization, with a slight recovery in employment and hours worked in the moving quarter ending in August. In this context, business and consumer expectations have continued to recover, but remain on pessimistic territory. The private expectations compiled in the October Economic Expectations Survey (EES) indicate that GDP is expected to contract 5.5% this year, but with high dispersion among the responses. As for commercial credit, its annual growth rate remains above those of the beginning of the year, reflecting the boost received from various stimulus programs. However, its dynamism has slowed down recently, while the annual variation in consumer loans continues to decrease and that of mortgage loans has stabilized at the margin. Interest rates fell across all portfolios. The Bank Credit Survey of the third quarter once again reported tighter supply conditions for all credit classes, generally linked to the evaluation of greater risk in the different categories. Household demand for credit remains weak, and demand for working capital funding has fallen. Between August and September, headline inflation rose to 3.1% annually, while its core component rose to 2.9%. This increase was mainly explained by the increase in the prices of goods and foodstuffs registered in September, bringing the monthly CPI change to 0.6%. This evolution is consistent, mainly, with the transitory boost to goods consumption linked to the withdrawal of pension savings and some short-term supply restrictions to satisfy this demand. For the medium term, inflationary pressures remain limited. With respect to market perspectives, one year ahead the EES median foresees inflation at 2.7% annually, while the Financial Traders Survey (FTS) median foresees it at 2.5% annually. Meanwhile, two years ahead expectations remain at around 3%. The Board reiterates that the high monetary impulse will remain in place for an extended period of time, so as to ensure compliance with the Bank's objectives. In particular, the Board foresees that it will hold the MPR at its minimum level over a big part of the two- year monetary policy horizon and will maintain the unconventional measures in place, thus continuing with the current asset purchase program. In addition, should the evolution of the economy so advise, it will continue to explore options to adjust this impulse and sustain financial stability. The minutes of this Monetary Policy Meeting will be published at 8:30 hours on Friday 30 October 2020. The next Monetary Policy Meeting is scheduled for Monday 7 December and the statement thereof will be released at 18 hours the same day. [INF*RES*AS] The Spanish original prevails."
Hungary,2020-10-20,"At its meeting on 20 October 2020, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 21 October 2020:. The primary objective of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) is to achieve and maintain price stability. Without prejudice to its primary objective, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank preserves financial stability and supports the Government's economic policy. Global macroeconomic and financial developments continue to be driven mainly by the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. In October, the number of daily infections rose to record levels globally again. There continues to be an exceptionally large degree of uncertainty surrounding the time profile of the coronavirus pandemic and the speed of the global economic recovery. Overall, sentiment in global financial markets has been volatile recently and risk indicators have remained elevated. Both the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank continued their liquidity-providing and asset purchase programmes. In the CEE region, central banks held policy rates close to zero, and the Polish and Romanian central banks continued their government securities purchase programmes. The world's leading central banks and those in the region are expected to maintain loose monetary conditions over a prolonged period. The Hungarian economy exhibited a similar decline to that seen in other countries of the region in the first half of 2020. Based on data for the third quarter, economic activity underwent a significant correction after reaching a low point in April and May. In August, the volume of retail sales and data on industrial production rose back to close to their levels a year earlier. At 3.9 percent, the unemployment rate was low in international comparison in August. The corporate sector responded to the challenges arising from COVID-19 primarily by raising the ratio of part-time workers, partly as a result of Government measures. The recovery slowed as the second wave of coronavirus began to unfold; therefore, based on real time data, economic activity continues to fall short of the level seen last year. Due to the second wave of coronavirus, the economic recovery takes longer than earlier expected. Overall. Hungary's GDP is expected to decline by between 5.1 percent and 6.8 percent in 2020, which may be followed by growth between 4.4 percent and 6.8 percent in 2021. Economic performance may recover to its pre-crisis level by the turn of 2022. As a result of coronavirus, pricing decisions in recent months have been more volatile and followed unusual seasonal patterns. With the restart of the economy during the summer months, inflation rose to the upper bound of the tolerance band, which was possibly due to the frontloading of price increases in a few cases, in addition to the implementation of price changes cancelled in previous months. Inflation and core inflation excluding the effects of indirect taxes decreased to 3.4 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively, in September 2020. The effect of several factors jointly caused the fall in inflation. Market services restricted the pace of price rises to the greatest extent, by 0.3 percentage points. In addition, price changes in food prices were also a key factor contributing to the decline. Looking ahead, developments in underlying inflation are expected to be driven by the overall balance of the upside effects of supply-demand frictions and the growing disinflationary impact of weak demand. The persistence of inflationary effects arising as a result of the economic recovery will also be important for the time profile of the decline in underlying inflation, which the Monetary Council will closely monitor. The government deficit may amount to 7-7.5 percent of GDP in 2020. The debt-to-GDP ratio is likely to rise in 2020, but is expected to move onto a downward path from 2021 once economic growth is restored and the deficit decreases. The current account balance is expected to show a slight deficit in 2020 and then to improve gradually. With Hungary's net lending position remaining persistently stable, the country's external debt ratios will continue to decrease in the coming years. In the Monetary Council's assessment, consistent with the risk scenario highlighted in the September Inflation Report, currently the increase in risk aversion vis-a-vis emerging markets poses the greatest risk in terms of the outlook for inflation. It is the MNB's clear intention to prevent the current uncertain global market environment from causing an increase in upside risks to inflation. Consistent with this, on 24 September 2020 the Bank changed the one-week deposit rate from 0.60 percent to 0.75 percent. It is a key priority for the MNB that short-term rates in every sub-market and at all times should develop consistently with the level of short-term rates deemed optimal by the Monetary Council. In order to ensure this, the Bank reintroduced its swap facility providing foreign currency liquidity in September. Due to the Bank's active presence, there was no tension in the swap market at the end of the quarter. Measures taken at the short end of the yield curve contribute to preserving the stability of monetary conditions and through this to maintaining price stability. On 6 October, the Monetary Council decided to change certain parameters of the programme of government securities purchases to promote the effectiveness the Bank's programmes affecting long-term yields. Under the measures, the amount available for purchase of certain series of government securities has been raised from 33 percent to 50 percent. Furthermore, the range of assets available for purchase has been extended to government-guaranteed debt securities issued, using the same strategic parameters as those of government securities purchases. The Bank applies a flexible approach to the amount of its weekly purchases, focusing its purchases on longer maturities. The Monetary Council will use the government securities purchase programme continuously through a lasting market presence to the extent required. In view of the large-scale utilisation, the Monetary Council raised the amount available under the Bond Funding for Growth Scheme to HUF 750 billion from 23 September. Under the FGS Go!, more than 12,000 companies had access to funding over the period to mid-October, exceeding an amount of HUF 800 billion. The MNB will continue to sterilise the resulting surplus liquidity issued under the programmes in full, using the preferential deposit instrument. At its meeting today, the Monetary Council left the base rate and the overnight deposit rate unchanged at 0.60 percent and -0.05 percent, respectively, and the overnight and the one-week collateralised lending rates at 1.85 percent. The MNB will continue to set the one-week deposit rate at weekly tenders, in response to the increase in risk aversion vis-a-vis emerging markets. The Bank will maintain the difference between the base rate and the one-week deposit rate as long as warranted by inflationary risks. In the Monetary Council's assessment, the monetary conditions established at the short end support price stability, the preservation of financial stability and the recovery of economic growth in a sustainable manner. In the current rapidly changing environment, it is key to maintain short-term yields at a safe distance from a range close to zero. The MNB remains committed to maintaining price stability during the coronavirus pandemic. Consequently, the Council continuously assesses incoming data, closely monitors the persistence of inflationary effects resulting from the restoration of the economy and the possible inflationary effects of financial market developments. If warranted by a change in the outlook for inflation, the MNB will be ready to use the appropriate instruments."
Israel,2020-10-22,"During the summer months: following the first lockdown and prior to the imposition of the second lockdown: economic recovery in Israel recovered rapidly. However, the imposition of the second lockdown in September, following an increase in morbidity, led to a sharp decline in activity and in demand. Prior to the imposition of the second lockdown, broad unemployment stabilized at around 11-12 percent. However, it jumped to 19 percent in the second half of September following the imposition of the second lockdown. The number of unemployed in the first half of September was about 470,000, and it increased by about 300,000 due to the imposition of the lockdown. The Research Department's forecast outlines two possible scenarios. In the greater-control scenario, in which control over the pandemic is achieved. GDP is expected to contract by 5 percent in 2020 and to grow by 6.5 percent in 2021. In the more serious scenario, growth is expected to be -6.5 percent in 2020 and just 1 percent in 2021. The debt to GDP ratio in 2021 is expected to be 76 percent In the greater-control scenarioand 83 percent in the more serious scenario. The inflation environment remains low. Inflation in the past 12 months is -0.7 percent. One-year expectations from all sources remained below the lower bound of the target.Short- and medium-term forward expectations declined slightly since the previous interest rate decision, while long-term expectations remained anchored within the target range. Since the previous interest rate decision, the shekel has strengthened by 0.4 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. During the same period, the shekel strengthened by 0.5 percent against both the US dollar and the euro. The development of the exchange rate over the period was not uniform: The shekel weakened in September and resumed strengthening in October. The financial markets remained relatively stable. The credit market continues to function with stable interest rates. Following a sharp incline at the start of the crisis, therehas been a downward trend in demand for financing on the part of companies, butthe rate of companies reporting a serious financing constraint remains higher than it was prior to the crisis, and it increased slightly in September. At the end of September, the outline for deferring payments on bank loans was further extended and expanded, and loans from credit card companies were also included in the deferrals. The global economy improved during the third quarter in view of the decline in morbidity rates and the easing of lockdown policies, which led to an upward revision in the IMF's forecast. The forecast now projects contraction of 4.4 percent in the global economy in 2020, and growth of 5.2 percent in 2021. In recent weeks, the spread of the pandemic again increased, mainly in countries that eased their lockdowns, which may lead to a halt in the economic recovery. Monetary policy in various countries remained very accommodative, and the central banks continued signaling their preparedness to take nonconventional measures to ease financial conditions. 1. To increase the government-bond purchase program in the secondary market by NIS 35 billion. 2. To implement an additional pillarof the program to extend credit to banks: Loans will be provided at a fixed rate of negative 0.1 percent against loans that banks extend to small businesses at an interest rate not exceeding Prime +1.3 percent. In view of the magnitude of the crisis's adverse impact on economic activity, the Committee continues to utilize a range of tools in order to increase the extent of the monetary policy accommodation and to ensure the continued orderly functioning of the financial markets. The Committee will expand theuse of the existing tools, including the interest rate tool, and will operate additional ones, to the extent that it assesses that the crisis is lengthening and that it is necessary in order to achieve the monetary policy goals and to moderate the negative economic impact created as a result of the crisis. For the file of figures accompanying this notice, click here. The imposition of the second lockdown in September, following an increase in morbidity, led to a sharp decline in activity and in demand. The intensity of the reaction was not uniform over all industries, and was, in general, more moderate than the decline in activity during the first lockdown. According to a flash survey by the Central Bureau of Statistics, companies reported that there was less of an impact to revenue during the second lockdown than during the first (Figure 7). Data on credit card purchases shows a similar picture: For most of the second lockdown period, the decline in the value of purchases was more moderate than during the first lockdown (Figure 3). Mobility data show a decline in mobility to places of work, commerce, and leisure (<b>Figure 4). Duringthe summer months: following the first lockdown and prior to the imposition of the second lockdown: economic activity in Israel recovered rapidly, as shown by a number of main activity indices. Central Bureau of Statistics flash surveys showed continued improvement in firms' expectations regarding their volume of activity. In August and September, electricity consumption reached higher levels than during the same period in the previous year. The Composite State of the Economy Index shows that economic activity stabilized during the summer, following negative data at the start of the crisis. Companies Survey data for the third quarter show that the net balance increased to a higher level than during the first quarter of 2020, but its level still reflects a strong contraction of activity. The Business Tendency Survey conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics shows a similar picture (Figure 2). Goods exports improved in August and September following a sharp decline in July (Figure 5). Labor market data show that prior to the imposition of the second lockdown, the broad unemployment rate stabilized at around 11-12 percent in the first half of September. It jumped to 19 percent in the second half of the month following the imposition of the second lockdown (Figure 8).[1]There were about 470,000 unemployed workers (according to the broad definition) in the first half of September, and the number jumped by about 300,000 in the second half of September due to the imposition of the lockdown. The Bank of Israel Research Department revised its macroeconomic forecast, which outlines two possible scenarios (Figure 1). In the scenario in which control over the pandemic is achieved. GDP is expected to contractby 5 percent in 2020, and the broad unemployment rate is expected to be about 17 percent of the labor force in the fourth quarter, compared with a GDP contraction of 6.5 percent and a broad unemployment rate of about 20 percent in the more serious scenario. In 2021, the greater-controlscenario forecasts GDP growth of 6.5 percent, compared to just 1 percent growth in the more serious scenario. In 2021, the unemployment rate In the greater-control is expectedto be 7.8 percent, while In the more serious scenario it is expected to be 13.9 percent. In the first scenario, the deficit is expected to be about 13 percent in 2020 and about 8 percent in 2021, and the debt to GDP ratio is expected to be about 73 percent in 2020 and about 76 percent in 2021. In the more serious scenario, the deficit is expected to be 13 percent in both 2020 and 2021, and the debt to GDP ratio is expected to be 75 percent in 2020 and 83 percent in 2021. The inflation environment remained low. The CPI for August remained unchanged, and the reading for September declined by 0.1 percent. Inflationin the past 12 months is -0.7 percent. Inflation excluding energy, fruits, and vegetables in the past 12 months is -0.4 percent (Figure 10). The negative contribution of the energy components to the CPI moderated, and in the past 12 months, they contributed -0.4 percentage points. Inflation expectations for the coming year from all sources remained below the lower bound of the target range. Expectations derived from the capital market returned to negative territory. In the coming months, the annual inflation rate is expected to remain negative. Forward expectations for the short and medium terms declined slightly since the previous interest rate decision, while long-term expectations remained anchored within the target range. Since the previous interest rate decision, the shekel has strengthened by about 0.4 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. During the same period, the shekel strengthened by about 0.5 percent against both the US dollar and the euro. The development of the exchange rate throughout the period was not uniform. The shekel weakened in September and resumed strengthening in October (Figure 14). The credit market continues to function well and interest rates are stable , supported by a variety of measures taken by the Bank of Israel and the Ministry of Finance. There was even a slight decline in the average interest rate to small businesses. The Business Tendency Survey shows that following a sharp increase at the startof the crisis, there has been a downward trend in firms' difficulties in obtaining bank and nonbank financing, but the rate of companies reporting a serious difficulty remains higher than it was prior to the crisis, and increased slightly in September (Figure 21). At the end of September, the outline for deferring bank loans was further extended and expanded to December 31, 2020, and credit card companies were added to it. As of the end of September, loan payments totaling NIS 9.8 billion have been deferred in the banking system, constituting 16 percent of the credit portfolio. (Figure 23). The global economy also showed improvement during the third quarter in view of the decline in morbidity levels and an easing of lockdown policies, although with large variance between economies. The improvement in the United States was stronger than in Europe or Japan, and the Chinese economy is particularly good in view of their success in dealing with the healthcare crisis. The improvement in activity also led to an upward revision in the IMF's forecast, which now projects contraction of 4.4 percent in the global economy in 2020 (compared to a contraction of 4.9 percent in the June forecast). The IMF forecasts growth of 5.2 percent in the global economy in 2021 (compared with 5 percent in the June forecast. Figure 24). In recent weeks, the spread of the disease has again increased, mainly in countries that adopted a policy of easing lockdowns. A continued increase in the spread may lead to increased mobility restrictions and a halt to the economic recovery that has just begun. In response, there was an increase in volatility in the capital markets (Figure 30). Monetary policy in various countries remained very accommodative, and the central banks continued to signal their readiness to take nonconventional steps to ease financial conditions. Oil prices declined to about $43 per barrel, while commodity prices continued to increase (Figure 28). The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on November 5, 2020. The next decision regardingthe interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Monday. November 30, 2020. [1] Broad unemployment as defined by the Central Bureau of Statistics, based on Labor Force Survey data, includes the unemployed plus employed workers who were temporarily absent from their jobs due to COVID and those not participating in the labor force who stopped working because of dismissal during the COVID period.

Turkiye,2020-10-22,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to:. While global economic activity has shown signs of partial recovery in the third quarter following the normalization steps taken by several countries, uncertainties on global economic recovery persist. Advanced and emerging economies continue to maintain expansionary monetary and fiscal stances. The pandemic disease is closely monitored for its evolving global impact on capital flows, financial conditions, international trade and commodity prices. The recovery in economic activity continues. Following recent policy steps, the normalization trend observed in commercial and consumer loans has become more pronounced. The expected moderation in imports has started with the phasing out of pandemic-related supportive policies. The strong recovery in exports of goods, relatively low levels of commodity prices and the level of the real exchange rate will support the current account balance in the upcoming periods. As a result of fast economic recovery with strong credit momentum, and financial market developments, inflation followed a higher-than-envisaged path. A significant tightening in financial conditions has been achieved, following the monetary policy and liquidity management steps taken to contain inflation expectations and risks to the inflation outlook. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged, while enhancing flexibility in liquidity management and continuing with liquidity measures until inflation outlook displays a significant improvement. The Committee assesses that restoring the disinflation process is a key factor for achieving lower sovereign risk, lower long-term interest rates, and stronger economic recovery. Keeping the disinflation process in track with the targeted path requires the continuation of a cautious monetary stance. In this respect, monetary stance will be determined by considering the indicators of the underlying inflation trend to ensure the continuation of the disinflation process. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability and financial stability objectives. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Ukraine,2020-10-22,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to keep its key policy rate at 6% per annum. The sustained monetary policy easing is aimed at supporting economic recovery and bringing inflation to the target. In September, inflation remained below the target range of 5%+/-1 pp. Consumer inflation declined to 2.3% yoy on an increase in food supply. This has offset the opposite pressure on prices from other factors, such as the hryvnia depreciation, higher energy prices, and a recovery in economic activity and consumer demand. However, such balanced effect of mixed factors is temporary. According to preliminary data of the NBU's online monitoring of prices, inflation somewhat accelerated in October. Although the hryvnia depreciation had a minor pass-through effect on prices, inflation expectations of businesses and households also continued to deteriorate. Moreover, the consumer sentiment index improved. Inflation will reach the lower bound of the 5% ± 1 pp target range by the end of 2020 and will accelerate further on. Considering the weak dynamics of consumer prices in Q3, the NBU has revised its annual inflation forecast downward, to 4.1%. The accelerated growth in prices at the end of this year will be primarily driven by a further recovery in economic activity amid sustained loose monetary and fiscal policies and by an increase in energy prices. The last year's low comparison base will also have a notable statistical effect on annual inflation estimates. Consumer inflation will increase to 6.5% in 2021, influenced by the continued economic recovery, this year's hryvnia depreciation, and a large hike in the minimum wage that will boost domestic demand. However, inflation will cross the upper bound of the target range only temporarily. The NBU may let inflation deviate from the target for a short period of time in order for the economy to return to steady growth sooner. At the same time, the NBU will apply monetary tools to bring inflation back to the target range in 2022. The economy of Ukraine will contract by 6% in 2020 but will resume growth at the level of around 4% in subsequent years. The GDP forecast for 2020 has remained unchanged. The main reason behind the year-end economic contraction lies in difficulties faced by businesses in Q2, when the strictest quarantine restrictions were in place. At the same time, business activity picked up markedly as the restrictions were eased. A recovery in consumer and investment demand in H2 will offset the lower crop harvest and smaller fiscal impulse. Private consumption will remain the main economic growth driver, boosting GDP growth to 4% in 20212022. Fiscal stimuli, the loose monetary policy, and a rebound in external demand will support economic growth. This scenario is possible if the quarantine restrictions are not tightened in Ukraine and across the globe. After the economy returns to steady growth, it will need less fiscal stimuli from the state. This will help gradually reduce the state budget deficit to around 3% of GDP in 2022. Going forward, the public and publicly guaranteed debt, which grew to 63% of GDP this year, will decline by 23 pp a year. The decline will be underpinned by economic growth, prudent fiscal policy, and moderate exchange rate volatility. Although the current account will record a surplus of about 3% of GDP in 2020, it will return to deficit in the coming years. The coronavirus pandemic has markedly decreased energy prices, while also reducing Ukrainians' demand for imported goods and travelling abroad, and businesses' demand for investment products. Meanwhile, external conditions were reasonably favorable for Ukraine's main exports. Consequently, over the entire year, exports will fall much less pronouncedly than imports. As a result, the current account will post a surplus. The economic recovery is triggering a widening of both consumer and investment imports, a trend which was already apparent in Q3 2020. The rebounding global economy is also pushing energy prices up. In addition. Ukraine's income from gas transit will fall both this and next year. All of these factors will cause the current account to return to deficit. In 2021, the deficit will be about 2% of GDP, widening to 5% of GDP in 2022. The primary assumption of the NBU Board is that Ukraine will continue to cooperate with the IMF. Cooperation with the Fund is the basic precondition for fully financing the state budget deficit. Another important precondition is receiving financing from international partners, which in turn depends on IMF financing. Ukraine needs this support to revive its economy as quickly as possible. In contrast, any significant delays in, or suspension of. Ukraine's performance of its commitments to the IMF could not only slow economic recovery, but also markedly worsen inflation and depreciation expectations. A constructive dialogue with international partners is the key to maintaining macrofinancial stability. Cooperation with the IMF will enable Ukraine to continue to meet its external obligations and to increase international reserves to USD 29-30 billion in the years to come. As before, a longer-lasting coronavirus pandemic, the further spread of the disease and stricter quarantine measures remain the key risks to macrofinancial stability. Other risks also remain significant. the negative impact of certain court rulings on macrofinancial stabilityan escalation of the military conflict in eastern Ukraine or on the country's borders andthe higher volatility of global food prices, driven by global climate change and the risk of stronger protectionist measures.Given the above balance of risks and expectations that inflation will overshoot its target range in 2021, the NBU Board decided to keep the key policy rate unchanged, at 6%. With the high level of uncertainty, the NBU's future monetary policy will mainly depend on how the pandemic develops and what budgetary parameters are adopted. If the pick-up in domestic demand and business activity fails to persist due to an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, the NBU will be able to support the economy by cutting its key policy rate further. Conversely, the NBU will also be prepared to raise the key policy rate in 2021 if inflationary pressures intensify. The NBU will continue to keep a balance between stimulating the economy and maintaining moderate inflation. The NBU's decisions will also be largely guided by the established parameters of fiscal support for the economy. This support is also expected to be significant next year. A new detailed macroeconomic forecast will be published in the central bank's Inflation Report on 29 October 2020. A summary of the discussion by Monetary Policy Committee members that preceded the approval of this decision will be published on 2 November 2020. The next monetary policy meeting of the NBU Board will be held on 10 December 2020, according to the confirmed and published schedule. The decision to keep the key policy rate at 6%, was approved by an NBU Board Decision on the key policy rate No.658-D, dated 22 October 2020."
Russia,2020-10-23,"On 23 October 2020, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to keep the key rate at 4.25% per annum. Inflation is developing in line with the Bank of Russia's forecast and is expected to lie within the range of 3.9-4.2% at the end of 2020. The epidemiological situation globally and in Russia is worsening. The situation in external financial and commodity markets remains vulnerable; increased volatility can be expected to persist in the near future, including in view of geopolitical factors. Inflation expectations of households and businesses have increased which is largely related to exchange rate fluctuations. Although disinflationary risks still prevail over the medium-term horizon, the effect of short-term proinflationary factors has somewhat increased. According to the Bank of Russia's forecast, given the current monetary policy stance, annual inflation will reach 3.5-4.0% in 2021 and will stabilise close to 4% later on. If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia will consider the necessity of further key rate reduction at its upcoming meetings. In its key rate decision-making, the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic developments over the forecast horizon, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. Inflation dynamics. Inflation is developing in line with the Bank of Russia's forecast and is expected to lie within the range of 3.9-4.2% at the end of 2020. Consumer price movements are influenced by competing factors, including, primarily, the weakening of the ruble and, on the other hand, a slower recovery in domestic demand compared to the summer months. In this context, annual inflation rose to 3.7% in September (vs 3.6% in August). According to an estimate as of 19 October, it was 3.8%. According to Bank of Russia estimates, current consumer inflation indicators reflecting the most sustainable price movements are close to 4% (annualised). Inflation expectations of households and businesses have increased which is mainly related to exchange rate volatility. Analysts' expectations of inflation for the year ahead are somewhat below 4%, which reflects that disinflationary factors prevail. Their expectations are anchored close to 4% over a longer horizon. The remaining downward deviation of the economy from its potential creates disinflationary pressure. This pressure can increase given the worsening epidemiological situation. At the same time, the risks of inflation substantially deviating downwards from the target in 2021 are limited owing to the considerable key rate cuts already made and the accommodative monetary policy pursued. According to the Bank of Russia's forecast, given the current monetary policy stance, annual inflation will reach 3.5-4.0% in 2021 and will stabilise close to 4% later on. Monetary conditions have generally softened since the previous meeting of the Bank of Russia Board of Directors. Loan and deposit rates mainly declined; lending expansion continued. Longer-term OFZ yields declined amid a certain stabilisation of financial and commodity markets, remaining close to the levels observed in the middle of this year. Apart from the key rate reduction, interest rates and lending dynamics are substantially influenced by the preferential programmes implemented by the Government and the Bank of Russia as well as by regulatory relaxations. When making its key rate decisions, the Bank of Russia will assess the impact of cancelling these anti-crisis measures on monetary conditions. Against the backdrop of a substantial decline in interest rates, financial institutions, businesses and households are adjusting to changing financial market conditions. Saving models also continue to adjust, including with respect to the redistribution of funds across different financial market instruments. This process needs time to go smoothly, without creating risks for households, businesses and financial institutions. Economic activity. Flash indicators of economic activity point to a slowdown in the recovery growth of the Russian economy, which is largely related to the dynamics of domestic demand. The worsening epidemiological situation negatively influences the sentiment of households and businesses, potentially affecting both demand and supply. This can have both disinflationary and proinflationary effects. However, disinflationary pressure caused by weaker demand will prevail. Taking into account this factor and the Q2-Q3 data, the Bank of Russia has revised downwards its 2020 forecast of consumer and investment demand. At the same time, according to the Bank of Russia's estimates, the Russian economy's contraction in 2020 will be in the range of 4.0-5.0%, which is somewhat less than it was suggested in the July forecast. This is largely associated with the lesser than expected contraction of exports. The recovery growth rate of the Russian economy in 2021 is estimated in the range of 3.0-4.0%. The economic growth path will be largely influenced by the upcoming budget consolidation, further coronavirus pandemic developments across the globe and in Russia, as well as by the nature of the recovery of private demand in the context of potential change in consumer and business behaviour. The recent reduction in the key rate will continue to support the economy this and next year. Inflation risks. Disinflationary risks still prevail over proinflationary ones over the medium-term horizon although proinflationary risks rose somewhat over the short-term horizon. Disinflationary risks under the baseline scenario are chiefly connected with further developments in the coronavirus pandemic situation in Russia and globally, the scale of possible measures to fight it and their impact on economic activity, as well as the speed at which both the global and Russian economies will recover. Persistent changes in consumer preferences and behaviour, including a persistent higher propensity to save, might exert a constraining influence on inflation. Short-term proinflationary risks are in the first place connected with stronger volatility in global markets, driven by various geopolitical developments, among other factors, which may have an effect on exchange rate and inflation expectations. Upward pressure on prices may also be caused by continuing temporary disruptions in production and supply chains, as well as by additional corporate costs of protecting staff and consumers from the spread of the pandemic. Uncertainty remains as to rather long-term structural effects of the coronavirus pandemic for the Russian and global economies, specifically, the scale of a decrease in the potential of the national economy. Potential global growth may also come under marked pressure from geopolitical factors including rising trade conflicts. The extent of the Russian economy's deviation from its potential is, in turn, the core driver of medium-term inflation movements. Medium-term inflation is significantly impacted by fiscal policy. In its baseline scenario the Bank of Russia proceeds from the fiscal policy path reflected in draft Guidelines for Fiscal. Tax and Customs and Tariff Policy for 2021 and the 2022-2023 Planning Period. If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast, the Bank of Russia will consider the necessity of further key rate reduction at its upcoming meetings. In its key rate decision-making, the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic developments over the forecast horizon, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. In the follow-up to the Board of Directors meeting of 23 October 2020 the Bank of Russia released its medium-term forecast. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next rate review meeting on 18 December 2020. The press release on the Bank of Russia Board decision is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time. The reference to the Press Service is mandatory if you intend to use this material."
Kazakhstan,2020-10-26,"Press-Release 43 The base rate remains unchanged at 9.00% October 26, 2020 Nur-Sultan The National Bank of Kazakhstan has made a decision to maintain the base rate at 9.00% per annum with the interest rate corridor of +/- 1.5 percentage points. Consequently, the rate for the liquidity provision standing facilities is to be set at 10.50% and for the liquidity withdrawal standing facilities at 7.50%. The recovery of the economic activity in the world is moderate and unstable owing to the second wave of COVID-19. As a result of the new disease spikes, a record number of infected are registered, forcing governments to introduce new restrictions in many countries, including Kazakhstan's largest trading partners - the EU and the Russian Federation. The oil market is experiencing increased volatility associated with the uncertainty of the recovery in global demand. The geopolitical risks are growing. The persistence of uncertainty and the increased probability of external risks limit the potential for lowering the base rate. For the second month in a row, the stabilization of inflation has been observed. Disinflationary factors continue to prevail and are reflected in suppressed aggregate demand, declining real incomes of the population and a slow recovery in business activity. The pro-inflationary factors also present in the short and medium term. The medium-term factors include a possible acceleration of inflation due to deferred demand, an expected deterioration in the current account of the balance of payment and a delayed consolidation of the state budget. The short-term factors include a worsening epizootic situation (mass mortality of birds as a result of the spread of avian influenza), an increase in gasoline prices due to a slowdown in production growth, enhanced export performance, an increase in electricity tariffs and accelerated rise in sugar prices in the Russian Federation. At the end of September 2020, the annual inflation is formed at the level of 7.0% (7.0% in August) below the National Bank's expectations. The food and non-food components of inflation have stabilized, amounting to 10.8% (10.9% in August) and 5.5% (5.5% in August), respectively. The inflation of paid services was formed at the level of 3.6%. The National Bank monitors the dynamics of inflation components. In the structure of food inflation, a slowdown in annual growth rates of prices in the markets of meat and bakery products and an increase in prices for groups of import- intensive goods are observed. The annual growth in prices for bakery products and cereals amounted to 13.4%, meat and meat products - 10.3%, oils and fats - 9.8%, tea and coffee - 9.4%, alcoholic beverages - 7.7%. The dynamics of nonfood inflation remained relatively stable in light of suppressed consumer demand caused by the decline in real incomes of the population, compliance with quarantine measures and restrictions on the operation of shopping facilities. As quarantine measures are softened and the activities of real sector enterprises are resumed in September 2020, the annual growth rate of gasoline prices accelerates to 2.7%. The main factor for the acceleration of inflation of paid services became the rise in the cost of regulated utilities by 0.7%, in particular, electricity cost by 6.6%. The overall increase in prices for services is also affected by the rise in the cost of education and communication services by 3.3% and 2.1%, respectively. Inflationary expectations fell in September 2020. Compared to the previous assessment, fewer respondents noted an increase in food prices, more - for non-food products and services. In September 2020, the quantitative estimate of inflation for the year ahead was 6.5%. The share of respondents expecting continued or accelerated price growth over the next 12 months dropped to 49% in September 2020 (55% in August 2020). Despite the positive changes, the respondents' assessments remain largely volatile. Core inflation indicators stabilized. Core inflation (excluding fruits and vegetables, utilities (regulated), railway transport, communications, gasoline, diesel and coal) amounted to 7.4% in September (7.4% in August), the deviation from actual inflation was reduced to 0.4 p.p. (in December 2019 - a gap of 1.9 p.p.). In September 2020, core inflation  trimmed mean (total inflation excluding 8% of maximum and minimum price changes) and median inflation demonstrate more moderate dynamics - 6.1% (6.2% in August) and 4.6% (4, 5% in August), respectively. From the beginning of the year, the real sector demonstrates the expected decline, while the recovery continues. At the end of 9 months of 2020. GDP decreased in line with forecasts by 2.8%. The negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy of Kazakhstan still persists, however, the improvements in certain sectors are present due to the easing quarantine measures and government support. In September, a positive contribution was made by the manufacturing industry (2.9%), agriculture (5.1%), construction (24.2%), information and communications (7.3%). In trade, an increase of 2.7% was recorded for the first time since March 2020. The main negative contribution to the GDP dynamics was made by the mining industry (-7.7%) and transport (-23.1%). The results of the survey of enterprises indicate a slight improvement in sentiment in the real sector. In September 2020, the business activity index (BAI) rose by 2.2 points and amounted to 47.6 (July - 44.7. August - 45.4). At the same time, the BAI level remains below 50 points, which still indicates suppressed economic activity and the prevalence of disinflationary factors. After six months of being in the negative zone, the business climate index turned positive in September, amounting to 2.0 points. Fixed capital investment declined by 4.9% in January-September 2020, reflecting the impact of the shock caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The recovery of investment occurs in transport and professional, scientific and technical activities (from the beginning of the year an increase of 5.7% and 57.1%, y/y, respectively). The negative dynamics of investments persists in the mining industry, where the decline in January-September deepened compared to the previous months (a decrease of 23%, y/y, in January-September 2020). A decline in investment is also noted in trade, construction and financial activities. All other real and public sectors demonstrate an increase in fixed capital investment. Real incomes of the population in August 2020 continued to decline with a slowdown in real wage growth. The annual decline in real income constituted 2.5%. In January-August 2020, in the structure of nominal incomes of the population, a decrease in the share of income from self- employment and an increase in the share of income from employment and income in the form of transfers were observed. This is accompanied by the continued growth of republican budget expenses 2 for social assistance and social security (in January-August 2020, an increase of 17.6%). In August, the growth of real wages (excluding small enterprises) amounted to 3.5%, in September - 3.0%. The situation in the external sector remains uncertain regarding the rate of the global economic recovery. In October, the IMF improved its outlook for the development of the world economy for 2020 from -4.9% to -4.4%, but adjusted its expectations for 2021 downward from 5.4% to 5.2%. The uncertainty about the rate of global economic recovery due to the coronavirus situation is still present. At the same time, the results of the US presidential elections and the size of the US stimulus package remain among the significant risk factors for foreign markets. IMF estimates on economic growth of major trading partners in 2020 have been improved. The forecast for the EU economy for 2020 increased from -10.2% to -8.3%, for 2021 reduced from 6.0% to 5.2%. The prospects for recovery are linked to the uncertainty due to the rising of coronavirus cases and the absence of agreement with the UK on future trade relations. The forecast for the economy of China in 2020 has been improved to 1.9% (the previous estimate was 1.0%). In 2021, the estimation remained unchanged - 8.2%. Despite the expected recovery, concerns about the spread of the coronavirus in many key cities and a slower recovery from the recent floods still remain. In addition, the decline in imports in July-August 2020 indicates weak domestic consumption. The forecast for the dynamics of the Russian economy for 2020 has also been improved from -6.6% to - 4.1%, while for 2021 it has significantly deteriorated from 4.1% to 2.8%. The deterioration is due to the increase in the tax on mineral extraction, increased sanctions and geopolitical risks and risks associated with the instability of the global oil market. Monetary conditions in trading partner countries remain soft as business activity declines around the world. Inflation in trading partner countries remains below target values. In September 2020, inflation in the EU (0.2%) and China (1.7%) continued to decline due to the weakening demand. In Russia, inflation accelerated to 3.7% amid rising prices for non-food products. The situation in the world oil market is developing under the baseline scenario of $40 per barrel. In September 2020, prices for Brent crude oil fell below $40 per barrel with a subsequent recovery associated with repeated outbreaks of the coronavirus in the world and an increase of oil supply in world markets. According to international organizations estimations, the oil demand will continue to recover until the end of 2020 and in 2021. Supply growth will be moderate and will be provided mainly by non-OPEC countries. At the same time, the main risks in the oil market are still present: uncertainty about the COVID-19 pandemic, the recovery of oil production in Libya and the United States, low discipline among the OPEC+ countries. Following the results of 9 months of 2020, the current account of the balance of payments is expected to move into the negative zone. Deteriorating conditions of trade in March-April owing to the decrease in oil prices and oil production volumes will affect the balance of payments indicators in the third quarter. The negative current account of the balance of payments will be attributable to the first trade deficit in the last 20 years, caused by the outstripping rate of decline in exports over imports. The next decision on the base rate will be made taking into account the results of the upcoming forecasting round ""November-December"" and will be based on updated inflation forecasts and other macroeconomic indicators, depending on the evolving dynamics and the continuation of the coronavirus pandemic. This will provide the possibility to analyze the correspondence of monetary conditions to the expected and actual situation of the economy, as well as to assess the potential for the rate cut, given the achievement of the inflation target in 2021. 3 The next planned decision of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan about the base rate will be announced on December 14, 2020 at 15:00 Nur-Sultan time.

Armenia,2020-10-27,"PRESS RELEASE 27.10.2020 Refinancing rate left unchanged 4.25% At the October 27 meeting, the CBA Board decided to keep the refinancing rate unchanged at 4.25%. Inflation in September 2020 stood at -0.2%, compared to 0.2% in the same month of the previous year. As a result, the 12-month inflation amounted to 1.4%. At the same time, the 12-month core inflation somewhat increased to 1.3%․ Despite some positive developments in the global economy in the third quarter, it is estimated that in September-October, in light of the new pace of coronavirus spread and resulting high uncertainties, the recovery of global demand and economic activity will be somewhat delayed. At the same time, a weak inflationary environment persists in the commodity markets. Under such conditions, central banks of main partner countries will continue pursuing expansionary monetary policy. Hereby, the CBA Board estimates that no significant inflationary impact is expected from the external sector on the Armenian economy. Low economic activity prevailed in Armenia in the third quarter and a 7.5% decrease in economic activity compared to the same month of the previous year was registered in September, which was mainly a result of a significant reduction in the services sector. Despite the expansionary fiscal policy, domestic demand was slightly weaker than expected during the quarter, mainly due to a deeper reduction in private consumption. The large-scale military attack by Azerbaijan along the entire line of contact of Artsakh (Nagorno Karabakh) on 27th September, as well as the incomparably rapid spread of the coronavirus in the first half of October, created a negative environment for both supply and demand developments. It is estimated that along with a somewhat reduction in output, uncertainty regarding economic growth outlook will increase, thus delaying the recovery of economic activity and domestic demand. In this situation, the Government outlines the implementation of a sizable fiscal expansion, mainly due to the increase in military spending and expenses aimed at overcoming the pandemic. Taking into account the above-mentioned actual and expected macroeconomic developments, as well as the fact that the country's risk premium has increased to some extent during the military actions and certain risks of inflation destabilization have arisen, the CB Board considers it convenient to leave the refinancing rate unchanged. Under these circumstances, inflation will gradually increase and stabilize near the 4% target at the end of the forecast horizon. The Board estimates that the risks of inflation deviating from the projection are balanced. In case risks materialize, the Central Bank is ready to respond accordingly to ensure price stability in the medium term. Detailed information underlying the decision on the level of interest rate will be available in the Press release (Minutes of the CBA Board meeting), to be published on 10th of November 2020 CBA Public Relations Service."
Brazil,2020-10-28,"In its 234th&#160;meeting, the Copom unanimously decided to maintain the Selic rate at 2.00% p.a. In its 234th meeting, the Copom unanimously decided to maintain the Selic rate at 2.00% p.a. The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario:. Regarding the global outlook, the strong recovery in some economic sectors seems to be subsiding, partly due to the pandemic resurgence in some major economies. There is significant uncertainty regarding the evolution of this scenario due to a possible decline in government stimuli and to the evolution of the COVID-19 itself. However, the moderation in financial assets volatility keeps resulting in a relatively favorable environment for emerging economies. Turning to the Brazilian economy, similarly to other countries, recent indicators suggest an uneven recovery in economic activity. Sectors more directly affected by social distancing measures remain depressed despite the offsetting effects of the transfer programs. Prospectively, uncertainty about economic growth remains larger than usual, especially for the period starting at the end of this year, concurrently with the expected unwinding of the emergency transfer programs. The latest inflation readings were higher than expected and the Committee raised its projection for the remaining months of 2020. This revision was due to continuing food and industrial price increases which, in turn, are a consequence of a persistent exchange rate depreciation, the oil price rise, and the income transfer programs. In spite of the stronger short-term inflationary pressure, the Committee maintains the diagnosis that this shock is temporary, but closely monitors its evolution. The various measures of underlying inflation are in levels compatible with meeting the inflation target at the relevant horizon for monetary policy. Inflation expectations for 2020, 2021, and 2022 collected by the Focus survey are around 3.0%, 3.1%, and 3.5%, respectively. The Copom's inflation projections in its baseline scenario, with interest rate path extracted from the Focus survey and exchange rate starting at R$5.60/US$* and evolving according to the purchase power parity (PPP), stand around 3.1% for 2020, 3.1% for 2021 and 3.3% for 2022. This scenario assumes a path for the Selic rate that ends 2020 at 2.00% p.a., rises to 2.75% p.a. in 2021 and 4.50% p.a. in 2022; and. The scenario with constant interest rate at 2.00% p.a. and exchange rate starting at R$5.60/US$* and evolving according to the PPP yields inflation projections around 3.1% for 2020, 3.2% for 2021 and 3.8% for 2022. The Committee emphasizes that risks to its baseline scenario remain in both directions. On the one hand, economic slack may continue to produce a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory, especially when the slack is concentrated in the service sector. This risk increases if a slower reversion of the pandemic effects lengthens the environment of high uncertainty and precautionary savings. On the other hand, the extension of fiscal policy responses to the pandemic that aggravate the fiscal path or a frustration with the continuation of the reform agenda may increase the risk premium. The relative increase in the risks of these events imply an upward asymmetry to the balance of risks, i.e., in the direction of higher-than-expected paths for inflation over the relevant horizon for monetary policy. The Committee believes that persevering in the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy is essential for a sustainable economic recovery. The Copom also stresses that uncertainty regarding the continuation of the reform agenda and permanent changes to the fiscal consolidation process could result in an increase in the structural interest rate. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to maintain the Selic rate at 2.00% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation, a higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks, and it is consistent with convergence of inflation to its target over the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2021 and 2022. The Copom believes that the current economic conditions continue to recommend an unusually strong monetary stimulus but it recognizes that, due to prudential and financial stability reasons, the remaining space for monetary policy stimulus, if it exists, should be small. The Committee deems as adequate the current level of monetary stimulus, which is being provided by the maintenance of the policy rate at 2.00% p.a. and the forward guidance introduced in the 232nd meeting. The forward guidance stated that the Copom does not intend to reduce the monetary stimulus as long as specified conditions are met. The Committee judges that those conditions continue to hold: inflation expectations, as well as inflation projections for its baseline scenario, are significantly below the inflation target for the relevant horizon for monetary policy; the current fiscal regime has not been changed; and long-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Roberto Oliveira Campos Neto (Governor). Bruno Serra Fernandes. Carolina de Assis Barros. Fabio Kanczuk. Fernanda Feitosa Nechio. Joao Manoel Pinho de Mello. Mauricio Costa de Moura. Otavio Ribeiro Damaso, and Paulo Srgio Neves de Souza. *Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average R$/US$ exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the last day of the week before the Copom meeting."
Georgia,2020-10-28,"28.10.2020 The National Bank of Georgia keeps its policy rate unchanged at 8.0 percent. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on October 28, 2020, and decided to keep the refinancing rate unchanged at 8.0 percent. Inflation dynamics in recent months are in line with the forecasts of the NBG. Annual inflation continues to decline, reaching 3.8 percent in September. According to the current forecast, other things equal, annual inflation will have a declining trend and remain close to the target level in 2021. The declining dynamics of inflation is driven by weak aggregate demand and it is expected that this impact will persist. The decrease in external demand is especially noteworthy. Against the backdrop of coronavirus activation and anticipated further extension of pandemic, global economic recovery in 2021 is expected to be slower than previously forecasted, which will have downward impact on external demand. The Monetary Policy Committee also took into account the uncertainty associated with the acceleration of the virus spread and the increase in geopolitical risks. According to the current estimates, the gradual exit from the tight monetary policy stance (normalization) and its pace will depend on inflation expectations and the dynamics of economic activity. Preliminary indicators still point to a weak aggregate demand. According to current estimates, economic activity fell by 5.3 percent in August, year-on-year. Improvement of this indicator is driven by relatively recovered domestic demand, compared to previous months. This is related to the fiscal stimulus and the better-than-expected dynamics of credit activity and remittances. According to the existing forecasts, other things equal, domestic demand will be the main driver of economic growth in 2021. In contrast, external demand remains significantly reduced. Revenues from international travelers are minimal and, according to preliminary data, in September it declined by 95 percent anually. At the same time, demand for exports of goods continued to improve and, for the first time since January, the annual growth was positive at 8.6 percent in September. The high growth of remittances also persisted. Amid improved domestic demand, imports of goods fell by 9 percent year- on-year in September, which is lower decline than in previous months. The NBG continues to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all available tools to ensure price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on December 9, 2020."
Euroarea,2020-10-29,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Executive Vice-President. Mr Dombrovskis. The resurgence in coronavirus (COVID-19) infections presents renewed challenges to public health and the growth prospects of the euro area and global economies. Incoming information signals that the euro area economic recovery is losing momentum more rapidly than expected, after a strong, yet partial and uneven, rebound in economic activity over the summer months. The rise in COVID-19 cases and the associated intensification of containment measures is weighing on activity, constituting a clear deterioration in the near-term outlook. In fact, while activity in the manufacturing sector has continued to recover, activity in the services sector has been slowing visibly. Although fiscal policy measures are supporting households and firms, consumers are cautious in the light of the pandemic and its ramifications for employment and earnings. Moreover, weaker balance sheets and increased uncertainty about the economic outlook are weighing on business investment. Headline inflation is being dampened by low energy prices and muted underlying price pressures in the context of weak demand and significant slack in labour and product markets. The monetary policy measures that we have taken since early March are helping to preserve favourable financing conditions for all sectors and jurisdictions across the euro area, thereby providing crucial support to underpin economic activity and to safeguard medium-term price stability. At the same time, in the current environment of risks clearly tilted to the downside, the Governing Council will carefully assess the incoming information, including the dynamics of the pandemic, prospects for a rollout of vaccines and developments in the exchange rate. The new round of Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections in December will allow a thorough reassessment of the economic outlook and the balance of risks. On the basis of this updated assessment, the Governing Council will recalibrate its instruments, as appropriate, to respond to the unfolding situation and to ensure that financing conditions remain favourable to support the economic recovery and counteract the negative impact of the pandemic on the projected inflation path. This will foster the convergence of inflation towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry. In the meantime, we decided to reconfirm our accommodative monetary policy stance. We expect them to remain at their present or lower levels until we have seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2 percent within our projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics. We will continue our purchases under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) with a total envelope of €1,350 billion. These purchases contribute to easing the overall monetary policy stance, thereby helping to offset the downward impact of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation. The purchases will continue to be conducted in a flexible manner over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions. This allows us to effectively stave off risks to the smooth transmission of monetary policy. We will conduct net asset purchases under the PEPP until at least the end of June 2021 and, in any case, until the Governing Council judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over. We will reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2022. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance. Net purchases under our asset purchase programme (APP) will continue at a monthly pace of €20 billion, together with the purchases under the additional €120 billion temporary envelope until the end of the year. We continue to expect monthly net asset purchases under the APP to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of our policy rates, and to end shortly before we start raising the key ECB interest rates. We intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. We will also continue to provide ample liquidity through our refinancing operations. In particular, our third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO remains an attractive source of funding for banks, supporting bank lending to firms and households. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro area real GDP contracted by 11.8 percent, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2020. Following the trough in April 2020, the euro area economy rebounded strongly in the third quarter, making up about half of the contraction in the first half of the year. The significant surge in coronavirus infection rates and the associated intensification of containment measures since the summer constitute clear headwinds to the short-term outlook. In fact, recent hard data, survey results and high-frequency indicators point to a significant softening in economic activity in the final quarter of the year. Moreover, economic developments continue to be uneven across sectors. In particular, activity in the services sector is slowing again as it is the sector most affected by the new restrictions on social activities and mobility. Looking ahead, while the uncertainty related to the evolution of the pandemic will likely dampen the strength of the recovery in the labour market and in consumption and investment, the euro area economy should continue to be supported by favourable financing conditions and an expansionary fiscal stance. Overall, the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook are clearly tilted to the downside. This largely reflects the recent resurgence in COVID-19 infections, the associated intensification of containment measures and a highly uncertain timeline of the pandemic and its implications for economic and financial conditions. Euro area annual inflation decreased to -0.3 percent in September, from -0.2 percent in August, reflecting developments in the prices of energy, non-energy industrial goods and services. On the basis of oil price dynamics and taking into account the temporary reduction in German VAT, headline inflation is likely to remain negative until early 2021. Moreover, near-term price pressures will remain subdued owing to weak demand, notably in the tourism and travel-related sectors, as well as to lower wage pressures and the appreciation of the euro exchange rate. Once the impact of the pandemic fades, a recovery in demand, supported by accommodative fiscal and monetary policies, will put upward pressure on inflation over the medium term. Market-based indicators and survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations remain broadly unchanged at low levels. Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth rose to 10.4 percent in September 2020, from 9.5 percent in August, thus remaining well above the levels recorded before the COVID-19 pandemic. Strong money growth continues to reflect domestic credit expansion and the ongoing asset purchases by the Eurosystem, as well as precautionary considerations which foster a heightened preference for liquidity in the money-holding sector. In this environment, the narrow monetary aggregate M1, encompassing the most liquid forms of money, continues to be the main contributor to broad money growth. Developments in loans to the private sector continued to be shaped by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic activity. Following strong increases in the early months of the pandemic, the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations stood at 7.1 percent in September, unchanged from August. This, however, masks a moderation in recent monthly loan flows. The annual growth rate of loans to households edged up to 3.1 percent in September, from 3.0 percent in August. Growth in loans to the private sector continues to benefit from historically low bank lending rates. According to our bank lending survey for the third quarter of 2020, credit conditions on loans to firms tightened. While banks indicated that their funding and balance sheet conditions remain supportive, higher risk perceptions could weigh on their attitude towards loan creation. Surveyed banks reported a fall in firms' loan demand in the third quarter, reflecting a decline in emergency liquidity needs and weakening corporate investment. The survey indicates an increase in households' net demand for loans in the third quarter, while also suggesting the intention to tighten credit standards for households. Overall, our policy measures, together with the measures adopted by national governments and European institutions, remain essential to support access to financing, including for those most affected by the ramifications of the pandemic. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is necessary to support economic activity and the robust convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2 percent over the medium term. Regarding fiscal policies, an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance remains critical, in view of the sharp contraction in the euro area economy and the reduction in private demand. While fiscal measures taken in response to the pandemic emergency should, as much as possible, be targeted and temporary in nature, weak demand from firms and households and the heightened risk of a delayed recovery warrant continued support from national fiscal policies. The three safety nets endorsed by the European Council for workers, businesses and sovereigns provide important funding support in this context. The Governing Council recognises the key role of the Next Generation EU package and stresses the importance of it becoming operational without delay. Provided the funds are deployed for productive public spending and accompanied by productivity-enhancing structural policies. Next Generation EU will contribute to a faster, stronger and more uniform recovery and will increase economic resilience and the growth potential of Member States' economies, thereby supporting the effectiveness of monetary policy in the euro area. Such structural policies are particularly important in addressing long-standing structural and institutional weaknesses and in accelerating the green and digital transition."
Colombia,2020-10-30,"Vimeo live broadcast (Only in Spanish). Other measures taken by BR on account of COVID-19. Learn about the considerations of the BDBR for its decision. The Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica, at today's meeting, unanimously decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 1.75%. For this decision, the Board mainly took into account the following elements. Inflation is under control. Inflation in September stood at 1.97%, and inflation excluding food and regulated items stood at 1.67%. Inflation expectations from surveys to the end of 2021 stand at 2.8%, while two-year expectations embedded in public debt instruments are at 2.52%. The easing of isolation measures, the fiscal support for households and businesses, lower interest rates, and the ample liquidity provided by the Central Bank are facilitating the conditions for the recovery of economic activity. The situation in the labor market is worrisome. The latest available data suggest that the national unemployment rate remains high, consistent with the contraction of economic activity. However, it is expected to decrease in the fourth quarter of 2020 and stand within the range of 15.1% to 16.9%. Transmission mechanisms are working. The interest rates of the financial system have significantly reflected the reduction in the monetary policy rate. External financial conditions continue to be favorable to finance the Colombian economy. However, recent developments regarding the pandemic and reactions to contain a possible second wave have increased risk aversion globally. Under these conditions and taking into account the risk balance, the Board estimated that a 1.75% intervention rate maintains an expansionary monetary policy, thus supporting the recovery of the Colombian economy. It was deemed prudent to maintain the current policy stance pending further information on the shocks and the evolution of the variables that affect policy reaction. The decision to maintain the benchmark interest rate was approved unanimously by the members of the Board.

Malaysia,2020-11-03,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 1.75 percent. The global economy continues to recover, led by improvements in manufacturing and export activity. Latest indicators show that economic activity picked up in most advanced and regional economies, with a more pronounced recovery momentum in PR China. However, recent resurgences in COVID-19 cases have caused some major economies to re-introduce containment measures, although generally less restrictive than earlier measures. This suggests that the global economic recovery will likely remain uneven in the near-term. Financial conditions have improved, although risk aversion remains elevated. The overall outlook remains subject to downside risks, primarily due to the risk of further resurgence of COVID-19 infections which could lead to weaker business, employment and income conditions. For Malaysia, the latest indicators point towards significant improvement in economic activity in the third quarter. The introduction of targeted measures to contain COVID-19 in several states could affect the momentum of the recovery in the fourth quarter. Nonetheless, growth for the year 2020 is expected to be within the earlier forecasted range. For 2021, economic activity is projected to improve further. This will be underpinned by the recovery in global demand, turnaround in public and private sector expenditure amid continued support from policy measures, and higher production from existing and new facilities. Nevertheless, the pace of recovery will be uneven across sectors, with economic activity in some industries remaining below pre-pandemic levels, and a slower improvement in the labour market. Downside risks to the outlook remain, stemming mainly from ongoing uncertainties surrounding the pandemic globally and domestically. In line with earlier assessments, headline inflation is likely to average negative this year given the substantially lower global oil prices. For 2021, headline inflation is projected to average higher. The outlook, however, will continue to be significantly affected by global oil and commodity prices. Underlying inflation is expected to remain subdued in 2021 amid continued spare capacity in the economy. The MPC considers the stance of monetary policy to be appropriate and accommodative. The cumulative 125 basis points reduction in the OPR this year will continue to provide stimulus to the economy. The MPC will continue to assess evolving conditions and their implications on the overall outlook for inflation and domestic growth. The Bank remains committed to utilise its policy levers as appropriate to create enabling conditions for a sustainable economic recovery.

Czech Republic,2020-11-05,"At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank unanimously kept interest rates unchanged. The two-week repo rate thus remains at 0.25%, the discount rate at 0.05% and the Lombard rate at 1%.. The decision adopted by the Bank Board is underpinned by a new macroeconomic forecast. Consistent with the forecast is stability of market interest rates initially, followed by a gradual rise in rates in 2021. The current economic situation and the economic outlook are being fundamentally affected by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and the anti-pandemic measures gradually being adopted in the Czech Republic and abroad. The new forecast, including the said interest rate path, is therefore strongly conditional on the fulfilment of the assumptions made about the course of the epidemic situation and the anti-pandemic measures. The global economy is recording an unprecedented contraction this year owing to the coronavirus pandemic. Most euro area countries bottomed out in Q2. During the summer, their economies were gradually recovering from the anti-pandemic restrictions and lockdowns with fiscal and monetary policy support. However, the second wave of the pandemic in late 2020 and early 2021 will hold back the recovery in many countries and have adverse effects on consumer demand and firms' willingness to invest. The forecast expects growth abroad to recover next year after the second wave subsides. Growth abroad will be supported by still accommodative fiscal policy and the gradual start of drawdown from the EU Recovery and Resilience Facility. The previous drop in oil prices and weak demand pressures will cause euro area producer prices to decrease in 2020 as a whole. As a result of the low demand, consumer prices also started falling in most euro area countries in Q3, owing in part to the euro appreciating against the dollar. Euro area inflation will increase only slowly in the years ahead. The European Central Bank is keeping monetary conditions very easy. Short-term euro rates thus remain negative over the entire forecast outlook. The Brent crude oil price increased in 2020 Q3 and its outlook is slightly rising. The euro will continue to appreciate slightly against the dollar. Domestic economic activity is suffering a sharp contraction this year caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The Czech economy partly began to breathe again in the summer after most of the anti-epidemic measures from the first wave of the pandemic were lifted. However, the strong impact of the second wave of the pandemic and the reintroduced measures to counter the pandemic are leading to a repeated decline in economic output in the final quarter of this year. The downturn is particularly visible in services and retail and wholesale trade, which have been hit much harder by the government's anti-epidemic measures than industry. The latter is being affected less than in the spring given the so far limited economic impacts of targeted anti-epidemic measures abroad, the functioning global supply chains and the fully passable borders. However, the worse overall perceptions of the economic situation among Czech firms will continue to be reflected in a decline in private investment. By contrast, the negative impacts of the coronavirus pandemic are being softened by faster growth in government consumption coupled with stabilising fiscal measures. The latter are partly slowing the drop in household consumption. The negative economic impacts of the second wave of the pandemic are expected to subside during the first half of next year, when the economy will return to growth amid recovering external demand. However, the output of the Czech economy will not reach the pre-crisis level even by the end of 2022. Inflation will decrease into the tolerance band in late 2020 and early 2021. Administered price inflation will moderate, mainly due to slower growth in electricity prices. The decline in headline inflation will meanwhile be due in part to the anti-inflationary demand effects of the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic amid subdued external and above all domestic economic activity. However, the cost pressures will remain elevated for some time. A cooling labour market and slower wage growth will dampen growth in domestic costs, but this will be offset by the recent significant depreciation of the koruna. Inflation will fall next year, mainly due to a moderation of total cost growth. This will be linked partly with expected renewed appreciation of the koruna. The currently subdued domestic price pressures will increase again next year. This will be caused by the impacts of the pandemic subsiding and fostering a gradual recovery in domestic economic activity and related stabilisation of the labour market. Inflation will be close to the 2% target over the monetary policy horizon, i.e. in late 2021 and early 2022. Monetary policy-relevant inflation will merge with headline inflation in mid-2021, when the currently only marginal first-round effects of changes to indirect taxes will fade out fully. The koruna has depreciated markedly in recent weeks due to the reversal in global sentiment resulting from the start of the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic in the Czech Republic and other European countries. The expected gradual calming of the epidemic situation in Europe and the Czech Republic next year will foster renewed gradual appreciation. This will be caused by a widening interest rate differential amid a recovery in external demand and, in turn, domestic economic activity. Consistent with the forecast is stability of market interest rates initially, followed by a gradual rise in rates in 2021. The until recently strong inflationary effect of the domestic economy is being dampened significantly at the end of this year by the worse epidemic situation, which will negatively affect the domestic economy in the coming quarters. The expected subsequent fading of the negative effects of the second wave of the pandemic, the related renewed return of domestic and external economic activity towards pre-crisis levels, and inflation stabilising close to the target will allow a gradual shift away from the pronounced easing of the monetary conditions to start next year. The inflation outlook for the next few quarters has been lowered by comparison with the previous forecast. However, its expected level over the monetary policy horizon is virtually unchanged. The forecast for growth in domestic economic activity has been revised towards a smaller decline this year, owing to better-than-forecasted developments during the spring and summer. These will outweigh the negative impacts of the second wave of the pandemic at the year-end. By contrast, the outlook for next year has shifted towards markedly lower GDP growth as a result of the second wave. Domestic interest rates are slightly higher in the next two years. The koruna is rather weaker against the euro both this year and the next."
United States,2020-11-05,"EST November 5, 2020 The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals. The COVID-19 pandemic is causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. Economic activity and employment have continued to recover but remain well below their levels at the beginning of the year. Weaker demand and earlier declines in oil prices have been holding down consumer price inflation. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. The path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus. The ongoing public health crisis will continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation running persistently below this longer- run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved. The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, over coming months the Federal Reserve will (more) For release at 2 p.m. EST November 5, 2020 - 2 - increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities at least at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning and help foster accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H Powell. Chair; John C. Williams. Vice Chair; Michelle W Bowman; Lael Brainard; Richard H Clarida; Mary C. Daly; Patrick Harker; Robert S Kaplan; Loretta J Mester; and Randal K Quarles. Daly voted as an alternate member at this meeting."
Poland,2020-11-06,"Warsaw, 6 November 2020 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 6 November 2020 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: reference rate at 0.10%; lombard rate at 0.50%; deposit rate at 0.00%; rediscount rate at 0.11%; discount rate at 0.12%. NBP will continue to purchase government securities and government-guaranteed debt securities on the secondary market as part of the structural open market operations. The timing and scale of the operations will depend on the market conditions. Furthermore. NBP will offer bill discount credit aimed at refinancing loans granted to enterprises by banks. Incoming data confirm that following a sharp fall in global GDP in 2020 Q2, economic activity was recovering in Q3. The improvement in the global economic conditions had been supported by the earlier easing of the containment restrictions, the fiscal measures introduced, as well as the accompanying easing of monetary policy, including interest rate cuts and asset purchases by central banks. Despite the rebound, economic activity in most countries remained lower than before the outbreak of the pandemic. Recently, however, there has been a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 infections. As a consequence, many countries have once again tightened the pandemic restrictions. At the same time uncertainty about the further course of the pandemic as well as future economic conditions in the global economy has increased. The growing number of new COVID-19 cases has also contributed to a deterioration in global financial market sentiment, mirrored, among others, in a depreciation of emerging market currencies. Global commodity prices remain significantly lower than at the beginning of the year. Along with weaker economic activity, this has contributed to inflation staying at low levels in many countries, including Poland's main trading partners. In Poland, the incoming data also confirm a strong rebound in economic activity in 2020 Q3, after a significant fall in GDP in 2020 Q2. This is indicated by, in particular, data on retail sales and industrial output in September. This was accompanied by a certain improvement in the labour market situation, including higher wage growth in the corporate sector. At the same time, inflation in October  according to the Statistics Poland flash estimate  decreased to 3.0% y/y (compared to 3.2% y/y in September). The sharp increase in the number of new COVID-19 infections in the recent period and the tightening of the pandemic restrictions will contribute to a further deterioration in the economic conditions in 2020 Q4. In particular, domestic economic conditions will be held back by a decline in activity in the services sector, restrictions introduced in trade, increased uncertainty about the further course and effects of the pandemic and a deterioration in economic agents' sentiment. Domestic economic activity may be also limited by economic downturn in the environment of the Polish economy as well as by the lack of a visible and more durable zloty exchange rate adjustment to the global pandemic-driven shock and to the monetary policy easing introduced by NBP. In turn, the fall in the activity will be limited by the economic policy measures, including the easing of NBP's monetary policy. The Council became acquainted with the results of the November projection of inflation and GDP based on the NECMOD model. In line with the projection prepared under the assumption of unchanged NBP interest rates and taking into account data available until 4 November 2020, there is a 50-percent probability that the annual price growth will be in the range of 3.43.5% in 2020 (against 2.93.6% in the July 2020 projection), 1.83.2% in 2021 (compared to 0.32.2%) and 1.63.6% in 2022 (compared to 0.62.9%). At the same time, the annual GDP growth  according to this projection  will be with a 50-percent probability in the range of -4.1  -3.0% in 2020 (against -7.2  -4.2% in the July 2020 projection), 0.84.5% in 2021 (compared to 2.16.6%) and 3.87.8% in 2022 (compared to 1.96.0%). These operations are aimed at changing the long-term liquidity structure in the banking sector, ensuring the liquidity in the secondary markets for the purchased securities and enhancing the impact of the NBP interest rate cuts on the economy, i.e. strengthening the monetary policy transmission mechanism. NBP's monetary policy mitigates the negative economic impact of the pandemic, supports economic activity and stabilises inflation at the level consistent with the NBP's medium-term inflation target. Due to its positive impact on the financial situation of debtors, it is also conducive to the strengthening of financial system stability. The Council adopted the Inflation Report  November 2020 as well as the Opinion on the 2021 Draft Budget Act."
Egypt,2020-11-12,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release November 12, 2020 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation by 50 basis points to 825%, 925%, and 875%, respectivel. The discount rate was also cut by 50 basis points to 875. Annual headline urban inflation recorded 45% in October 2020 and 37% in September 2020 from 34% in August 202. The increase in annual headline inflation continued to be mainly driven by higher annual contribution of food items as well as regulated item. This comes as negative annual food inflation eased for the second consecutive mont. In the meantime, annual core inflation increased to 39% in October 2020 up from 33% in September 202. Nevertheless annual inflation rates continued to reflect muted inflationary pressure. Preliminary figures announced show that real GDP growth for FY 2019/20 recorded 36% compared to 56% a year earlie. Growth was dragged downwards in 2020 Q2, mainly due to the partial lockdown measures that were implemented to contain COVID-19, registering negative 17%, down from 50% in 2020 Q1. The pickup in consumption in 2020 Q2 was not enough to offset the combined contraction in investments, and to a lesser extent in net export. This was also reflected in the unemployment rate which recorded 96% in 2020 Q2 up from 77% in 2020 Q1. Meanwhile, leading indicators for 2020 Q3 continue to show gradual signs of recover. Globally economic activity remained weak despite some recovery, international oil prices broadly stabilized, and global financial conditions continued to improve, supported mainly by policy measures despite the ongoing uncertaint. The outlook for inflation in 2020 Q4 is estimated to be in the low single digits range, with increasing likelihood of coming under the inflation target floor of 6%, further confirming the muted inflationary pressures in the medium-ter. And because the path for current policy rates remains a function of medium-term inflation expectations rather than current inflation outturns, the MPC decided to cut key policy rates by 50 basis point. The reduction in key policy rates in today's MPC meeting provides appropriate support to economic activity, while remaining consistent with price stability over the medium ter. The MPC closely monitors all economic developments and will not hesitate to utilize all available tools to support the recovery of economic activity, within its price stability mandat.

Mexico,2020-11-12,"Banco de Mexico's Governing Board decided to maintain the target for the overnight interbank interest rate at 4.25%, effective November 13, 2020. Global economic activity has been recovering, although heterogeneously among countries and sectors and at a slower pace than that observed between May and June. Inflation in advanced economies remains below the targets of their central banks, which have reiterated their intention to maintain accommodative monetary policy stances for an extended period. The world economy and international financial markets are subject to several risks, among which are the evolution of the pandemic, the sufficiency of fiscal stimuli to support the recovery, trade tensions, and the worsening of social and geopolitical conflicts. Since the last monetary policy decision, the Mexican peso exhibited volatility and appreciated, while interest rates registered moderate adjustments: short term to the downside, and long term to the upside. The latest information suggests that after having contracted markedly during the second quarter, economic activity in Mexico started to recover during the third, although it remains below the levels prior to the pandemic in an environment of uncertainty and downward risks. Ample slack conditions are expected throughout the time frame in which monetary policy operates. Annual headline inflation rose from 4.01% to 4.09% between September and October 2020, reflecting an increase in its non-core component, especially in the annual rates of change of fruits and vegetable prices. Core inflation was 3.98% in October and its recomposition continues, with increases in merchandises and reductions in services. Headline inflation expectations for the end of 2020 rose, while those for the medium and long terms remained stable at levels above the 3% target. The challenges for monetary policy posed by the pandemic include both the significant impact on economic activity as well as a financial shock and their effects on inflation. The recent behavior of headline and core inflation, and of the factors that affect them, imply a slight increase in the foreseen trajectories within the forecast horizon, although those for the next 12-24 months are expected to be around 3%. These forecasts are subject to short and medium term risks. To the downside: a greater- than-expected effect due to the negative output gap; lower inflationary pressures worldwide; and, greater social distancing measures that lower the demand for goods and services. To the upside: episodes of foreign exchange depreciation; persistence of core inflation at high levels; and, logistical problems and higher costs associated with the sanitary measures. The balance of risks for the projected trajectory of inflation described above is uncertain. The risks for inflation, economic activity and financial markets pose major challenges for monetary policy and for the economy in general. Considering the mentioned forecasts for inflation and the convenience of consolidating a downward path for headline and core inflation towards the 3% target, with the presence of all its members. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board decided by majority to maintain the target for the 1 overnight interbank interest rate at 4.25%. One member voted for lowering the policy rate to a level of 4.00%. This pause provides the necessary room to confirm that the trajectory of inflation converges to the target. Looking ahead, monetary policy implementation will depend on the evolution of the factors that have an incidence on headline and core inflation, on their foreseen trajectories within the forecast horizon, and on their expectations. The Governing Board will take the necessary actions on the basis of incoming information in order for the policy rate to be consistent with the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to Banco de Mexico's target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates. Perseverance in strengthening the macroeconomic fundamentals and adopting the necessary actions regarding both monetary and fiscal policies will contribute to a better adjustment of domestic financial markets and of the economy as a whole."
Peru,2020-11-12,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT NOVEMBER 2020 BCRP MAINTAINED REFERENCE RATE AT 0.25% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to continue its expansionary policy stance, maintaining the reference rate at 0.25 percent and implementing further liquidity injection operations, in light of the following developments: Inflation in 2020 and 2021 is expected to be around the lower limit of the target range due to a significant weakening of domestic demand. One-year ahead expected inflation was 1.6 percent in October. Year-on-year inflation decreased from 1.8 percent in September to 1.7 percent in October, while trend inflation remains in the lower part of the target range. Leading indicators continued to show a significant recovery as of October, although they remain below last year's levels, while firms' growth expectations continued to recover in October. Global economic activity has been improving, but remains below last year's levels. The BCRP will continue to take the necessary steps to sustain the payments system and credit flows. As of November 11, the BCRP's liquidity injection operations totaled S/ 61.7 billion, of which S/ 50.2 billion were associated with government-backed repos. In this context, credit to the private sector grew 14.1 percent year-on-year in September, with interest rates declining steadily since April. The Board considers it appropriate to maintain a strong expansionary monetary stance for as long as the negative effects of the pandemic on inflation and its determinants persist. The BCRP stands ready to expand monetary stimulus using a range of instruments. The Board also decided to maintain the following interest rates on its window facility operations in domestic currency with financial entities: Overnight deposits: 0.15 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 0.50 percent per year. The BCRP Board's next monetary policy session will take place on December 10, 2020."
Romania,2020-11-12,"In its meeting of 12 November 2020, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided the following:. Global and European economies saw a strong, albeit partial, rebound in Q3, thanks to fiscal and monetary policy support, but their near-term outlook deteriorated visibly, under the impact of the new pandemic wave and the tightening of the related containment measures. On the domestic front, the incoming data and information since the NBR Board meeting held in August also show a larger-than-expected upturn in the economy over the summer, supported by government programmes and the NBR's monetary policy measures. However, the recovery will probably come to a halt towards the end of the year or even see a slight reversal amid the resurgence of the pandemic and the mobility restrictions. The annual CPI inflation rate decelerated to 2.45 percent in September (2.68 percent in August) and to 2.24 percent in October, running thus visibly below the projected level, mainly amid the much larger-than-expected decline in the prices of fruit and vegetables. The inflation rate therefore recorded a decrease versus the last month of Q2, when it stood at 2.58 percent, and an even larger fall when compared to the 4.04 percent level seen at end-2019. The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate (which excludes from the CPI inflation administered prices, volatile prices, and tobacco product and alcoholic beverage prices) was, however, flat in Q3 and posted only a minor decrease in October, in line with forecasts, reaching 3.6 percent from 3.7 percent in June. Its evolution is further marked by the pre-pandemic underlying inflationary pressures, amid, inter alia, the recovery of consumer demand in Q3, to which add influences, albeit slightly milder, from supply-side disruptions/constraints and higher costs associated with the pandemic and with the measures to prevent the coronavirus spread. Average annual CPI inflation rate and average annual inflation rate calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices dropped to 2.9 percent and 2.7 percent respectively in October from 3.3 percent and 3.2 percent respectively in June. In line with expectations, the economy witnessed a severe contraction in 2020 Q2, by 10.3 percent in annual terms and by 11.9 percent in quarterly terms, under the impact of the pandemic and the restrictive measures imposed during the state of emergency. The main driver of the decline was the plunge in household consumption, whereas gross fixed capital formation continued to rise mildly amid the hike in equipment purchases and the resilience of the construction activity. The annual dynamics of general government consumption remained in the two-digit range, albeit on a slight decrease versus the previous quarter. Furthermore, the massive fall in exports of goods and services outpaced visibly the drop in imports thereof, causing the annual dynamics of the negative trade balance to step up again. The current account deficit continued, however, to narrow in annual terms due to the improved dynamics of the primary and secondary income balances, on account of the returns on equity holdings and inflows of EU funds. The latest developments in high-frequency indicators show a more sizeable rebound in the economy in Q3 than previously anticipated, albeit uneven from a sectoral perspective. Thus, in July-August, in terms of annual dynamics, retail trade and motor vehicles and motorcycles sales returned to positive territory, coming again close to the volumes seen in February or even surpassing them, whereas the annual rate of change of services to households remained negative, but shrank to a third of that in the previous quarter. In addition, the annual increase in the volume of construction works stepped up slightly, while industrial output and the new orders in manufacturing recovered most of the decline in Q2; conversely, net direct investment flows saw a notable contraction in July-August as against the same year-earlier period. At the same time, the annual dynamics of trade deficit accelerated again in September, after the deceleration in the first two months of Q3. Financial market conditions continued to improve under the impact of the three successive policy rate cuts and on the back of the liquidity provided by the central bank to credit institutions, conducive to the adequate financing of the real economy and the public sector, amid the relative stability of the EUR/RON exchange rate. Preserving confidence in the domestic currency, in the context of widening twin deficits, is a key element of monetary policy conduct this year, implying a gradual and sustainable reduction in interest rates on the money market and on leu-denominated loans. Key interbank money market rates stuck to a downtrend in the past months, albeit relatively slower and marked recently by some small fluctuations, while yields on government securities extended their downward course, with 10Y bonds hitting four-year lows. The average lending rate on new business to non-bank clients went further down in Q3, dropping at the end of the quarter to the lowest reading in almost three years. The recent fluctuations of the EUR/RON exchange rate  brought about by the heightened global risk aversion amid the resurgence of the pandemic crisis, but also by domestic political decisions posing risks to public finance sustainability  have been far more moderate than those in the region. The annual dynamics of credit to the private sector followed a slightly steeper upward path in September, after the shift in direction seen in August, reaching 4.0 percent, from 3.6 percent in July, amid the rebound in domestic currency lending, especially to non-financial corporations, also upheld by the IMM Invest Romania Programme. The share of leu-denominated loans in total private sector credit widened to 68.8 percent, hitting a record-high for the post-January 1996 period. In today's meeting, the NBR Board examined and approved the November 2020 Inflation Report, which incorporates the latest available data and information. The new scenario partly reconfirms the expected trajectory of the annual inflation rate highlighted in the previous forecast, with a significant downward revision only over the short-term horizon. Specifically, the annual inflation rate is anticipated to decline further in the near future, to markedly lower values than previously envisaged, before climbing and remaining thereafter close to the mid-point of the target over the policy-relevant horizon, the same as in previous forecasts. At the same time, the outlook for adjusted CORE2 inflation is fully reconfirmed, as its annual rate is seen decelerating only slightly at end-2020, but much more visibly afterwards, declining in the latter part of next year and thereafter remaining slightly below the mid-point of the target, amid the disinflationary effects from the aggregate demand deficit. The uncertainties surrounding the new macroeconomic projections continue to be extremely elevated in the current environment, triggering two-way risks to the inflation outlook over the projection horizon. Their major source remains, at least in the short run, the coronavirus pandemic and the related containment measures  in the context of the new wave that gains increasing momentum , as well as their impact on the domestic and European/global economies. Heightened uncertainties and risks stem from the outlook of the fiscal and income policy stance, especially in the absence of the draft budget for 2021 and in the electoral context, given the potentially sharper increase in budget expenditures this year  with knock-on effects on future budget executions and hence on the sovereign risk premium , as well as the budget consolidation necessary to be initiated in the near run; the impact of the consolidation could be partly counterbalanced by the intake of European funds allocated to Romania via the EU's recently-agreed economic recovery package and multiannual budget. Significant uncertainties and risks also stem from the external environment, given the relatively more robust recovery of European economies in Q3, which could nevertheless be halted or even reversed slightly by the new pandemic wave and the associated containment measures. In today's meeting, based on the currently available data and assessments, but also in light of the extremely elevated uncertainty, the NBR Board decided to keep the monetary policy rate at 1.50 percent per annum; moreover, it decided to leave unchanged the deposit facility rate at 1.00 percent per annum and the lending (Lombard) facility rate at 2.00 percent per annum. Given the developments in foreign currency lending and the adequate level of forex reserves, the NBR Board decided to cut the minimum reserve requirement ratio on foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions to 5 percent from 6 percent starting with the 24 November  23 December 2020 maintenance period. The measure also aims to continue the harmonisation of the minimum reserve requirements mechanism with the relevant standards and practices of the European Central Bank and the major central banks across the European Union. The minimum reserve requirement ratio on leu-denominated liabilities remains unchanged at 8 percent. The NBR Board considers that such a calibration of the monetary policy conduct is likely to provide an underpinning to the recovery of economic activity over the projection horizon with a view to bringing and strengthening over the medium term the annual inflation rate in line with the 2.5 percent ±1 percentage point inflation target, while safeguarding financial stability. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be published on 13 November 2020 at 12:00 p.m. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR's website on 24 November 2020, at 3:00 p.m."
Hungary,2020-11-17,"At its meeting on 17 November 2020, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 18 November 2020:. The primary objective of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) is to achieve and maintain price stability. Without prejudice to its primary objective, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank preserves financial stability and supports the Government's economic policy. Global macroeconomic and financial developments continue to be driven mainly by the events of the coronavirus pandemic and the news related to the development of the vaccine. Following a decline in the second quarter of 2020, the performance of large economies showed significant reversal in the third quarter, although it continued to fall short of the level seen a year earlier. Since mid-October, infection curves in several countries have risen sharply; therefore, governments decided to take restrictive measures. Due to the increasingly stronger restrictions introduced, the economic recovery is expected to be delayed. As a result, there remains an exceptionally high uncertainty surrounding the rate of global economic recovery. Sentiment in global financial markets has been volatile recently. This primarily reflected developments in the current pandemic situation, the reintroduction of restrictive measures and their tightening and the events of the US presidential elections. The world's leading central banks did not change their monetary conditions. According to market expectations, euro area inflation may remain in negative territory until the beginning of 2021, and the economic recovery seen in the summer months was halted in the autumn and restoration is expected to be delayed. The ECB may decide to introduce additional easing measures or to modify its instruments in the light of the December projection. In the CEE region, central banks held policy rates close to zero, and the Polish and Romanian central banks continued their government securities purchase programmes. Due to the protracted economic recovery, the world's leading central banks and those in the region are expected to maintain loose monetary conditions over a prolonged period. Based on data for the third quarter, economic activity underwent a significant correction after reaching a low point in April and May. According to the preliminary release by the HCSO. Hungary's GDP rose by 11.3 percent relative to the previous quarter and it fell short of the level, seen a year earlier, by 4.6 percent. The recovery in the volume of retail sales following its low point in April was halted in September, while the rapid reversal of industrial production continued. The unemployment rate fell in the third quarter of 2020 relative to the previous quarter, and it remained at a low level of 4.4 percent in international comparison. So far, the corporate sector has responded to the challenges arising from COVID-19 primarily by raising the ratio of part-time workers, partly as a result of the Government's measures. At the onset of the second wave of coronavirus, the economic recovery slowed and the additional significant restrictive measures, introduced to control the pandemic, may cause a delay in the restoration of economic growth. As a result of the second wave of the pandemic, the economic recovery is expected to stall in the fourth quarter of 2020 before it continues from 2021. According to the MNB's September projection. Hungary's GDP is expected to decline by between 5.1 percent and 6.8 percent in 2020, which may be followed by growth between 4.4 percent and 6.8 percent in 2021. Economic performance may recover to its pre-crisis level by the turn of 2022. In October 2020, annual inflation was 3.0 percent and core inflation excluding indirect tax effects stood at 3.2 percent. The value of both indicators declined relative to the previous month. Following the higher repricing in the summer months, from September, disinflationary effects strengthened. Consistent with this, the autumn months were characterised by gradually declining price dynamics primarily due to market services, food and fuel. Developments in underlying inflation are still expected to be driven by the overall balance of the upside effects of supply-demand frictions and the growing disinflationary impact of weak demand. As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, pricing decisions continue to exhibit increased volatility and an unusual seasonal pattern in the coming quarters. The persistence of inflationary effects arising as a result of the economic recovery will also be important for the time profile of the decline in underlying inflation, which the Monetary Council will closely monitor. According to the October EDP report, the government deficit will amount to around 8 percent of GDP in 2020. The debt-to-GDP ratio is likely to rise temporarily in 2020 but is expected to move onto a downward path from 2021 once economic growth is restored and the deficit decreases. The current account balance is expected to show a slight deficit in 2020 and then to improve gradually. With Hungary's net lending position remaining persistently stable, the country's external debt ratios will continue to decrease in the coming years. In the Monetary Council's assessment, consistent with the risk scenario highlighted in the September Inflation Report, the increase in risk aversion vis-a-vis emerging markets continues to pose the greatest risk in terms of the outlook for inflation. It is the MNB's clear intention to prevent the current uncertain global market environment from causing an increase in upside risks to inflation. It is a key priority for the MNB that short-term rates in every sub-market and at all times should develop consistently with the level of short-term rates deemed optimal by the Monetary Council. In order to ensure this, the Bank reintroduced its swap facility providing foreign currency liquidity in September. Due to the Bank's active presence, there was no tension in the swap market at the end of the third quarter. Measures taken at the short end of the yield curve contribute to preserving the stability of monetary conditions and through this to maintaining price stability. In response to the adverse economic effects arising from the coronavirus pandemic, the MNB expanded significantly the central bank balance sheet and thereby supporting the recovery of economic growth as well. The central bank balance sheet has contracted in recent years creating sufficient potential to address economic challenges in a sustainable manner. The MNB's balance sheet can still be considered of average size in regional comparison, despite a significant expansion this year. The MNB will be ready to expand its balance sheet further to manage risks arising from the coronavirus pandemic and to foster the quick recovery of sustainable economic growth. At its meeting today, the Monetary Council performed the technical revision of its government securities purchase programme. In the Monetary Council assessment, the programme has been successful. The stock of government securities in the Bank's balance sheet has increased by over HUF 700 billion since May 2020. Government securities purchases by the Bank contributed to maintaining a stable liquidity position in the government securities market and strengthened the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission. The MNB continues to use the government securities purchase programme and to settle for a lasting market presence in the government securities market. The MNB will use the programme to the extent and to the time necessary. The Bank applies a flexible approach to the amount of its weekly purchases, concentrating its purchases on longer maturities. The Council has proceeded without setting a total amount to the government securities programme. The Monetary Council will perform the next technical revision when the stock of purchases reaches HUF 2,000 billion while continuously monitoring the implementation of its asset purchase programme. The utilisation of the Funding for Growth Scheme Go! exceeded HUF 1,000 billion by mid-November; therefore, at its meeting today, the Monetary Council decided to raise the total amount of programme by HUF 1,000 billion as well. The FGS Go! plays a key role in mitigating the adverse economic effects of coronavirus as it offers cheap funding with reliable rates to the SME sector with the most favourable conditions ever and a wide range of applications. There has been significant interest by companies in the FGS Go! since it was launched in April. Under the scheme, 15,000 companies have accessed favourable funding until mid-November. During the economic recovery, it is of key importance for the Monetary Council to provide the amount of funding required for the continuous operations of SMEs and the realisation of their investment projects, which also fosters the recovery of economic growth. By the end of October 2020, over 260 companies registered for the Bond Funding for Growth Scheme. By the end of the period, 35 companies successfully issued 40 bond series, raising more than HUF 680 billion. The MNB will continue to sterilise the resulting surplus liquidity issued under the programmes in full, using the preferential deposit instrument. At its meeting today, the Monetary Council left the base rate and the overnight deposit rate unchanged at 0.60 percent and -0.05 percent, respectively, and the overnight and the one-week collateralised lending rates at 1.85 percent. The MNB will continue to set the one-week deposit rate at weekly tenders, in response to the increase in risk aversion vis-a-vis emerging markets. The Bank will maintain the difference between the base rate and the one-week deposit rate as long as warranted by inflationary risks. In the Monetary Council's assessment, the monetary conditions established at the short end support price stability, the preservation of financial stability and the recovery of economic growth in a sustainable manner. In the current rapidly changing environment, it is key to maintain short-term yields at a safe distance from a range close to zero. The MNB remains committed to maintaining price stability during the coronavirus pandemic. Consequently, the Council continuously assesses incoming data, closely monitors the persistence of inflationary effects resulting from the restoration of the economy and the possible inflationary effects of financial market developments. If warranted by a change in the outlook for inflation, the MNB will be ready to use the appropriate instruments."
Philippines,2020-11-18,"At its meeting on monetary policy today, the Monetary Board decided to cut the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase facility by 25 basis points to 2.0 percent, effective Friday, 20 November 2020. The interest rates on the overnight deposit and lending facilities were likewise reduced to 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively. Latest baseline forecasts continue to indicate a benign inflation environment over the policy horizon, with inflation expectations remaining firmly anchored within the target range of 2-4 percent. Average inflation is seen to settle within the lower half of the target band for 2020 up to 2022, reflecting slower domestic economic activity, lower global crude oil prices, and the recent appreciation of the peso. The balance of risks to the inflation outlook also remains tilted toward the downside owing largely to potential disruptions to domestic and global economic activity amid the ongoing pandemic. Meanwhile, uncertainty remains elevated amid the resurgence of COVID-19 cases globally. However, the Monetary Board also observed that global economic prospects havemoderated in recent weeks. At the same time, the Monetary Board noted that while domestic output contracted at a slower pace in the third quarter of 2020, muted business and household sentiment and the impact of recent natural calamities could pose strong headwinds to the recovery of the economy in the coming months. Given these considerations, the Monetary Board assessed that there remains a critical need for continuing policy support measures to bolster economic activity and boost market confidence. With a benign inflation environment and stable inflation expectations, the Monetary Board sees enough policy space for a reduction in the policy rate at thistime to uplift market sentiment and nurture the country's economic recovery amid increased downside risks to growth. Looking ahead, the BSP stands ready to deploy its full arsenal of instruments as needed in fulfillment of its mandate to maintain price and financial stability conducive to sustainable economic growth."
Thailand,2020-11-18,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 7/2020 Mr. Titanun Mallikamas. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 18 November 2020 as follows. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 050 percent to support economic recovery while placing emphasis on more targeted measures. The Committee assessed that despite the recent better-than-expected outturn, the Thai economy would recover slowly and need support from the continued low policy rate. Nonetheless the economic recovery would remain fragile and highly uncertain. The Committee thus voted to maintain the policy rate at this meeting and to preserve the limited policy space in order to act at the appropriate and most effective timing. The Thai economy in the third quarter of 2020 improved more than expected. However the recovery would remain slow and vary significantly among economic sectors. Overall economic activities were projected to take approximately two years before returning to the pre-pandemic level. Consequently the labor market would remain fragile, especially as labor incomes remained low. This would in turn weigh on private consumption, particularly among low-income households, following a phase-out of temporary supporting factors. Public expenditure was expected to be lower than previously assessed. The financial system remained sound, despite increasing vulnerabilities given the economic outlook and risks to the financial positions of businesses and households. Meanwhile headline inflation would be less negative in line with increasing energy prices and would stay close to the lower bound of the target range in 2021. Medium-term inflation expectations remained anchored within the target. Despite ample liquidity in the financial system and low financing costs, some businesses, especially SMEs, and households in need of liquidity have not gained access to credits. The baht appreciated rapidly against the US dollar owing to risk-on sentiment following the US presidential election outcome and the progress of COVID-19 vaccine development. The Committee expressed concerns over the rapid appreciation of the baht as this affected the fragile economic recovery. Therefore the Committee would closely monitor developments in foreign exchange markets and capital flows as well as consider the necessity of implementing additional appropriate measures. The Committee viewed that policy coordination among government agencies would be critical to support the economic recovery going forward. Monetary policy must remain accommodative. Financial and credit measures should expedite liquidity distribution to the affected groups in a targeted and timely manner, and financial institutions should accelerate debt restructuring to have a broader impact. Fiscal measures continued to play an important role in shoring up the economy. The government should thus accelerate budget disbursement and assist the vulnerable target groups. In addition, implementation of supply-side policies should be accelerated to support business restructuring and upskilling of labor, which would help support sustainable economic recovery in the long term. Under the monetary policy framework with objectives of maintaining price stability, supporting sustainable and full-potential economic growth, and preserving financial stability, the Committee continued to put emphasis on supporting economic recovery. The Committee would monitor the adequacy of the government measures and various risks, including domestic political uncertainties, progress of protocols for admitting foreign tourists, and financial position of businesses and households, in deliberating monetary policy going forward. The Committee would stand ready to use additional appropriate monetary policy tools if necessary."
Turkiye,2020-11-19,"The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to:. - increase the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) from 10.25 percent to 15 percent, and. #NAME? Global economic activity has recovered partially in the third quarter. However, uncertainties regarding global economic activity heightened due to the recent increase in Covid-19 cases. The recovery in economic activity continues. Partial restrictions introduced due to the increasing number of cases heighten uncertainties on the short-run outlook of economic activity, particularly the services sector. Besides, strengthening domestic demand, due to the lagged effects of strong credit impulse during the pandemic, affects the current account balance adversely through the imports channel. The lagged effects of depreciation in Turkish lira, increasing international food prices and deterioration in inflation expectations affect the inflation outlook adversely. While tracked data for November point to an increase in inflation due to the recent exchange rate volatility, this is assessed to be temporary with the decisive monetary policy stance. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to implement a transparent and strong monetary tightening in order to eliminate risks to the inflation outlook, contain inflation expectations and restore the disinflation process. In the periods ahead, all factors affecting inflation will be taken into account, and the tightness of monetary policy will be decisively sustained until a permanent fall in inflation is achieved. The permanent establishment of a low inflation environment will affect macroeconomic and financial stability positively through the fall in country risk premium, reversal in the dollarization trend, accumulation of foreign exchange reserves and the perpetual decline in financing costs. The Central Bank will attain its main objective of achieving and maintaining price stability by adopting transparency, predictability and accountability principles of the inflation targeting regime. In light of these principles, the Central Bank funding will be provided through the one-week repo rate, which will be the main policy tool and the only indicator for the monetary stance. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
South Africa,2020-11-19,"PRESS STATEMENT EMBARGO DELIVERY 19 November 2020 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the September meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), it has become clear that Covid-19 infections will occur in waves of higher and lower intensity, caused in large part by pandemic fatigue and lapses in safety protocols. The virus is spreading rapidly in parts of North America and Europe and hotspots have emerged in some parts of South Africa. While we have learned how to better manage the risks of transmission and the design of lockdowns, these waves of infection will continue for some time. Fresh spread of the virus and reimposed lockdowns will extend the time needed for economies to get back to pre-pandemic activity levels. Despite the welcome development in November of successful vaccine trials, global distribution of vaccines is likely to be slow, resulting in a modest pace of global economic growth into 2021. As expected, second quarter GDP outcomes for most economies were massively negative. Third quarter recoveries have generally been robust and economies will continue to recover in the fourth quarter. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) now expects global gross domestic product (GDP) to contract by about 4.4% this year. MPC Statement 19 November 2020 Page 1. MPC Statement 19 November 2020 Page 1 Although global GDP forecasts improved from September, it is probable that global growth will be revised somewhat in coming months.1 While financial asset prices have been volatile for much of the year due to pandemic- related developments and geopolitical events, recent weeks have seen markets strengthen. Capital flows to emerging markets have generally picked up when compared to the outflows experienced in March and April, and global policy rates look set to remain accommodative. Nonetheless, pronounced levels of risk aversion are likely to persist through 2021, particularly where economies fail to grow or run large external imbalances, fiscal deficits and high debt levels. Locally, further easing of lockdown restrictions has supported economic growth, with high frequency indicators continuing to show a pickup in economic activity during August and September. The Bank's forecast of third quarter GDP growth has been revised up to 50.3% quarter on quarter, seasonally adjusted and annualised. The growth rate for the full year is now expected to be -8.0%, compared to the contraction of 8.2% expected at the time of the September. South Africa's terms of trade remain robust. Commodity export prices are high, while oil prices remain generally low. Getting back to pre-pandemic output levels, however, will take time. Sharply lower investment this year by both public and private sectors will weigh on growth prospects in coming years. GDP is now expected to grow by 3.5% in 2021 and by 2.4% in 2022.2 Overall, risks to the growth outlook are assessed to be balanced, but this is tentative and open to adjustment given the wide range of shocks hitting the economy, 1 Global growth in the QPM model is a trade-weighted average of South Africa's trading partners. For 2020 this is now at -3.9% (up from -4.2% in September) and revised down to 4.5% for 2021. Based on the October 2020 World Economic Outlook, the IMF expects global growth of 5.2% in 2021. 2 Compared to 3.9% and 2.6%, respectively, in September. MPC Statement 19 November 2020 Page 2. MPC Statement 19 November 2020 Page 2 uncertainties involving the effectiveness of policy, and the sensitivity of sentiment to news flow. The somewhat stronger growth in 2020 and a small downward revision to growth in 2021 implies little change in the size of the output gap over the forecast period, compared to the September meeting. The accommodative policies in many advanced economies and the improved economic outlook have supported a partial recovery in global financial markets. But this has so far resulted in only a trickle of fresh capital flows to emerging markets, and financing conditions remain uncertain. South Africa's high public financing needs have been met instead by local private sector savings and borrowing from international financial institutions. Yields have eased in recent months due to higher purchases of sovereign bonds by resident investors, including banks, alongside SARB liquidity- management operations. However, the yield curve remains exceptionally steep, reflecting elevated levels of risk associated with high public borrowing needs.3 Better global economic and financial conditions saw the rand appreciate by 6.9% since the September meeting. The rand has, however, depreciated by 8.7% against the USD since January and remains below its estimated long-run equilibrium value. The implied starting point for the rand forecast is R16.50 to the US dollar, compared with R16.90 at the time of the previous meeting. The Bank's headline consumer price inflation forecast averages 3.2% in 2020 and is slightly lower than previously forecast at 3.9% in 2021 and remains at 4.4% in 2022. The forecast for core inflation is lower at 3.3% in 2020, at 3.4% in 2021, and remains stable at 4.0% in 2022. 3 Measured by the EMBI+ premium over emerging market averages and as an absolute value over time. MPC Statement 19 November 2020 Page 3. MPC Statement 19 November 2020 Page 3 The overall risks to the inflation outlook appear to be to the downside in the near term and balanced over the medium term. Global producer price inflation and oil prices remain low.4 Local food price inflation is expected to remain contained. The Committee additionally notes the significant but likely temporary reduction in medical insurance price inflation for next year. Given low pass-through, risks to inflation from currency depreciation are expected to stay muted. However, additional exchange rate pressures could result from heightened fiscal risks. While there are no demand side pressures evident, electricity and other administered prices remain a concern. Importantly, expectations of future inflation continued to moderate this year and have shifted slightly below the mid-point of the band for 2021. Market-based expectations for short and medium-term inflation have eased slightly, while longer-term inflation expectations remain higher.5 The Committee notes that the slow recovery will keep inflation below the midpoint of the target range for this year and next. Unless risks outlined earlier materialise, inflation is expected to be well contained over the medium-term, remaining below but close to the midpoint in 2021 and 2022. Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to keep rates unchanged at 3.5% per annum. Two members of the committee preferred a 25 basis point cut and three preferred to hold rates at the current level. 4 Our assumptions are now for oil prices to average about $40 per barrel in 2020, rising to $45 per barrel in 2021 and $50 per barrel in 2022. 5 The latest Bureau for Economic Research (BER) survey has expectations for 2020 down by 0.3 ppts to 3.6% and to 4.2% (from 3.9 and 4.5%) for 2021. Five-year-ahead inflation expectations eased from 4.7% to 4.5%. Household inflation expectations down from 6.2% to 5.9%. Market analysts (Reuters Econometer) expect inflation to remain unchanged at 3.3% for 2020, lower at 3.9% in 2021 and unchanged at 4.4% in 2022. Market-based rates are calculated from the break-even inflation rate, which is the yield differential between conventional and inflation-linked bonds. These sit at 3.15% for the 5-year and 4.91% on the 10-year breakeven. 15-year breakeven inflation sits at 6.1%. MPC Statement 19 November 2020 Page 4. MPC Statement 19 November 2020 Page 4 The implied policy rate path of the Quarterly Projection Model (QPM) indicates no further repo rate cuts in the near term, and two increases of 25 basis points in the third and fourth quarters of 2021. Monetary policy has eased financial conditions and improved the resilience of households and firms to the economic implications of Covid-19 and continues to be accommodative. The Bank has taken important steps to ensure adequate liquidity in domestic markets. Regulatory capital relief has also been provided, sustaining lending by financial institutions to households and firms. Monetary policy however cannot on its own improve the potential growth rate of the economy or reduce fiscal risks. These should be addressed by implementing prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms that lower costs generally, and increase investment opportunities, potential growth and job creation. Consistently aligning administered prices and productivity-adjusted wage setting with projected inflation would generate important macroeconomic gains. Such steps will enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy and its transmission to the broader economy. Economic and financial conditions are expected to remain volatile for the foreseeable future. In this highly uncertain environment, policy decisions will continue to be data dependent and sensitive to the balance of risks to the outlook. The MPC will seek to look through temporary price shocks and focus on second round effects. As usual, the repo rate projection from the QPM remains a broad policy guide, changing from meeting to meeting in response to new data and risks.

Mongolia,2020-11-23,"MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Lowering the policy rate, reducing banks' reserve requirement, extending the maturity of consumer loans, and introducing a long-term refinancing instrument Number: 2020/06 Date: November 23, 2020 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) held an unscheduled meeting on November 23, 2020 in light of recent lockdown measures taken due to the state of public preparedness declared in response to the domestic spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. At this meeting, the MPC decided to: 1. lower the policy rate by 2 percentage points to 6 percent; 2. reduce the reserve requirement on banks' domestic currency liabilities by 2.5 percentage points to 6 percent; 3. to continue to implement restructuring and extension of the maturity of consumer loans with repayment difficulties by 12 months until July 1, 2021; 4. introduce a long-term refinancing instrument aimed at supporting SMEs and non-mining exports. This set of decisions is directed at minimizing the adverse effects rising in the economy, as well as the banking and financial sectors, and to lighten the financial burdens of individuals, businesses and financial institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the decisions were aimed at ensuring financial and economic stability in the medium-term without missing the inflation target. Annual headline inflation is 2.4 percent nationwide and 2.6 percent in Ulaanbaatar city as of October, 2020. In the coming months, inflation will increase marginally due to the base effect, but is expected to remain subdued and below the target of 6 percent, owing to weaker economic activity. The economy contracted 9.7 percent in the first half of 2020 as a result of the COVID- 19 pandemic; however, by the end of the third quarter, the contraction has slowed to -3.1 percent and the outlook of balance of payments has improved. While the lockdown measures imposed in November to curb local spread of the pandemic have the positive effect of protecting public health in the medium to long term, they are expected to delay recovery by curtailing economic activity in the short term. The indicators of the real economy, financial markets and commodity markets show that the global economy has been recovering in the second half of 2020. Although early clinical trials of several vaccines have been successful and are nearing completion, the second and third waves of the virus have continued in many countries, and uncertainty in the economic outlook remains elevated. The monetary and macroprudential policy measures, taken step-by-step to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, increase financing and reduce the costs of financing for SMEs and non-mining exports, and thus, slow the domestic economic downturn and ensure the stability of the banking sector. The Bank of Mongolia will continue to take prudent measures to prevent credit crunch in the banking system while supporting the liquidity of banks, households and businesses. Extracts of the meeting minutes will be released in two weeks on the Bank of Mongolia's website. MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE."
Pakistan,2020-11-23,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement November 23, 2020. At its meeting on 23rd November 2020, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain the policy rate at percent. The MPC noted that since the last meeting in September, the domestic recovery has gradually gained traction, in line with expectations for growth of slightly above percent in FY21, and business sentiment has improved further. Nevertheless there are risks to the outlook. The recent rise in Covid cases in Pakistan and many other countries presents considerable downside risks. On the upside, while it could take some time to fully implement worldwide, there has been recent encouraging news on vaccine development. On the inflation front, recent out-turns have been on the higher side, primarily due to increases in food prices. However these supply-side pressures are likely to be temporary and average inflation is expected to fall within the previously announced range of 7-9 percent for FY21. Taken together, risks to the outlook for both growth and inflation appear balanced. Given the broadly unchanged outlook for growth and inflation, the MPC viewed the existing stance of monetary policy as appropriate to support the nascent recovery while keeping inflation expectations well- anchored and maintaining financial stability. The MPC noted that the lagged effects of the significant fiscal, monetary and credit stimulus injected during the pandemic should continue to shore up growth in coming quarters. In reaching its decision, the MPC considered key trends and prospects in the real, external and fiscal sectors, and the resulting outlook for monetary conditions and inflation. Real sector. Recent data suggest further strengthening and broadening of the recovery observed since July, led by construction and manufacturing. Sales of Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCGs) rebounded in FY21 Q1, average sales volumes of POL and automobiles have surpassed their pre-Covid levels of FY20, and cement sales are at an all-time high. Large scale manufacturing (LSM) continues to rebound, expanding by. percent (y/y) in FY21 Q1, against contraction of. percent in the same quarter last year. Nine out of fifteen major manufacturing sectors have shown gains, including textiles, food and beverages, petroleum products, paper and board, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, cement, fertilizer, and rubber products. The MPC noted that the recovery was being supported by stimulus provided by the government, the round of policy rate cuts and the SBP's timely measures to mitigate the impact of the COVID pandemic. These measures included principal extension and loan restructuring, payroll financing, and Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) which injected liquidity, reduced layoffs and provided incentives for investment. In agriculture, the impact of the expected decline in cotton production is likely to be offset by growth in other major crops and higher wheat production due to the rise in support prices and recently announced subsidies on fertilizers and pesticides. While social distancing continues to weigh more heavily on certain parts of the services sector, wholesale and retail trade and transportation are expected to benefit from the knock-on impacts of the on- going pick-up in construction, manufacturing and agriculture. Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN External sector. The external sector continues to strengthen, with the current account in FY 21 Q1 recording the first quarterly surplus in more than five years. After remaining in positive territory for all four months of this fiscal year, the cumulative current account through October reached surplus of $1. billion against deficit of $1. billion in the same period last year. This turnaround was supported by an improvement in the trade balance and record remittances. Exports have recovered to their pre-COVID monthly level of around $2 billion in September and October, with the strongest recovery in textiles, rice, cement, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. Remittances recorded strong growth of 26. percent (y/y) during July-October, primarily due to orderly exchange rate conditions, supportive policy measures taken by the government and SBP, travel restrictions, and increased use of formal channels. Meanwhile subdued domestic demand and low global oil prices have kept imports in check. The sizable current account surplus and improving outlook and sentiment for the economy have supported 3½ percent appreciation in the PKR since the last MPC and further strengthened external buffers, with SBP's foreign exchange reserves increasing to $12. billion, their highest level since February 2018. Based on the performance to date, the outlook for the external sector has improved further and the current account deficit for FY21 is now projected to be below percent of GDP. Fiscal sector. In line with this year's budget, the government continues to make concerted efforts to maintain fiscal discipline, including adhering to its commitment of no fresh borrowing from SBP. Despite lower non-tax revenue, the primary balance posted surplus of. percent of GDP in FY21 Q1, similar to the levels achieved during the same period last year. However the higher overall budget deficit due to larger domestic interest payments should taper as the benefits of recent interest rate cuts filter through. PSDP-releases which are an important stimulant of economic activity, recorded an increase of 12. percent (y/y) during the first four months of this year. On the revenue side, despite fast-tracking of refunds to help businesses during the pandemic. FBR tax collections continued to record positive growth, at. percent (y/y) in July-October, to come in close to target levels. Monetary and inflation outlook. The MPC viewed that overall financial conditions remain appropriately accommodative, with the real policy rate remaining in slightly negative territory on forward-looking basis. While private sector credit growth is moderate on year-on-year basis, its month-on-month momentum is reverting to pre-Covid trends. With higher risk aversion on the part of commercial banks, the expansion in credit to the private sector has been supported by SBP's temporary and targeted refinance schemes introduced in the aftermath of the Covid-19 shock. After falling sharply since January, headline inflation has remained close to percent during the last two months, primarily driven by sharp increases in selected food items due to supply-side issues. In contrast, core See for details on the design and take-up of the different SBP refinance schemes. Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN inflation has been relatively moderate and stable, in line with subdued underlying demand in the economy. In addition, recent SPI releases suggest weakening in the momentum of food prices, as the government has taken various measures to address supply-side issues. Over the next few months, these measures, together with favorable base effects and spare capacity in the economy should help contain inflation. The latest results of SBP surveys also lend support to this assessment, with inflation expectations of both businesses and consumers remaining well-anchored. Taking into account higher than expected recent out-turns due to supply side factors and absence of demand side pressures on inflation, risks to the inflation outlook are balanced. Page."
Nigeria,2020-11-24,"CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO. 133 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING HELD ON MONDAY 23rd AND TUESDAY 24th NOVEMBER 2020 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on the 23rd and 24th of November, 2020 amidst the announcement of the discovery of several high efficacy COVID-19 vaccines, resulting in stronger optimism for improvement in global output. However persisting weakness in crude oil prices, soaring global debt and high unemployment persist. In the domestic environment, the Nigerian economy slid into recession in the third quarter of 2020, following a second consecutive quarter of contraction in output. The third quarter contraction was, however, milder than the previous quarter. The Committee appraised the developments in both the global and domestic economies, as well as the outlook for the rest of the year and the first quarter of 2021. Ten (10) members of the Committee were in attendance at the meeting. Global Economic Developments Although the global economy witnessed a better-than-expected recovery in the second quarter of 2020, it, however, continued to be weighed down by the headwinds largely associated with the 1 COVID-19 pandemic and weak crude oil prices. In the advanced economies, the persistence of weak aggregate demand, slow recovery in supply chain networks and the rebound in COVID-19 infection rates, have cast a new wave of uncertainty over their recovery in the short to medium term. In the Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDEs). China continues to lead the recovery, recording a stronger-than-expected growth in the second quarter of 2020. In India, on the other hand, growth continued to be muted as a result of increasing rates of COVID-19 infections and fatality. In general, this group of economies is set to contract less, compared with the advanced economies, led by the expected strong recovery in China. Consequently the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reviewed the forecast for global growth in 2020 to reflect a slower pace of contraction from -49 per cent to - 44 per cent. Inflation in most Advanced Economies is expected to remain subdued in the medium to long term as aggregate demand remains weak across several economies, reflecting the impact of the Pandemic on income. The US economy has, however, maintained a steady pace of job creation, even though infection rates and total fatality continue to rise in that country. The threat of a rebound of the Pandemic in several countries has resulted in second and third waves of lockdowns in these countries. This is expected to further dampen aggregate demand and slow the pace of price development. In several Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDES), inflation remained relatively high 2 compared with the Advanced Economies owing to the persistence of exchange rate pressures, dwindling capital flows and weak accretion to reserves as well as other structural issues. In the financial markets, conditions remain relatively stable, buoyed by continued monetary and fiscal stimulus. The huge level of monetary and fiscal injections has, however, increased the likelihood of a global financial crisis post-pandemic, especially when central banks commence normalization of monetary policy. Domestic Economic Developments Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) contracted by -362 per cent in Q3 2020, compared with -610 and 228 per cent in the previous quarter and corresponding period of 2019, respectively, thereby pushing the economy into recession. The oil sector contracted further by - 1389 per cent in Q3 2020 from -663 per cent in the previous quarter, while the non-oil sector contracted by -251 per cent in Q3 2020, compared with -605 per cent in the preceding quarter. The persisting weak performance was mainly attributed to the lull in economic activities associated with the low price in the oil market as well as the lingering effects of the Coronavirus Pandemic. The MPC observed the gradual improvement in the Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Indices (PMIs) which rose to 502 and 476 index points, respectively, in November 2020, compared with 494 and 468 index points in October 2020. This development signposts an increase in economic activities, 3 driven by growth in new orders, improved supply delivery time, rising production levels and new export orders. The employment level index component of the manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMIs also improved in November 2020 to 473 index points and 467 index points, respectively, compared with 460 index points and 442 index points in October 2020. The Committee, however, noted the likely downside risk to growth of the recent unrest in the country, warning that this may adversely impact economic recovery in the near term. The Committee noted with concern that inflation has been on the rise for the fourteenth consecutive month, as headline inflation (year-on-year) moved up to 1423 per cent in October 2020 from 1371 per cent in September 2020. This was attributed to the increase in both food and core inflation, which rose to 1738 and 1114 per cent in October 2020 from 1666 and 1058 per cent in September 2020, respectively. The continued increase in food and core inflation was attributed to the persistence of insecurity across the country as well as lingering structural deficiencies impacting the logistics of moving food items to urban areas such as poor road networks, unstable power supply and a host of other infrastructural deficiencies. Other factors include the persisting impact of coronavirus-induced supply disruptions, recent hikes in the price of energy products (PMS and electricity) and weak crude oil prices. The Committee, however, noted that the rise in inflation will likely abate in the medium term, as domestic production is expected to recover, following the resumption of economic activities post- 4 COVID-19 lockdown. In addition to this, food inflation is expected to moderate as harvest season sets in. Monetary and fiscal policies are also expected to continue their broad-based stimulus support towards full recovery. This will involve fiscal measures to reduce unemployment, provide an enabling environment for private sector investment and necessary support to the health sector to cushion the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. In addition, the CBN is expected to sustain its various intervention measures to boost consumer spending and support the recovery. The Committee noted that growth in broad money supply (M3) increased marginally to 353 per cent in October 2020 from 320 per cent in September 2020, reflecting an increase in Net Foreign Assets (NFA). It further noted the moderation in contraction in Net Domestic Assets (NDA) to -219 per cent from -505 per cent in the previous period. Aggregate domestic credit, however, grew by 761 per cent in October 2020 compared with 735 per cent in the previous month, as a result of the Bank's policy on Loan-to-Deposit Ratio (LDR), supported by the Bank's interventions in the various sectors of the economy. Total gross credit by the banking industry stood at N1954 trillion as at 13th November 2020 compared with N1933 trillion at end-August 2020, an increase of N29013 billion. When compared with N1556 trillion at the commencement of the LDR policy in May 2019, total gross credit increased by N397 trillion. These loans were granted mainly to manufacturing (N738 billion). General Commerce (N874 billion). Agric and Forestry (N301 billion). Construction (N291 billion). ICT (N231 billion), just to mention a few. The Committee noted the reduction in interest rates on loans granted by Deposit Money Banks (DMBs). As at October 2020, 8623 per cent of total loans granted to over one million customers, by Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) were at interest rates considerably below 20 per cent. This was an improvement from 7643 per cent as at July 2019. MPC noted the improvement in Financial Soundness Indicators of the DMBs which showed Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of 155 per cent. Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) of 573 per cent and Liquidity Ratio (LR) of 356 per cent, as at October, 2020. As regards non- performing loans (NPLs). MPC however, noted that the ratio remained above the prudential benchmark of 50 per cent and urged the Bank to sustain its tight prudential regime to bring it below the benchmark. The Committee welcomed the improvement in the financial soundness indicators of Other Financial Institutions (OFIs) as indicated by the growth of N582 billion, or 1694 per cent (year-on- year), in aggregate assets to N402 trillion as at end-September 2020. Similarly aggregate credit grew by N217 billion, or 1227 per cent (year-on-year), to N199 trillion during the same period. The Capital Adequacy Ratio for the subsector also exceeded the minimum prudential ratio of 10 per cent. The Committee recognized the supportive developmental roles of the CBN towards addressing some of the structural issues in the economy. The MPC specifically expressed optimism on the future 6 impact of the disbursements from Agri-Business/Small and Medium Enterprise Investment Scheme (AGSMEIS) (N9290 billion to 24,,702 beneficiaries). Anchor Borrowers Program (ABP) by the sum of N16491 billion to 954,,279 beneficiaries and COVID-19 Targeted Credit Facility (TCF) to household and SMEs (N14921 billion to 316,,869 beneficiaries). Liquidity conditions in the banking system continued to influence money market rates in the review period. The Open Buy Back (OBB) rate declined progressively as a result of rising liquidity levels in the banking system, while there were no transactions at the uncollateralized inter-bank call window. Consequently the monthly weighted average OBB rate declined to 188 per cent in October 2020 from 350 per cent in September 2020. The Committee noted the recent impressive performance recorded in the equities market, particularly the increased patronage by domestic investors largely driven by low yields in the money market. Similarly Market Capitalization, grew by 2082 per cent to N1596 trillion from N1321 trillion over the same period. This improved performance was largely attributed to positive third quarter corporate earnings as investors moved in to pick-up bargain stocks. The Committee observed the moderate decline in the external reserves position, which stood at US$3518 billion as at November 7 19, 2020 compared with US$3595 billion at end-September 2020, as crude oil prices continue to fluctuate with downward pressure. Outlook Overall, the medium-term outlook for the global economy is beginning to show a ray of optimism following the discovery of COVID-19 vaccines. In the domestic economy, available data and forecasts for key macroeconomic variables also suggest optimism in output growth in the fourth quarter of 2020, due to the positive outlook for most economic activities. Accordingly the economy is expected to recover from recession by the end of 2020, while inflation is projected to moderate by the first quarter of 2021. The Committee's Considerations The Committee's considerations remained focused around tailwinds imparting upward pressure to domestic prices and key headwinds to output growth. The Committee noted that inflation continued to be driven by supply side disruptions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and other legacy factors. Key amongst these are: the security challenges in parts of the country; increase in food prices; and the recent hike in pump price of PMS and electricity tariff. The MPC, therefore, emphasized the need to address structural supply side issues putting upward pressure on costs of production and 8 unemployment. To address the public health crisis associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the Committee urged the Federal Government to make relentless effort to procure a substantial quantity of the COVID-19 vaccines to surmount the public health crisis and pave the way for a broader macroeconomic recovery. The Committee noted that the contraction had bottomed out, since it moderated significantly from -610 to -362 per cent in the third quarter of 2020. This was so because both the monetary and fiscal authorities had anticipated the impending recession and had put measures in place for its quick reversion. Some of these measures include the Economic Sustainability Programme by the Federal Government and other CBN facilities targeted at households, small and medium enterprises (SMEs), youth empowerment, and reduction of unemployment. It thus, urged the Federal Government to maintain its initiatives targeted at reducing unemployment, particularly amongst the youths, citing the recent EndSARS protests and ensuing agitation by hoodlums as potentially disruptive to output growth in Nigeria. To this end, the MPC reiterated its support for the various development finance initiatives of the CBN to stimulate production and reduce unemployment. MPC further encouraged the Bank to intensify its efforts by increasing funding to more beneficiaries so as to boost consumer spending and accelerate recovery from recession. On the Financial Markets, the Committee considered the improved performance in the equities market as a leading indicator of medium-term macroeconomic recovery. It thus urged the Bank to 9 maintain its policies on exchange rate and financial system stability to attract more investment into the Nigerian equities market. The MPC noted that credit to key sectors of the economy increased and encouraged the continued credit support to employment- stimulating sectors to hasten the recovery of output growth and improve employment particularly among the youths. The Committee emphasized the need for the Bank to maintain its regulatory surveillance over the banking system to ensure that non- performing loans remain low. MPC noted with pleasure, the CBN's engagement with relevant stakeholders, particularly in the private sector, to hasten the recovery of growth. This engagement would involve collaboration towards job creation and provision of credit facilities to stimulate business activities for both corporates and individuals, particularly those who lost their goods and business premises to hoodlums, during the recent protest. The Committee's Decision At this meeting, the Committee focused not only on price stability, but also on the need to speedily take actions to exit the recession. In view of these considerations, the choices before the Committee were focused on whether: to tighten the stance of policy to address rising price levels recognizing its primary mandate of price stability; to ease to support output recovery; or to hold to allow existing policy initiatives to permeate the economy. 10 The Committee noted that, although the appropriate response to rising inflationary pressure would be to tighten the stance of policy in order to moderate upward pressure on prices, it nevertheless, felt that doing this would exert downward pressure on the recovery of output growth. The Committee also felt that tightening would negate the Bank's desire to expand credit to the real sector at affordable terms, not only to boost production, but also to increase consumer spending. To the Committee, tightening was therefore not the appropriate response at this time. With the economy, whereas MPC felt that government spending and Bank's expansionary stance would be desirable to support recovery and guide the economy out of recession, it felt loosening would trigger excess liquidity and worsen the inflationary pressure. MPC also felt that excess liquidity may impact demand pressure and fuel further depreciation of the naira. With respect to a hold position, the Committee was of the view that this will be beneficial as it will allow current policy measures to permeate the economy while observing the trend of developments. The Committee also felt that the heterodox policies of the Bank targeted at various sectors are showing positive results that would further engender growth. On balance, the MPC was of the view that, although all three options offer some benefits to the economy, the hold option was desirable at this meeting. Based on these factors, members, voted in line with the most pressing need towards reversing the recession and achieving medium term macroeconomic stability. 1 In view of the foregoing, the Committee decided by a unanimous vote to retain all parameters. In summary, the MPC voted to: I Retain the MPR at 115 per cent; II. Retain the asymmetric corridor of +100/-700 basis points around the MPR; III. Retain the CRR at 275 per cent; and IV. Retain the Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent. Thank you. Godwin I Emefiele Governor. Central Bank of Nigeria 24th November, 2020 12."
South Korea,2020-11-26,"The bank of korea. The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 0.50% for the intermeeting period. Currently available information suggests that the global economy has continued to recover, but the pace of recovery has been slow due to the ongoing resurgence of COVID19. In global financial markets, risk aversion has subsided on improvement of economic indicators and hopes for coronavirus vaccine development. Stock prices in major countries and government bond yields have risen and the US dollar has weakened. Looking ahead, the Board sees global economic growth and global financial markets as likely to be affected largely by the severity of the resurgence of COVID-19 and the status of vaccine development, as well as by national policy responses and their effects. The Korean economy has continued to recover at a modest pace. Although the recovery in private consumption has been slow and the correction in construction investment has continued, facilities investment has started to recover and the improvement in exports has continued. Labor market conditions have remained weak, with the number of persons employed continuing to decline sharply compared to the corresponding period last year. Going forward, the economy is likely to recover gradually, led mainly by exports and investment. However, uncertainties surrounding the economic outlook are judged to remain elevated. GDP is projected to grow at slightly below -1% in 2020 and around 3% in 2021. Consumer price inflation has slowed to the lower-0% level due to the sharp decline in the prices of public services. Core inflation (excluding changes in food and energy prices from the CPI) recorded a negative rate, and the inflation expectations of the general public have moved down slightly within the upper-1% range. It is forecast that consumer price inflation and core inflation will run at the low- to mid-0% level for some time and then moderately increase to around 1% in 2021. In domestic financial markets, stock prices have risen considerably and the Korean won to US dollar exchange rate has fallen significantly while long-term market interest rates have risen, affected by various factors such as global financial market movements and improvement of economic indicators. Household loan growth has picked up and housing prices have continued to increase in all parts of the country. The Board will continue to conduct monetary policy in order to support the economy and stabilize consumer price inflation at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As the recovery in the Korean economy is expected to be modest and inflationary pressures on the demand side are forecast to remain weak, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance. In this process it will thoroughly assess developments related to the pandemic, the impact on the economy and financial markets here and abroad, changes in financial stability such as household debt growth, and the effects of the policy measures taken in response to the pandemic."
Colombia,2020-11-27,"Vimeo live broadcast (Only in Spanish). Other measures taken by BR on account of COVID-19. Learn about the aspects considered by the Board of Directors at their November meeting. During today's meeting, the Board of Directors of the Banco de la Republica unanimously decided to hold the policy rate at 1.75%. This decision was made on the basis of the following considerations. Inflation in October stood at 1.75% and expectations for 2021-2023 are anchored at around 3%. The most recent indicators of economic growth confirm the predicted recovery rate for activities, and this development is expected to continue in 2021. Although the labor market continues to improve, it reflects severe structural problems. The loan portfolio and interest rates continue to respond to monetary policy stimuli. External financial conditions remain favorable for financing the Colombian economy. Under these conditions and considering the risk balance, the Board unanimously decided to keep the benchmark rate at 1.75%.

Israel,2020-11-30,"The economy is in a prolonged exit process from the second lockdown, but there is uncertainty regarding the continuation of the exit from the lockdown in view of the apparent increase in morbidity. News from abroad regarding progress in vaccine development is positive, but in the meantime,it is unclear when the vaccines will be distributed in Israel and abroad. Until then, morbidity is expected to continue affecting economic activity. The adverse impacton economic activity as a result of the second lockdown was less severe than the impact of the first lockdown, but the exit from the second lockdown has been slower, and there is variance in theadverse impact on activity across various industries. Some firms have been able to adapt their operations to the COVID-19 restrictions, but industries such as tourism, restaurants, education, and leisure are more restricted and have not returned to the pre-crisis levels of activity. The second lockdown led to a sharp increase in the broad unemployment rate, which reached approximately 23 percent of the labor force in the first half of October, compared with about 11 percent in the first half of September. With the start of easing the lockdown, the unemployment rate moderated to approximately 18 percent. The inflation environment remained low. The CPI increased by 0.3 percent in October, and inflation in the past 12 months is -0.8 percent (-0.4 percent net of energy and fruit and vegetables). Inflation expectations forthe coming year, from all sources, remain below the lower bound of the target range, but expectations derived from the capital market increased. Forward expectations for the second year returned to within the target range, and long-term expectations remained anchored within the target range. In recent months, the effective exchange rate had been in a relatively narrow range, but since the previous interest rate decision, the shekel has strengthened by about 1 percent in terms of the effective exchange rate, and by about 1.7 percent against the US dollar in view of the significant weakening of the dollar worldwide. Continued appreciation may have an adverse effect on exports, and is expected to lead to a further slowdown in inflation. The credit market continues to function well with low and stable interest rates, supported by a range of measures taken by the Bank of Israel and the Ministry of Finance. The Business Tendency Survey shows that there was a decline in the difficulty of large and medium businesses to raise credit, while small businesses continued to find difficulty in raising bank credit. The global economyrecovered in the third quarter, and most economies recorded high GDP growth. However, the renewed spread of morbidity is expected to lead to a moderation of global growth in the fourth quarter. World trade is recovering after having declined sharply at the onset of the crisis. The central banks of the major economies emphasized their commitment to maintaining accommodative policy for a long time, and governments continue to adopt assistance and fiscal expansion measures. Thepositive results in coronavirus vaccine tests are increasing optimism regarding the rapid return of the economy to a path of growth in the coming year. However, the adverse impact on the economy, and particularly on the labor market, is expected to be prolonged, and the Committee will thereforecontinue to utilize a range of tools in order to increase the extent of the monetary policy accommodation and to ensure the continued orderly functioning of the financial markets. The Committee will expand the use of the existing tools, including the interest rate tool, and will operate additional ones, to the extent that it assesses that it is necessary in order to achieve the monetary policy goals and to moderate the adverse economic impact resulting from the crisis. For the file of figures accompanying this notice, clickhere. News from abroad regarding progress in the production of vaccines is positive, but in the meantime, itis unclear when the vaccines will be distributed in Israel and abroad. According to the first estimate of National Accounts data for the third quarter, following the sharp drop in GDP in the second quarter, therewas rapid recovery during the summer months until the start of the second lockdown in mid-September, as the economy grew by 38 percent (in seasonally adjusted annual terms; Figure 1) in the third quarter. The growth was driven by exports, private consumption, and investment in residential construction, while investment in industries continued to contract. The available indicators regarding economic activity in October and November show that the adverse impact on economic activity as a result of the second lockdown was more moderate than the impact of the first lockdown, but as a result of the gradual exit, recovery in some of the industries has been slower than following the first lockdown, and there is variance in the adverse impact on activity across various industries. According to the Central Bureau of Statistics Business Tendency Survey, the business sector's total net balance declined more moderately than in the previous lockdown, but it continues to reflect strong contraction in activity (Figure 3). Electricity usage data also declined only moderately. Manufacturing exports (excluding ships, aircraft,and diamonds, in dollars) increased slightly in October, returning to the level from before the first lockdown, driven by high-technology exports (Figure 7). Google's data on mobility to workplaces, which declined only slightly during the lockdown, indicate a faster return to the mobility levels of just before the second lockdown, already at the initial stages of the exit from the lockdown, relative to the first lockdown. Credit card expenditure data indicate a similar trend, as some companies in the retail trade and food and beverage services industries adapted their operations to supplying products online and through deliveries. In contrast, in view of the gradual reopening of the economy, some industries such as tourism, restaurants, education, and leisure did not return to their pre-crisis levels of activity (Figure 4). The second lockdown led to a sharp increase in the broad unemployment rate, which reached approximately 23 percent of the labor force in the first half of October (938,000 unemployed), compared with approximately 11 percent in the first half of September. The increase was mainly due to the growth in the number of workers who were temporarily absent from their jobs. In the second half of October, with the start of easing the lockdown, the broad unemployment rate moderated to approximately 18 percent (Figure 9). A Central Bureau of Statistics real-time survey conducted in October shows that there was an increase in the share of those dismissed compared with a survey conducted in August. The Bank of Israel Research Department revised its estimates of monthly activity rates in the economy during the crisis (Figure 2). According to these estimates. GDP is now expected to decline by 4.5 percent in 2020 if there is no significant drawback in removing the restrictions until the end of the year, and by 5 percent if there is such a drawback due to an increase in morbidity. Regarding 2021, a high level of uncertainty remains regarding the forecast in view ofthe recent increase in the infection coefficient and the probability of additional lockdowns compared to the chances of a vaccine during 2021. The forecast published in October 2020, which contains a scenario of remaining in control and a scenario of low control', still covers the range of potential scenarios in the Research Department's forecast for 2021. The CPI for October increased by 0.3 percent, inflation in the past 12 months was -0.8 percent (-0.4 percent net of energy and fruit and vegetables) (Figure 10). The energy component contributed -0.5 percentage points to the inflation rate in the past 12 months, while the housing component moderated in the past year, making a positive contribution of just 0.2 percentage points. Inflation expectations for the coming year, from all sources, remain below the lower bound of the target range. Expectations derived from the capital market increased markedly, returning to positive territory. In the coming months, annual inflation is expected to remain negative. Short- and medium-term forward expectations increased since the previous interest rate decision, and expectations for the second year returned to within the target range. Long-term expectations were virtually unchanged, and remained anchored within the target range (Figure 14). The effective exchange rate had been in a relatively narrow range in recent months (Figure 15), but since the previous interest rate decision, the shekel has strengthened by about 1 percent in terms of the effective exchange rate. During the same period, the shekel strengthened by approximately 1.7 percent against the US dollar in view of the significant weakening of the dollar worldwide. The continued appreciation of the shekel could have an adverse impact on exports, and is expected to lead to a further slowdown of inflation. The recent positive results in tests for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine contributed to price increases on global equity markets, as well asto an increase in bond yields. In the domestic market, yields increased on the shekel bond curve similar to the global trend, and corporate bond spreads continued to narrow alongside the price increases on equity indices (Figure 18). The credit market continues to function well with low and stable interest rates, supported by a range of steps taken by the Bank of Israel and the Ministry of Finance. The Business Tendency Survey shows that there was a decline in the difficulty of raising credit by large and medium businesses, while for small businesses the difficulty of raising bank credit remained at its previous level (Figure 22). As of mid-November, loan repayments totaling NIS 10.8 billion in total were deferred as part of the bank credit payment deferral program. The balance of credit for which payments were deferred constitutes 16.4 percent of the credit portfolio. Today the Bank of Israel announced an additional framework for further deferrals and easing of loan repayments, which has been adopted by the banking system, and which focuses on households. The framework enables customers who have been harmed by the crisis to spread out their consumer and mortgage loan repayments over longer periods, and also provides them with the option of a further deferral of loan repayments to credit card companies. The global economy recovered in the third quarter, and most economies recorded high GDP growth. However, the renewed spread of morbidity and the expansion of lockdowns and restrictions in advanced economies are expected to lead to a moderation of global growth in the fourth quarter. The global Purchasing Managers Index has remained at a level that indicates expansion of activity since July, and reflects recovery both in manufacturing and in services (Figure 27). World trade is recovering after having declined sharply at the start of the year, and recent data reflect a contraction of only about 1.5 percent compared with the same period last year (Figure 26). In the US, morbidity is spreading at a high rate, but economic indicators point to a continued recovery in the fourth quarter. The spread of morbidity and the resumption of lockdowns in Europe are expected to lead to contraction in the fourth quarter, but at a more moderate rate than during the first lockdown.In Japan as well, low growth is expected in the fourth quarter. China's economy is particularly robust, and is the only one among the large economic blocs where positive growth is expected in 2020. Monetary policy throughout the world remains very accommodative. The central banks of the major economies stressed their commitment to maintaining accommodative policy for a long time, and governments continue to adopt assistance and fiscal expansion measures. In October, inflation declined in all of the blocs, and it is expected to remain low in 2021 as well. Expectations of a recovery in the global economy contributed to an increase in oil prices. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on December 14, 2020. The next decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Monday. January 4, 2021, followed by a press briefing by the Governor."
Poland,2020-12-02,"Warsaw, 2 December 2020 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 2 December 2020 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: reference rate at 0.10%; lombard rate at 0.50%; deposit rate at 0.00%; rediscount rate at 0.11%; discount rate at 0.12%. NBP will continue to purchase government securities and government-guaranteed debt securities on the secondary market as part of the structural open market operations. The timing and scale of the operations will depend on the market conditions. Furthermore. NBP will offer bill discount credit aimed at refinancing loans granted to enterprises by banks. GDP data point to a strong global economic recovery in 2020 Q3, but the activity in most countries did not return to its pre-pandemic levels. At the same time, a significant increase in the number of new COVID-19 cases in recent months together with renewed tightening of the pandemic restrictions in many countries  in particular European ones  have contributed to the deterioration of economic conditions, especially in services. As a consequence, many economies will probably see another drop in GDP in 2020 Q4. The further course of the pandemic remains the main source of uncertainty for economic prospects in the coming quarters. Under these circumstances, major central banks keep interest rates at low levels and conduct asset purchases. Information on the results of COVID-19 vaccines clinical trials has contributed to some improvement in global financial market sentiment. At the same time, global commodity prices remain significantly lower than at the beginning of the year. Lower commodity prices along with weaker economic activity have contributed to inflation staying at low levels in many countries, including Poland's main trading partners. In Poland, the 2020 Q3 GDP data confirmed a strong rebound in economic activity compared to previous quarter, but the GDP year-to-year growth rate remained negative. The increase in annual GDP growth rate was supported by the recovery in consumption demand. Amid improved economic conditions abroad, exports also accelerated. In turn, investment was significantly lower than a year before. The sharp increase in the number of new COVID-19 infections along with the tightening of the epidemic restrictions and weakening sentiment of economic agents in October and November contributed to the deteriorating economic conditions in recent period, especially in the service sector. Current forecasts indicate that GDP will decrease in 2020 Q4 compared to previous quarter. The labour market data for October indicate a further increase in employment in corporate sector on monthly basis accompanied by lower wage growth in this sector. At the same time, inflation in November  according to the Statistics Poland flash estimate  stood at 3.0% y/y (compared to 3.1% y/y in October). It could be anticipated that  after a fall in 2020  the economic activity would rebound next year, but the GDP would probably remain lower than prior to the pandemic. The uncertainty about the economic prospects persists, driven by incertitude regarding further course of the pandemic and its effects on economic conditions at home and abroad. Domestic economic situation will be supported by the economic policy measures, including the easing of NBP's monetary policy. In turn, economic activity may be limited by increased uncertainty and weaker sentiment of economic agents than in previous year. The pace of recovery may also be reduced by the lack of a visible and more durable zloty exchange rate adjustment to the global pandemic-driven shock and to the monetary policy easing introduced by NBP. These operations are aimed at changing the long-term liquidity structure in the banking sector, ensuring the liquidity in the secondary markets for the purchased securities and enhancing the impact of the NBP interest rate cuts on the economy, i.e. strengthening the monetary policy transmission mechanism. NBP's monetary policy mitigates the negative economic impact of the pandemic, supports economic activity and stabilises inflation at the level consistent with the NBP's medium-term inflation target. Due to its positive impact on the financial situation of debtors, it is also conducive to the strengthening of financial system stability."
India,2020-12-04,"Monetary Policy Statement, 2020-21 Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) December 2-4, 2020 On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its meeting today (December 4, 2020) decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 4.0 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains unchanged at 3.35 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 4.25 per cent. The MPC also decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary  at least during the current financial year and into the next financial year  to revive growth on a durable basis and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward. These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Assessment Global Economy 2. The outlook for Q4 (October-December) of 2020 is overcast with a surge in COVID-19 infections in a second wave across Europe, the US and major emerging market economies (EMEs), with accompanying lockdowns. Progress on vaccine candidates has, however, generated some offsetting optimism. World trade recorded a rebound in Q3 as lockdowns were eased, but it is likely to slow in Q4 as pent-up demand is exhausted, inventory restocking is completed, and trade-related27 showed a contraction of 7.5 per cent in real GDP in Q2:2020-21 (July-September). In Q3:2020-21, high frequency indicators point to a recovery gaining traction, with double digit growth in passenger vehicles and motorcycle sales, railway freight traffic, and electricity consumption in October, although there was moderation in some of these indicators in November. Riding on the favourable monsoon, the outlook for agriculture remains bright, with rabi sowing up 4.0 per cent from the acreage covered at this time last year under supportive soil moisture and reservoir conditions. CPI inflation rose sharply to 7.3 per cent in September and further to 7.6 per cent in October 2020, with some evidence that price pressures are spreading. Food inflation surged to double digits in October across protein-rich items including pulses, edible oils, vegetables and spices on multiple supply shocks. Core inflation, i.e. CPI excluding food and fuel, also picked up from 5.4 per cent in September to 5.8 per cent in October. Both three months and one year ahead inflation expectations of households have eased modestly in anticipation of the seasonal moderation of food prices in the winter and easing of supply chain disruptions. Domestic financial conditions remained easy in October-November and systemic liquidity continued to be in large surplus. Reserve money increased by 15.3 per cent (y-o-y) (as on November 27, 2020), driven by a surge in currency demand. Money supply (M ), on the other hand, grew by only 12.5 per cent as on November 3 20, 2020. A noteworthy development is that non-food credit growth accelerated and moved into positive territory for the first time in November 2020 on a financial year basis  hitherto, the large inflow of deposits into the banking system was being predominantly deployed in SLR investment. Corporate bond issuances stood at ₹4.4 lakh crore during April-October 2020 as against ₹3.5 lakh crore during the same period last year. India's foreign exchange reserves were US$ 574.8 billion (as on November 27), up from US$ 545.6 billion on October 2 at the time of the MPC's last resolution. Outlook 6. The outlook for inflation has turned adverse relative to expectations in the last two months. The substantial wedge between wholesale and retail inflation points to the supply-side bottlenecks and large margins being charged to the consumer. Turning to the growth outlook, the recovery in rural demand is expected to strengthen further, while urban demand is also gaining momentum as unlocking spurs activity and employment, especially of labour displaced by COVID-19. These positive impulses are, however, clouded by a possible rise in infections in some parts of the country, prompting some local containment measures. At the same time, the recovery rate has crossed 94 per cent and there is considerable optimism on successes in vaccine trials. Consumers remain optimistic about the outlook, and business sentiment of manufacturing firms is gradually improving. Fiscal stimulus is increasingly moving beyond being supportive of consumption and liquidity to supporting growth-generating investment. On the other hand, private investment is still slack and capacity utilisation has not fully recovered. While exports are on an uneven recovery, the prospects have brightened with the progress on the vaccines. Demand for contact-intensive services is likely to remain subdued for some time due to social distancing norms and risk aversion. Taking these factors into consideration, real GDP growth is projected at (-)7.5 per cent in 2020-21: (+)0.1 per cent in Q3:2020-21 and (+)0.7 per cent in Q4:2020-21; and (+)21.9 per cent to (+)6.5 per cent in H1:2021-22, with risks broadly balanced (Chart 2)."
Chile,2020-12-07,"Monday, 7 December 2020 Monetary Policy Meeting  December 2020 At its Monetary Policy Meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to hold the monetary policy interest rate at 0.50%, and to keep the unconventional liquidity- and credit-supporting measures in place. The decision was adopted by the unanimous vote of its members. On the external front, incoming figures show that the recovery process continues, albeit with differences by country and economic sector. The good performance of China and the rapid upturn in international trade in goods stand out. The resurgence of Covid-19, mainly in the Northern Hemisphere, raises the alarm about the true capacity to sustain the pace of recovery, which reflects the deterioration of some indicators of expectations. In any case, the greater focus of the sanitary measures imposed in some of the most affected countries suggests that the effects on mobility and the economy will be milder than they were in the early stages of the pandemic. The advances in the process of developing, authorizing, and applying a vaccine has had a positive impact on the global financial markets, increasing appetite for risk and boosting stock markets and commodity prices. Worth noting are the favorable prospects for Chile's trading partners and the rise in the copper price to nearly US$3.5 per pound. In the country. October's Imacec was lower than expected, reflecting the complexities of an economic recovery process when major sectors lag behind because of their strong reliance on human contact. The effects on construction, transportation and many services deserve mention, while by contrast, trade and manufacturing have picked up notoriously, and mining activity shows normal-year indicators. The labor market, despite having significant gaps, is giving signs of improvement, as close to one third of the jobs lost to the pandemic have been recovered, while real labor income and hours worked have [INF*RES*AS] increased. However, these signs are weaker in some labor-intensive sectors, particularly certain services with more social interaction and formal salaried employment and female occupation. All considered, activity and the labor market continue along a path of recovery, as is visible in improved expectations of consumer and businesses. Although the recent announcement of some reinstatement of confinements in the Metropolitan Region may delay somewhat this recovery, it may also reduce the risk of more drastic actions later on. In the local financial markets, stock prices rose and the peso appreciated, in line with the trends of its peers abroad, while the longer-term interest rates —both nominal and indexed—posted a stronger increase. As for banking credit, loans to firms have slowed down further, with a significant reduction of new loans associated with the Covid-Fogape program and greater credit amortization by big companies. Meanwhile, consumer loans have contracted further and mortgage loans continue to grow with relative stability. The interest rates for the different credit users remain low. After the second pension fund withdrawal was passed, the Central Bank of Chile announced a package of precautionary measures aimed at ensuring the AFPs' orderly liquidation of assets and thus preserve the stability of financial markets and the efficiency of the price formation process. November's CPI was below expectations, partly offsetting two months of surprises in the opposite direction. With it, total inflation dropped to 2.7% annually, while its core component remained at 3.2%, in a context where shocks to consumption, coupled with slow inventory replenishment, has caused major movements in some prices. Beyond these short-lived ups and downs, inflationary pressures are still contained, as the gradual closing of the wide activity gap that was opened in recent months dominates. Market expectations have factored in the transitory nature of price movements, with changes at shorter terms and stability around 3% two years ahead. The Board reiterates that the strong monetary stimulus will be maintained over a prolonged period of time, in order to ensure the consolidation of economic recovery and compliance with its objectives. In particular, it foresees that the MPR will remain at its minimum level over most of the two-year monetary policy horizon. The unconventional measures will remain in effect. This considers that the total stock of banking bonds acquired under different programs—around US$8 billion—will be maintained over the next six months, reinvesting the coupons as they mature. This excludes those purchases made under the CC-VP program. Regarding the FCIC facility, the Board decided to introduce no changes in the total of resources available and conditions for utilization. However, it will evaluate a possible extension and changes in the access parameters that facilitate their use to respond to the economy's needs at this stage. The December 2020 Monetary Policy Report containing the projections and analyses that underlie these decisions of the Board will be published on Wednesday 9 December at 8:30 [INF*RES*AS] hours. The minutes corresponding to this Meeting will be released at 8:30 hours of Wednesday 23 December 2020. The next Monetary Policy Meeting is scheduled to take place on Tuesday 26 and Wednesday 27 January 2021 and the statement thereof will be released at 18:00 hours of this latter date. The Spanish original prevails."
Brazil,2020-12-09,"In its 235th meeting, the Copom unanimously decided to maintain the Selic rate at 2.00% p.a. The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario:. Regarding the global outlook, the pandemic resurgence in some major economies is reversing previous mobility gains and should affect short-term activity. However, promising results in COVID-19 vaccine trials tend to improve confidence and growth in the medium term. Economic slack and central bank communication from major economies suggest monetary stimuli will last long, resulting in a favorable environment for emerging economies. Turning to the Brazilian economy, recent indicators suggest the uneven recovery in economic activity continues, as expected. However, prospectively, uncertainty about economic growth remains larger than usual, especially for the period starting at the end of this year, concurrently with the expected unwinding of the emergency transfer programs. The latest inflation readings were higher than expected and, despite the predicted retraction of food price pressures. December inflation should still remain elevated. In spite of the stronger short-term inflationary pressure, the Committee maintains the diagnosis that the current shocks are temporary, but continues to monitor closely its evolution, in particular the core inflation readings. The various measures of underlying inflation are in levels compatible with meeting the inflation target at the relevant horizon for monetary policy. Inflation expectations for 2020, 2021, and 2022 collected by the Focus survey are around 4.2%, 3.3%, and 3.5%, respectively. The Copom's inflation projections in its baseline scenario, with interest rate path extracted from the Focus survey and exchange rate starting at R$5.25/US$* and evolving according to the purchase power parity (PPP), stand around 4.3% for 2020, 3.4% for 2021 and 3.4% for 2022. This scenario assumes a path for the Selic rate that ends 2020 at 2.00% p.a., rises to 3.00% p.a. in 2021 and 4.50% p.a. in 2022; and. The scenario with constant interest rate at 2.00% p.a. and exchange rate starting at R$5.25/US$* and evolving according to the PPP yields inflation projections around 4.3% for 2020, 3.5% for 2021 and 4.0% for 2022. The Committee emphasizes that risks to its baseline scenario remain in both directions. On the one hand, economic slack may continue to produce a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory, especially when the slack is concentrated in the service sector. This risk increases if a slower reversion of the pandemic effects lengthens the environment of high uncertainty and precautionary savings. On the other hand, an extension of fiscal policy responses to the pandemic that aggravate the fiscal path or a frustration with the continuation of the reform agenda may increase the risk premium. The relative increase in the risks of these events imply an upward asymmetry to the balance of risks, i.e., in the direction of higher-than-expected paths for inflation over the relevant horizon for monetary policy. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the broad array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to maintain the Selic rate at 2.00% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation, a higher-than-usual variance in the balance of risks, and it is consistent with the convergence of inflation to its target over the relevant horizon for monetary policy, which includes 2021 and 2022. The Committee deems as adequate the current level of unusually strong monetary stimulus, which is being provided by the maintenance of the policy rate at 2.00% p.a. and the forward guidance introduced in the 232nd meeting. The forward guidance stated that the Copom does not intend to reduce the monetary stimulus as long as specified conditions are met. The Committee judges that those conditions continue to hold. In spite of having increased since the last meeting, in particular for 2021, inflation expectations, as well as inflation projections for its baseline scenario, are still below the inflation target for the relevant horizon for monetary policy; the current fiscal regime has not been changed; and long-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. The Copom judges that, since adoption of the forward guidance, inflation expectations reversed their declining trend relative to the target for the relevant horizon. Additionally, over the next months, the 2021 calendar-year should become less relevant than the 2022 calendar-year, for which projections and expected inflation are around the target. A scenario of inflation expectations converging to the target suggests that the conditions for maintaining the forward guidance may soon no longer apply, which does not mechanically imply interest rates increases, since economic conditions still prescribe an extraordinarily strong monetary stimulus. In case the forward guidance ceases to apply, monetary policy will follow the inflation target framework, based on the analysis of prospective inflation and its balance of risks. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Roberto Oliveira Campos Neto (Governor). Bruno Serra Fernandes. Carolina de Assis Barros. Fabio Kanczuk. Fernanda Feitosa Nechio. Joao Manoel Pinho de Mello. Mauricio Costa de Moura. Otavio Ribeiro Damaso, and Paulo Srgio Neves de Souza. *Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average R$/US$ exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the last day of the week before the Copom meeting."
Georgia,2020-12-09,"09.12.2020 The National Bank of Georgia keeps its policy rate unchanged at 8.0 percent. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on December 9, 2020, and decided to keep the refinancing rate unchanged at 8.0 percent. Annual inflation has been at 3.8 percent in recent months. According to the current forecast, other things equal, the inflation rate will hover close to the target level in the first half of 2021. Inflation dynamics is mainly determined by weak aggregate demand and this impact is expected to persist next year as well. Still, the effect on aggregate demand coming from increased pandemic-related social and economic support fiscal measures of 2020-2021 is noteworthy. The Monetary Policy Committee also took into account the supply-side factors, such as the increase in production costs due to additional restrictions in the wake of the pandemic. The Committee also took note of the uncertainties surrounding the prolonged pandemic and the global restrictions. Moreover, due to the still high dollarization of the economy, the room for easing monetary policy is limited. According to the current estimates, a tight monetary policy may be necessary for longer, subject to inflation expectations and the dynamics of economic activity. Depending on the economic developments, the Committee does not rule out the need for an increase in interest rate in the future. According to preliminary indicators, aggregate demand is weak. Based on rapid estimates, economic activity fell by 3.9 percent year-on-year in October and by 5.1 percent over the first ten months of the year. After the decline in 2020, economic activity is expected to recover gradually from 2021. According to the current forecasts, other things equal, domestic demand will be the main driver of economic growth in 2021. In contrast, external demand remains significantly reduced and slow growth is projected for 2021 as well. The revenues from international travelers are minimal and, according to preliminary data, fell by 94 percent year on year in October. Amid weak aggregate demand, imports of goods fell by annual 24 percent in October. After a small increase in the previous month, exports declined again. In contrast, the high growth of remittances persists. As part of Covid-19-related measures, the European Central Bank and the NBG agreed to launch a €100 million euro repo line to support liquidity. This line was introduced under the framework of the Eurosystem repo facility for central banks (EUREP). The purpose of the instrument is to supply euro liquidity to the Georgia's financial system in case of need. The mechanism will be in force until June 30, 2021, and its operational support will be provided by the German Bundesbank. The NBG continues to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all available tools to ensure price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on February 3, 2021."
Euroarea,2020-12-10,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Executive Vice-President. Mr Dombrovskis. While the rebound of economic activity in the third quarter was stronger than expected and the prospects for the roll-out of vaccines are encouraging, the pandemic continues to pose serious risks to public health and to the euro area and global economies. The resurgence in COVID-19 cases and the associated containment measures are significantly restricting euro area economic activity, which is expected to have contracted in the fourth quarter of 2020. While activity in the manufacturing sector continues to hold up well, services activity is being severely curbed by the increase in infection rates and the new restrictions on social interaction and mobility. Inflation remains very low in the context of weak demand and significant slack in labour and product markets. Overall, the incoming data and our staff projections suggest a more pronounced near-term impact of the pandemic on the economy and a more protracted weakness in inflation than previously envisaged. In view of the economic fallout from the resurgence of the pandemic, today the Governing Council recalibrated its monetary policy instruments as follows:. First, the Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We expect them to remain at their present or lower levels until we have seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2 per cent within our projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics. Second, we decided to increase the envelope of the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) by €500 billion to a total of €1,850 billion. We also extended the horizon for net purchases under the PEPP to at least the end of March 2022. In any case, we will conduct net purchases until the Governing Council judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over. We will conduct our purchases under the PEPP to preserve favourable financing conditions over this extended period. We will purchase flexibly according to market conditions and with a view to preventing a tightening of financing conditions that is inconsistent with countering the downward impact of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation. In addition, the flexibility of purchases over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions will continue to support the smooth transmission of monetary policy. If favourable financing conditions can be maintained with asset purchase flows that do not exhaust the envelope over the net purchase horizon of the PEPP, the envelope need not be used in full. Equally, the envelope can be recalibrated if required to maintain favourable financing conditions to help counter the negative pandemic shock to the path of inflation. The extension of our PEPP purchases over a longer horizon reflects the prolonged fallout from the pandemic for the economy and inflation. It allows for a continuous market presence and more durable support from our monetary stimulus. Preserving favourable financing conditions over the pandemic period will help to reduce uncertainty and bolster confidence, thereby encouraging consumer spending and business investment, and, ultimately, underpinning the economic recovery and helping to offset the downward impact of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation. We also decided to extend the reinvestment of principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the PEPP until at least the end of 2023. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance. Third, the Governing Council decided to further recalibrate the conditions of the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO . Specifically, we decided to extend the period over which considerably more favourable terms will apply by twelve months, to June 2022. We will also conduct three additional operations between June and December 2021. Moreover, we decided to raise the total amount that counterparties will be entitled to borrow in TLTRO III operations from 50 per cent to 55 per cent of their stock of eligible loans. In order to provide an incentive for banks to sustain the current level of bank lending, the recalibrated TLTRO III borrowing conditions will be made available only to banks that achieve a new lending performance target. The extension of the pandemic-related low interest rate period under TLTRO III, the addition of more operations and the increase in the amount that can potentially be borrowed will preserve the very attractive funding conditions for banks. This will help to ensure that they can continue to offer favourable lending conditions and have ample liquidity to extend loans to households and firms. Fourth, we decided to extend to June 2022 the duration of the set of collateral easing measures adopted by the Governing Council on 7 and 22 April 2020. The extension of these measures will continue to ensure that banks can make full use of the Eurosystem's liquidity operations, most notably the recalibrated TLTROs. The Governing Council will reassess the collateral easing measures before June 2022, ensuring that Eurosystem counterparties' participation in TLTRO III operations is not adversely affected. Fifth, the Governing Council also decided to offer four additional pandemic emergency longer-term refinancing operations (PELTROs) in 2021, which will continue to provide an effective liquidity backstop. Sixth, net purchases under our asset purchase programme (APP) will continue at a monthly pace of €20 billion. We continue to expect monthly net asset purchases under the APP to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of our policy rates, and to end shortly before we start raising the key ECB interest rates. We also intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. Seventh, the Eurosystem repo facility for central banks (EUREP) and all temporary swap and repo lines with non-euro area central banks will be extended until March 2022. Finally, we decided to continue conducting our regular lending operations as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment at the prevailing conditions for as long as necessary. Separate press releases with further details of the measures taken by the Governing Council will be published this afternoon at 15:30 CET. The monetary policy measures taken today will contribute to preserving favourable financing conditions over the pandemic period, thereby supporting the flow of credit to all sectors of the economy, underpinning economic activity and safeguarding medium-term price stability. At the same time, uncertainty remains high, including with regard to the dynamics of the pandemic and the timing of vaccine roll-outs. We will also continue to monitor developments in the exchange rate with regard to their possible implications for the medium-term inflation outlook. We therefore continue to stand ready to adjust all of our instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards our aim in a sustained manner, in line with our commitment to symmetry. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Following a sharp contraction in the first half of 2020, euro area real GDP rebounded strongly and rose by 12.5 per cent, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter, although remaining well below pre-pandemic levels. The second wave of the pandemic and the associated intensification of containment measures observed since mid-October are expected to result in a renewed significant decline in activity in the fourth quarter, although to a much lesser extent than observed in the second quarter of this year. Economic developments continue to be uneven across sectors, with activity in the services sector being more adversely affected by the new restrictions on social interaction and mobility than activity in the industrial sector. Although fiscal policy measures are supporting households and firms, consumers remain cautious in the light of the pandemic and its ramifications for employment and earnings. Moreover, weaker balance sheets and uncertainty about the economic outlook are weighing on business investment. Looking ahead, the news of prospective roll-outs of vaccines allows for greater confidence in the assumption of a gradual resolution of the health crisis. However, it will take time until widespread immunity is achieved, while further resurgences in infections, with challenges to public health and economic prospects, cannot be ruled out. Over the medium term, the recovery of the euro area economy should be supported by favourable financing conditions, an expansionary fiscal stance and a recovery in demand as containment measures are lifted and uncertainty recedes. This assessment is broadly reflected in the baseline scenario of the December 2020 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. These projections foresee annual real GDP growth at -7.3 per cent in 2020, 3.9 per cent in 2021, 4.2 per cent in 2022 and 2.1 per cent in 2023. Compared with the September 2020 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for economic activity has been revised down in the short term, but is seen to broadly recover to the level projected in the September baseline scenario over the medium term. Overall, the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the downside, but have become less pronounced. While the news about the prospects for vaccine roll-outs in the near future is encouraging, downside risks remain related to the implications of the pandemic for economic and financial conditions. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual inflation remained unchanged at -0.3 per cent in November. On the basis of oil price dynamics and taking into account the temporary reduction in the German VAT rate, headline inflation is likely to remain negative until early 2021. Thereafter, it is expected to increase owing to the end of the temporary VAT reduction in Germany and upward base effects in energy price inflation. At the same time, underlying price pressures are expected to remain subdued owing to weak demand, notably in the tourism and travel-related sectors, as well as to low wage pressures and the appreciation of the euro exchange rate. Once the impact of the pandemic fades, a recovery in demand, supported by accommodative fiscal and monetary policies, will put upward pressure on inflation over the medium term. Market-based indicators and survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations remain at low levels. This assessment is broadly reflected in the baseline scenario of the December 2020 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresees annual inflation at 0.2 per cent in 2020, 1.0 per cent in 2021, 1.1 per cent in 2022 and 1.4 per cent in 2023. Compared with the September 2020 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for inflation has been revised down for 2020 and 2022. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth of broad money (M3) remained broadly unchanged at 10.5 per cent in October 2020. Strong money growth has been supported by the ongoing asset purchases by the Eurosystem, which have become the largest source of money creation. In the context of a still heightened preference for liquidity in the money-holding sector and a low opportunity cost of holding the most liquid forms of money, the narrow monetary aggregate M1 continues to be the main contributor to broad money growth. The growth of lending to the private sector has plateaued, while still recording higher growth rates than prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Following strong increases in the early months of the pandemic, the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations fell to 6.8 per cent in October, after 7.1 per cent in September. This deceleration has occurred in the context of abating emergency liquidity needs, weak investment and tighter credit conditions on loans to firms, as signalled by our bank lending survey for the euro area for the third quarter of 2020. The annual growth rate of loans to households stood at 3.1 per cent in October, unchanged from September. Overall, our policy measures, together with the measures adopted by national governments and European institutions, remain essential to support bank lending conditions and access to financing, in particular for those most affected by the ramifications of the pandemic. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is necessary to support economic activity and the robust convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2 per cent over the medium term. Regarding fiscal policies, an ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance remains critical, in view of the sharp contraction in the euro area economy. Fiscal measures taken in response to the pandemic emergency should, as much as possible, be targeted and temporary in nature. At the same time, weak demand from firms and households and the heightened risk of a delayed recovery in the light of the new lockdowns owing to the second wave of the pandemic warrant continued support from national fiscal policies. The three safety nets endorsed by the European Council for workers, businesses and sovereigns provide important funding support in this context. The Governing Council recognises the key role of the Next Generation EU package and stresses the importance of it becoming operational without delay. It calls on Member States to deploy the funds for productive public spending, accompanied by productivity-enhancing structural policies. This would allow the Next Generation EU programme to contribute to a faster, stronger and more uniform recovery and would increase economic resilience and the growth potential of Member States' economies, thereby supporting the effectiveness of monetary policy in the euro area. Such structural policies are particularly important in addressing long-standing structural and institutional weaknesses and in accelerating the green and digital transitions."
Peru,2020-12-10,"PRESS RELEASE MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT DECEMBER 2020 BCRP MAINTAINED REFERENCE RATE AT 0.25% The Board of Directors of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) decided to continue its expansionary policy stance, maintaining the reference rate at 0.25 percent and implementing further liquidity injection operations, in light of the following developments: Inflation in 2020 will lie at the center of the target range due to transitory factors; and inflation in 2021 is expected to be around the lower limit of the target range, as domestic demand, although in recovery, will remain low. One-year ahead expected inflation was 1.7 percent in November. Year-on-year inflation increased from 1.7 percent in October to 2.1 percent in November due to higher food and energy prices associated with transitory supply-side factors. Trend inflation remains in the lower part of the target range. Year-on-year core inflation was 1.75 percent in November. Leading indicators continued to improve at a higher than expected rate, although they remain below last year's levels, while firms' growth expectations continued to recover in November. Global economic activity has been improving, but remains below last year's levels. The BCRP will continue to take the necessary steps to sustain the payments system and credit flows. As of December 9, the BCRP's liquidity injection operations totaled S/ 61.5 billion, of which S/ 50.2 billion were associated with government-backed repos. In this context, credit to the private sector grew 13.1 percent year-on-year in October, with interest rates declining steadily since April. The Board considers it appropriate to maintain a strong expansionary monetary stance for as long as the negative effects of the pandemic on inflation and its determinants persist. The BCRP stands ready to expand monetary stimulus using a range of instruments. The Board also decided to maintain the following interest rates on its window facility operations in domestic currency with financial entities: Overnight deposits: 0.15 percent per year. Direct security/currency repo and rediscount operations: 0.50 percent per year. The schedule of monetary policy meetings for the next twelve months is the following January 14 February 11 March 11 April 8 May 13 June 10 July 8 August 12 September 9 October 7 November 11 December 9."
Ukraine,2020-12-10,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to keep its key policy rate at 6% per annum. On the one hand, this decision does not change the expansionary stance of monetary policy, which is important for economic recovery. On the other hand, it will keep inflation moderate. Inflation accelerated markedly and came close to the lower bound of the 5%+/-1 pp target range. In November, consumer prices grew by 3.8% yoy. In monthly terms, the consumer price index also grew noticeably, by 1.3%, which was more than the NBU had expected. An important factor behind the growth in consumer prices was the increase in natural gas prices on the European market, which impacted domestic prices of gas, heating, and hot water supply. In addition, some foods became more expensive because of lower harvests and the resulting growth in global prices. Buoyant consumer demand has also supported price growth in the past few months. Higher incomes and worsened expectations, including due to uncertainty over the lockdown, encouraged households to spend more, which was evidenced by an increase in retail turnover. This also contributed to an active economic recovery in H2. The NBU sees the impact of the “weekend quarantine” as insignificant, although it has affected the confidence of businesses and consumers. The NBU expects inflation to enter the target range of 5%+/-1 pp by the end of the year. In view of the low comparison base, consumer prices are expected to continue rising in the coming months. According to the NBU estimates, the quarantine restrictions announced by the government for January 2021 will not have much influence on economic activity, consumer demand, and thus on inflation. At the same time, balanced monetary and fiscal policies will not only contribute to the resumption of economic growth, but also will maintain inflation at moderate levels. The primary assumption of the NBU Board is that Ukraine will continue to cooperate with the IMF. Cooperation with the IMF remains fundamental for the recovery of Ukraine's economy. Financing provided by the IMF and other international partners is crucial for the planned budgetary spending. Without this support, the fiscal impulse required to revive the economy will be much smaller, and the recovery will take longer. Ukraine's fulfillment of its obligations under agreements with international lenders will unblock next tranches of official financing. This will reduce interest rates on state borrowing on the domestic and foreign markets. As before, a rise in coronavirus cases and the imposition of stricter quarantine measures to overcome the pandemic remain the key risks to macrofinancial stability. This could result in gloomier consumer sentiment and subdued domestic demand, which would depress economic activity and restrain inflation. Other risks also remain significant. the negative impact of certain court rulings on macrofinancial stabilityan escalation of the military conflict in eastern Ukraine or on the country's borders, andhigher volatility of global food prices, driven by global climate change and stronger protectionist measures worldwide.Given rising inflationary pressures and great uncertainty, the NBU Board decided to keep the key policy rate unchanged, at 6%. Looking ahead, the NBU's monetary policy will mainly depend on how the pandemic develops and how high inflation risks are. If the epidemiological situation stabilizes quickly, the economy will continue to revive, accompanied by a moderate increase in inflation. The main stimuli will be provided by fiscal policy, including by an expected rise in the minimum wage. That said, the NBU, while conducting a loose monetary policy, stands ready to raise its key policy rate in response to accelerating inflation on the back of a revival of the global and Ukrainian economies. Conversely, the materialization of the adverse scenario will restrain consumer demand, slowing overall economic growth. Under such conditions, inflationary pressures will be weaker, enabling the NBU to give the economy additional monetary impetus for growth. The decision to keep the key policy rate at 6%, was approved by an NBU Board Decision on the key policy rate  No.726-D, dated 10 December 2020. A summary of the discussion by Monetary Policy Committee members that preceded the approval of this decision will be published on 21 December 2020. The next monetary policy meeting of the NBU Board will be held on 21 January 2021, according to the confirmed and published schedule."
Kazakhstan,2020-12-14," 52 The base rate remains unchanged at 9.00% December 14, 2020 Nur-Sultan The National Bank of Kazakhstan has made a decision to maintain the base rate at 9.0% per annum with the narrowing of the corridor to +/- 1.0 percentage points. Consequently, the rate for the liquidity provision standing facilities set on 10.0% and for the liquidity withdrawal standing facilities  8.0%. The decision was made on the basis of the fundamental instability in the oil market, the high and weakly anchored inflation expectations, still continuing uncertainty about the epidemiological situation in the country and in the world, and also the timing of mass vaccination. Anchoring the inflation expectations is the basis for achieving the target objections in years of 2021-2022, which will allow to achieve the inflation target of 4-6% by the end of 2021 at the current level of the base rate. Annual inflation rate in November, 2020 has accelerated to 7.3% after the stabilization at the level 7.0-7.1% in June-October of the current year. The dynamics of the inflationary processes continues to remain above the target band of 4-6%. The food component of inflation continues to make the main contribution to the formation of inflationary processes. At the same time, international prices for grain have been growing for the fourth month in a row, which creates additional inflationary risks. Growth in food prices, after a slight slowdown in previous months, accelerated again to 10.8% in November 2020, despite a slowdown in price growth for certain types of goods, such as meat and bakery products. In November 2020, the acceleration of prices of sugar and sunflower oil continued amid rising world prices. Non-food inflation in November 2020 accelerated to 5.7% in annual terms. In connection with the pandemic, prices for medicines continue to increase by 9.7%, household goods by 7.5% and detergents and cleaning products by 10.2%. The disinflationary effect is caused by a weak consumer demand, a decrease of real money incomes of households and an existing quarantine restrictions in the country. Non-food inflation is restrained by the slowdown in the annual growth rate of prices for fuels, oil and lubricants to 1.7%, as well as by the shift in consumer preferences of the households towards cheaper imported goods. The inflation of paid services in annual terms also showed an acceleration to 4.1%. This was facilitated by the rise in prices for both regulated (utilities) and unregulated services (hospital services, education, repair of footwear and cars). According to the National Bank's estimates, in August-October 2020 the seasonally adjusted annualized growth in consumer prices formed closer to the upper limit of the 4-6% target band. However, in November 2020, due to the increasing prices for certain goods (oils and fats, sugar, outerwear, thermal energy), it accelerated to 7.4%, thereby significantly exceeding the target band. Inflation expectations of the households are weakly anchored and remain sensitive to the imbalances in the food markets and the increase in the level of uncertainty due to the worsening epidemiological situation and tougher quarantine measures in the country's regions. The quantitative estimate of inflation expected in a year in November 2020 increased to 7.8%. The share of respondents who expect the current price growth to continue or to accelerate over the next twelve months increased to 52% (in September - 49%). The inflation forecast in Kazakhstan at the end of 2020 has been revised downwards. Annual inflation in December 2020 is expected to be in the range of 7.3-7.5% due to the more significant disinflationary impact of domestic demand amid repeated quarantine measures. Nevertheless, medium-term inflation forecasts have not undergone significant changes - a gradual slowdown towards the upper limit of the target band of 4-6% will occur only by the end of 2021. According to the results of 11 months of 2020, the economy of Kazakhstan contracted by 2.8% in annual terms - the decline in economic activity turned out to be deeper than expected. This is due to a 3.4% reduction in the mining industry, as well as the implementation of the negative scenario of the second coronavirus wave. In the service sector, the negative contribution of trade has continued since the beginning of the year due to a decrease in wholesale trade turnover amid a decrease in exports of oil and certain types of metals. At the same time, due to the softening of restrictive measures in some regions, an increase in the volume of retail trade is observed. The dynamics in transport is also in the negative zone. The sectors of construction (12.1%), information and communications (8.4%), and agriculture (5.3%) made a positive contribution to the dynamics of GDP. In October 2020, there was a deterioration in investment activity (a decrease of 4.7% yoy since the beginning of the year). The fall in investment in the mining industry, construction and trade is partially offset by positive dynamics, and in some cases by the acceleration of investments in other sectors of the real and public sectors of the economy. Leading indicators recorded a continuing recovery in economic activity. In November, the business activity index continued growth and improved by 0.6 percentage points from 48.8 to 49.4. The growth of the index was largely influenced by the improvement in the situation in construction, which for the first time since February this year entered the positive zone, reaching a value of 52.5. In industry and services, the situation remained practically unchanged, the indices were 49.6 and 48.7, respectively. In the third quarter of 2020, after a significant drop in the second quarter, due to the gradual lifting of quarantine restrictions, the real household consumption is gradually reviving. This is confirmed by the data on retail trade turnover, which has been showing positive dynamics since August 2020. The pandemic continues to have a negative impact on the development of the global economy. Another wave of coronavirus, which led to repeated quarantine measures in many countries, negatively affected economic activity, in particular this applies to most EU countries. In the meantime, the United States is showing the highest values of business growth since 2018, driven by the realization of deferred demand. A slower and more uneven global growth recovery is expected during 2021-2022. External demand from the countries - the main trading partners of Kazakhstan will recover unevenly, which is confirmed by the projected growth rates in 2021: in Russia - 3.1%, in the EU - 4.5%, in China - 7.9%. This can be explained by the prolonged unavailability of large-scale vaccine use and the ongoing 2 restrictive measures to combat COVID-19, which have a negative impact on consumption and business activity. Annual inflation in the countries - the main trading partners emerges in different directions due to different epidemiological and economic situations. Considering that and the growing uncertainty about the future development of the pandemic, the monetary conditions in the countries remain extremely adaptive. In Russia, in November 2020, annual inflation unexpectedly accelerated to 4.4%, which was primarily caused by the rise in food prices. To ensure price stability, the Government of the Russian Federation has been tasked to take appropriate measures, including of those of the administrative nature. News on coronavirus vaccines had a positive impact on world oil prices, which reached 50 US dollars per barrel for the first time since early March. The oil market also positively reacted to the decision taken by the OPEC + countries at their meeting on December 3, 2020. Thus, a decision was made to increase the daily oil production more moderately from January 1, 2020 - 0.5 million barrels/day instead of the previously agreed 1.9 million barrels / day. However, this positive news may be temporary due to the possibly longer recovery in oil demand due to uncertainties amid the pandemic, the timing of vaccinations and the risk of accelerating oil production from individual countries. The stable situation in the money market allowed to narrow the base rate corridor to the pre-epidemic level. As a result, more stable expectations of market participants will be formed and the volatility of money market rates will decrease. The National Bank will continue to monitor internal and external factors that affect the dynamics of inflation. Further decisions on the base rate will be made taking into account the compliance of the actual dynamics of inflation with its targets, the rate of decline of inflation expectations, recovery in demand, and the balance of inflationary risks. The next planned decision of the National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan about the base rate will be announced on January 25, 2020 at 15:00 Nur-Sultan time.

Thailand,2020-12-14,"Outcome of the Joint Meeting between the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) and the Financial Institutions Policy Committee (FIPC) on 8 December 2020 The Bank of Thailand (BOT) announced the outcome of the joint meeting between the MPC and the FIPC on 8 December 2020 to assess risks to Thailand's financial stability. Key discussion points were as follows. The committees concluded that Thailand's financial stability remained sound overall. Commercial banks and insurance companies had substantial capital buffers, while financial markets continued to function properly. Yet despite the better-than-expected economic outturns, the Thai economic recovery would likely be gradual and uncertain. Risk factors going forward would include the possibility of the second outbreak of COVID-19, the scale of the re- opening of the country for foreign tourists in 2021, and the continuity of government's economic stimulus measures. Under this environment, risks to financial stability in certain pockets could rise in contrast with improving economic conditions. One key area would be the deterioration in debt serviceability of households and businesses, especially SMEs, which could exert spillover to other sectors, for example, via financial institutions' credit quality and corporate bonds' rollover risks. These risks shall be managed by targeted and timely measures, so that economic momentum would not be affected going forward. The committees conducted a comprehensive assessment of financial stability risks and highlighted two priority areas as follows. Supporting businesses and households in a targeted and timely manner to contain financial stability risks. Businesses had started re-opening but showed different paces of recovery across business segments (uneven recovery). As a result, support measures—including structural, demand-sided, and financial policies—should be tailored to address the problems and the viability of each business segment as follows: For viable firms facing temporary liquidity shortage, liquidity support via new loans and proactive debt restructuring would be appropriate. For already- burdened-by-high-debt firms facing liquidity shortage, funding support for business restructuring, through credit or debt to equity swap mechanism, and proactive debt restructuring should be prioritized. In this light, the Office of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was in consultation with government and private agencies to evaluate the possibility of establishing funds to help firms affected by COVID-19. For firms that had been facing competitiveness issues for some time, attention should be given to structural measures aiming to reduce excess capacity and support adaptation of business models to meet changing consumer demand. With regard to households, the implemented measures aiming to reduce debt-servicing burden, notably debt payment holidays and installment reductions, had reached a large number of retail borrowers so far. However some borrowers still needed additional help through debt restructuring. The BOT urged financial institutions to help borrowers in a manner tailored to borrowers' problems and needs by letting the borrowers “opt-in” into support programs, instead of applying broad-based measures. In addition, debt restructuring for retail borrowers was pushed to be more comprehensive and suitable to borrowers' debt serviceability in the long term. Alongside these debt measures, measures to support income and reduce expenses should also be implemented. These included government' s measures on employment support and expenditure reduction for low-income households, as well as measures by the Office of Insurance Commission (OIC) to help policyholders, such as the reduction of insurance premiums and the extension of premium payments. Safeguarding stability of the financial sector and containing spillover from financial markets. Measures undertaken to stabilize domestic financial markets, namely the Corporate Bond Stabilization Fund (BSF) and the Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (MFLF), had been instrumental in restoring investor confidence and market functioning. However the credit spreads of corporate bonds rated BBB or below and unrated bonds, which had picked up sharply in the first half of 2020, were yet to recede to normal levels, reflecting investors' concerns on these segments. Also there continued to be rollover risks in high-yield bonds (ie. non-investment grade and unrated), which were issued mainly by real estate developers. Although these risks were still present, assessments indicated that they would not lead to systemic risks. While overall situations had improved, the economic outlook remained highly uncertain and capital markets would likely remain volatile, so both the BSF and the MFLF still needed to be maintained to prepare for future shocks that could affect investor sentiment. Moreover there remained a need to prepare additional measures for risks from market segments not covered by the BSF, such as supporting the establishment of high-yield bond funds, which could provide additional liquidity and help stabilize the corporate bond market. With regard to the savings cooperatives system, the search-for-yield behavior continued to be present, as reflected by the growing proportion of excess liquidity invested in equity and corporate debt securities. Thus there continued to be a need to strengthen and effectively implement related regulations, such as investment limits on financial securities. Furthermore financial regulators had implemented several measures to ensure that the financial sector possess adequate buffers to withstand potential risks and support economic recovery going forward. For examples: The BOT set the limit on banks' dividend payments, prohibited the buybacks of stocks and debentures that could be counted as regulatory capital before maturity, and relaxed the eligibility criteria for regulatory capital to be on par with the international standard. The objective was to ensure that financial institutions have enough capital cushion to withstand unanticipated events and play a key role in supporting economic recovery. The SEC was in the process of revising regulations to provide asset management companies with more liquidity management tools, as approved by the Capital Market Supervisory Board. The OIC was in the process of issuing guidelines on subordinated debt issuances by life and non-life insurance companies to be counted toward regulatory capital, aiming to strengthen capital and liquidity positions of insurance companies. Also the OIC issued the guidelines for insurance companies on IT security and cyber risks, which emerged as new risks for the insurance industry. Given economic and financial uncertainties going forward, the BOT, the SEC, and the OIC would continue to collaborate closely in assessing risks as well as the adequacy and effectiveness of measures undertaken. The regulators would stand ready to impose additional measures to contain financial stability risks and support economic recovery. Further cooperation with government agencies would be essential going forward, while financial regulations should be coordinated and reviewed to ensure that they continue to be appropriate in the changing economic and financial context."
Armenia,2020-12-15,"PRESS RELEASE 15.12.2020 Refinancing rate raised by 1.0 pp to 5.25% At the December 15, 2020 meeting the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia decided to raise the refinancing rate by 1.0 percentage point to 5.25%. Inflation in November 2020 stood at 1.3%, compared to 1.1% in the same month of the previous year. As a result, the 12-month inflation amounted to 1.6%, still below the 4% target. In November, the 12- month core inflation also continued rising, which at the end of the month stood at about 2.0%. In the fourth quarter, the world economy developments were mainly affected by the new wave of coronavirus pandemic and the coronavirus-related restrictions in some countries, which had a negative impact on global demand and economic activity. On the other hand, expectations about the possible effective use of vaccines since the beginning of 2021 have created a positive momentum for the outlook of global demand. Under such circumstances, inflationary trends have been recorded in both international commodity and food product markets, which is gradually fueling the inflationary environment of the partner countries. Based on these developments, the CBA Board expects some inflationary impact from the external sector on the Armenian economy. In Armenia in the third quarter, in line with the CBA forecasts, a y/y 9.1% economic decline was registered, caused by decreases in all sectors of the economy, and services in particular. In the fourth quarter, due to the negative impact of the announced military situation in Armenia, the outbreak of a new wave of coronavirus pandemic, as well as heightened uncertainty, sluggish economic activity and weak domestic demand are expected to persist. On the other hand, implementation of the expansionary fiscal policy will continue contributing positively to aggregate demand. Under such conditions, the estimates of annual economic growth for 2020 have not been revised. Taking into account some acceleration of inflation amid the expected inflationary effects from the external sector and considering the increase of the country's risk premium, the CBA Board considers it appropriate to raise the refinancing rate. The Board also reckons that the monetary policy stance still remains expansionary, which will need to be gradually reduced over the forecast horizon, in order to stabilize inflation around the 4% target. The Board considers that, in view of high uncertainties about economic growth outlook, risks of inflation deviating from the projection path are on the upside in the short run. The Central Bank is monitoring the developments, and should they unfold, the CBA will stand ready to react accordingly, ensuring price stability in the medium run. You can read detailed information underlying the decision on the level of interest rate in Inflation Report (Monetary Policy Program. Q4, 2020) to be published on December 29, 2020.

Hungary,2020-12-15,"At its meeting on 15 December 2020, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 16 December 2020:. The primary objective of the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) is to achieve and maintain price stability. Without prejudice to its primary objective, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank preserves financial stability and supports the Government's economic policy. Global macroeconomic and financial developments continue to be driven mainly by the events of the coronavirus pandemic and the news related to the development of the vaccine. Following a decline in the second quarter of 2020, the performance of the world's large economies showed a significant correction in the third quarter. However, due to the second wave of the pandemic and the increasingly tighter pandemic restrictions introduced, the economic recovery has been delayed. As a result, there remains an exceptionally high degree of uncertainty surrounding the pace of global economic recovery. Sentiment in global financial markets has improved recently, reflecting favourable news related to the development of the vaccine, an improvement in the economic outlook and the prior adoption of the European budget and the recovery fund. Nevertheless, risk indicators have remained at a high level. At its policy meeting in December, the European Central Bank (ECB) left policy rates unchanged, but further easing measures were announced. The ECB decided to increase the envelope of the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) by EUR 500 billion to a total of EUR 1,850 billion, and eased the conditions of its TLTRO III programme. In addition, the ECB will also conduct additional longer-term refinancing tenders to provide the banking system with the necessary amount of liquidity. In our region, the Czech, the Polish and the Romanian central banks held their policy rates unchanged at low levels. Due to the protracted economic recovery, the world's leading central banks and those in the region are expected to maintain loose monetary conditions over a prolonged period. After reaching a low point in April and May, domestic economic activity underwent a significant correction. In the third quarter of 2020. Hungary's GDP rose by 11.4 percent relative to the previous quarter but fell by 4.6 percent from its level a year earlier. In general, the global economic recovery is taking longer than earlier expected due to the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic. With the restrictive measures. Hungary's economic activity is likely to weaken again in the fourth quarter of 2020. As a result, overall GDP is expected to decline by 6.0-6.5 percent in 2020. Economic activity may begin to normalise from the second quarter of 2021 as the coronavirus vaccine becomes widely available. Hungary's GDP is expected to rise by 3.5-6.0 percent in 2021 and by 5.0-5.5 percent in 2022. In November 2020, annual inflation was 2.7 percent, core inflation was 3.9 percent and core inflation excluding indirect tax effects stood at 3.3 percent. Following higher repricing in the summer months, disinflationary effects strengthened from September. More subdued price growth primarily reflected changes in market services, fuel and food prices. Based on incoming data, the inflation rate is likely to be somewhat lower, at 3.4 percent, in 2020 relative to the September projection. Pricing decisions are expected to continue to exhibit high volatility in the coming quarters. As a result of an increase in excise taxes on tobacco products at the beginning of 2021 and base effects, the consumer price index is expected to stand at around 4 percent temporarily in the spring months of 2021. Tax effects resulting from the new administrative measures are expected to raise inflation by 0.4 percentage point in 2021 and by 0.1 percentage point in 2022. In terms of underlying inflation, a prolonged economic recovery is likely to cause disinflationary effects to be persistent. In addition to the moderate external inflation environment, weak domestic demand also points to a slowdown in price growth. Overall, inflation is likely to be 3.5-3.6 percent in 2021 before returning to around the central bank target in 2022. The time profile of the pandemic and the expected economic recovery may continue to result in volatile pricing patterns; therefore, an exceptionally cautious approach is warranted in assessing more persistent inflationary effects. In 2020, the government deficit is likely to rise to 8-9 percent of GDP due to the costs of protection against the coronavirus pandemic, the measures taken under the Economy Protection Action Plan and declining tax revenue resulting from the slowdown in economic growth. However, the government deficit in 2020 is likely to be around the international average. From 2021 the government deficit is likely to decrease. After falling steadily since 2011, the government debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to rise temporarily in 2020; however, it is likely to shift to a downward path from 2021 as the economy recovers and the deficit declines. The capital account surplus is contributing to maintaining Hungary's stable, positive net lending position. As a result, net external debt is expected to decline further in the coming years. In the Monetary Council's assessment, the increase in risk aversion vis-a-vis emerging markets continues to pose the greatest risk in terms of the outlook for inflation. It is the MNB's clear intention to prevent the current uncertain global market environment from causing an increase in upside risks to inflation. The central bank balance sheet has contracted in recent years, creating sufficient potential to address economic challenges in a sustainable manner. In response to the adverse economic effects arising from the coronavirus pandemic, the MNB expanded significantly the central bank balance sheet, thereby supporting the recovery of economic growth as well. The MNB's balance sheet can still be considered of average size in regional comparison, despite a significant expansion this year. The MNB will be ready to increase the size of its balance sheet further to manage risks arising from the coronavirus pandemic and to foster the quick recovery of sustainable economic growth. The government securities purchase programme contributed successfully to maintaining a stable liquidity position in the government securities market and strengthened the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission. The stock of government securities in the Bank's balance sheet has increased by over HUF 900 billion since May 2020. The MNB continues to use the government securities purchase programme and to settle for a lasting market presence in the secondary government securities market. The MNB will use the programme to the extent and for the time necessary. The Bank applies a flexible approach to the amount of its weekly purchases, concentrating its purchases on longer maturities. In the Monetary Council's assessment, the FGS Go! plays a key role in mitigating the adverse economic effects of coronavirus, as it offers cheap funding with reliable rates to the SME sector with more favourable conditions than before and to a wide range of applications. There has been significant interest by companies in the FGS Go! since it was launched in April. Under the scheme, over 17,000 domestic micro, small and medium-sized enterprises accessed the favourable funding opportunity until the end of November, in the amount of close to HUF 1,200 billion. During the economic recovery, it is of key importance for the Monetary Council to provide the amount of funding necessary for the continuous operations of SMEs and the realisation of their investment projects, which also fosters the recovery of economic growth. By the end of November 2020, over 260 companies registered for the Bond Funding for Growth Scheme. By the end of the period, 40 companies successfully issued 46 bond series, raising nearly HUF 800 billion. The MNB will continue to sterilise the resulting surplus liquidity issued under the programmes in full, using the preferential deposit instrument. At its meeting today, the Monetary Council left the base rate and the overnight deposit rate unchanged at 0.60 percent and -0.05 percent, respectively, and the overnight and the one-week collateralised lending rates at 1.85 percent. The MNB will continue to set the one-week deposit rate at weekly tenders, in response to the increase in risk aversion vis-a-vis emerging markets. The Bank will maintain the difference between the base rate and the one-week deposit rate as long as warranted by inflationary risks. It is a key priority for the MNB that short-term rates in every sub-market and at all times should develop consistently with the level of short-term rates deemed optimal by the Monetary Council. Therefore, the MNB will conduct foreign exchange swap tenders providing euro liquidity at the end of December as at the end of September. The Bank will hold the four announced tenders with no quantitative limit, and it still may use its international master repurchase agreements to finance them. Measures taken at the short end of the yield curve will contribute to preserving the stability of monetary conditions and through this to maintaining price stability. In the Monetary Council's assessment, the monetary conditions established at the short end support price stability, the preservation of financial stability and the recovery of economic growth in a sustainable manner. In the current rapidly changing environment, it is key to maintain short-term yields at a safe distance from a range close to zero. The MNB remains committed to maintaining price stability during the coronavirus pandemic. Consequently, the Council continuously assesses incoming data, closely monitors the persistence of inflationary effects resulting from the restoration of the economy and the possible inflationary effects of financial market developments. If warranted by a change in the outlook for inflation, the MNB will be ready to use the appropriate instruments."
Philippines,2020-12-16,"At its meeting on monetary policy today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase facility at 2.0 percent. The interest rates on the overnight deposit and lending facilities were likewise kept at 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively. The Monetary Board's decision was based on its assessment that the inflation environment remains benign. The latest baseline forecasts have risen slightly due to the sharp increase in global crude oil prices and the higher-than-expected food inflation in November. However, since the rise in food prices is transitory, it is expected that the future inflation path will remain firmly within the Government's 2-4 percent target over the policy horizon. The balance of risks to the inflation outlook also leans toward the downside from 2020 to 2022 owing largely to potential disruptions to domestic and global economic activity amid the ongoing pandemic. Meanwhile, inflation expectations remain broadly consistent with the inflation target. The Monetary Board noted that the resurgence of COVID-19 cases globally has tempered economic activity with the reimposition of preventive measures in recent weeks. However, optimism over the delivery of vaccines has lifted market confidence, supporting improved prospects for global growth. On the domestic front, the Monetary Board also observed early indications of improved mobility and sentiment. While recent natural calamities could pose strong headwinds to growth, the further easing of quarantine measures should help facilitate the recovery of the economy in the coming months. Given these considerations, the Monetary Board is of the view that monetary policy settings remain appropriate. The Monetary Board believes that an accommodative monetary policy stance, together with sustained fiscal initiatives to ensure public welfare, should quicken the economy's transition toward a sustainable recovery. Looking ahead, the BSP remains committed to deploying its full range of instruments as needed in fulfillment of its mandate to maintain price and financial stability conducive to growth."
United States,2020-12-16,"EST December 16, 2020 The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals. The COVID-19 pandemic is causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. Economic activity and employment have continued to recover but remain well below their levels at the beginning of the year. Weaker demand and earlier declines in oil prices have been holding down consumer price inflation. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. The path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus. The ongoing public health crisis will continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation running persistently below this longer- run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved. The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, the Federal Reserve will continue to increase its (more) For release at 2 p.m. EST December 16, 2020 - 2 - holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage- backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals. These asset purchases help foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H Powell. Chair; John C. Williams. Vice Chair; Michelle W Bowman; Lael Brainard; Richard H Clarida; Patrick Harker; Robert S Kaplan; Neel Kashkari; Loretta J Mester; and Randal K Quarles."
Czech Republic,2020-12-17,"t its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank unanimously kept interest rates unchanged. The two-week repo rate thus remains at 0.25%, the discount rate at 0.05% and the Lombard rate at 1%. This decision of the Bank Board is underpinned by the November macroeconomic forecast and by an assessment of information obtained since it was prepared. Consistent with the forecast is stability of market interest rates initially, followed by a gradual rise in rates in the course of 2021. The Bank Board assessed the risks and uncertainties of the forecast in the context of the ongoing second wave of the pandemic as remaining very substantial. As regards developments abroad, the decline in GDP in the effective euro area will be smaller this year compared with the assumptions of the current forecast. However, it will take the economies longer to recover from it. This will result in slower economic growth in 2021. By contrast. GDP growth in 2022 has been revised slightly upwards. The outlook for foreign industrial producer prices has been increased for this year and the next but lowered thereafter. Expectations regarding consumer price inflation abroad are largely unchanged, as is the outlook for 3M EURIBOR interest rates. The Brent crude oil price rose significantly during November. Its outlook increased above the assumptions of the current forecast for both the rest of this year and the subsequent years. By contrast, the outlook for the euro-dollar exchange rate is almost unchanged. In line with expectations, domestic inflation fell below the upper boundary of the tolerance band around the inflation target in the autumn. In November, it was slightly below the forecast. Core inflation remained elevated but did not accelerate further. The recent high growth in food prices slowed as expected. The slowdown in November was slightly more pronounced than forecasted. Growth in administered prices slowed further, in fact slightly more than expected, owing to changes in electricity prices. Fuel prices continued to fall year on year, in line with the forecast. According to the current forecast, inflation will decrease further next year and will return close to the 2% target over the monetary policy horizon, i.e. in late 2021 and early 2022. The easing of the anti-epidemic measures during the summer enabled the Czech economy to partly breathe again. This led to quarter-on-quarter GDP growth of almost 7% and a moderation of the year-on-year GDP decline to -5%. The recovery of the domestic economy in Q3 was stronger than expected by the current forecast. This was due mainly to exports, reflecting above all a stronger recovery in external demand. Imports meanwhile lagged behind exports, owing partly to an unexpectedly deep downturn in domestic private investment, which is highly import-intensive. The household consumption forecast broadly materialised, in an environment of huge uncertainty. By contrast, government consumption growth surprisingly halted. The forecast does not expect the negative economic impacts of the second wave of the pandemic to start subsiding until the first half of next year, when the economy will return to growth amid recovering external demand. However, the output of the Czech economy will not reach the pre-crisis level even by the end of 2022. So far, the latest monthly indicators do not point to any significant negative impacts of the second wave of the pandemic on domestic industrial production, which returned to year-on-year growth in October. By contrast, construction output, which was hit less severely than industry in the spring, remains in a year-on-year decline during the autumn. The fall in overall retail sales, i.e. including the automotive segment, has moderated in recent months. Retail sales excluding the automotive segment have been broadly flat. The situation can be expected to worsen again in November and December, not only in retail, but also in many other sectors. As forecasted, the cooling of the labour market temporarily halted in Q3. Unemployment rose only slightly and total employment did not fall further, in line with the forecast. Year-on-year wage growth in Q3 was slightly faster than forecasted. The return to wage growth in Q3 primarily reflected the fade-out of statistical effects connected with the first wave of the pandemic, which had significantly lowered the reported wage growth in Q2. The koruna appreciated against the euro in November, correcting the previous sharp weakening associated with the onset of the second wave of the pandemic. So far in Q4, the koruna has on average been almost 50 hellers stronger against the euro than forecasted. Overall, the key domestic variables are not deviating substantially from the forecast. The smaller-than-expected year-on-year decline in economic activity in 2020 Q3 is good news. Inflation was slightly lower than forecasted in November. The same goes for the share of unemployed persons in Q4 so far. By contrast, the average wage rose faster year on year in Q3 than expected by the forecast."
Mexico,2020-12-17,"Banco de Mexico's Governing Board decided to maintain the target for the overnight interbank interest rate at 4.25%. Global economic activity has been recovering, although heterogeneously among countries and sectors. Global financial markets have performed favorably, driven by progress in the development of vaccines against COVID-19, expectations of additional fiscal stimulus in the United States, and lesser geopolitical uncertainty. In advanced economies, inflation remains below the targets of their central banks, which have reiterated their intention to maintain accommodative monetary policy stances for an extended period. The world economy and international financial markets are subject to several risks, mainly the evolution of the pandemic, vaccine production and distribution, the sufficiency of fiscal stimuli, and other tensions worldwide. Since the last monetary policy decision, the Mexican peso appreciated, while short-term interest rates exhibited moderate adjustments and long-term interest rates decreased. After having recovered during the third quarter, economic activity in Mexico continued to improve at the beginning of the fourth, although it remains below the levels prior to the pandemic, in an environment of uncertainty and downward risks. Ample slack conditions are expected throughout the time frame in which monetary policy operates. Annual headline inflation declined from 4.09 to 3.33% between October and November 2020 due to reductions in both its core and non-core components. Core inflation fell from 3.98 to 3.66%, mainly driven by the lower annual change in non-food merchandise prices (from 3.85% to 3.06%). The latter associated with the longer duration and greater intensity of discount sales during “El Buen Fin” period. Looking forward, the behavior of non-food merchandise prices might be influenced by the weakness of demand, which would lead to a more persistent decline in prices, as well as by supply-related effects and a recomposition of spending towards merchandise, which could result in upward adjustments once the sales period ends. Non-core inflation fell from 4.42% to 2.33%, mainly due to decreases in the annual rates of change of fruits and vegetable and gasoline prices. Headline inflation expectations for the end of 2020 were adjusted downwards and those for the medium and long terms remained stable at levels above the 3% target. The challenges for monetary policy posed by the pandemic include both the significant impact on economic activity as well as a financial shock and their effects on inflation. The recent behavior of headline and core inflation, and of the factors that affect them, imply trajectories within the forecast horizon similar to those foreseen in the last Quarterly Report, and those for the next 12-24 months are still expected to be around 3%. These forecasts are subject to short- and medium-term risks. To the downside: a greater-than-expected effect due to the negative output gap, greater social distancing measures or some persistence in the reduction in prices due to “El Buen Fin” sales period; lower inflationary pressures worldwide; and, additional foreign exchange appreciation. To the upside: core inflation pressures generated by the recomposition of spending towards merchandise; episodes of 1 foreign exchange depreciation; and, various cost-related pressures for firms. The balance of risks for the projected trajectory of inflation described above is uncertain. The risks for inflation, economic activity and financial markets pose major challenges for monetary policy and for the economy in general. Considering the mentioned forecasts for inflation, the uncertainty that surrounds them, as well as the convenience of consolidating a downward path for headline and core inflation towards the 3% target, with the presence of all its members. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board decided by majority to maintain the target for the overnight interbank interest rate at 4.25%. Two members voted for lowering the rate to 4.00%. This pause provides the necessary room to confirm that the trajectory of inflation converges to the target. Looking ahead, monetary policy implementation will depend on the evolution of the factors that have an incidence on headline and core inflation, on their foreseen trajectories within the forecast horizon, and on their expectations. The Governing Board will take the necessary actions on the basis of incoming information in order for the policy rate to be consistent with the orderly and sustained convergence of headline inflation to Banco de Mexico's target within the time frame in which monetary policy operates. In addition, it is imperative to safeguard the institutional framework, strengthen the macroeconomic fundamentals and adopt the necessary actions on both monetary and fiscal policy fronts, to enable a better adjustment of domestic financial markets and of the economy as a whole."

Mongolia,2020-12-18,"MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Keeping the policy rate unchanged and setting the refinancing amount No: 2020/07 Date: December 18, 2020 At the scheduled meeting held on December 18, 2020, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of Mongolia took into consideration the current state and outlook of the economy and financial markets, as well as the uncertainties and risks inherent in the domestic and external environments, and reached a decision to: 1. Keep the policy rate unchanged; 2. Issue up to MNT 250.0 billion under the long-term repo financing to support SMEs and non-mining exports in the first quarter of 2021. Annual headline inflation stands at 3.5 percent nationwide and 4.3 percent in Ulaanbaatar city as of November, 2020. Owing to a drop in prices of some administered goods and services coupled with weakened demand, inflation is projected to remain subdued and at the target level in medium-term. The domestic spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has impeded economic recovery. It is still expected that economic activity will pick up next year. After experiencing a sharp downturn due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the first half of this year, global economic recovery is under way since the second half of the year, but it is uneven across countries. Successful completions of clinical trials of vaccines for the virus have begun to emit continuously positive signals to the market. The step-by-step implementation of monetary and macroprudential policy measures and the adoption of new financing instruments by the central bank directed at mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic contribute to decelerating the pace of domestic economic downturns, facilitating recovery, and ensuring the stability of the banking sector. Extracts of the meeting minutes will be released in two weeks on the Bank of Mongolia website. MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE."
Russia,2020-12-18,"On 18 December 2020, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to keep the key rate at 4.25% per annum. Inflation is developing above the Bank of Russia's forecast and is expected to lie within the range of 4.6-4.9% at the end of 2020. One-off proinflationary factors are exerting more significant and prolonged upward influence on prices amid the growth in households' and businesses' inflation expectations and supply-side restrictions. The worsening epidemic situation in Russia and worldwide is constraining economic activity significantly less than in 2020 Q2. The situation in external financial and commodity markets has improved, supported by expectations of faster global economic recovery on the back of vaccine development progress. Disinflationary risks do not prevail in 2021 as much as before, considering the strengthening of short-term proinflationary factors and risks of their influence being more prolonged. According to the Bank of Russia's forecast, given the current monetary policy stance, annual inflation will reach 3.5-4.0% in 2021 and will stabilise close to 4% later on. Given the high heterogeneity of current economic and price movement trends, the Bank of Russia will assess the subsequent developments and the existence of a potential for additional key rate reduction. In its key rate decision-making, the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic developments over the forecast horizon, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. Inflation dynamics. Inflation is developing above the Bank of Russia's forecast and is expected to lie within the range of 4.6-4.9% at the end of 2020. This is largely related to the effect of one-off proinflationary factors in certain markets and the continuing pass-through of the ruble's earlier weakening to prices. However, these factors may exert more prolonged upward influence on prices amid the growth in households' and businesses' inflation expectations and supply-side restrictions. In November, annual inflation rose to 4.4% (vs 4.0% in October). According to an estimate as of 14 December, it was 4.7%. According to Bank of Russia estimates, current consumer inflation indicators reflecting the most sustainable price movements also grew in November and were close to 4% (annualised). Inflation expectations of households continued to grow, driven mainly by the growth of prices for certain everyday goods and exchange rate volatility. Businesses' price expectations increased over the previous months and remain elevated, driven by higher costs. Analysts' medium-term inflation expectations are anchored close to 4%. Although domestic demand is still exerting constraining influence on price movements, it is offset by proinflationary factors over the short-term horizon. They include, among other things, supply-side factors (in particular, the emerging labour force shortage in certain spheres and additional costs of businesses to comply with anti-epidemic requirements) and secondary effects related to the growth of inflation expectations. In these conditions, the influence of one-off proinflationary factors on price movements may be more prolonged. As this influence subsides, consumer price growth will slow down. According to the Bank of Russia's forecast, given the current monetary policy stance, annual inflation will reach 3.5-4.0% in 2021 and will stabilise close to 4% later on. Monetary conditions have not seen any significant changes since the previous meeting of the Bank of Russia Board of Directors. Loan and deposit rates mainly stabilised; lending expansion continued. OFZ yields changed unevenly over different maturities. Medium-term OFZ yields declined slightly amid the improved situation in financial and commodity markets, including due to the expectations of a faster recovery in the global economy on the back of vaccine development progress. Apart from accommodative monetary conditions, lending dynamics are influenced by the preferential programmes implemented by the Government as well as by regulatory relaxations. When making its key rate decisions, the Bank of Russia will assess the impact of cancelling these anti-crisis measures on monetary conditions. Economic activity. High-frequency indicators of economic activity point to a pause in the economic recovery in 2020 Q4. However, the worsening epidemic situation in Russia and worldwide is constraining economic activity significantly less than in 2020 Q2. This is related to the targeted nature of restrictive measures and the adaptation of households and businesses to the new conditions. In view of the above and given higher than expected Q3 data, the 2020 GDP decline may reach around 4%. In spring 2021, the Russian economy is expected to resume its sustainable growth as the coronavirus situation returns to normal. The medium-term economic growth path will be largely influenced by further coronavirus pandemic developments in Russia and across the globe, the nature of the recovery of private demand in the context of potential change in consumer and business behaviour, as well as by the upcoming budget consolidation. Accommodative monetary policy will continue to support the economy throughout the next year. Inflation risks. Disinflationary risks do not prevail in 2021 as much as before, considering the strengthening of short-term proinflationary factors and risks of their influence being more prolonged amid the rise in inflation expectations and related secondary effects. Short-term proinflationary risks are also connected with stronger volatility in global markets, driven by various geopolitical developments, among other factors, which may have an effect on exchange rate and inflation expectations. Upward pressure on prices may be caused by temporary disruptions in production and supply chains in the post-restriction period, as well as by additional corporate costs of protecting staff and consumers from the spread of the pandemic. Proinflationary risks are generated by domestic prices for certain food products, affected by supply-side factors and the environment in the related global markets. Disinflationary risks under the baseline scenario are chiefly connected with further developments in the coronavirus pandemic situation in Russia and globally, the scale of possible measures to fight it and their impact on economic activity, as well as the speed at which both the economy and household income will recover. Persistent changes in consumer preferences and behaviour including a persistent higher propensity to save might exert a constraining influence on inflation. Uncertainty remains as to rather long-term structural effects of the coronavirus pandemic for the Russian and global economies, specifically, the scale of a decrease in the potential of the national economy. Potential global growth may also come under marked pressure from geopolitical factors including rising trade conflicts. The extent of the Russian economy's deviation from its potential is, in turn, the core driver of medium-term inflation movements. Medium-term inflation is significantly impacted by fiscal policy. In its baseline scenario, the Bank of Russia proceeds from the fiscal policy path reflected in the Guidelines for Fiscal. Tax and Customs and Tariff Policy for 2021 and the 2022-2023 Planning Period, as well as from the announced time frames for the completion of anti-crisis measures of the Government and the Bank of Russia. Given the high heterogeneity of current economic and price movement trends, the Bank of Russia will assess the subsequent developments and the existence of a potential for additional key rate reduction. In its key rate decision-making, the Bank of Russia will take into account actual and expected inflation dynamics relative to the target and economic developments over the forecast horizon, as well as risks posed by domestic and external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next key rate review meeting on 12 February 2021. The press release on the Bank of Russia Board decision and the medium-term forecast are to be published at 13:30 Moscow time.

Thailand,2020-12-23,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 8/2020 Mr. Titanun Mallikamas. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 23 December 2020 as follows. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 050 percent to support the economic recovery which remained highly uncertain. One MPC member was unable to attend the meeting. The Committee assessed that the Thai economy continued to recover but downside risks and uncertainties remained high in the period ahead. The economy would thus need support from the continued low policy rate. The Committee voted to maintain the policy rate at this meeting to preserve the limited policy space in order to act at the appropriate and most effective timing. The Committee projected that the Thai economy would contract 66 percent in 2020, which was better than previously assessed due to improvement in private consumption and merchandise exports. The economy would expand at 32 percent and 48 percent in 2021 and 2022, respectively. Nonetheless the economic recovery remained highly uncertain which would in the short term depend on the situation of the new wave of COVID-19 outbreak and corresponding containment measures. At a longer horizon, it would depend on the recovery in foreign tourist figures, efficacy and coverage of COVID-19 vaccination, and labor market situation in which numbers of unemployed and underemployed workers remained high. Furthermore uneven recoveries across economic sectors would affect the sustainability of the economic growth going forward. Financial system remained sound while vulnerabilities among households and SMEs remained. Headline inflation was projected to return to the target in the middle of 2021 and would stay close to the lower bound of the target range throughout the forecast period. Medium-term inflation expectations remained anchored within the target. Despite ample liquidity in the financial system and low financing costs, some businesses, especially SMEs, and households in need of liquidity have not gained access to credits. The movement of the baht against the US dollar was volatile in line with regional currencies. The Committee expressed concerns over potential rapid appreciation of the baht owing to risk-on sentiment in financial markets and the weakening outlook of the US dollar. The Committee would closely monitor developments in foreign exchange markets, consider the necessity of implementing additional appropriate measures, as well as continue to expedite new foreign exchange ecosystem. The Committee viewed that the continuity of government measures and policy coordination among government agencies would be critical to support the economic recovery going forward. Monetary policy must remain accommodative. Financial and credit measures should expedite liquidity distribution to the affected groups in a targeted and timely manner, for instance, through credit guarantee schemes in order to curb credit risks, while financial institutions should accelerate debt restructuring to have a broader impact. Fiscal measures must continue to sustain the economy. In particular, the government should expedite budget disbursement under the restoration plan and simultaneously implement supply- side policies to support business restructuring and upskilling of labor, which would help support sustainable economic recovery in the long term. Under the monetary policy framework with objectives of maintaining price stability, supporting sustainable and full-potential economic growth, and preserving financial stability, the Committee continued to put emphasis on supporting the economic recovery. The Committee would monitor the adequacy of the government measures and various risks, especially the new wave of the domestic outbreak in deliberating monetary policy going forward. The Committee would stand ready to use additional appropriate monetary policy tools if necessary."
Egypt,2020-12-24,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release December 24th, 2020 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 825 percent, 925 percent, and 875 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 875 percen. Annual headline urban inflation accelerated for the third consecutive month to 57 percent in November 2020 from 45 percent in October 202. Higher annual headline inflation has been mainly driven by higher annual contribution of selected food items since September 202. In November 2020, it reflected a transitory supply shock in tomatoe. In the meantime, annual core inflation increased only slightly to 40 percent in November 2020 from 39 percent in October 202. Average annual headline inflation is estimated to be in the low single digits range in 2020 Q4, with increasing likelihood of coming under the inflation target floor of 6 percen. The magnitude of a possible deviation from the target would mainly depend on the degree of the reversal of the supply shock of tomatoes, among other factor. Real GDP growth recorded a preliminary figure of 07 percent during 2020 Q3, up from -17% during 2020 Q2. Moreover, growth registered a preliminary figure of 36 percent in FY 2019/20 compared to 56 percent a year earlie. Economic activity was affected by the impact of COVID-19 and its resulting containment measure. Meanwhile most demand side leading indicators for October and November 2020 show continued signs of recovery after displaying weakness during 2020 Q2. Furthermore, the unemployment rate recorded 73 percent in 2020 Q3, the lowest rate on record, and down from 96 percent in 2020 Q. Globally economic activity remains subdued despite the accommodative financial conditions, as the outbreak of the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic and its related lockdown measures weigh on the near-term outloo. On the other hand, the continued development and roll-out of vaccines could ease the level of uncertainty regarding economic activity over the medium ter. Meanwhile international oil prices started to slightly pick up recentl. As the CBE continues to support macroeconomic stability, the CBE's next inflation target has been set at 7 percent (±2 percentage points) on average during 2022 Q4 down from 9 percent (±3 percentage points) on average during 2020 Q4. Monetary policy tools are utilized to anchor inflation expectations, contain demand-side pressures and second-round effects of supply shock. Exogenous factors that are outside the scope of monetary policy may lead to transitory deviations from previously announced target rate. Egypt's GDP growth is expected to recover albeit gradually, with structural measures expected to support economic activit. On the other hand, annual headline inflation rates are expected to be affected by unfavorable base effects related to the normalization of monthly inflation rates in 2021, but will continue hovering around the inflation target's mid-point of 7 percent in 202. In account of the above, the MPC decided that keeping key policy rates unchanged at this juncture remains consistent with achieving the inflation target of 7 percent (±2 percentage points) in 2022 Q4 and price stability over the medium ter. The MPC reiterates that the path of current policy rates remains a function of medium-term inflation expectations rather than current inflation outturn. The MPC closely monitors all economic developments and will not hesitate to utilize available tools to support the recovery of economic activity, within its price stability mandat.

Turkiye,2020-12-24,"The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to increase the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) from 15 percent to 17 percent. Global economic activity data indicate that partial recovery since the third quarter continues. However, despite the positive developments regarding the vaccine, uncertainties surrounding the global economic activity prevail due to the recent increase in Covid-19 cases. National income data and indicators for the last quarter point to a strong course in economic activity. However, restrictions introduced due to the increasing number of cases create uncertainties on the short-run outlook of economic activity, particularly the services sector. Besides, strengthening domestic demand, due to the cumulative effects of high credit growth during the pandemic, increases the current account deficit. Domestic demand conditions, cumulative cost effects, in particular the exchange rate effects, increasing international food and other commodity prices and deterioration in inflation expectations continue to affect the pricing behavior and inflation outlook adversely. Accordingly, the MPC, taking into account the end-2021 forecast target, has decided to implement a strong monetary tightening, in order to eliminate risks to the inflation outlook, contain inflation expectations and restore the disinflation process as soon as possible. In the forthcoming period, tightness of monetary policy stance will be decisively sustained until strong indicators point to a permanent fall in inflation in line with the targets and to price stability. The permanent establishment of a low inflation environment will affect macroeconomic and financial stability positively through the fall in country risk premium, the beginning of reverse currency substitution, accumulation of foreign exchange reserves and the perpetual decline in financing costs. In its decision-making process, the CBRT adopts a framework with a medium term perspective, based on analyzing all factors affecting inflation and the interaction between these factors. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
