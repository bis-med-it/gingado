Romania,2018-01-08,"In its meeting of 8 January 2018, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided:. The annual inflation rate continued to rise in the first two months of 2017 Q4, up to 2.63 percent in October from 1.77 percent in September and to 3.23 percent in November, standing below the upper bound of the variation band of the target, but higher than the forecast. The advance in the prices of consumer goods and services was almost across the board, with nearly all CPI components contributing to the step-up in inflation. Behind this evolution stood primarily supply-side factors, the main influence coming from administered prices, as a result of the increase in electricity price, as well as from fuel prices, in the context of the hike in the excise duty on motor fuels and of the higher international oil prices. The adjusted CORE2 component also made a considerable contribution, given that its annual rate saw a rapid pick-up from 1.82 percent in September to 1.95 percent in October and to 2.3 percent in November. Apart from the external influences on the processed food segment, the faster growth in core inflation reflected inflationary pressures stemming from the cyclical position of the economy and from the dynamics of unit wage costs, as well as the effects of the behaviour of the leu exchange rate. The average annual CPI inflation rate consolidated in positive territory at 1.0 percent in November 2017 (0.7 percent in October) from 0.4 percent in September; calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, the annual average increased to 0.9 percent in November 2017 (0.6 percent in October) from 0.5 percent in September. In 2017 Q3, economic growth continued to accelerate significantly, exceeding expectations. The annual dynamics of real GDP reached 8.8 percent (from 6.1 percent in the previous quarter). The driver of this evolution was household consumption (8.2 percentage points) whose annual dynamics rose markedly to 12.3 percent from 7.3 percent in the previous quarter. A significant positive contribution was made  for the first time in six quarters  by gross fixed capital formation (2.3 percentage points) whose annual pace of increase came in at 8.8 percent. The negative contribution of net exports to GDP doubled (to -1.2 percentage points) amid a stronger deceleration in the annual growth rate of exports of goods and services than in that of imports; the change in inventories also made a negative contribution (-0.7 percentage points). Looking at the supply side. GDP growth had an almost across-the-board support. The tertiary sector made further the largest contribution, followed by agriculture, which posted the highest rate of increase in four years. Statistical data for October 2017 point to a strengthening of the uptrend seen in industrial output throughout the year and to further high growth rates of the activity in trade and services, amid the persistence of stimulative conditions on the labour market and from the income policy. The trade balance continued to post unfavourable developments, ending the first ten months of the year on a deficit of EUR 9.4 billion, higher than that for the entire 2016. In 2017 Q4, real monetary conditions were slightly less accommodative, given the significant increase in the relevant interbank money market rates. The annual growth rate of credit to the private sector slowed only marginally in the first two months of Q4 (6.8 percent in November) and was primarily underpinned by the leu-denominated component and by developments in loans to households. The share of leu-denominated credit in total private sector loans widened to 61.8 percent, certifying and ensuring an improvement in monetary policy transmission. The latest assessments indicate the outlook for the annual inflation rate to pick up further in the months ahead, mainly due to supply-side factors, as well as to rising pressures from fundamentals, overlapping in the early months of 2018 the inflationary base effects associated with the indirect tax cuts and removals and with the decline in administered prices. The uncertainties and risks surrounding the inflation outlook stem mainly from the fiscal and income policy stance, the volatility of international oil prices, and from the pace of euro area and global economic growth, also amid a slow normalisation of the monetary policy pursued by the major central banks. In light of these assessments, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided to increase the monetary policy rate to 2.00 percent per annum from 1.75 percent per annum; moreover, the NBR Board decided to raise the deposit facility rate to 1.00 percent per annum and the lending (Lombard) facility rate to 3.00 percent per annum. In addition, the NBR Board decided to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board decisions aim to ensure and preserve price stability over the medium term in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth. The NBR Board underlines that the balanced macroeconomic policy mix and progress in structural reforms are of the essence in preserving a stable macroeconomic framework and strengthening the capacity of the Romanian economy to withstand potential adverse developments. The NBR is closely monitoring domestic and external developments and stands ready to use all its available tools. According to the NBR Board decision, the account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR website on 15 January 2018, at 3:00 p.m. In line with the announced calendar, the next monetary policy meeting of the NBR Board is scheduled for 7 February 2018, when a new quarterly Inflation Report is to be examined."
Israel,2018-01-10,"Since the previous interest rate decision, there has been no notable change in the inflation environment, which remains below the target range. Inflation is expected to continue being affected by price reductions initiated by the government, increased competition in the economy, and by the cumulative appreciation of the shekel to date. Wage increases in the economy, increases in energy prices, and the continued rise in rent prices, will support the return of inflation to the target range. Indicators of economic activity in the fourth quarter provide a basis for the assessment that the economy continued to grow in the fourth quarter at a pace that is in line with its potential growth rate. Labor market data continue to portray a high level of activity, and indicate a tight labor market. According to the Research Department's staff forecast, the economy is expected to grow by about 3.5 percent per year in each of the next two years. Data on the globaleconomy continue to indicate improvement, and growth forecasts have again been revised upward. However, inflation in most of the major economies continues to range below target. The US Federal Reserve is expected to continue raising the federal funds rate gradually during 2018. The ECB is maintaining its negative interest rate policy, but has begun reducing the volume of quantitative easing. The shekel strengthened in recent weeks, mainly against the dollar, in line with the global trend. In the past 12 months, the shekel has strengthened by about 5 percent in terms of the effective exchange rate. Housing market data continue to indicate some slowdown in activity, with a decline in the volume of transactions and a continued increase in home prices at a relatively moderate rate. The Monetary Committee intends to maintain the accommodative policy as long as necessaryin order to entrench the inflation environment within the target range. The Bank of Israel continues to monitor developments in inflation, the real economy,the financial markets, and the global economy, and will act to attain the monetary policy targets in accordance with such developments. For the file of data accompanyingthis notice, click here. Graphs and data (Hebrew). Inflation measured over the preceding 12 months reached 0.3 percent in November (Figure 1 in the attached data file). Short-term inflation expectations remained low (Figure 4). Inflation is expected to continue being affected by price reductions initiated by the government, increased competition in the economy, and by the cumulative appreciation of the shekel to date (Figure 6). According to the Research Department's staff forecast, inflation in the next four quarters isexpected to be 1.1 percent, supported by wage increases in the economy, increases in energy prices, and the continued rise in rent prices. However, the annual inflation rate is expected to decline in the beginning of the year, in line with the seasonal path, and to resume its increase only thereafter. Long-term inflation expectations are anchored within the target range (Figure 5). Nominal yields on long-term government bonds declined since the previous interest rate decision, against the background of a decline in the government's need to raise debt, and even though the yields on corresponding bonds abroad increased (Figure 7). Real yields in Israel are similar to those in the US and higher than those in Europe. The yield spread between corporate and government bonds remains very low, similar to the global trend. This is indicated by initial data from the Companies Survey (Figure 10), the Composite State of the Economy Index, and the continued growth of services exports in October. Goods exports remain at a virtual standstill against the background of the level of the exchange rate and impacted by the volatility in pharmaceutical exports. Labor market data continue to portray a high level of activity, and indicate a tight labor market: a record low unemployment rate, and a record high employmentrate (Figure 13), wage increases (Figure 14), a high level of job vacancies relative to the number of unemployed people (Figure 16), and a decline in the rate of people who are employed in part time positions involuntarily (Figure 17). According to the Research Department's staff forecast, theeconomy is expected to grow by 3.4 percent in 2018 and by 3.5 percent in 2019 (Figure 11). The forecast is positively affected by the expected increase in vehicle imports in 2018 and by one-off investments expected in 2019. Housing market data continue to indicate some slowing of activity, with home prices continuing to increase at a relatively moderate rate (Figure 8). The volume of transactions continues to decline, apparently due to uncertainty regarding the effect that government programs in the housing area will have. Recent data indicate some increase in the pace of taking out new mortgages, which stabilized recently following a continued decline. There was a renewed decline in the interest rate on mortgages. (Figure 9). There was a decline in building starts, although some upward revision is expected in the data. There is apparently an increase in building completions, and in the number of permits issued. Data on the global economy continue to indicate improvement. Growth forecasts have again been revised upward (Figure 18), and the improvement in world trade continues (Figure 19). However, despite the increase in oil prices (Figure 22), inflation in most of the major economies continues to range below the target of 2 percent (Figure 21). The Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate in December as expected, and is expected to continue increasing it gradually in 2018. The ECB maintained its negative interest rate policy, but began reducing the monthly volume of asset purchases as part of its quantitative easing program, as announced. In the US, the economic improvement encompasses most sectors of the economy, and the recently passed tax reform is expected to support economic activity in the short term, while increasing the deficit and government debt in the coming years. The economic data published in Europe indicate continued improvement in activity, but there has been some increase in political risk due to developments in Spain and Italy. In Japan, assessments are that the economy is continuing to growat a pace that exceeds potential, but this is having no noticeable impact on inflation, and policy remains accommodative. In China, the economic data indicate some moderation in economic activity in the fourth quarter. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on January 24. The next decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Monday. February 26, 2018."
Poland,2018-01-10,"Warsaw, 10 January 2018 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 9-10 January 2018 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: â–ª reference rate at 1.50%; â–ª lombard rate at 2.50%; â–ª deposit rate at 0.50%; â–ª rediscount rate at 1.75%. The global economic conditions continue to improve. Data in the euro area signal further economic recovery, driven by an improvement in the labour market conditions, very good sentiment of economic agents, and a stronger world trade growth. Also in the United States economic conditions remain favourable. In China, in turn, incoming data indicate a slight slowdown in GDP growth. Despite ongoing global recovery, inflation abroad remains moderate, on the back of persistently low domestic inflationary pressure in many countries. At the same time, prices of certain commodities, including oil, have risen in recent months. The European Central Bank keeps interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero, while still purchasing financial assets. The US Federal Reserve increased interest rates in December and continues to shrink its balance sheet. In Poland, incoming data point to continued good economic conditions. Growth continues to be driven primarily by consumer demand, supported by rising employment and wages, disbursement of benefits and very good consumer sentiment. This is accompanied by a recovery in investment, mainly in the public sector. Growth in economic activity is also supported by strong external demand, reflected in significant exports growth. Annual consumer price growth declined and stands at a moderate level. At the same time  although wage growth is faster than in the previous quarters  core inflation net of food and energy prices remains low. In the Council's assessment, favourable economic conditions in the Polish economy will continue in the next quarters. Yet. GDP growth will probably be lower than in the second half of 2017. Taking into account the current information, the Council judges that inflation will remain close to the inflation target over the projection horizon. As a result, the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on the sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability."
Peru,2018-01-11,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JANUARY 2018 BCRP LOWERED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE T0 3.0% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to lower the monetary policy interest rate from 3.25 to 3.0 percent. This decision takes into account the following factors: Inflation in December continued decreasing and showed a rate in the lower band of the inflation target range for the second consecutive year due mainly to the reversal of the supply shocks as well as due to a level of economic activity lower than the potential growth rate. Inflation is projected to continue declining in the first months of 2018 and to converge thereafter to 2.0 percent. Moreover, trend inflation measurements continue decreasing and are expected to remain close to the middle of the target range during this year; Expectations of inflation in 12 months continued declining and fell from 2.48 percent in November to 2.30 percent in December 2017; In the fourth quarter of 2017, public expenditure, particularly investment expenditure, grew less than forecast, as a result of which the gap between economic activity and its potential level of growth increased, and The world economy continues to show positive indicators, with positive signals in the prices of commodities and in capital flows to the emerging economies. The Board pays close attention to new data on inflation and inflation determinants to consider the convenience of making additional adjustments in the Central Bank's monetary policy stance should it be necessary. Recent indicators of inflation and activity reflect the following: Inflation in December recorded a rate of 0.16 percent, as a result of which the year-to- year inflation rate fell from 1.54 percent in November to 1.36 percent in December. Inflation without food and energy showed a rate of 0.29 percent, as a result of which the year-to-year rate fell from 2.23 percent in November to 2.15 percent in December, also within the target range. The indicators of business expectations showed more moderate levels in December, but remain on the optimistic side. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to lower the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 1.75 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 3.55 percent for the first 15 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 15 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 3.55 percent. The Monetary Program for the month of February will be approved on the Board Meeting of February 8, 2018."
Kazakhstan,2018-01-15,"Press-release –1 The base rate reduced to 9.75% January 15, 2018 Almaty The National Bank of Kazakhstan has decided to reduce the base rate to the level of 9.75% with a corridor of +/-1%. The decision on the reduction was based on the lower level of the actual inflation rate by the end of 2017 in contrast to the forecasted trajectory, the estimates of the further deceleration of the inflationary processes, the continuing weak recovery of the domestic demand, and also the favorable trends in the external markets. The trend of the further easing of the monetary policy conditions will depend on the situation in the world markets and in the countries - main trade partners, stabilization of the positive trends in the domestic economy, which will determine the accordance of the forecasted inflation with that of the actual. The annual inflation in December 2017 has amounted to 7.1%, which is significantly lower than the expected level of 7.5-7.7%. The deceleration of the inflation rate was caused by the stabilization of the price dynamics in the markets of some goods and services, specifically in the non- food product markets. In December 2017 the petrol price has decreased after the growth in the autumn months. In relation to the low consumer demand, the slower growth of the durable goods prices is being observed. The price growth of the food products and services reflects the historical dynamics and in general matches the forecasts. The low volatility of the tenge exchange rate has also made a positive contribution to the deceleration of the annual inflation. It is expected that in the medium-term (until the end of the current year and in the next year) disinflationary tendencies will persist. However in the short-run period (in the first quarter of 2018) the tariffs for paid services of the monopoly enterprises will become an existing risk for the annual inflation rate to sustain on the same level or even to increase to some extent. Though, their influence on the inflation is estimated as limited and does not require the corrective measures to tighten the monetary policy conditions since the risks of inflation may be released on the supply side, which does not depend on the NBK's policy. The households' perception of the prices is getting better. In 2017 according to the surveys of the households, the share of responders, which believed that the prices have been increasing more rapid than earlier in the last 12 months, has decreased from 59.8% in December 2016 to 52.1% in December 2017. The quantitative assessment of the inflationary expectations of the households for a year ahead has decreased from 7.6% in December 2016 to 7.1% in December 2017. Regarding the demand, the growth deceleration of the costs on the final consumption is being observed. It is stipulated by the decrease of the households' income in the real terms, which also limits the consumer price growth. The external conditions are favorable. Since the end of October the oil prices get steadily formed on the level above 60 US dollars per barrel. Continuation of the OPEC+ agreement about the oil production cuts while keeping the current quota in November 2017 reduces the risks of the significant oil price drop. Also, the world food prices index in December has declined in comparison to the previous month by 3.3%, and the expectations of the world output growth in some agriculture markets in 2018 ensures maintaining the current level of prices. The improvement of the economic situation and the moderate rate of inflation in the countries  main trade partners, which all together with the other factors will make a disinflationary impact on the consumer prices in Kazakhstan. In spite of the base rate reduction, the monetary policy conditions remain neutral in a context of the expected deceleration of the inflation rate. The current level of the base rate in the real terms ensures maintaining the target level of the inflation in 2018 (5-7%) and corresponds to the long-term potential level of the economic growth. The next decision on the base rate will be announced on March 5, 2018 at 17:00 Astana time. For more detailed information please contact: +7 (727) 2704 585 e-mail: press@nationalbank.kz."
South Korea,2018-01-18,"Base Rate unchanged at 1., 50% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Board considers that the pace of global economic growth has accelerated. The global financial markets have shown generally stable movements, with the trend of rising stock prices continuing for example, although government bond rates have risen in line mainly with expectations of monetary policy normalizations in major countries. Looking ahead the Board sees global economic growth as likely to be affected by factors such as the paces of monetary policy normalization in major countries, the directions of the US government's economic policies, and the movements toward spreading trade protectionism. The Board judges that the solid trend of domestic economic growth has continued, as exports have sustained their buoyancy and consumption has improved moderately, although investment has slowed somewhat. The trend of improvement in employment conditions has slowed, with the increase in the number of persons employed in the service sector having declined for example. The Board sees the domestic economy as likely to show a pace of GDP growth at the 3% level this year as well. It expects that investment will slow, but that the trend of steady increase in consumption will continue due in large part to improvements in household income conditions, and that exports will also sustain their favorable movements thanks to the buoyancy of the global economy. Consumer price inflation has slowed to the mid-1% level, in consequence mainly of declines in the extents of increase in the prices of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products and of a reduction in gas fees. Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has stayed in the mid-1% range, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has remained at the mid-2% level. Looking ahead it is forecast that consumer price inflation, after being in the low- to mid-1% range for some time, will pick up and gradually approach the target level from the second half of this year, and for the year as a whole be in the upper-1% range. Core inflation will also gradually rise. Although long-term market interest rates have shown a trend of rising, affected by increases in interest rates in major countries, the domestic financial markets have displayed generally stable movements, with stock prices having risen for example, on expectations of improvements in corporate performances. The Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has continued its downtrend, in line chiefly with the weakening of the US dollar. The amount of increase in household lending has lessened. Housing sales prices have shown low rates of increase overall, but have risen faster in some parts of Seoul and its surrounding areas. Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As it is forecast that inflationary pressures on the demand side will not be high for the time being, while the domestic economy is expected to continue its solid growth, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance. In this process it will judge carefully whether it is necessary to adjust its accommodative monetary policy stance further, while closely checking future economic growth and inflation trends. It will also carefully monitor any changes in the monetary policies of major countries, conditions related to trade with major countries, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks."
Turkiye,2018-01-18,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels:. a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate at 9.25 percent and borrowing rate at 7.25 percent, b) One-week repo rate at 8 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, and lending rate at 12.75 percent. Recently released data indicate that economic activity maintains its strength. Domestic demand continues to expand and external demand contributes positively to exports. Current elevated levels of inflation and inflation expectations continue to pose risks on the pricing behavior. Accordingly, the Committee decided to maintain the tight monetary policy stance. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. Tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained decisively until inflation outlook displays a significant improvement, independent of base effects and temporary factors, and becomes consistent with the targets. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
South Africa,2018-01-18,"South African Reserve Bank PRESS STATEMENT EMBARGO DELIVERY 18 January 2018 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank In recent weeks, some of the risks to the inflation outlook have dissipated somewhat. The rand appreciated following the African National Congress (ANC) elective conference. Also. Eskom was granted a lower-than-expected tariff increase. While S&P Global Ratings downgraded South Africa's long-term local currency sovereign credit rating to sub-investment grade. Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) placed the country ratings on review for a downgrade. A further downgrade therefore remains a risk, and will depend on government's response to the deteriorating fiscal position and commitment to credible growth-enhancing policies. Against this more positive backdrop, the inflation forecast has improved despite continued increases in international oil prices. Near-term inflation is expected to remain close to the midpoint of the target range. At the same time, domestic growth outcomes have surprised on the upside, in large part due to the recovery in the MPC statement 18 January 2018 Page 1. At the same time, domestic growth outcomes have surprised on the upside, in large part due to the recovery in the MPC statement 18 January 2018 Page 1 agricultural sector. While there have been moderate upward revisions to the growth forecast, the outlook remains challenging. The year-on-year inflation rate, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas, measured 4.6% in November, down from 4.8% previously. Lower food and fuel price inflation contributed to this decline. Goods price inflation moderated to 3.7% from 4.1% previously, while services price inflation was unchanged at 5.5%. The South African Reserve Bank's (SARB) measure of core inflation  which excludes food, fuel, and electricity  amounted to 4.4% in October compared with 4.5% previously. Year-on-year producer price inflation for final manufactured goods measured 5.1% in November, up from 5.0% in October. Food products price inflation moderated further to 0.9% due to strong base effects from lower agricultural prices. Meat price inflation, however, remains elevated, as the adverse effects of the recent drought continue to be felt. The inflation forecast generated by the SARB's Quarterly Projection Model (QPM) shows some improvement since November. The average forecast for 2017 is unchanged at 5.3% but has been revised downwards for 2018 and 2019 to 4.9% and 5.4% respectively from 5.2% and 5.5% previously. Inflation is expected to average 5.5% in the final quarter of 2019. The lower turning point of the forecast is still expected in the first quarter of 2018 but has been revised down from 4.7% to 4.4%. The main drivers of the more favourable forecast were the stronger exchange rate and lower electricity price assumption, following the 5.23% electricity tariff increase granted to Eskom by the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa). This adjustment takes effect from July, when a 6.0% increase is assumed in the CPI MPC statement 18 January 2018 Page 2. This adjustment takes effect from July, when a 6.0% increase is assumed in the CPI MPC statement 18 January 2018 Page 2 compared with 8.0% previously. The assumption from mid-2019 remains unchanged at 8.0%. These effects are countered to some extent by upward adjustments to the international oil price assumptions, as well as by the impact of the sugar tax on food prices. This tax is expected to increase food price inflation and headline inflation by 0.6 and 0.1 percentage points respectively in the year following its expected implementation in April. Food price inflation is now expected to average 5.2% and 6.0% in 2018 and 2019 respectively, up from 4.5% and 5.9% previously. The core inflation forecast remains unchanged at 4.8% for 2017 but has been adjusted down to 4.6% and 5.1% in 2018 and 2019 from 5.1% and 5.3% respectively. Whereas previously a lower turning point of 4.6% was expected in the final two quarters of 2017, a low of 4.4% is now expected in the first quarter of 2018. The improved forecast for core inflation is driven mainly by the stronger exchange rate, which is expected to impact favourably on core goods inflation. Higher wage pressures, by contrast, are expected to keep core services inflation more or less unchanged. The closing output gap also reduces the degree of downside pressure on inflation. Average inflation expectations for 2018, as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research (BER) in the fourth quarter of 2017, declined marginally from 5.8% to 5.7% but remain close to the upper end of the target range. Average expectations for 2019 were unchanged at 5.9%, as were the average five- year inflation expectations at 5.6%. These moderate moves mask larger adjustments compared with the third-quarter survey, with business people revising their MPC statement 18 January 2018 Page 3. These moderate moves mask larger adjustments compared with the third-quarter survey, with business people revising their MPC statement 18 January 2018 Page 3 expectations higher over the two years, offsetting the downward adjustment by trade union officials. The expectations of market analysts, which are reflected in the Reuters econometer survey conducted in January, also show a slight improvement since November. The median forecasts for 2018 and 2019 have declined by 0.1 percentage points to 5.1% and 5.4% respectively while the forecast for 2020 is 5.5%. Inflation expectations implicit in the inflation-linked bond yields have declined, with the five- year break-even inflation rates declining to 5.4%. The global growth outlook remains positive and relatively synchronised, although uneven across regions. However, some moderation in growth is generally expected in 2019. Growth in the United States (US) is expected to be given a boost by the proposed tax reforms, but the extent of this is still unclear. The euro area recovery also appears to be sustained, with a persistent decline in the unemployment rate amid a broad-based firming of fixed capital formation. The recent positive momentum in Japanese growth is also expected to continue. These favourable conditions are expected to have a positive spillover effect on emerging markets in general, with upward growth revisions in most regions, although less so for Latin America and Africa. Commodity exporters are also expected to benefit from the recovery in commodity prices. Consensus forecasts suggest that growth in China will be sustained at current levels despite continued financial stability risks. Global inflation trends, by contrast, remain subdued, although there are indications of emerging upside pressures, driven in part by higher energy prices. Core inflation pressures are also becoming evident in the US in particular, and are expected to MPC statement 18 January 2018 Page 4. Core inflation pressures are also becoming evident in the US in particular, and are expected to MPC statement 18 January 2018 Page 4 intensify gradually should strong growth and labour market tightness persist. Monetary policies in the advanced economies, particularly in the US and the United Kingdom (UK), are expected to maintain a moderate tightening bias, while the pace of withdrawal of monetary accommodation in the euro area and Japan is expected to be slow. These trends should help sustain capital flows to emerging markets. The rand exchange rate responded strongly to the outcome of the ANC elective conference, and since then has traded in a range of between R12.25 and R12.50 against the US dollar. This is in sharp contrast to the low of R14.47 a month earlier. Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), the rand has appreciated by 13.1% against the US dollar, by 9.6% against the euro, and by 10.6% on a trade-weighted basis. In the near term, the rand is expected to remain sensitive to sentiment generated by political developments. The favourable outlook for capital flows to emerging markets as well as the positive trade account balances are expected to be supportive of the rand. The latter is a reflection of the favourable terms of trade and import compression from lower growth. However, the lingering prospect of a credit ratings downgrade to sub-investment grade by Moody's continues to weigh on the longer- term outlook for the rand. Such an event would trigger the exclusion of South African government bonds from the World Government Bond Index, and is likely to precipitate significant capital outflows. The extent of the impact on the exchange rate remains uncertain. Domestic growth prospects appear to be showing some signs of improvement, although off a low base. This follows encouraging growth rates in the second and third quarters of this year, driven to a significant degree by the exceptionally strong MPC statement 18 January 2018 Page 5. This follows encouraging growth rates in the second and third quarters of this year, driven to a significant degree by the exceptionally strong MPC statement 18 January 2018 Page 5 recovery in the agricultural sector. The SARB has revised its forecast for gross domestic product (GDP) growth up from 0.7% to 0.9% for 2017, while forecasts for 2018 and 2019 have been adjusted to 1.4% and 1.6% respectively, up from 1.2% and 1.5% previously. This more favourable outlook is consistent with the further increase in the SARB's composite leading business cycle indicator of economic activity in October. The outlook is also likely to be impacted positively should the recent political developments lead to a sustained boost in business and consumer confidence. High-frequency data suggest that fourth-quarter growth is likely to be slower than in the previous quarter, but still positive. On a month-to-month basis, mining output increased in October but declined in November, while manufacturing output increased in both these months. However, the decline in the Absa Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) to 44.9 index points in December is indicative of the continued challenges faced by the sector. More positively, the sub-index measuring expected business conditions in six months' time improved markedly. Despite the continued weakness in the Rand Merchant Bank (RMB) / BER business confidence index, growth in real gross fixed capital formation improved in the third quarter, following a contraction in the previous quarter. All three sectors recorded growth rates in excess of 4%. The recovery was most pronounced in the private sector. The durability of this improvement will be highly dependent on the extent to which the recent political developments impact on confidence and lead to greater policy certainty and credibility. This process could take some time. At this stage, the forecast is for minimal growth in gross fixed capital formation this year, with a slight improvement in 2019. MPC statement 18 January 2018 Page 6. MPC statement 18 January 2018 Page 6 A prolonged recovery in fixed capital formation is needed to make inroads into the official unemployment rate of 27.7%. The Quarterly Employment Statistics survey of Statistics South Africa shows that, during the third quarter of 2017, formal non- agricultural employment in both the public and the private sectors declined further. Adjusted for election-related employment by the Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC), private-sector employment creation more or less offset public-sector losses in the four quarters to the third quarter of 2017. Growth in real final consumption expenditure by households decelerated to an annualised rate of 2.6% in the third quarter but was characterised by a sharp increase of 19.9% in expenditure on durable goods, mainly motor vehicles. Some moderation in consumption expenditure growth is expected in the fourth quarter following weaker motor vehicle sales. However, the strong â€˜Black Friday' effect evident in the November retail trade sales may moderate the extent of this slowdown. Despite being relatively constrained, the outlook for household consumption expenditure has improved, with annual average real growth rates of around 1.3% expected over the forecast period. This category is expected to be the main driver of GDP growth in the short to medium term. Although consumers are likely to be adversely affected by possible further tax increases, expenditure is expected to be underpinned by lower inflation and positive real wage increases. Growth in bank credit extension to households remains weak but has trended slightly higher in recent months. Much of this increase reflects growth in instalment sale financing, consistent with improved motor vehicle sales. Growth in credit extension to MPC statement 18 January 2018 Page 7. Growth in credit extension to MPC statement 18 January 2018 Page 7 the corporate sector, while more robust, has been on a downward trend for some time. Wage pressures are expected to continue contributing to inflation persistence. Growth over four quarters in nominal remuneration per worker in the formal non- agricultural sector increased from 6.3% in the second quarter of 2017 to 6.8% in the third quarter. However, adjusting for labour productivity, growth in nominal unit labour costs declined from 6.1% to 5.5%. Average nominal remuneration increases are expected to remain above 6% over the forecast period. International oil prices have continued their upward trend to current levels of around US$70 per barrel for Brent crude oil. These increases are due to supply restrictions by some producers, as well as increased global demand. At this stage, it is unclear if these prices will settle at these elevated levels or if the trend will be reversed by increased US shale output in response to higher prices. The oil price assumptions in the QPM have been adjusted upwards to average US$62 per barrel in 2018 and 2019. Domestic petrol prices increased by 71 cents per litre in December but were reduced by 34 cents per litre (for 95 octane) in January as a result of the stronger exchange rate. The current over-recovery on the petrol price points to a further price reduction in February, should current trends persist. The MPC has taken note of the improved inflation outlook over the near term in particular. Inflation is expected to reach a low point below the midpoint of the target range, but is then expected to resume an upward trajectory and measure 5.5% in the final quarter of next year. This remains above the midpoint of the target range. The risks to the forecast are still assessed to be on the upside, though the degree of the upside risk has subsided. MPC statement 18 January 2018 Page 8. MPC statement 18 January 2018 Page 8 Two main risks featured prominently in the MPC discussions. First is the prospect of a sovereign credit ratings downgrade, which would result in three major agencies rating South Africa's local-currency debt as sub-investment grade. The impact on the rand and on long-bond yields could be significant, but the extent to which a universal downgrade is already priced in remains unclear. Furthermore, the assumption in the forecast for the starting point of the rand (at R12.90 against the US dollar) is weaker than current levels. The response of government to the intensifying fiscal challenges in the upcoming budget will be key to avoiding this event risk. In addition, the pressures are now even more intense, with several state-owned enterprises facing financial risks. The challenge for government will be to find ways to finance the deficit in a growth- positive manner, and at the same time convey a credible commitment to structural reforms that can raise the potential growth of the economy. This would also support business and consumer confidence. The second risk relates to international oil price developments. Although the assumptions have been raised over the forecast period, the MPC still assesses the risks to be moderately on the upside, and further upward adjustment may be required in the future. Demand pressures are benign, with core inflation pressures relatively contained. While household consumption expenditure is expected to be supported by positive wage growth, it remains constrained. The economic growth outlook is also more positive, but fragile. At this stage, the MPC assesses the risks to the growth forecast to be more or less balanced. MPC statement 18 January 2018 Page 9. MPC statement 18 January 2018 Page 9 The endogenous interest rate path generated by the QPM has changed slightly since the previous meeting. Whereas three increases of 25 basis points by the end of 2019 were indicated previously, the third increase is now a marginal call. Furthermore, the timing of the first increase has been pushed out to later in the period. The implied path remains a broad policy guide and could change in either direction by the next meeting in response to new developments and changing risks. In light of the recent developments and the balance of risks, the MPC has decided that it would be appropriate to maintain the current monetary policy stance at this stage. Accordingly, the repurchase rate remains unchanged at 6.75% per annum. Five members preferred an unchanged stance, while one member preferred a 25 basis point reduction.

Pakistan,2018-01-20,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement January 2018 Pakistan's economic growth is on track to achieve its highest level in the last eleven years. Average headline inflation remains within the forecast range of SBP, but core inflation has continued to increase. Fiscal deficit for H1-FY18 is expected to fall close to the last year's. percent. There has been visible improvement in export growth and remittances are marginally higher. However largely due to high level of imports the current account deficit remains under pressure. The exchange rate adjustment in December 2017 is expected to help ease the pressure on the external front. The progress in the real sector indicates that agriculture sector is set to perform better for the second year in row. Production of all major Kharif crops, except maize, has surpassed the level of FY17. Similarly large scale manufacturing (LSM) recorded healthy broad-based growth of. percent during Jul-Nov FY18 as compared to. percent during the same period last year. While there could be some deceleration in LSM growth due to sector specific issues such as sugar. POL and fertilizer, overall industrial activity is likely to remain strong. Benefiting from both infrastructure and CPEC related investments, construction and its allied industries are expected to maintain their higher growth momentum. After incorporating the impact of commodity sector dynamics on the services sector, the real GDP growth is projected to be around. percent, significantly higher than FY17, but marginally lower than the annual target of percent for FY18. This is largely due to expectations of below-target wheat crop because of reduction in area under cultivation. Average headline inflation for H1-FY18 stands at. percent. Meanwhile core inflation (non-food- non-energy) continued to maintain its higher trajectory, and clocked in at. percent during the first half of the year as compared to. percent last year. This together with lagged impact of PKR depreciation and rising international oil prices are likely to increase inflation in the coming months. Taking into account the impact of all these developments, while the average inflation for FY18 is still projected to fall in the range of. to. percent, end of fiscal year YoY inflation is likely to inch towards the annual target of percent. Broad money supply grew marginally by. percent during 1st Jul-12th Jan FY18. This is reflection of the decline in NFA and government efforts to contain expenditures. Higher tax collection and proceeds from the issuance of Sukuk and Eurobond have led to reduction in net budgetary borrowing which stood at Rs. 401. billion during 1st Jul-12th Jan FY18 as compared to Rs. 470. billion in the corresponding period of the previous year. Moreover the delay in the sugar crushing season also contributed to moderation of demand in private sector credit. On the external front, export receipts posted the highest growth in the last seven years of 10. percent in H1-FY18 against reduction of. percent in H1-FY17. Worker's remittances also recorded growth (2. percent) during the first half of the year as compared to decline in the same period last year. However favorable impact of these positives was overshadowed by the continuation of strong growth in imports of goods and services. The current account deficit widened to US$. billion during the first half of the year, which was. times of the deficit during the same period last year. Developments in financial accounts show that one-fifth of this deficit was financed by healthy foreign direct investments inflows, and the rest was managed by the official flows and the country's own resources. As result. SBP's liquid foreign exchange reserves Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN witnessed decline of US$. billion since end June 2017 to reach US$ 13. billion as of 19th January 2018. Going forward, the PKR depreciation in December 2017, the export package, the lagged impact of adjustments in regulatory duties, favorable external environment, and expected increase in workers' remittances, will contribute to gradual reduction in the country's current account deficit. While increase in international oil prices pose major risk to this assessment, managing overall balance of payments in near term depends on the realization of official financial flows. Four key factors of Pakistan's economy have witnessed important changes since November 2017 impinging upon the policy rate decision. Firstly PKR has depreciated by around percent. Secondly oil prices are hovering near USD 70 per barrel. Thirdly number of central banks have started to adjust their policy rates upwards adversely affecting PKR interest-rate differentials vis-Ã - vis their currencies. Fourthly multiple indicators show that the output gap has significantly narrowed indicating buildup of demand pressures. Based on these developments. MPC is of the view that in order to preempt overheating of the economy and inflation breaching its target rate, this is the right time to make policy decision that would balance growth and stability in the medium to long term. Accordingly the Monetary Policy Committee has decided to raise the policy rate by 25 bps to.0 percent. Page."
Euroarea,2018-01-25,"Ladies and gentlemen, first of all let me wish you a Happy New Year. The Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Vice-President. Mr Dombrovskis. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We continue to expect them to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases. Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, we confirm that our net asset purchases, at the new monthly pace of â‚¬30 billion, are intended to run until the end of September 2018, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, we stand ready to increase the asset purchase programme (APP) in terms of size and/or duration. The Eurosystem will reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time after the end of its net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary. This will contribute both to favourable liquidity conditions and to an appropriate monetary policy stance. Incoming information confirms a robust pace of economic expansion, which accelerated more than expected in the second half of 2017. The strong cyclical momentum, the ongoing reduction of economic slack and increasing capacity utilisation strengthen further our confidence that inflation will converge towards our inflation aim of below, but close to, 2%. At the same time, domestic price pressures remain muted overall and have yet to show convincing signs of a sustained upward trend. Against this background, the recent volatility in the exchange rate represents a source of uncertainty which requires monitoring with regard to its possible implications for the medium-term outlook for price stability. Overall, an ample degree of monetary stimulus remains necessary for underlying inflation pressures to continue to build up and support headline inflation developments over the medium term. This continued monetary support is provided by the net asset purchases, by the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the forthcoming reinvestments, and by our forward guidance on interest rates. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Real GDP increased by 0.7%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2017, following similar growth in the second quarter. The latest economic data and survey results indicate continued strong and broad-based growth momentum at the turn of the year. Our monetary policy measures, which have facilitated the deleveraging process, continue to underpin domestic demand. Private consumption is supported by rising employment, which is also benefiting from past labour market reforms, and by growing household wealth. Business investment continues to strengthen on the back of very favourable financing conditions, rising corporate profitability and solid demand. In addition, the broad-based global expansion is providing impetus to euro area exports. The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook are assessed as broadly balanced. On the one hand, the prevailing strong cyclical momentum could lead to further positive growth surprises in the near term. On the other hand, downside risks continue to relate primarily to global factors, including developments in foreign exchange markets. Euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.4% in December 2017, down from 1.5% in November. Looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for oil, annual rates of headline inflation are likely to hover around current levels in the coming months. For their part, measures of underlying inflation remain subdued  in part owing to special factors  and have yet to show convincing signs of a sustained upward trend. Yet, looking forward, they are expected to rise gradually over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the continuing economic expansion, the corresponding absorption of economic slack and rising wage growth. Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) continues to expand at a robust pace, with an annual rate of growth of 4.9% in November 2017, after 5.0% in October, reflecting the impact of the ECB's monetary policy measures and the low opportunity cost of holding the most liquid deposits. Accordingly, the narrow monetary aggregate M1 continued to be the main contributor to broad money growth, expanding at an annual rate of 9.1% in November, after 9.4% in October. The recovery in the growth of loans to the private sector observed since the beginning of 2014 is proceeding. The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations increased to 3.1% in November 2017, after 2.9% in October, while the annual growth rate of loans to households stood at 2.8% in November, compared with 2.7% in October. The euro area bank lending survey for the fourth quarter of 2017 indicates that loan growth continues to be supported by increasing demand and a further easing in overall lending conditions. The pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014 continues to significantly support borrowing conditions for firms and households, access to financing â€’ notably for small and medium-sized enterprises â€’ and credit flows across the euro area. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed the need for an ample degree of monetary accommodation to secure a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2%. In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute decisively to strengthening the longer-term growth potential and reducing vulnerabilities. The implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up to increase resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost euro area productivity and growth potential. Regarding fiscal policies, the increasingly solid and broad-based expansion strengthens the case for rebuilding fiscal buffers. This is particularly important in countries where government debt remains high. All countries would benefit from intensifying efforts towards achieving a more growth-friendly composition of public finances. A full, transparent and consistent implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact and of the macroeconomic imbalance procedure over time and across countries remains essential to increase the resilience of the euro area economy. The Governing Council welcomes the ongoing discussions on completing the banking union and the capital markets union, and on further deepening Economic and Monetary Union."
Malaysia,2018-01-25,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to increase the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) by 25 basis points to 3.25 percent. The floor and ceiling rates of the corridor for the OPR are correspondingly raised to 3.00 percent and 3.50 percent respectively. The global economy has strengthened further, with growth becoming more entrenched and synchronised across regions. Global trade continues to sustain strong growth performance. In the advanced economies, diminishing labour market slack and additional policy support will provide further impetus to growth. In Asia, growth is driven by sustained domestic activity and strong external demand. Globally, financial markets have remained stable. Global growth is projected to experience a faster expansion in 2018. In this environment, risks to the global growth outlook are more balanced, pointing towards continuity in the current phase of global economic expansion. For the Malaysian economy, latest indicators reaffirm the strength in exports and domestic activity. Looking ahead, the strong growth momentum is expected to continue in 2018, sustained by the stronger global growth and positive spillovers from the external sector to the domestic economy. Domestic demand will remain the key driver of growth, underpinned by favourable income and labour market conditions. The outlook for investment activity is also positive, driven by new and on-going infrastructure projects and capital spending by both export- and domestic-oriented firms. The external sector will provide additional impetus to the economy. Overall, growth is expected to remain strong in 2018. Headline inflation averaged at 3.7% in 2017. Inflation is expected to average lower in 2018, on expectations of a smaller effect from global cost factors. A stronger ringgit exchange rate compared to 2017 will mitigate import costs. Global energy and commodity prices are expected to trend higher in 2018. However, the trajectory of headline inflation will be dependent on future global oil prices which remain highly uncertain. Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation, remains moderate. The domestic financial markets have been resilient. The ringgit has strengthened to better reflect the economic fundamentals. Banking system liquidity remains sufficient with financial institutions continuing to operate with strong capital and liquidity buffers. The growth of financing to the private sector has been sustained and is supportive of economic activity. With the economy firmly on a steady growth path, the MPC decided to normalise the degree of monetary accommodation. At the same time, the MPC recognises the need to pre-emptively ensure that the stance of monetary policy is appropriate to prevent the build-up of risks that could arise from interest rates being too low for a prolonged period of time. At the current level of the OPR, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative. The MPC will continue to assess the balance of risks surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation. Bank Negara Malaysia 25 January 2018."
Ukraine,2018-01-25,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to hike its key policy rate to 16% per annum, effective from 26 January 2018. The tighter monetary policy will help decrease the inflation and bring it back to the target range in the middle of 2019. In 2017, headline inflation reached 13.7%, exceeding the target of 8% Â± 2 pp set for the National Bank of Ukraine in the Monetary Policy Guidelines for 2017 and Medium Term. Inflation sped from 12.4% in 2016, mainly due to factors on which monetary policy tools have only a limited effect. In particular, acceleration of inflation was mainly driven by a decrease in the supply of some foods resulting from the unfavorable weather conditions seen in the first half of last year, the unstable situation in animal breeding, and a rise in the global prices of, and demand for. Ukrainian foods, mainly meat and dairy products. An increase in production costs, especially labor costs, and fast recovery of consumer demand also contributed to the growth of prices. In addition, the end of last year saw an increase in hryvnia exchange rate fluctuations and a noticeable easing in fiscal policy, thanks to, among other things, sharp increase in pension payments and budgetary spending being unevenly distributed over the year. This increased underlying inflationary pressure, as evidenced by a rise in core inflation, to 9.5% in December, and high inflation expectations. As a consequence, the deviation of inflation rate from the target was larger than the NBU anticipated in its October 2017 Inflation Report. Headline inflation is expected to slow down and return to the target in the middle of 2019. Inflation will gradually decrease in 2018 through 2020, mainly due to the central bank conducting a tight monetary policy over forecast horizon. However, the NBU projects that inflation will remain high in 2018: headline inflation will be 8.9% and core inflation will be 8.2%. This inflationary pressure will be due to several factors, such as:. the rise in the prices of raw foods (mainly meat and milk) that occurred last year passing through to the prices of highly processed foods;a pick-up in consumer demand, driven by household income growth resulting from both higher social standards and a further increase in wages in the private sector amid high demand for labor;an increase in the external vulnerability of the Ukrainian economy, due to delayed cooperation with the IMF, which makes it more difficult for Ukraine to attract capital, and consequently, puts pressure on the hryvnia exchange rate;the high inflation expectations of households and businesses, resulting from consumer prices' current pace of growth, and the FX market volatility seen in recent months;a hike in global oil prices, which pushes domestic prices up.In the future, the inflation decrease will be ensured by a tight monetary policy, a rise in supply of foods and a slow down of imported inflation. Respectively, the growth rates of both raw food prices and core inflation heavily dependent on the former will decline. As a result, the inflation will return to its target range in the middle of the year 2019 and will be 5.8% by the end of the following year. In 2020, inflation will decelerate to 5.0%, thus corresponding to the mean value of the target range (5.0% Â± 1 pp). The NBU expects economic growth to accelerate in 2018. The economic growth is to accelerate to 3.4% in 2018. The key driver of the economic growth will be private consumption associated with sustained high real wages growth rates, as well as other household incomes, including pensions. Besides, loosening the fiscal policy will be an additional contributor. Also, companies' investment activity will stay robust. In 2019-2020 increase in real GDP will somewhat slow down (to 2.9%) due to wearing off this year's fiscal easing effects and impact of the tight monetary policy necessary to bring the consumer inflation to the target level over the forecast horizon. Furthermore, a slow progression of the structural reforms will withhold the advancement of long-term economic prospects. Over the forecast horizon, resumption of lending will be slow primarily due to high risks of the institutional environment, suchas the low level of protection of creditors' rights. The role of exports in the economic growth will gradually strengthen complementary to favorable trade conditions and expanding access to foreign markets. The export increase will also sustain recovery of manufacturing in certain industries that lost supply of products manufactured by companies in non-government controlled area in the previous year. At the same time, boosted domestic consumption and investment demand will continue to drive imports. Thus, the current account deficit will maintain the level of about 3% of GDP in 20182020. A key assumption of the macroeconomic forecast is that Ukraine will continue to cooperate with the International Monetary Fund. This will sustain access to official funding from other organizations, as well as access to international capital markets in the forecast horizon. This year the NBU expects about USD 2 billion tranches from the IMF, as well as the EU and the World Bank loans to be issuedto the government. The aforesaid will ensure an increase in international reserves up to USD 20.5 billion (covering 3.7 months of future imports) by the end of 2018. However, in 2019-2020, due to spiking reimbursement of the external public debt, the deficit of overall balance of payments and a drop in international reserves is expected. A lack of the structural reform essential to maintain macrofinancial stability and continue cooperation with the IMF poses the main risk to the implementation of the mentioned scenario, according to the regulator. In case of premature termination of the IMF program, it may impede Ukraine's access to the international financial markets, which may bring higher currency depreciation and inflation expectations and raise probability of facing problems with external public debt servicing in the next years. In 2018-2020, the Government and the NBU have to pay more than USD 16 billion for external debt servicing. Hence, the NBU deems further cooperation with the IMF within the existing and new programs to be critical for maintaining macrofinancial stability. Another considerable risk stems from a looser fiscal policy of the Government. In particular, faster growth in social spending than in labor productivity may aggravate the inflationary pressure. If this should be the case, the NBU will have to resort to creating tighter monetary conditions than in the baseline scenario. With the aim of gradually bringing inflation to its targets and taking into account the above risks the NBU deems it necessary to hike the key policy rate, up to 16% per annum. In the absence of indications of the lowering inflationary pressure the NBU may further increase the key policy rate to return inflation to its medium-term target. The decision to raise the key policy rate to 16% is approved by NBU Board Decision No. 43-D On the Key Policy Rate, dated 25 January 2018. Ð new detailed macroeconomic forecast will be published in the Inflation Report on 1 February 2018. The next meeting of the NBU Board on monetary policy issues will be held on 1 March 2018 as scheduled."
Colombia,2018-01-29,"The Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica, in its meeting today, decided to reduce the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp, placing it at 4.5% For this decision, the Board mainly took into account the following aspects. In December, yearly inflation fell less than expected, reaching 4.09%. Except for food, all the major components of the CPI registered yearly variations somewhat greater than had been projected. The average of core inflation indicators increased again, reaching 4.66%. Inflation expectations recorded slight changes. Those by analysts to December 2018 and 2019 stand, on average, at 3.47% and 3.33%, respectively. Those embedded in public debt bonds remain above 3.0%. Inflation and core inflation are expected to decrease in the coming months, partly due to the dissipation of the effects of the increases in indirect taxes at the beginning of last year. External demand continues to recover, driven by developed economies and by the major emerging economies. The US dollar has depreciated vis--vis most other currencies, and the risk premia in the region, including Colombia, have reduced. Oil prices increased again, reaching levels higher than the averages registered in the last two years. Should this trend continue, the country's terms of trade would continue improving and, together with the better dynamics expected from external demand, would continue to favor the recovery of the country's external income. most other currencies, and the risk premia in the region, including Colombia, have reduced. Due to the higher external income, the technical staff reduced their estimation of the current account deficit from 3.7% to 3.5% of GDP in 2017; additionally, it forecasted that it would continue reducing to 3.3% in 2018. The new figures for the country's economic activity in the last quarter of 2017 confirm a weak domestic demand, with which the Central Bank's technical staff maintained its growth forecast at 1.6% for 2017. For 2018, its growth forecast is 2.7%. The increase in the growth rate would be supported by the acceleration of external demand, the effects of the previous reductions in interest rates, and investment in civil works, among other factors. However, according to this forecast, the underuse of the installed capacity would broaden this year. Based on this information, the Board considered the following factors for its decision. Weakness of the economic activity and uncertainty over its pace of recovery. Should the price of oil remain at current levels for a prolonged period, investment in the sector would increase and national income would improve. However, uncertainty on the persistence of these shocks is high. The less-favorable behavior registered in some groups of the CPI vis--vis the forecast by the technical staff, and the risk that convergence of inflation to its target be slower than expected. Weakness of demand and the exchange-rate effect of the country's terms of trade would alleviate this risk. However, uncertainty on these events is high. In this context, after assessing the risk balance of the weakness of the economic activity and its expected recovery and the pace of convergence of inflation to its target, the Board deemed appropriate to reduce the benchmark interest rate to 4.5%. Some indicators suggest that at this level the monetary policy stance is slightly expansionary. With the information available, the Board considers that the reduction cycle of the interest rate has been completed. The Board will continue to carefully monitor the behavior of inflation and the forecasts for economic activity and inflation in the country, as well as the international context. Finally, the Board reiterates that the monetary policy will depend on the availability of new information. The decision to reduce the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp was approved by four members of the Board. The three remaining members of the Board voted to keep it unaltered."
Georgia,2018-01-31,"The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on 31st of January, 2018 and decided to keep the refinancing rate unchanged. Based on current forecast, the annual inflation rate will start to decline in the first few months of 2018 and remain close to target level of 3% over 2018. By the end of 2017, the nominal effective exchange rate has notably depreciated, increasing inflation expectations and creating upward pressure on inflation. As a response, the Monetary Policy Committee met on 13th of December and decided to tighten the monetary policy. Recently, the nominal effective exchange rate has started to appreciate. However, the effect of the recent depreciation on inflation persists. However, despite higher than expected GDP growth in 2017, aggregate demand remains below its potential level, having a downward pressure on inflation. Thus, there is no need for further tightening of the monetary policy. The future decisions of the Committee will rely upon the pace of neutralization of factors having an upwards pressure on inflation. In December, the annual inflation rate was equal to 6.7%. The contribution of temporary exogenous factors (independent from monetary policy) was equal to 2.9 percentage points. With the exhaustion of temporary factors, the inflation is expected to gradually decline from the beginning of 2018. During 2018 the inflation rate will be affected by several other exogenous factors such as the increase of administrative prices on electricity and water, and the increase of international prices of oil, that started in 2018 and will continue to affect inflation in 2018. Other things equal, the contribution of these factors will equal to 0.3 and 0.5 percentage points respectively. The positive trends remain in the external sector. Following the increase in the volume of remittances, tourism revenues and export, based on preliminary estimates, current account deficit has significantly improved in 2017. Based on the current estimates, the current account deficit will continue to improve in 2018, decreasing the exchange rate pressure on the inflation rate. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all means and instruments at its disposal in order to ensure the price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on14th of March 2018."
United States,2018-01-31,"EST January 31, 2018 Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a solid rate. Gains in employment, household spending, and business fixed investment have been solid, and the unemployment rate has stayed low. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have continued to run below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation have increased in recent months but remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will remain strong. Inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to move up this year and to stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and (more) For release at 2 p.m. EST January 31, 2018 - 2 - readings on financial and international developments. The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were Janet L Yellen.

Czech Republic,2018-02-01,"At its meeting today, the CNB Bank Board unanimously increased the two-week repo rate by 25 basis points to 0.75%. At the same time, it increased the Lombard rate by 50 basis points to 1.50% and kept the discount rate unchanged at 0.05%.. The decision adopted by the Bank Board is underpinned by a new macroeconomic forecast of the Czech National Bank. Consistent with the forecast is a further rise in domestic market interest rates this year and especially next year. This, coupled with further appreciation of the koruna against the euro, will ensure that inflation returns to the target. According to the external assumptions of the new forecast, the current robust growth in economic activity in the effective euro area will gradually slow to 2%. Growth in industrial producer prices will slacken temporarily at the start of this year. However, it will then recover again, owing among other factors to higher oil prices. Accommodative monetary policy of the European Central Bank will foster a return of euro area inflation to 2% in late 2019. 3M EURIBOR market rates will not turn positive until the end of next year. The expected outlook for the euro-dollar exchange rate is slightly below USD 1.20 to the euro. The Brent crude oil price will gradually decline from its current elevated levels almost to USD 60 a barrel at the end of next year. Domestic inflation will remain above the 2% target this year. It will then return to the target at the start of next year. The currently strong inflation pressures, stemming from faster growth of the domestic economy and wages, will ease gradually. In 2018, this will be due mainly to a strengthening anti-inflationary effect of import prices, which will reflect appreciation of the koruna. At the same time, the one-off price factors that increased inflation last year will fully disappear. However, faster growth in administered prices will cause headline inflation to stay above the 2% target this year. Inflation will be just below the target over the monetary policy horizon. The growth of the Czech economy will slow compared to last year, but it will exceed 3% nonetheless. The economy will continue to be supported by growth in external demand, robust consumption of Czech households and generally strong domestic investment activity. Rising labour demand coupled with an increasingly distinct shortage of available labour will manifest itself in continued rapid wage growth. Starting with this forecast, the Czech National Bank is returning to the publication of numerical forecasts for the koruna-euro exchange rate. Like the interest rate forecast, the exchange rate outlook does not constitute any commitment by the Czech National Bank, nor can it be interpreted as the preferred or desired exchange rate level. Like the forecasts for all other variables, the exchange rate forecast is conditional on the assumptions of the forecast, including the outlooks for developments abroad. Unexpected shocks may cause the actual exchange rate to deviate in either direction from the forecast, sometimes significantly. However, its publication will give the market a useful guide to the future monetary policy stance, as it did before November 2013. A deviation of the actual exchange rate from the forecasted path may point to a need to change the outlook for the interest rate component of the monetary conditions. According to the new forecast, the koruna will appreciate further against the euro. Its forecasted appreciation in the course of this year will mainly reflect a widening of the interest rate differential vis-Ã -vis the euro area and the impact of continued asset purchases by the European Central Bank. Ongoing real convergence of the Czech economy towards the euro area countries, associated with rising labour productivity, will act in the same direction over the entire forecast horizon. Next year, however, the koruna will firm only modestly to around CZK 24.5 to the euro. This will reflect, among other factors, the assumed shift of the European Central Bank's monetary policy towards normal. According to the forecast, the return of inflation very close to the target will be fostered by a rise in domestic market interest rates in addition to appreciation of the koruna. However, this rise will be slowed in 2018 by continued very accommodative European Central Bank monetary policy, which will add to the appreciation pressures on the koruna in the next few quarters. During 2019, domestic interest rates will converge smoothly to their assumed long-run neutral level, owing, among other things, to foreign rates turning positive again. Compared to the previous forecast, the inflation outlook is slightly lower over the monetary policy horizon. By contrast, the forecasted growth of the Czech economy is slightly higher this year and the next. The pace of growth in interest rates is somewhat more gradual in 2019, while the koruna-euro exchange rate forecast for next year has moved to a rather stronger level."
Brazil,2018-02-07,"The Copom unanimously decided to reduce the Selic rate by 0.25 percentage point, to 6.75 percent per year. The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario:. The set of indicators of economic activity released since the last Copom meeting shows consistent recovery of the Brazilian economy. The global outlook has been favorable, as economies grow worldwide. This has so far contributed to support risk appetite towards emerging economies, notwithstanding recent volatility of financial conditions in advanced economies. The Committee judges that its baseline inflation scenario has evolved, to a large extent, as expected. Inflation developments remain favorable, with various measures of underlying inflation running at comfortable or low levels. This includes the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy. Inflation expectations for 2018 collected by the Focus survey are around 3.9%. Expectations for 2019 and 2020 remain around 4.25% and 4.0%, respectively; and. The Copom's inflation projections in the scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the Focus survey stand around 4.2% for both 2018 and 2019. This scenario assumes a path for the policy interest rate that ends 2018 at 6.75%, and 2019 at 8.0%. The Committee emphasizes that its baseline scenario involves risks in both directions. On the one hand, the combination of possible second-round effects of the favorable food price shock and of low current levels of industrial goods inflation, and the possible propagation through inertial mechanisms of low inflation levels may lead to a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory. On the other hand, frustration of expectations regarding the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy may affect risk premia and increase the path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy. This risk intensifies in the case of a reversal of the current benign global outlook for emerging economies. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the wide array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to reduce the Selic rate by 0.25 percentage point, to 6.75 percent per year. The Committee judges that this decision is consistent with convergence of inflation to target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, which includes 2018 and, with smaller and gradually increasing weight, 2019. The Committee judges that economic conditions prescribe accommodative monetary policy, i.e., interest rates below the structural level. The Copom emphasizes that the evolution of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy contributes to the reduction of its structural interest rate. The Committee will continue to reassess estimates of this rate over time. The evolution of the baseline scenario, in line with expectations, and the stage of the monetary easing cycle made it appropriate to reduce the Selic rate by 0.25 percentage point at this Copom meeting. Regarding the next meeting, provided the Committee's baseline scenario evolves as expected, at this time the Copom views the interruption of the monetary easing process as more appropriate. This view regarding the next Copom meeting might change in favor of an additional moderate monetary easing, if the Committee's baseline scenario and balance of risks change. The Copom emphasizes that the next steps in the conduct of monetary policy will continue to depend on the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, possible reassessments of the extension of the cycle, and on inflation forecasts and expectations. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Ilan Goldfajn (Governor). Carlos Viana de Carvalho. Isaac Sidney Menezes Ferreira. Mauricio Costa de Moura. Otavio Ribeiro Damaso.

India,2018-02-07,"Sixth Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2017-18 Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) Reserve Bank of India On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation at its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 6.0 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains at 5.75 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 6.25 per cent. The decision of the MPC is consistent with the neutral stance of monetary policy in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Assessment 2. Since the MPC's last meeting in December 2017, global economic activity has gained further pace with growth impulses becoming more synchronised across regions. Among advanced economies (AEs), the Euro area expanded at a robust pace, supported by consumption and investment. Economic optimism alongside falling unemployment and low interest rates are supporting the recovery. The US economy lost some momentum with growth slowing down in Q4 of 2017 even as manufacturing activity touched a multi-month high in December. The Japanese economy continued to grow as manufacturing activity gathered pace in January on strong external demand, providing fillip to the already bullish business confidence. Economic activity accelerated in emerging market economies (EMEs) in the final quarter of 2017. The Chinese economy grew above the official target, driven by strong domestic consumption and robust exports. However, some downside risks to growth remain, especially from easing fixed asset investment and surging debt levels. In Russia, strong private consumption, rising oil prices and high exports are supporting economic activity, although weak investment and economic sanctions are weighing on its growth prospects. In Brazil, data on household spending and unemployment were positive in Q4. However, recovery remains 12017-18 from 7.1 per cent in 2016-17 due mainly to slowdown in agriculture and allied activities, mining and quarrying, manufacturing, and public administration and defence (PADO) services. Information available after the release of FAE by the CSO has, however, been generally positive. Manufacturing output boosted the growth of index of industrial production (IIP) in November. After a period of prolonged weakness, cement production registered robust growth in November-December, which along with continuing healthy growth in steel production led to acceleration of infrastructure goods production in November. The manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) expanded for the sixth consecutive month in January led by new orders. Assessment of overall business sentiment in the Indian manufacturing sector improved in Q3 as reflected in the Reserve Bank's Industrial Outlook Survey (IOS). However, core sector growth decelerated in December due to contraction/deceleration in production of coal, crude oil, steel and electricity. Acreage in the case of wheat, oilseeds and coarse cereals was lower than last year. As a result, the shortfall in area sown for rabi crops increased to (-)1.5 per cent as on February 2 as compared with (-)1.0 per cent on December 29, 2017. In the services sector, some of the high frequency indicators improved. Commercial vehicle sales growth touched an eight-year high in December. Cargo carried by sea, rail and air also registered higher growth in November, but showed mixed performance in December. Other indicators such as domestic and international air passenger traffic and foreign tourist arrivals grew at a fast pace in November-December. The services PMI expanded sequentially in December and January on the back of higher business activity. Retail inflation, measured by the year-on-year change in the consumer price index (CPI), increased for the sixth consecutive month in December on account of a strong unfavourable base 23. This is also confirmed by manufacturing and services firms polled by PMI. Organised sector wage growth remained firm, while the rural wage growth decelerated. The liquidity in the system continues to be in surplus mode, but it is moving steadily towards neutrality. The weighted average call rate (WACR) traded 12 basis points (bps) below the repo rate during December-January as against 15 bps below the repo rate in November. On some days in December and January, the system turned into deficit due to slow down in government spending and large tax collections, which necessitated injection of liquidity by the Reserve Bank. During the two weeks beginning December 16, 2017, the Reserve Bank injected average daily net liquidity of â‚¹ 388 billion into the system. For December as a whole, however, the Reserve Bank absorbed â‚¹ 316 billion (on a net daily average basis). As the system turned into deficit again in the fourth week of January, the Reserve Bank injected average net liquidity of â‚¹ 145 billion. For January, on the whole, the Reserve Bank absorbed â‚¹ 353 billion (on a net daily average basis). Merchandise exports bounced back in November and December. While petroleum products, engineering goods and chemicals accounted for three-fourths of this growth, exports of readymade garments contracted. During the same period, merchandise import growth accelerated sequentially with over one-third of the growth emanating from petroleum (crude and products) due largely to high international prices. Gold imports increased  both in value and volume terms  in December, after declining in the preceding three months. Pearls and precious stones, electronic goods and coal were major contributors to non-oil non-gold import growth. With import growth exceeding export growth, the trade deficit for December was US$ 14.9 billion. Even though the current account deficit narrowed sharply in Q2 of 2017-18 on a sequential basis, it was higher than its level a year ago, mainly due to widening of the trade deficit. While net foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows moderated in April-October 2017 from their level a year ago, net foreign portfolio investment (FPI) inflows were buoyant in 2017- 18 (up to February 1). India's foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 421.9 billion on February 2, 2018. 34.3-4.7 per cent in the second half of 2017-18, including the impact of increase in HRA. In terms of actual outcomes, headline inflation averaged 4.6 per cent in Q3, driven primarily by an unusual pick-up in food prices in November. Though prices eased in December, the winter seasonal food price moderation was less than usual. Domestic pump prices of petrol and diesel rose sharply in January, reflecting lagged pass-through of the past increases in international crude oil prices. Considering these factors, inflation is now estimated at 5.1 per cent in Q4, including the HRA impact. The inflation outlook beyond the current year is likely to be shaped by several factors. First, international crude oil prices have firmed up sharply since August 2017, driven by both demand and supply side factors. Second, non-oil industrial raw material prices have also witnessed a global uptick. Firms polled in the Reserve Bank's IOS expect input prices to harden in Q4. In a scenario of improving economic activity, rising input costs are likely to be passed on to consumers. Third, the inflation outlook will depend on the monsoon, which is assumed to be normal. Taking these factors into consideration. CPI inflation for 2018-19 is estimated in the range of 5.1-5.6 per cent in H1, including diminishing statistical HRA impact of central government employees, and 4.5-4.6 per cent in H2, with risks tilted to the upside (Chart 1). The projected moderation in inflation in the second half is on account of strong favourable base effects, including unwinding of the 7th CPC's HRA impact, and a softer food inflation forecast, given the assumption of normal monsoon and effective supply management by the Government. Turning to the growth outlook. GVA growth for 2017-18 is projected at 6.6 per cent. Beyond the current year, the growth outlook will be influenced by several factors. First. GST implementation is stabilising, which augurs well for economic activity. Second, there are early signs of revival in investment activity as reflected in improving credit offtake, large resource mobilisation from the primary capital market, and improving capital goods production and imports. Third, the process of recapitalisation of public sector banks has got underway. Large distressed borrowers are being referenced for resolution under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). This should improve credit flows further and create demand for fresh investment. Fourth, although export growth is expected to improve further on account of improving global demand, elevated commodity prices, especially of oil, may act as a drag on aggregate demand. Taking into consideration the above factors. GVA growth for 2018-19 is projected at 7.2 per cent overall  in the range of 7.3-7.4 per cent in H1 and 7.1-7.2 per cent in H2  with risks evenly balanced (Chart 2). 456 Chief General Manager 6."
Philippines,2018-02-07,"At its meeting on monetary policy today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain its policy rate, the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) facility, steady at 3.0 percent. The corresponding interest rates on the overnight lending and deposit facilities were also kept unchanged. The Monetary Board's decision is based on its assessment that while latest baseline forecasts show higher inflation outturns for 2018, the inflation path is expected to moderate and settle within the inflation target range of 3.0 percent Â± 1.0 percentage point in 2019. The Monetary Board also noted that prospects for domestic activity continue to be firm on the back of robust domestic demand, manageable growth in credit and liquidity, and a sustained recovery in global economic growth. The higher inflation in January is also due to better enforcement of tax laws on tobacco as well as temporary increases in prices of selected food items, such as fish and vegetables. Nevertheless, the Monetary Board observed that the risks to the inflation outlook remain weighted toward the upside owing mainly to price pressures emanating from possible further increases in global oil prices. At the same time, the Monetary Board saw that inflation expectations continue to be anchored within the inflation target band over the policy horizon. The BSP is watchful against any signs of second-round effects and inflation becoming broader based. Given these considerations, the Monetary Board reiterates that it remains committed to the BSP's price stability objective and will continue to closely monitor the evolving conditions for prices and output for any threats to the inflation target. The Monetary Board stands ready to take appropriate measures as necessary to ensure that the monetary policy stance continues to support price and financial stability."
Poland,2018-02-07,"Warsaw, 7 February 2018 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 6-7 February 2018 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: â–ª reference rate at 1.50%; â–ª lombard rate at 2.50%; â–ª deposit rate at 0.50%; â–ª rediscount rate at 1.75%. The global economic conditions continue to improve markedly. In the euro area. GDP data signal further economic recovery, driven by an improvement in the labour market conditions, rising sentiment of economic agents, and a stronger world trade growth. Also in the United States economic conditions remain favourable. In China, in turn, following a stabilization in GDP growth in 2017, a further gradual slowdown is anticipated. Despite ongoing global recovery, inflation abroad remains moderate, on the back of persistently low domestic inflationary pressure in many countries. At the same time, prices of certain commodities, including oil, have risen in recent months. This has been accompanied by a fall in agricultural commodity prices. The European Central Bank keeps interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero, while still purchasing financial assets. In turn, the US Federal Reserve continues a gradual reduction of its balance sheet, signalling further interest rate increases in the future. In Poland, incoming data point to continued good economic conditions. According to a preliminary estimate. GDP growth in 2017 stood at 4.6%. Growth is still primarily driven by domestic demand, including consumer demand, supported by rising employment and wages, disbursement of benefits and very good consumer confidence. This is accompanied by a recovery in investment, mainly in the public sector. 2017 Q4 probably also saw a rise in gross fixed capital formation in the enterprise sector. Growth in economic activity is additionally supported by strong external demand, reflected in the positive contribution of net exports to GDP growth. Despite the acceleration in economic growth, annual consumer price growth continues to run at a moderate level. In 2017, average annual inflation amounted to 2.0%. At the same time  although wage growth in enterprises increased  core inflation net of food and energy prices remains low. In the Council's assessment, favourable economic conditions in the Polish economy will continue in the next quarters. Yet. GDP growth in 2018 will probably be slightly lower than in the second half of 2017. Taking into account the current information, the Council judges that inflation will remain close to the target over the projection horizon. As a result, 1/2 the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on the sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability."
Romania,2018-02-07,"In its meeting of 7 February 2018, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided:. In December, the annual inflation rate climbed to 3.32 percent from 3.23 percent in November, standing inside the variation band of the flat target, but higher than the forecast. Behind this evolution stood primarily the step-up in core inflation and, to a small extent, the increase in volatile food prices and tobacco product prices. The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate continued to go up, reaching 2.5 percent in December 2017 versus 2.3 percent in November. Against the background of still rising excess aggregate demand in the economy and growing producer costs (labour force, utilities), the increase affected all categories of goods and services, particularly processed food, which was also hit by some supply-side shocks that were common at a European level. The average annual CPI inflation rate continued to advance up to 1.3 percent in December 2017 from 1.0 percent in November; calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, the annual average stood at 1.1 percent, up from 0.9 percent in the previous month. The revised data on third-quarter economic growth reconfirm the fast real GDP dynamics, i.e. 8.8 percent. The major driver of growth was household consumption (8.3 percentage points), whose annual pace of increase stepped up considerably to 12.5 percent, similar to the pre-crisis levels. The expansion in consumption was fostered by the income-boosting measures implemented as from 1 July 2017, which overlapped with the favourable financial conditions, and by the stimulative labour market conditions. In 2017 Q3, gross fixed capital formation also made a positive contribution to economic growth (2.1 percentage points). The contribution of net exports to GDP growth remained in negative territory. The current account deficit widened at a swifter annual rate, amid the larger negative balance on trade in goods. Statistical data for the first two months of the final quarter of 2017 point to a strengthening of the uptrend seen in industrial output, accompanied by a swifter advance in new orders across manufacturing and further high growth rates of the activity in trade and services, against the backdrop of an increase in net real average wage. The trade deficit continued to worsen, as the annual growth rate of imports still outpaced that of exports. Credit to the private sector continued its robust growth in December 2017, at an annual rate of 5.6 percent, given that the leu-denominated component increased by 15.8 percent in annual terms, its share in total credit widening to 62.8 percent (from a 35.6 percent low in May 2012). In today's meeting, the NBR Board examined and approved the February 2018 Inflation Report, which incorporates the most recent data and information available. The new scenario of the projection points to prospects for a pick-up in the annual inflation rate in the months ahead, followed by a slowdown starting with the latter part of 2018. Thus, compared to the previous Inflation Report, the path of the forecasted annual inflation rate has been revised upwards in the short run, mainly due to the relative strengthening of recent and anticipated inflationary effects of supply-side factors, as well as to pressures from fundamentals. The uncertainties and risks surrounding this outlook stem primarily from the fiscal and income policy stance, labour market conditions, as well as from developments in administered prices. Looking at the external environment, relevant are the uncertainties and risks regarding the volatility of international financial markets, the developments in oil and agri-food prices, as well as the pace of economic growth in the euro area and worldwide, also amid the normalisation of the monetary policy stances of the major central banks. Given the current assessments, the information available at present, as well as the new sources of uncertainty, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided to increase the monetary policy rate to 2.25 percent per annum from 2.00 percent per annum; moreover, the NBR Board decided to raise the deposit facility rate to 1.25 percent per annum and the lending (Lombard) facility rate to 3.25 percent per annum. In addition, the NBR Board decided to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board decisions aim to ensure and preserve price stability over the medium term in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth. The NBR Board underlines that the balanced macroeconomic policy mix and progress in structural reforms are of the essence in preserving a stable macroeconomic framework and strengthening the capacity of the Romanian economy to withstand potential adverse developments. The NBR is closely monitoring domestic and external developments and stands ready to use all its available tools with a view to fulfilling its primary objective. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be presented to the public in a press conference on 9 February 2018. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR website on 14 February 2018, at 3:00 p.m. The next monetary policy meeting of the NBR Board is scheduled for 4 April 2018."
Peru,2018-02-08,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR FEBRUARY 2018 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 3.0% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 3.0 percent. This decision takes into account the following factors: Inflation in January continued declining and showed a rate in the lower band of the inflation target range for the third consecutive month due mainly to the reversal of the supply shocks as well as due to a level of economic activity lower than the potential level of growth. Inflation is projected to remain around the lower band of the target range in the first months of 2018 and to converge thereafter to 2.0 percent. Moreover, trend inflation measurements continue decreasing and are expected to remain close to the middle of the target range during this year; Expectations of inflation in 12 months continued decreasing and registered a rate of 2.29 percent in January 2018; Economic activity continues to grow at levels below its potential level of growth, and The world economy continues to show positive indicators, with positive signals in the prices of commodities and in capital flows to the emerging economies, although uncertainty in international financial markets has increased. The Board pays close attention to new data on inflation and inflation determinants to consider the convenience of making additional adjustments in the Central Bank's monetary policy stance should it be necessary. Recent indicators of inflation and activity reflect the following: Inflation in January showed a rate of 0.13 percent, as a result of which the year-to-year inflation rate fell from 1.36 percent in December to 1.25 percent in January. Inflation without food and energy recorded a rate of -0.13 percent, as a result of which the year- to-year rate fell from 2.15 percent in December to 1.97 percent in January, also within the target range. The indicators of business expectations improved in January and continue to be on the optimistic side. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 1.75 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 3.55 percent for the first 15 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 15 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 3.55 percent. The Monetary Program for the month of March will be approved on the Board Meeting of March 8, 2018."
Russia,2018-02-09,"On 9 February 2018, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to cut the key rate by 25 bp to 7.50% per annum. Annual inflation remains sustainably low. Inflation expectations are diminishing progressively. Short-term pro-inflationary risks have abated. Therefore the balance of inflationary and economic risks has shifted slightly towards the risks to economic growth. The uncertainty over the situation in global financial markets has increased. This year annual inflation is much less likely to exceed 4%. In this environment the Bank of Russia will continue to reduce the key rate and may complete the transition from moderately tight to neutral monetary policy in 2018. In making its key rate decision, the Bank of Russia recognised the following factors. Inflation dynamics. Annual inflation remained sustainably low. Permanent factors slow down consumer price growth alongside temporary factors. Furthermore, permanent factors may have stronger effect on inflation than previously estimated. In January 2018, annual consumer price growth declined across all staple goods and services. Food inflation slowed to 0.7% while non-food inflation declined to 2.6%; service prices increased by 3.9%. According to Bank of Russia estimates, most annual inflation indicators reflecting the most sustainable price movements are below 4%. Increased supply in the farm produce market continued to exert downward pressure on food inflation. Most factors associated with the 2017 harvest will cease to have a disinflationary influence in the first half of 2018. At the same time, investment in agriculture and the sector's technological advancement pave the way for a sustainable increase in its production capacity in the medium term. The contribution of the exchange rate dynamics of the latest months to annual inflation slowdown will be exhausted by the end of the first quarter of this year. The slowdown of inflation was conducive to inflation expectation decline which nevertheless remains unstable and uneven. This requires both further decrease in inflation expectations and reduction in their sensitivity to price changes. The slowdown of annual consumer price growth may continue in the first half of 2018. This partially results from last year's high base effect of food inflation. According to the Bank of Russia's forecast, annual inflation will remain somewhat below 4% in 2018 and will hold close to this reading in 2019. Monetary conditions. Monetary conditions were gradually easing in 2017. Interest rate dynamics was a key contributor to easing of monetary conditions. At the same time, real interest rates remain positive promoting savings. Non-price lending conditions have been largely constraining with banks demonstrating conservative approach to screening borrowers and increasing lending on the back of elevated borrowers' risks. A balanced recovery of lending poses no pro-inflationary risks. The key rate decision and the potential for its decrease in the future will contribute to further easing of monetary conditions, thus creating prerequisites for inflation to approach 4% and supporting domestic demand. In the course of transition to neutral monetary policy, the shape of the yield curve will continue to return back to normal. Given the situation, the potential for lowering short-term rates is greater than for long-term ones. Economic activity. The fourth quarter of 2017 saw a slowdown in economic activity. However, some uncertainty remains in the assessments of the reasons behind this slowdown, also due to temporary factors. After decline in November 2017 in December 2017, industrial output resumed monthly growth. Producer sentiment remains relatively high. It will be further supported by higher domestic demand as real wages increase and global economic growth expands. Unemployment does not generate any excessive inflationary pressure. Inflation risks. Short-term pro-inflationary risks have abated. Therefore the balance of inflationary and economic risks has shifted slightly towards the risks to economic growth. The uncertainty over the situation in global financial markets has increased. This year annual inflation is much less likely to exceed 4%. In this environment the Bank of Russia will continue to reduce the key rate and may complete the transition from moderately tight to neutral monetary policy in 2018. The Bank of Russia hardly revised its medium-term risk estimates for inflation. Depending on the situation, a number of factors may cause inflation to deviate from the target both upwards and downwards. They include the dynamics of highly volatile food and oil prices. The fiscal rule will set off the impact of oil market conditions on inflation and domestic economic environment as a whole. At the same time, certain factors generate mostly pro-inflationary risks: they include the developments in the labour market, potential changes in consumer behaviour, and the nature of inflation expectations. In the medium term (in 2019-2020) the risks of inflation's upward deviation from 4% still prevail over deviation below 4%. First, increased structural labour shortage may cause labour productivity growth to considerably lag behind wage growth. Second, inflationary pressure may stem from changes in households' behaviour as the propensity to save becomes much lower. Third, inflation expectations remain elevated and subject to fluctuations caused by movements in prices of certain goods and services and the exchange rate. Besides, the medium-term balance of risks for inflation dynamics will depend on potential budgetary and tariff decisions in 20192020. The Bank of Russia will also monitor risks posed by external factors over the entire forecast horizon. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next rate review meeting on 23 March 2018. The Board decision press release is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time. (% p.a.). The reference to the Press Service is mandatory if you intend to use this material."
Armenia,2018-02-13,"PRESS RELEASE 13.02.2018 At the February 13th of 2018 meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia decided to leave the refinancing rate unchanged, at the level of 6.0%. There was 2.7% inflation in January of 2018, almost as much as the indicator registered in the same month of the previous year, and the 12â€month inflation rate amounted to 2.7% at the end of the month. Moreover, direct and indirect effects of change in tax and customs duties were within the estimation by the CBA. Actual developments in the external environment have largely reflected continued trends for improving global economic growth and persisting inflationary patterns in some commodity markets of the world. In view of such developments, the CBA Board keeps anticipating minor inflationary effects from the external sector, as external demand recovers. The CBA Board notes that economic activity was strong enough in the fourth quarter of 2017, driven primarily by high growths reported in services and industry. High economic activity was concurrent with rapid growth in domestic private demand, which continues to be promoted by expansionary monetary policy and a relatively high growth in lending to the economy by the financial system. Nevertheless, there is still a need for monetary stimulation to secure sustained recovery of demand, especially since additional inflation expectations have rather weakened. Taking the abovementioned into account, the CBA Board finds it reasonable to maintain the current level of monetary conditions. At the same time, the Board believes that, in light of predicted developments, a gradual offsetting of expansionary monetary conditions would be needed in the medium run to fulfil the inflation target. As a result, inflation will continue to gradually increase, floating within the confidence band and stabilizing around the target afterwards. Should there emerge risks to economic growth outlook and to the inflation deviating from its recovery path, the CBA would adjust the monetary policy directions accordingly. Detailed information on setting of the interest rate will be available in Inflation Report (Monetary Policy Program. Q1, 2018), to be published by February 27, 2018.

Thailand,2018-02-14,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 1/2018 Mr. Jaturong Jantarangs. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 14 February 2018 as follows. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 150 percent. In deliberating their policy decision, the Committee assessed that the Thai economy continued to gain further traction, driven by growth in the external sector as well as the gradual improvement in domestic demand. Headline inflation was projected to rise at a gradual pace. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative and conducive to economic growth. Financial stability remained sound overall, but there were pockets of risks that might lead to the build-up of vulnerabilities in the financial system going forward. The Committee viewed that the current accommodative monetary policy stance remained conducive to the continuation of economic growth and should foster the return of headline inflation to target, although the process could take some time. Thus the Committee decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at this meeting. The Thai economy as a whole continued to gain further traction on account of continued improvements in exports of goods and services that were driven by stronger global economic growth. Private consumption continued to expand, especially spending on durable goods, and would be underpinned by government measures. Nevertheless improvement in overall household purchasing power remained gradual partly due to structural issues in the labor market together with elevated household debt. Private investment picked up further with the improved economic outlook, and was projected to continue expanding with additional support from government projects. Meanwhile public expenditure remained an important growth driver despite recent delays in disbursement for investment spending. Nevertheless Thailand's growth outlook was still subject to risks that warranted close monitoring, namely uncertainties pertaining to US economic and foreign trade policies as well as geopolitical risks. Headline inflation was projected to edge up at a gradual pace on the back of the recovery in domestic demand and the increase in oil prices since last year. However demand- pull inflationary pressures remained low. Meanwhile structural changes also contributed to more persistent inflation than in the past. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative and conducive to economic growth with ample liquidity in the financial system as well as low government bond yields and real interest rates. Such conditions allowed financing by the private sector to continue expanding, with recent improvements seen in credits extended to SMEs across business sectors and areas. On exchange rates, the baht experienced higher volatility in the recent period and its movements in the period ahead would likely remain volatile mainly due to uncertainties pertaining to monetary and fiscal policies in major advanced economies. Thus the Committee would closely monitor exchange rate developments as well as impacts on the economy going forward. 2 The Committee viewed that financial stability remained sound but would continue to monitor pockets of risks that might pose vulnerabilities to financial stability in the future. These included, in particular, the search-for-yield behavior in the prolonged low interest rate environment that might lead to underpricing of risks, and the deterioration in debt serviceability of households and SMEs especially those affected by changes in structural factors and business models. Looking ahead. Thailand's growth outlook improved further particularly on the back of external demand while the strength of the domestic demand recovery and inflation developments must be monitored. Hence the Committee viewed that monetary policy should remain accommodative and would stand ready to utilize available policy tools to sustain economic growth while also ensuring financial stability."
Egypt,2018-02-15,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release February 15,,2018 In its meeting held on February 15, 2018, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) main operation by 100 basis points to 1775 percent, 1875 percent, and 1825 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also cut by 100 basis points to 1825 percen. Inflationary pressures have been contained, a consequence of tighter real monetary condition. This has been evident by relatively tame monthly inflation figures, despite being affected by upward adjustments of regulated price. As incoming data continued to confirm the moderation of underlying inflationary pressures, the MPC decided to cut key policy rates by 100 basis point. This remains consistent with tight real monetary conditions; a necessary requirement to achieve the inflation target of 13 percent (Â±3 percent) in 2018 Q4 and single digits thereafte. Annual headline and core inflation rates declined for the sixth consecutive month in January 2018 to record 171 percent and 144 percent, in line with projections, after peaking in July 2017 at 330 percent and 353 percent, respectivel. Headline and core annual inflation rates thereby registered the lowest rates since October 2016 and September 2016, respectivel. Favorable base effects have been accelerating the decline of annual inflation rates since November 201. Meanwhile real GDP growth continued to improve for the fifth consecutive quarter to record 53 percent in December 2017 and 50 percent during 2017, the highest economic growth since 201. The pickup of economic growth was largely boosted by higher net external demand, due to more competitive exchange rates, followed by public domestic demand, which have more than offset lower private domestic deman. Output growth by economic activity was relatively diversified, and 83 percent of which was supplied by the private secto. The pick-up of economic activity coincided with the continued narrowing of the unemployment rate to 113 percent in December 2017, registering the lowest rate since December 201. The MPC closely monitors all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust its stance to achieve its mandate of price stability over the medium ter.

Israel,2018-02-26,"The inflation environment remains below the target, but there has been some increase in inflation expectations for the short and medium terms. In the coming months a temporary decline in the annual inflation rate is expected. The depreciation that occurred in the past month, to the extent it persists, as well as the wage increase in the economy, will support the return of inflation to the target range. Economic activity continues to expand in line with the potential growth rate. Growth in 2017 was more balanced. Against the background of the rapid growth in world trade, there was positive growth in goods exports, despite the appreciation, and services exports increased at a solid pace. In contrast, investment in residential construction has declined for the past three quarters. Labor market data continue to indicate a high level of activity in a tight labor market. Recent indicators support the assessment that the growth of economic activity is continuing in the first quarter of 2018. The improvement in the global economy is solidifying, and forecasts for growth and world trade continue to be revised upward. The correction in global equity markets has halted asof now. In the US, the federal funds rate is expected to continue to increase, while most central banks continue to adopt accommodative monetary policy, but financial markets are pricing in a somewhat less accommodative future policy path. Since the last interest rate decision, the shekel has weakened by 3.1 percent in terms of the effective exchange rate, and by 1.6 percent against the dollar. In January, the Bank of Israel intervened in the foreign exchange market, buying $1.8 billion. Housing market data continue to indicate a slowing of activity. There were declines in home prices according to the last three monthly readings. The Monetary Committee intends to maintain the accommodative policy as long as necessaryin order to entrench the inflation environment within the target range. The Bank of Israel continues to monitor developments in inflation, the real economy,the financial markets, and the global economy, and will act to attain the monetary policy targets in accordance with such developments. For the file of data accompanyingthis notice, click here. Graphs and data (Hebrew). The inflation environment remains low. The CPI for January declined by 0.5 percent, and low inflation is expected in the coming two months as well, in accordance with the seasonal path and due to price reductions initiated by the government (Figure 2 in the attached data file). However, in the past month inflation expectations increased: expectations for the coming year derived from the capital market rose to 0.8 percent, and the average of professional forecasters' projections is similar (Figure 4). There was also an increase in capital market expectations for the medium terms (Figure 5): Second-year forward expectations are around the lower bound of the target range, and third-year forward expectations are within the range. Expectations for longer terms continue to be anchored within the target range. The increase in expected inflation occurred against the background of the depreciation of the shekelin the last month (Figure 6). To the extent that the depreciation will persist, it is expected, together with the impact of wage increases, to support the continued increase in inflation. Since the previous interest rate decision, government bond yields increased in Israeland abroad. The increase in Israel was more moderate than that in the US, so that the yield gap increased (Figure 7). Spreads between corporate bond yields and government bond yields increased slightly but remain very low, similar to the trend worldwide. Economic activity continues to expand at a pace in line with its potential growth rate (Figure 10). Based on the first estimate of fourth quarter National Accounts data, the economy grew in the fourth quarter of 2017 by 3.6 percent (seasonally adjusted, in annual terms). Exports in the fourth quarter grew at a relatively high rate, and with export data from previous quarters being revised upward, it appears that for 2017 overall, growth was more balanced than previously assessed (<b>Figure 11). Exports (excluding diamonds and startup companies) grew by 5.3 percent in 2017. Services exports increased at a rapid rate, but goods exports (excluding diamonds) also increased (by 2.5 percent. Figure 12), against the background of the solid growth in world trade (Figure 18) and despite the appreciation of the shekel. Investment grew moderately, relative to 2017, and there was a sharp decline in investment in residential construction. Indicators of activity in January point to the economy growing at a similar pace in the first quarter of 2018 as well (Figure 13). The labor market remains tight, with continued improvement in various figures: the participation and employment rates increased (Figure 14), the unemployment rate declined, wages increased (though its rate of growth has moderated in recent months. Figure 15), and the ratio of job vacancies to the number of unemployed people is high. Housing market data continue to point to a slowing of activity. The last three monthly readings of home prices showed declines, so that the annual rate of increase moderated considerably (Figure 8). The number of transactions continues to decline due to the prolonged decrease in transactions by people upgrading their homes. New mortgage volume continues to increase slightly, following its extended decline, with a continued slight decrease in interest rates (Figure 9). Global economic data indicate that the improvement is solidifying, and the IMF again revised upward its growth forecasts for major economies and for world trade (Figure 17). The equity market declines stopped a continued string of increases in most markets, and have halted as of now (Figure 19). Most economies continue to adopt accommodative monetary policy, but financial markets are pricing in asomewhat less accommodative future policy path. The US economy is around full employment and is expected to continue to grow at a solid pace in the coming years, against the background of fiscal policy that is expected to be very expansionary, while leading to an increase in the deficit and debt. The Federal Reserve is expected to increase the federal funds target rate at its upcoming meeting, and twice more during 2018. In 2017, the eurozone economy grew by 2.5 percent: the highest rate in the eurozone in the past decade, and the improvement encompasses most of its member countries. The ECB kept the accommodative monetary policy in place and signaled that it is expected to continue. Growth in Japan continues, but inflation is still low and the accommodative policy is expected to remain in place. Improvement in economic activity was also seen in China and other emerging economies. Crude oil prices were volatile after a prolonged increase (Figure 21). The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on March 12, 2018. Thenext decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Monday. April 16, 2018, and will be followed by a press briefing by the Governor."
South Korea,2018-02-27,"Base Rate unchanged at 1., 50% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Board considers that the acceleration in global economic growth has continued. Volatility in the global financial markets has increased substantially, with government bond yields rising and stock prices falling in line mainly with strengthening expectations of monetary policy normalizations in major countries. Looking ahead the Board sees global economic growth as likely to be affected by factors such as the paces of monetary policy normalization in major countries, the directions of the US government's economic policies, and the movements toward spreading trade protectionism. The Board judges that the solid trend of domestic economic growth has continued, as exports are sustaining their buoyancy and consumption and facilities investment have shown favorable movements, although construction investment has declined. The trend of improvement in employment conditions appears to have remained moderate, even though the extent of increase in the number of persons employed accelerated in January owing to temporary factors. Going forward the Board expects domestic economic growth to be generally consistent with the path projected in January. It anticipates that investment will slow, but that the trend of steady increase in consumption will continue, due in large part to improvements in household income conditions, and that exports will also sustain their favorable movements thanks to the buoyancy of the global economy. Consumer price inflation has slowed to the 1% level recently, in consequence mainly of declines in the prices of livestock products and of a reduction in the extent of increase in personal service fees. Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has fallen to the low 1% range, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has remained at the mid-2% level. Looking ahead it is forecast that consumer price inflation, after remaining in the low- to mid- 1% range for some time, will pick up and gradually approach the target level from the second half of this year. Core inflation will also gradually rise. In the domestic financial markets the volatility of price variables has expanded considerably, in reflection of global financial market movements. Long-term market interest rates have risen, stock prices have declined and the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has fallen, after having previously increased. Household lending has shown a higher rate of expansion than in past years, although the amount of its expansion has continued to decline. Housing sales prices have shown low rates of increase overall, but have risen faster in some parts of Seoul and its surrounding areas. Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As it is forecast that inflationary pressures on the demand side will not be high for the time being, while the domestic economy is expected to continue its solid growth, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance. In this process it will judge carefully whether it is necessary to adjust its accommodative monetary policy stance further, while closely checking future economic growth and inflation trends. It will also carefully monitor any changes in the monetary policies of major countries, conditions related to trade with major countries, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks."
Ukraine,2018-03-01,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to hike its key policy rate to 17% per annum, effective from 2 March 2018.The fourth consecutive increase in the key police rate is reasonable as inflation risks do not tend to subside. The hike is aimed at lowering headline inflation to meet the target over the medium term. In January 2018, headline inflation accelerated to 14.1% yoy, exceeding the NBU forecast published in the January Inflation Report. According to preliminary estimates, inflation rate remained high in February. This was primarily due to the faster-than-expected growth in prices for food products and services. Faster growth in fuel prices due to a substantial increase in global oil prices and hryvnia depreciation in the past months contributed as well. In January, core inflation accelerated to 9.8% yoy. This was driven by a number of factors: higher production costs amid further rapid wage growth, hryvnia depreciation over several previous months, and accelerated consumer demand. Monetary policy tightening conducted by the NBU since October 2017 curbed the buildup in inflationary pressure. As expected, higher key policy rate has stimulated growth in bank interest rates and made hryvnia financial instruments more attractive. In particular, this has boosted foreign capital inflows into hryvnia-denominated government securities. It is worth mentioning that short-term capital inflows might, under certain conditions, be quite volatile and pose risks to the external sustainability of the economy. However, the NBU currently assesses these risks as low. An inflow of foreign capital, together with an increase in exporters' foreign currency earnings amid benign global environment favorably affected the supply on interbank FX market. This strengthened the exchange rate of the hryvnia to the US dollar. However, the strengthening of hryvnia against US dollar took place in parallel with the weakening of the latter on the international foreign exchange market. Therefore, the overall movements in the hryvnia exchange rate against the currencies of Ukraine's main trading partners arenot yet conducive to a faster drop in inflation. The NBU believes that the January forecast that inflation will retreat to 8.9% in 2018 and will return to the target in mid-2019 remains relevant. At the same time, the inflation risks the NBU considered when making its policy decision in January still persist. These include:. high vulnerability of the Ukrainian economy as the next tranche under the EFF program with the IMF is further postponedhigh inflation expectations of economic agentsthe rapid growth in consumer demand.When making its last policy decision, the NBU Board said that if there were no clear signs of lowering inflation pressure in the near future, the central bank might tighten its monetary policy further in order to bring inflation back to its mid-term target. In view of the need to offset the influence of these risks and to curb inflation, the NBU has decided to increase the key policy rate to 17% per annum. As a result, the NBU believes that after several policy rate increases, which began in October 2017, the current monetary conditions are sufficiently tight to bring inflation back to its mid-term target, as projected in the January 2018 Inflation Report. However, if fundamental inflation risks increase further, the NBU may resort to further key rate hikes. The next key rate decision, which will be taken in April 2018, will factor in new macroeconomic projections, inflation projections in particular. The NBU Board is convinced that achieving price stability is a precondition for sustainable economic growth. In particular, an improvement in inflation expectations is the main driver for loan interest rates to decrease in the mid-term. The decision to raise the key policy rate to 17% has been approved by NBU Board Key Policy Rate Decision No. 133-D, dated 1 March 2018. The next meeting of the NBU Board on monetary policy issues will be held on 12 April 2018 as scheduled."
Kazakhstan,2018-03-05,"Press-release – 4 The base rate reduced to 9.5% March 5, 2018 Almaty The National Bank has decided to reduce the base rate to the level of 9.5% with a corridor of +/- 1%. The annual inflation continues to decelerate within the target range for 2018. Inflationary expectations demonstrate the decreasing tendency. In the short-term period there are risks that the inflation might undershoot the lower boundary of the target range of 5-7%, however in the medium-term it will remain within the new target range 4-6% for 2019. Considering the favorable tendencies and the positive estimates regarding the development perspectives of the situation in the foreign markets and in the countries-main trade partners, and also the expectations regarding the continuing economic growth of Kazakhstan in 2018-2019, in 2018 the National Bank of Kazakhstan will continue the policy of the gradual reduction of the base rate, yet ensuring maintenance of the monetary conditions. Since the beginning of 2018 the annual inflation has been decelerating faster than it was expected by the National Bank and in February amounted to 6.5%. This dynamics was caused by the weakening of the external inflationary pressures and the growth of the aggregate supply in the domestic market. Low level of the inflation in the countries-main trade partners fosters the decrease of the imported goods prices. Additionally, due to the continuing negative dynamics of the households' real money income, recovery of the domestic consumption is happening at a slower rate, which exerts the disinflationary pressure on the consumer prices. The increase of the inflation's separate components reflects the short-term correction as the result of the last year shocks in the energy market. In January the core inflation excluding the volatile components (fruit and vegetable products, energy, regulated services) has continued the decelerating dynamics and has decreased to 6.1%. The nature of the current year inflationary risks has switched from upward (the risk of overshooting the target range upper boundary) to downward. According to the estimates of the NBK, in the fourth quarter of 2018 the inflation rate may amount to the level lower than 5% (under the lower boundary) as a result of the weak domestic consumer demand and in absence of the shocks in the some goods markets. However, the expected recovery of the households' income due to the low inflation rate will ensure maintaining the new target range 4-6% for 2019. As a result of the observed disinflationary processes in the economy, the inflationary expectations keep the decreasing trend. In January 2018, according to the results of the population survey, the estimate of the expected inflation for the year ahead has decreased to 6.6% from its peak of 7.7% in November 2017. The share of the responders, who believe that in the past year the price of goods has increased with the faster rate than before from 52.1% to 47%, which verifies the continuing improvement of the perception of inflation by the households. In the current year the economic activity continues to demonstrate the strong growth. By the end of January the short-term economic indicator amounted to 104.7%. The economic growth was stipulated by the active production and the world price growth of the energy, recovery of the foreign demand and expansion of the mineral resources production. Due to the decelerating inflation and the gradual path of economy to the sustainable growth, the monetary policy conditions continue tending to the neutrality. In spite of the existing risks of the faster deceleration of the inflation in 2018, the policy regarding the further reduction of base rate ensures the correspondence of the future level of the inflation to the short-term target range and the achievement of the target of 4% by 2020, since the risks have the limited and short-term nature. The next decision on the base rate will be announced on April 16, 2018 at 17:00 Astana time. For more detailed information please contact: +7 (727) 2704 585 e-mail: press@nationalbank.kz."
Malaysia,2018-03-07,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.25 percent. The global economy continues to strengthen. Global trade is showing strong growth momentum. In the advanced economies, rising wages and policy support will provide further impetus to growth. In Asia, growth will be driven by sustained domestic activity and strong external demand. Recent adjustments in the financial markets, though short-lived, indicate that volatility may reemerge. Trade tensions have also risen in the recent period. At this point, risks to the global growth outlook remain balanced, pointing towards continuity in global economic expansion. For Malaysia, the strong growth performance in the fourth quarter of 2017 continued to be anchored by private sector spending. Looking ahead, growth prospects will be sustained by the positive global growth outlook and spillovers from the external sector to the domestic economy. Domestic demand will remain the key driver of growth, underpinned by favourable income and labour market conditions, spending on new and ongoing infrastructure projects and sustained capital investment by firms in the manufacturing and services sectors. With additional impetus from the external sector, growth is expected to remain strong in 2018. Inflation is projected to average lower in 2018, on expectations of a smaller effect from global cost factors. A stronger ringgit exchange rate compared to 2017 will mitigate import costs. Global energy and commodity prices are expected to trend higher in 2018, but at a more moderate pace relative to the previous year. However, the trajectory of headline inflation will be dependent on future global oil prices which remain highly uncertain. Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation, is also projected to moderate due to improving labour productivity and ongoing investments for capacity expansion. The domestic financial markets have been resilient. The broad appreciation of the ringgit in the past year better reflects the economic fundamentals. Banking system liquidity remains sufficient with financial institutions continuing to operate with strong capital and liquidity buffers. The growth of financing to the private sector has been sustained and is supportive of economic activity. At the current level of the OPR, the degree of monetary accommodativeness is consistent with the policy stance to ensure that the domestic economy continues on a steady growth path amid lower inflation. The MPC will continue to monitor and assess the balance of risks surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation. Bank Negara Malaysia 07 March 2018."
Poland,2018-03-07,"Warsaw, 7 March 2018 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 6-7 March 2018 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: â–ª reference rate at 1.50%; â–ª lombard rate at 2.50%; â–ª deposit rate at 0.50%; â–ª rediscount rate at 1.75%. The global economic conditions continue to improve. The euro area data for GDP in 2017 Q4 signal that the economy continues to grow faster than in previous years. This is driven by an improvement in the labour market conditions, good sentiment of economic agents, and stronger world trade growth. In the United States, economic conditions also remain favourable, although GDP growth in 2017 Q4 slowed down slightly. In China, in turn. GDP growth was relatively stable in 2017. Despite the ongoing global recovery, inflation abroad remains moderate, on the back of persistently low domestic inflationary pressure in many countries, and lower than in the previous year global agricultural commodity prices. At the same time, prices of some other commodities, including oil, are higher than a year ago. The European Central Bank keeps interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero, while still purchasing financial assets. The US Federal Reserve, in turn, continues to gradually reduce its balance sheet, signalling further interest rate increases in the future. In Poland, annual GDP growth in 2017 Q4 stood at 5.1%. Growth is still primarily driven by domestic demand, including consumer demand, supported by rising employment and an acceleration in wage growth, disbursement of benefits and very strong consumer sentiment. At the same time, 2017 Q4 saw a marked recovery in investment. The pickup in investment was primarily observed in the public sector, although gross fixed capital formation of enterprises probably increased as well. Growth in economic activity is also supported by strong external demand. Despite the acceleration in economic growth, annual consumer price growth continues to run at a moderate level. At the same time  although wage growth increased inflation net of food and energy prices remains low. The Council became acquainted with the results of the March projection of inflation and GDP, prepared under the assumption of unchanged NBP interest rates. In line with the March projection based on the NECMOD model, there is a 50-percent probability that the annual price growth will be in the range of 1.6-2.5% in 2018 (against 1.6-2.9% in the November 2017 projection), 1.7-3.6% in 2019 (compared to 1.7-3.7%) and 1.9-4.1% in 2020. 1/2 At the same time, the annual GDP growth  according to this projection  will be with a 50-percent probability in the range of 3.5-5.0% in 2018 (against 2.8-4.5% in the November 2017 projection), 2.8-4.8% in 2019 (compared to 2.3-4.3%) and 2.6-4.6% in 2020. In the Council's assessment, current data and the results of the projection indicate a favourable outlook for growth in economic activity in Poland, despite an expected slight slowdown in GDP growth in the coming years. In line with the projection, in the monetary policy transmission horizon inflation will remain close to the inflation target. As a result, the Council judges that the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability. The Council adopted Inflation Report  March 2018."
Turkiye,2018-03-07,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels:. a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate at 9.25 percent and borrowing rate at 7.25 percent,. b) One-week repo rate at 8 percent,. c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, and lending rate at 12.75 percent. Recently released data indicate that economic activity maintains its strength. Domestic demand continues to expand and external demand contributes positively to exports. Current elevated levels of inflation and inflation expectations continue to pose risks on the pricing behavior. Underlying trend indicators display inertia and the core inflation remains elevated. Accordingly, the Committee decided to maintain the tight monetary policy stance. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. Tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained decisively until inflation outlook displays a significant improvement, independent of base effects and temporary factors, and becomes consistent with the targets. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Euroarea,2018-03-08,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We continue to expect them to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases. Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, we confirm that our net asset purchases, at the current monthly pace of â‚¬30 billion, are intended to run until the end of September 2018, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. The Eurosystem will continue to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme for an extended period of time after the end of its net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary. This will contribute both to favourable liquidity conditions and to an appropriate monetary policy stance. Incoming information, including our new staff projections, confirms the strong and broad-based growth momentum in the euro area economy, which is projected to expand in the near term at a somewhat faster pace than previously expected. This outlook for growth confirms our confidence that inflation will converge towards our inflation aim of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. At the same time, measures of underlying inflation remain subdued and have yet to show convincing signs of a sustained upward trend. In this context, the Governing Council will continue to monitor developments in the exchange rate and financial conditions with regard to their possible implications for the inflation outlook. Overall, an ample degree of monetary stimulus remains necessary for underlying inflation pressures to continue to build up and support headline inflation developments over the medium term. This continued monetary support is provided by the net asset purchases, by the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the forthcoming reinvestments, and by our forward guidance on interest rates. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Real GDP increased by 0.6%, quarter on quarter, in the fourth quarter of 2017, after increasing by 0.7% in the third quarter. The latest economic data and survey results indicate continued strong and broad-based growth momentum. Our monetary policy measures, which have facilitated the deleveraging process, continue to underpin domestic demand. Private consumption is supported by rising employment, which is also benefiting from past labour market reforms, and by growing household wealth. Business investment continues to strengthen on the back of very favourable financing conditions, rising corporate profitability and solid demand. In addition, the broad-based global expansion is providing impetus to euro area exports. This assessment is broadly reflected in the March 2018 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. These projections foresee annual real GDP increasing by 2.4% in 2018, 1.9% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020. Compared with the December 2017 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real GDP growth has been revised up for 2018 and remains unchanged for 2019 and 2020. The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook are assessed as broadly balanced. On the one hand, the prevailing positive cyclical momentum could lead to stronger growth in the near term. On the other hand, downside risks continue to relate primarily to global factors, including rising protectionism and developments in foreign exchange and other financial markets. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation decreased to 1.2% in February 2018, from 1.3% in January. This reflected mainly negative base effects in unprocessed food price inflation. Looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for oil, annual rates of headline inflation are likely to hover around 1.5% for the remainder of the year. Looking forward, they are expected to rise gradually over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the continuing economic expansion, the corresponding absorption of economic slack and rising wage growth. This assessment is also broadly reflected in the March 2018 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation at 1.4% in 2018, 1.4% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020. Compared with the December 2017 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for headline HICP inflation has been revised down slightly for 2019 and remains unchanged for 2018 and 2020. Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) continues to expand at a robust pace, with an annual rate of growth of 4.6% in January 2018, unchanged from the previous month, reflecting the impact of the ECB's monetary policy measures and the low opportunity cost of holding the most liquid deposits. Accordingly, the narrow monetary aggregate M1 remained the main contributor to broad money growth, continuing to expand at a solid annual rate. The recovery in the growth of loans to the private sector observed since the beginning of 2014 is progressing. The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations strengthened to 3.4% in January 2018, after 3.1% in December 2017, while the annual growth rate of loans to households remained unchanged at 2.9%. The pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014 continues to significantly support borrowing conditions for firms and households, access to financing â€’ notably for small and medium-sized enterprises â€’ and credit flows across the euro area. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed the need for an ample degree of monetary accommodation to secure a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential and reducing vulnerabilities. The implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up to increase resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost euro area productivity and growth potential. Against the background of overall limited implementation of the 2017 country-specific recommendations, as communicated by the European Commission yesterday, greater reform effort is necessary in the euro area countries. Regarding fiscal policies, the increasingly solid and broad-based expansion calls for rebuilding fiscal buffers. This is particularly important in countries where government debt remains high. All countries would benefit from intensifying efforts towards achieving a more growth-friendly composition of public finances. A full, transparent and consistent implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact and of the macroeconomic imbalance procedure over time and across countries remains essential to increase the resilience of the euro area economy. The Governing Council urges specific and decisive steps to complete the banking union and the capital markets union."
Peru,2018-03-08,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR MARCH 2018 BCRP LOWERED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE TO 2.75% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to lower the monetary policy interest rate to 2.75 percent. This decision takes into account the following factors: Inflation in February continued declining and showed a rate in the lower band of the inflation target range for the fourth consecutive month due mainly to the reversal of the supply shocks and due to a level of economic activity lower than the potential level of growth. Inflation in March is projected to fall below 1.0 percent and to gradually converge thereafter to 2.0 percent. Moreover, trend inflation measurements continue decreasing and are expected to remain close to the middle of the target range during this year; Expectations of inflation in 12 months continued decreasing and registered a rate of 2.19 percent in February 2018; Economic activity continues to grow at levels below its potential level of growth, and The world economy continues to show positive indicators, although uncertainty in international financial markets has increased. The Board pays close attention to new data on inflation and inflation determinants to consider the convenience of making additional adjustments in the Central Bank's monetary policy stance should it be necessary. Recent indicators of inflation and activity reflect the following: Inflation in February showed a rate of 0.25 percent, as a result of which the year-to-year inflation rate fell from 1.25 percent in January to 1.18 percent in February 2018. Inflation without food and energy recorded a rate of 0.14 percent, as a result of which the year-to- year rate remained at 1.97 percent, also within the target range. The indicators of business expectations deteriorated in February, although they continue to be on the optimistic side. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 1.50 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 3.30 percent for the first 15 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 15 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 3.30 percent. The Monetary Program for the month of April will be approved on the Board Meeting of April 12, 2018."
Georgia,2018-03-14,"The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on March 14, 2018 and decided to keep the refinancing rate unchanged at 7.25 percent. Confirming the earlier forecasts, once the temporary factors have mostly petered out, the inflation started decreasing since the beginning of 2018, reaching 2.7 percent in February. According to the current forecasts, other things equal, the inflation will remain close to its target level (3 percent) throughout the year. Despite higher-than-expected economic growth in 2017, the aggregate demand is still below potential, pulling the inflation downwards. At the same time, despite the recent appreciation of the nominal effective exchange rate, the latter still pushes the inflation upwards. As a result, the committee deemed appropriate to maintain the moderately tight monetary policy. The gradual easing of the policy will be considered once the factors pushing inflation upwards are sufficiently weakened. The preliminary estimate of the annual economic growth in January is 4.4 percent. The current forecasts indicate that, similar to 2017, in 2018 the economic activity will remain at a relatively high level, thus narrowing the output gap. The positive trends in the external sector continued in the beginning of 2018, with January showing the high growth rates of goods export and tourism. The remittances from abroad have continued growing as well. However, the goods import growth rate has also increased compared to the last year. Overall, the current forecasts indicate an improvement in the current account deficit in 2018. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all means and instruments at its disposal in order to ensure the price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on May 2, 2018."
Chile,2018-03-20,"P RESS RELEASE Thursday, 20 March 2018 Monetary Policy Meeting * At its monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to hold the monetary policy interest rate at 2.5%, so the intensity of the monetary impulse is unchanged. The decision was adopted by the unanimous vote of the Board members. Internationally, the relevant scenario for the Chilean economy has continued to improve, adjusting to greater prospects for global growth, mainly in the developed world. In the United States, there is also the boost to demand associated with the tax reform approved by Congress. Inflation has remained contained in much of the developed world, although it is worth noting that some countries have revised upwards their forecasts for 2018. In the US, actual and projected data on activity and inflation have driven up the expected Fed funds rate. The discussion on the normalization of the monetary impulse in other developed economies has also taken shape. In the global financial markets, the increase in volatility and the sharp correction in the prices of risky assets in early February stood out. Although financial conditions remain favorable, the main stock markets have not recovered their previous levels. The improved growth outlook has favored the rise of long rates, especially in the US and, to a lesser extent, in other developed countries. In the emerging world, especially in Latin America, the evolution of risk premiums, stock markets, volatility indicators and capital flows to their economies remains positive. Commodity prices have fallen since the last Meeting. The oil price dropped somewhat more than 6%, owing mainly to news pointing to better supply-side conditions. In turn, the copper price, with fluctuations during the period, posted a drop around 2%. However, the two prices are still above their year-ago levels and their averages foreseen at the end of 2017. At home, beyond the turbulence caused by external movements in early February, financial conditions show no major developments since the previous Meeting. With some volatility, the peso/dollar parity and the different multilateral measures ceased to decline, and have accumulated little variation with respect to the last Meeting. The stock market (IPSA) as well as the sovereign spread (5-year CDS) and the corporate spread (CEMBI), with minor setbacks, remain near their best levels ever. In the fixed- income market, interest ratesâ€”nominal and UF-indexedâ€”had limited changes. The same applies to the cost of credit, as volumes have continued to grow at the same pace of recent months. Activity indicators received after the last Meetingâ€”including the revised quarterly National Accounts for the period 2015-2017â€”confirm that the economy performed better than was expected in the second part of 2017, particularly in the non-mining sectors. On the side of final domestic demand, the recovery of investment in the second half of 2017 deserves mention, including that in construction and other works. Consumption showed some acceleration from recent quarters, with increased sales of durables, especially automobiles, which have been stable in the first months of 2018. The real wage bill has continued to grow around 3.5%, in a context in which the annual growth of salaried employment increased again, owing mainly to the dynamism of public employment. The annual expansion of nominal wages fell to 3.4% on average in January 2018. Agents' confidence indicators have remained in optimistic territory. Inflation has performed as expected, remaining around 2% annually for headline inflation and close to 1.5% for its core measure CPIEFE. As has been the trend in recent quarters, the inflationary dynamic has been dominated by the appreciation of the peso over the period. Annual inflation of the goods in the CPIEFE basket is in slightly negative figures, while that of the services component has gradually decreased over the last year and stands near 3%. Inflation expectations showed limited movements. While the short-term expectations have adjusted downward somewhat, at two years they show no big changes from the data analyzed in the last Meeting. The Board's decision considered that both the latest data and the analysis contained in the March Report suggest that the risks for the convergence of inflation to 3% have moderated in the policy horizon, largely due to the implications that the better economic outlook has on the process of closing the capacity gaps. However, the evolution of the exchange rate in the coming months will cause inflation to be lower than expected in December, a situation that the Board will continue to monitor with special care, considering that it might jeopardize the convergence of inflation to the target over the policy horizon. Likewise, the Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the two-year horizon. The minutes of this Monetary Policy Meeting will be published at 8:30 hours of Thursday, 5 April 2018. The next Monetary Policy Meeting will be held over next Wednesday 2 and Thursday 3 May 2018 and the statement thereof will be published that Thursday at 18:00 hours. ___ * The Spanish original prevails."
Colombia,2018-03-20,"The Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica, in its meeting today, decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 4.5% For this decision, the Board mainly took into account the following aspects. In the first two months of 2018, yearly inflation and the average of core inflation indicators fell slightly more than expected, and stood at 3.37% and 3.96%, respectively, in February. In this period, the food and tradable CPI excluding food and regulated items were the groups with the largest decreases in their annual variation. The direct effects that the increase in taxes at the beginning of 2017 had on inflation are fading, and have been reflected in the reduction of inflation. Some of the most indexed and labor-intensive groups such as education and health, exhibited increases well-over the target. Inflation expectations recorded slight changes. Those by analysts to December 2018 and 2019 stand, on average, at 3.35% and 3.28%, respectively. Those embedded in public debt bonds remain above 3.0%. External demand continues to recover, driven by developed economies and by the major emerging economies. The price of the US dollar and the region's risk premia, including Colombia, have been relatively stable. Oil prices remain at levels higher than the averages registered in the last two years. GDP growth for 2017 was 1.8%, higher than projected by the technical staff of the Central Bank (1.6%), and for the last quarter (1.6%), was lower than had been estimated (1.8%). The indicators of economic activity available so far this year suggest that the economy would have continued with a low growth, albeit higher than in 2017. With these results, the technical staff of the Central Bank maintained its growth estimate at 2.7% for 2018. The recovery in external demand, better terms of trade, the impact of the reductions in interest rates, and investment in civil works would support the acceleration of GDP. The upward revision of GDP in 2017 by DANE suggests a degree of under-utilization of installed capacity in the economy somewhat lower than previously estimated. However, the Bank's technical staff considers that it would expand in 2018, given that growth forecasts would be lower than its potential. In 2017, the current account deficit declined more than estimated, standing at 3.3% of GDP. The recovery in external demand, the increase in the price of oil, and the weakness of domestic demand contributed to this adjustment. Based on this information, the Board considered the following factors for its decision. Despite the favorable behavior of the CPI, the inertia in the inflation rate for some items and a less favorable behavior in food inflation could affect expectations and delay the convergence of inflation to its 3.0% target. The prolonged weakness of economic activity, the widening output gap, and uncertainty regarding its pace of recovery. Some indicators suggest that a 4.5% reference interest rate is slightly expansionary. The Board will continue to carefully monitor the behavior of inflation and the forecasts for economic activity and inflation in the country, as well as the international context. Finally, the Board reiterates that the monetary policy will depend on the availability of new information. The decision to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 4.5% was approved by six members of the Board. The remaining Board Member voted for a 25 bp reduction."
Brazil,2018-03-21,"The Copom unanimously decided to reduce the Selic rate by 0.25 percentage point, to 6.50 percent per year. The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario:. The set of indicators of economic activity shows consistent recovery of the Brazilian economy. The global outlook has been favorable, as economies grow worldwide. This has so far contributed to support risk appetite towards emerging economies. The Committee judges that its baseline inflation scenario has evolved in a more benign fashion than expected since the turn of the year. Inflation developments remain favorable, with various measures of underlying inflation running at low levels. This includes the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy. Inflation expectations for 2018 collected by the Focus survey are around 3.6%. Expectations for 2019 and 2020 are around 4.2% and 4.0%, respectively; and. The Copom's inflation projections in the scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the Focus survey stand around 3.8% for 2018, and 4.1% for 2019. This scenario assumes a path for the policy interest rate that ends 2018 at 6.5%, and 2019 at 8.0%. The Committee emphasizes that risks around its baseline scenario remain in both directions. On the one hand, possible propagation through inertial mechanisms of low inflation levels may lead to a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory. On the other hand, frustration of expectations regarding the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy may affect risk premia and increase the path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy. This risk intensifies in the case of a reversal of the current benign global outlook for emerging economies. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the wide array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to reduce the Selic rate by 0.25 percentage point, to 6.50 percent per year. The Committee judges that this decision is consistent with convergence of inflation to target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, which includes 2018 and, with gradually increasing weight, 2019. The Committee judges that economic conditions prescribe accommodative monetary policy, i.e., interest rates below the structural level. The Copom emphasizes that the evolution of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy contributes to the reduction of its structural interest rate. The Committee will continue to reassess estimates of this rate over time. The evolution of the baseline scenario made it appropriate to reduce the Selic rate by 0.25 percentage point at this Copom meeting. Regarding the next meeting, at this time the Copom views an additional moderate monetary easing as appropriate. The Committee judges that this additional stimulus mitigates the risk of delayed convergence of inflation toward the targets. This view regarding the next Copom meeting might change in favor of the interruption of the monetary easing process, if risk mitigation proves unnecessary. Beyond the next meeting, absent relevant additional changes to the baseline scenario and balance of risks, the Copom deems appropriate to interrupt the monetary easing process, with the aim of evaluating next steps, in light of the relevant horizon for monetary policy at that time. The Copom emphasizes that the next steps in the conduct of monetary policy will continue to depend on the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, possible reassessments of the extension of the cycle, and on inflation projections and expectations. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Ilan Goldfajn (Governor). Carlos Viana de Carvalho. Isaac Sidney Menezes Ferreira. MaurÃ­cio Costa de Moura. OtÃ¡vio Ribeiro Damaso. Paulo Sergio Neves de Souza. Reinaldo Le Grazie. Sidnei CorrÃªa Marques and Tiago Couto Berriel."
Philippines,2018-03-21,"At its meeting on monetary policy today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain its policy rate, the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) facility, steady at 3.0 percent. The corresponding interest rates on the overnight lending and deposit facilities were also kept unchanged. The Monetary Board's decision is based on its assessment that while recent inflation outturns show an elevated path in 2018, the latest baseline forecasts continue to show inflation remaining within the inflation target in 2018 and moderating further in 2019. The Monetary Board also considered that prospects for domestic activity continue to be firm on the back of robust domestic demand, strong growth in credit and liquidity, and a sustained recovery in global economic growth. At the same time, the Monetary Board observed that the risks to the inflation outlook remain weighted toward the upside owing mainly to price pressures emanating from pending petitions for adjustments in minimum wages and transportation fares. Nevertheless, non-monetary measures such as institutional arrangements in setting transportation fares and minimum wages, unconditional cash transfers, as well as transport subsidies are expected to help mitigate these inflationary impulses. In addition, the proposed reforms in the rice industry could also help temper price pressures. Meanwhile, the Monetary Board noted that inflation expectations have started to rise and will therefore need to be monitored closely in the coming months. It was also observed that economic growth remains solid enough to absorb some policy tightening if warranted. Given these considerations, the Monetary Board reiterates that it remains watchful against any signs of second-round effects and inflation becoming broader based. The Monetary Board stands firm in its intent to take immediate and appropriate measures to ensure that the monetary policy stance continues to support the BSP's price and financial stability objectives."
United States,2018-03-21,"EDT March 21, 2018 Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate. Job gains have been strong in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low. Recent data suggest that growth rates of household spending and business fixed investment have moderated from their strong fourth-quarter readings. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have continued to run below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation have increased in recent months but remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The economic outlook has strengthened in recent months. The Committee expects that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace in the medium term and labor market conditions will remain strong. Inflation on a 12 month basis is expected to move up in coming months and to stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent - objective over the medium term. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1 1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting - strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This (more) For release at 2 p.m. EDT March 21, 2018 - 2 - assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were Jerome H Powell.

Russia,2018-03-23,"On 23 March 2018, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to cut the key rate by 25 bp to 7.25% per annum. Annual inflation remains sustainably low. Inflation expectations are diminishing progressively. The Bank of Russia forecasts annual inflation to be 3-4% in late 2018 and remain close to 4% in 2019. In this environment the Bank of Russia will continue to reduce the key rate and will complete the transition to neutral monetary policy in 2018. In making its key rate decision, the Bank of Russia recognised the following factors. Inflation dynamics. Annual inflation remains sustainably low. In February 2018 it stood at 2.2%. Inflation remains below 4% longer than expected, allowing for a quicker transition to neutral monetary policy this year. Factors, previously seen as mostly temporary, are becoming more persistent under the influence of the following structural changes. First, investments in agriculture and an increase in its production capacity reduce harvest's dependence on weather conditions and have a restraining influence on food price growth. Second, the implementation of the budget rule lowers the sensitivity of domestic economic conditions, including exchange rate and inflation dynamics, to changes in oil prices. These developments make the stabilisation of inflation at low levels more sustainable and reduce the risks of significant fluctuations. Current consumer price dynamics favour a decrease in inflation expectations of households and businesses, further contributing to keeping inflation at bay. However, households' inflation expectations are still way above the inflation target, still sensitive to the possible increase in prices for certain goods, including food products. The slowdown of annual inflation may continue in the first half of 2018. This partially results from last year's high base effect of food inflation. Inflation will begin to gradually return to the target in the second half of the year, supported by further recovery of domestic demand. The Bank of Russia forecasts annual inflation to be 3-4% in 2018 and close to 4% in 2019. Monetary conditions. Monetary conditions continue to ease. Their disinflationary effect is gradually declining. The interest rate dynamics were a key contributor to easing of monetary conditions. Real interest rates remain positive promoting savings. Non-price lending conditions for legal entities remain mostly constraining with banks still showing conservative approach to screening borrowers and increasing lending. The increase in mortgage and consumer lending does not pose any risks for inflation to rise above 4% so far. The key rate decision and the potential for its decrease in the future will contribute to further easing of monetary conditions, thus supporting domestic demand and creating prerequisites for inflation to approach 4%. Economic activity. Economic growth resumed in early 2018, following the decline due to temporary headwinds in late 2017. In January â€” February, the annual industrial production growth returned to the positive territory. The period also saw a continued growth in investment. The recovery in consumer demand is supported by rising real wages and expanding retail lending. The Bank of Russia's general perceptions of the Russian economy's growth have remained unchanged. The Bank of Russia has slightly raised the oil price in its baseline scenario. However, it has not entailed any significant review of the Russian economy's growth rate in the medium term due to its decreased sensitivity to oil price changes and remaining structural constraints. In 2018-2020. GDP will grow by 1.5-2%, which corresponds to the potential growth rate of the economy. Inflation risks. The Bank of Russia's assessment of inflation risks has not changed significantly, save for the risks posed by the labour market. The dynamics of wages and unemployment create prerequisites for potentially higher inflationary pressure. At the moment, the assessment of the duration and scale of effect of these drivers remains unclear. The Bank of Russia will pay particular attention to the situation in the labour market, including the impact of the dynamics of incomes and wages on consumer behaviour and inflation. The Bank of Russia will also monitor risks posed by external factors, considering the episodes of increased volatility in the global markets on the back of monetary policy normalisation in other countries and growing uncertainty with respect to the trade policy. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next rate review meeting on 27 April 2018. The press release on the Bank of Russia Board decision is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time.

Armenia,2018-03-27,"PRESS RELEASE 27.03.2018 At the March 27th of 2018 meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia (the CBA) decided to leave the refinancing rate unchanged, at the level of 6.0%. There was 0.5% deflation in February of 2018, relative to 0.9% deflation registered in the same month of the previous year, with the 12â€month inflation rate having amounted to 3.3% at the end of the month. The Board of the CBA considers that, in the light of expected external and internal economic developments, the inflation will be maintained within the lower part of the confidence band in the upcoming months, as was predicted. The actual developments in the external sector at the start of the year have been in line with the CBA's forecasts, as the trends for improving global economic growth and persisting inflationary patterns in some commodity markets of the world continued. In view of such developments, the CBA Board keeps anticipating minor inflationary effects from the external sector, as external demand recovers. The CBA Board notes that economic activity in the first quarter of 2018 has somewhat exceeded the expectations, driven by high growths reported in industry, construction and services sectors. Higherâ€thanâ€ anticipated growth rates were observed on the part of domestic demand, which continues to be promoted by expansionary monetary policy and high growth in lending to the economy by the financial system. At the same time, additional inflationary expectations observable since the beginning of the year have significantly mitigated while inflation expectations have generally stabilized. Taking the abovementioned into account, the Board of the CBA finds it reasonable to keep monetary conditions at the current level. At the same time, the Board believes that, in light of predicted developments, a gradual offsetting of expansionary monetary conditions would be needed in the future to fulfil the inflation target. As a result, the 12â€month inflation rate will somehow increase in the forecast horizon, floating within the confidence band and stabilizing around the target. The risks to economic growth outlook and to the inflation deviating from its recovery path are primarily upside as further growth of aggregate demand and economy on the whole is more likely. Should there emerge any risks, the CBA would adjust the monetary policy directions accordingly, in fulfilment of the inflation target in the forecast horizon. Detailed information that underlies the decision on setting of the interest rate will be available in Press Release (Minutes on Interest Rate), to be published by April 10, 2018. Press Service of the Central Bank of Armenia."
Thailand,2018-03-28,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 2/2018 Mr. Jaturong Jantarangs. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 28 March 2018 as follows. The Committee voted 6 to 1 to maintain the policy rate at 150 percent. One member voted to raise the policy rate by 025 percentage point from 150 to 175 percent. In deliberating their policy decision, the Committee assessed that the Thai economy continued to gain further traction and would achieve higher growth than previously assessed in the last quarter, driven by both growth in the external sector and gradual improvements in domestic demand. Headline inflation was projected to gradually rise albeit at a slightly slower pace than previously assessed. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative and conducive to economic growth. Financial stability remained sound overall, but there were pockets of risks that might lead to the build-up of vulnerabilities in the financial system going forward. Most members viewed that the current accommodative monetary policy stance remained conducive to the continuation of economic growth and should foster the return of headline inflation to target, although the process could take some time, and thus decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at this meeting. Nevertheless one member viewed that prolonged monetary accommodation might induce households and businesses to underestimate potential changes in financial conditions, while raising the policy rate at the current juncture would not hinder economic growth going forward. The Thai economy as a whole continued to gain further traction and was expected to achieve higher growth than the previous assessment due particularly to continued improvements in merchandise exports and tourism driven by stronger global economic growth. Private consumption growth remained moderate partly because the economic recovery had yet to benefit household income and employment in a broad-based manner while household debt remained elevated. In the Committee's view, these issues must be addressed through structural policies. Private investment picked up further with the improved economic outlook, and was projected to continue expanding with additional support from government projects. Meanwhile public expenditure would be a driver of growth while there remained risks of delays in budget disbursement. Furthermore Thailand's growth outlook was still subject to external risks that continued to warrant monitoring, including uncertainties pertaining to US economic and foreign trade policies, retaliatory measures from trading partners of the US, and geopolitical risks. Headline inflation was projected to edge up at a gradual pace on the back of the recovery in domestic demand and the increase in oil prices since last year, although the increase would be slower than the previous assessment as fresh food prices declined more than expected. Meanwhile demand-pull inflationary pressures remained low and structural changes contributed to more persistent inflation than in the past. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative and conducive to economic growth with ample liquidity in the financial system as well as low government bond yields and real interest rates. Such conditions allowed financing by the private sector to continue expanding with gradual improvements seen in the amount of credit extended to SMEs. On exchange rates, the baht experienced higher volatility in the recent period and its movements 2 in the period ahead would likely remain volatile mainly due to uncertainties pertaining to monetary, fiscal, and foreign trade policies among major advanced economies. Thus the Committee would closely monitor exchange rate developments as well as impacts on the economy going forward. The Committee viewed that financial stability remained sound but would continue to monitor pockets of risks that might pose vulnerabilities to financial stability in the future. These included, in particular, the search-for-yield behavior in the prolonged low interest rate environment that might lead to underpricing of risks, and the deterioration in debt serviceability of households and SMEs especially those affected by changes in structural factors and business models. Looking ahead. Thailand's growth outlook improved further particularly on the back of external demand while the strength of the domestic demand recovery and inflation developments must be monitored. Hence the Committee viewed that monetary policy should remain accommodative and would stand ready to utilize available policy tools to sustain economic growth while also ensuring financial stability."
South Africa,2018-03-28,"South African Reserve Bank PRESS STATEMENT 28 March 2018 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), the risks to the inflation outlook have subsided somewhat. Inflation outcomes in recent months have remained well within the inflation target band, although this likely represents the low point of the current cycle. While the increase in the value-added tax (VAT) rate to 15% places temporary upside pressure on inflation, this is mitigated by the stronger exchange rate which has contributed to the changing inflation risk profile. The affirmation of South Africa's sovereign rating as â€˜investment grade' and the change of the outlook from negative to stable by Moody's Investors Service has contributed to the recent rand resilience. The domestic growth outlook is more positive but still challenging. Growth in the fourth quarter surprised significantly on the upside, and there are signs of increased business confidence. This is against a backdrop of sustained momentum in the global economy which provides a favourable environment for emerging markets generally. MPC Statement March 28th, 2018 Page 1. MPC Statement March 28th, 2018 Page 1 The year-on-year inflation rate, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas, measured 4.4% in January 2018 before declining to 4.0% in February. Goods price inflation moderated from 3.7% to 3.2% while services price inflation moderated to a seven-year low of 4.9%. The South African Reserve Bank's (SARB) measure of core inflation  which excludes food, fuel and electricity  remained unchanged at 4.1% in February. Year-on-year producer price inflation for final manufactured goods declined marginally to 5.1% in January. The inflation forecast of the SARB has shown a moderate improvement despite the adverse impact of the VAT increase due to be implemented in April. This increase, combined with base effects and other indirect tax increases, implies that the low point of the inflation cycle was reached in the first quarter of 2018, at a forecast average of 4.1%. Headline inflation is expected to average 4.9% in 2018 (unchanged from the previous forecast), 5.2% in 2019 (down from 5.4%), and 5.1% in 2020. A peak of 5.5% is expected by the first quarter of 2019 before the VAT increase falls out of the data. The forecast for core inflation is unchanged at 4.6% for 2018 and is 0.2 percentage points lower, at 4.9%, for 2019. It is expected to remain unchanged at 4.9% in 2020. The main changes in the forecast related to the VAT increase and the exchange rate. The VAT increase is expected to add about 0.6 percentage points to the headline inflation trajectory for the four quarters from the second quarter of 2018, with marginal second-round effects persisting into subsequent quarters. The improved exchange rate has softened the impact of the indirect tax adjustments on the inflation forecast. The implied starting point for the rand is R11.97 against the US dollar compared with R12.90 at the time of the previous MPC meeting. MPC Statement March 28th, 2018 Page 2. MPC Statement March 28th, 2018 Page 2 Inflation expectations, as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research (BER) in the first quarter of 2018, are at a multi-year low, having declined across all groups of respondents. Average expectations for 2018 and 2019 have declined to 5.2% and 5.3% respectively from 5.7% and 5.9% previously, while an average of 5.4% is expected in 2020. The largest adjustment was seen in the business category, with downward revisions of around 1 percentage point in both 2018 and 2019. Five-year inflation expectations declined to 5.3%, their lowest level since they were first surveyed in 2011. Expectations implicit in the break-even inflation rates (i.e. the yield differential between conventional and inflation-linked government bonds) declined across all maturities. While these developments are welcome, the MPC would prefer to see inflation expectations anchored closer to the midpoint of the target band. The global economic outlook has remained favourable amid a relatively synchronised upswing in the advanced economies, although risk and vulnerabilities remain. The global inflation outlook remains benign but is on a moderate upward path. However, the recent trade policy actions by the United States (US) could escalate into a trade war, which could in turn undermine this positive prognosis for growth and push inflation higher. The rand has sustained its recent gains since late last year, and some of the key risks to the outlook have dissipated. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand has appreciated by 4.8% against the US dollar, by 3.2% against the euro, and by 3.5% on a trade-weighted basis. At current levels, the SARB's model assesses the rand to be somewhat overvalued, and further strengthening potential is probably limited. MPC Statement March 28th, 2018 Page 3. MPC Statement March 28th, 2018 Page 3 The rand has reacted positively to domestic political developments in the past months and was given further support following the recent sovereign credit rating announcement. The risk of a significant sell-off of South African government bonds by non-residents has therefore receded for now. Further support for the rand comes from recent dollar weakness. Some widening of the current account deficit is expected over the forecast period as imports increase in line with higher expected investment expenditure and the impact of a stronger rand. A key external risk to the rand remains the possibility of a tighter-than-expected stance of monetary policy in the US in particular. As anticipated, a moderately faster pace of tightening was signalled by the US Federal Open Market Committee, particularly for 2019, and at this stage, further tightening is expected to remain measured in the absence of significant inflation or growth surprises. Significantly higher US fiscal deficits could also elicit a stronger monetary policy response. The pace of monetary policy normalisation in some of the other advanced economies continues to be gradual with a tightening bias. The domestic economic growth outlook for this year is more favourable but remains challenging. This follows an upward revision of historical gross domestic product (GDP) data and a fourth-quarter outcome of 3.1% which surprised on the upside. Following an annual growth rate of 1.3% in 2017, the SARB expects a growth rate of 1.7% for 2018 compared with 1.4% previously. The forecast for 2019 is 1.5%, marginally lower than the previous forecast of 1.6%, while a growth rate of 2.0% is forecast for 2020. At these growth rates, the negative output gap, which measured -1.1% in 2017, is expected to close in 2020. The composite leading MPC Statement March 28th, 2018 Page 4. The composite leading MPC Statement March 28th, 2018 Page 4 business cycle indicator continued its upward trend in January, consistent with the improved outlook. The improved growth outlook is driven primarily by an increase in business and consumer confidence. This is reflected in the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index, which increased markedly in the first quarter of 2018 although it remains below the neutral 50 level. Furthermore, the â€˜expected business conditions' category in the Absa Purchasing Managers' Index surged in February to its highest level since 2001. In this context, growth in gross fixed capital formation is forecast to increase gradually over the forecast period. Consumption expenditure by households is also expected to be positively impacted by the expected increase in consumer confidence, although this is not yet evident in the consumer confidence surveys. In the near term, consumption expenditure is expected to be constrained by the tax increases, the lack of compensation for fiscal drag, weak employment growth as well as subdued growth in credit extension to households. While consumption expenditure is expected to grow at a slightly slower rate in 2018 compared with last year, the trend over the forecast period is moderately stronger than previously expected, reaching 2.1% in 2020. This improvement is also supported by higher expected wealth growth over the longer term. Employment trends remain a concern despite an increase of 102 000 during the past year. The official unemployment rate was slightly higher when compared to the same quarter in 2016 while the number of discouraged job seekers increased markedly. The national Budget presented in February 2018 proposed a faster pace of fiscal consolidation than that indicated in the October Medium Term Budget Policy MPC Statement March 28th, 2018 Page 5. The national Budget presented in February 2018 proposed a faster pace of fiscal consolidation than that indicated in the October Medium Term Budget Policy MPC Statement March 28th, 2018 Page 5 Statement. This revised path is expected to result in a stabilisation of the ratio of government debt to GDP at about 56% over the medium term. The moderately tighter stance is due to an overall cut in budgeted expenditure growth as well as an increase in tax revenues. However, the projected deficits are wider than those proposed in the February 2017 Budget. The outcome of the ongoing public sector wage negotiations will be an important indicator of the sustainability of the fiscal projections and future wage trends. Nominal wage growth appears to be moderating slightly, but upside pressure on inflation from this source is expected to persist. Average wage inflation is expected to decline moderately over the forecast period, from 7.6% in 2017 to 6.8% in 2020, still positive in real terms. Annual food price inflation is no longer seen as a major risk to the inflation outlook. While the continued drought in the Western Cape is likely to adversely affect agricultural production in the region, the direct impact on food prices is expected to be fairly limited. The MPC noted the general improvement in inflation outcomes and the lower inflation expectations. Although the bottom of the inflation cycle has likely been reached, the trajectory of headline inflation is forecast to remain within the target range, with core inflation expected to remain below 5% for most of the forecast period. To the extent that inflation expectations are adaptive, there may be further downward adjustment in these expectations in the coming quarters. As mentioned earlier, the MPC would prefer to see inflation expectations anchored closer to the midpoint of the target band. MPC Statement March 28th, 2018 Page 6. MPC Statement March 28th, 2018 Page 6 In considering the impact of the VAT increase, the approach of the MPC is to look through the first-round effects of this increase and focus on the second-round effects, which are expected to be relatively small. In any event, the policy horizon of the MPC extends beyond the period during which the first-round effects have an impact. The MPC assesses the risks to the inflation forecast to be more or less evenly balanced. Some of the key domestic risks and uncertainties that overshadowed the outlook in recent meetings have abated. The government budget was generally well received, but implementation risks remain. While the recent sovereign ratings outcome was positive for the rand, further sustained appreciation of the local currency is not expected. The exchange rate is currently assessed to be less of a risk to the inflation outlook. However, the rand will remain sensitive to a faster pace of normalisation in the advanced economies, possible heightened global financial market volatility, as well as domestic developments. Although the growth forecast has improved, the outlook remains relatively constrained. Despite the higher levels of consumption expenditure in the latter part of 2017, demand pressures in the economy are not assessed to pose a risk to the inflation outlook. The MPC assesses the risks to the growth forecast to be moderately on the upside. To make an appreciable impact on employment and potential output, the current improved levels of confidence will need to be sustained and translate into higher levels of investment. This can only be achieved through a firm commitment to, and implementation of, credible structural reforms by government. MPC Statement March 28th, 2018 Page 7. MPC Statement March 28th, 2018 Page 7 The MPC was of the view that, in light of the improved inflation outlook and the moderation in risks to the forecast, there was some room to provide further accommodation without undermining the inflation trajectory or the downward trend in inflation expectations. Accordingly, the MPC has decided to reduce the repurchase rate by 25 basis points to 6.5% with effect from 29 March 2018. Four members preferred a reduction while three members preferred an unchanged stance. In this uncertain environment, future policy decisions will be highly data-dependent and sensitive to the assessment of the balance of risks to the outlook. The implied path of policy rates generated by the SARB's Quarterly Projection Model has changed since the previous MPC meeting. Whereas previously two to three increases of 25 basis points each by the end of 2019 were indicated, one increase of 25 basis points is now implied. Two further increases are indicated in 2020. As emphasised previously, the implied path remains a broad policy guide which can and does change in either direction between meetings in response to new developments and changing risks. Therefore, the MPC does not mechanistically respond to changes in the path. Lesetja Kganyago GOVERNOR The next statement of the Monetary Policy Committee will be released on 24 May 2018.

Czech Republic,2018-03-29,"At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank decided unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged. The two-week repo rate thus remains at 0.75%, the discount rate at 0.05% and the Lombard rate at 1.50%.. According to the current forecast, inflation will be above the Czech National Bank's 2% target for the rest of this year and return to it at the start of next year. Following the interest rate increase in February, a further rise in rates at the close of this year at the earliest and especially next year is consistent with the forecast. The Bank Board assessed the risks to the current forecast as being slightly anti-inflationary. Compared to the assumptions of the current forecast, the outlook for growth in foreign economic activity this year and the next has shifted slightly higher. The outlook for euro area producer prices this year has likewise increased. In 2019, by contrast, the producer price outlook is lower. Expectations regarding consumer prices and euro interest rates remain unchanged. The market outlook for oil prices is little changed. The euro-dollar exchange rate is currently expected to remain stable at the present level, which has shifted towards a stronger euro compared to the assumptions of the forecast. Domestic inflation fell further at the start of this year. The fall was only modest in January but more pronounced in February, when inflation dropped slightly below the Czech National Bank's 2% target for the first time in more than a year. In February, inflation was markedly below the central bank's forecast. This was due mainly to lower-than-expected food price inflation. However, core inflation also fell somewhat short of the Czech National Bank's expectations. The growth of the Czech economy accelerated further in 2017 Q4. Its pace was only slightly below the central bank's forecast. This was linked with slightly slower-than-expected growth in household consumption. Nevertheless, its dynamics remain robust due to a strong labour market and ensuing rapid growth in household income. The deviations of the other demand components from the Czech National Bank's forecast were generally insignificant and, moreover, offset each other to a large extent. According to monthly indicators, industrial production and retail sales continued to rise at roughly the same pace in January. Following a slowdown in December, growth in construction output accelerated again. The economic sentiment of both households and corporations remains favourable. These indicators suggest continued robust economic growth at the start of this year. The labour market situation reflects the exceptionally good performance of the Czech economy over the last few years. Employment continued to increase year on year at the close of last year, although its growth moderated in line with the forecast. The long-running decrease in unemployment also continued into early 2018, albeit only to a small degree according to the monthly indicators. This was also in line with the forecast. A shortage of available labour force coupled with high labour demand led to a further sizeable increase in job vacancies to new historical highs. As expected, wage growth accelerated again in late 2017, although its pace in the private sector was slightly lower than the central bank had predicted. To sum up the important facts about recent developments in the Czech economy. GDP growth and wage growth in Q4 were only slightly below the forecast. Inflation was markedly below the Czech National Bank's forecast at the start of this year. The share of unemployed persons has been in line with the forecast so far in Q1."
Egypt,2018-03-29,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release March 29, 2018 In its meeting on March 29, 2018, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) main operation by 100 basis points to 1675 percent, 1775 percent, and 1725 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also cut by 100 basis points to 1725 percen. In its last meeting on February 15, 2018 the MPC began to ease its tight stance on interest rates that successfully managed to tame monthly inflatio. Annual headline and core inflation rates continued to decline to record 144 percent and 119 percent in February 2018, after peaking in July 2017 at 330 percent and 353 percent, respectivel. The headline and core annual inflation rates thereby registerd the lowest since October and April 2016, respectivel. Real GDP growth continued to improve for the fifth consecutive quarter to record 53 percent in December 2017 and 50 percent during 2017, the highest economic growth since 201. This coincided with the narrowing of the unemployment rate to 113 percent in December 2017, the lowest since December 201. The pickup of economic growth was largely boosted by higher net external demand, due to more competitive exchange rates, followed by public domestic demand, which have more than offset lower private domestic deman. Output growth by economic activity was relatively diversified, and continued to be mostly supplied by the private secto. Cutting key policy rates today remains consistent with tight real monetary conditions and with achieving the inflation target of 13 percent (Â±3 percent) in 2018 Q4 and single digits thereafte. Domestic risks surrounding the inflation outlook include the evolution of inflation expectations, the timing and magnitude of potential subsidy-reform measures, as well as demand-side pressure. Risks from the global economy are crude oil price developments and the pace of tightening financial condition. The MPC closely monitors all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust its stance to achieve its mandate of price stability over the medium ter.

Pakistan,2018-03-30,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement March 30, 2018 The latest information since MPC's meeting in January 2018 reveals that the prospects of achieving an eleven-year high growth rate remains strong with average headline inflation within comfortable bounds for FY18 and FY19. This high growth and low inflation outcome has been accompanied by higher current account deficit. Alongwith high fiscal deficit, this could affect medium-term stability of the economy. However recent adjustments stemming from greater exchange rate flexibility, active monetary management as well as visible improvements in exports and remittances are expected to bear fruit for medium-term in terms of sustaining the growth momentum without posing risk to stability. CPI inflation has remained moderate during Jan-Feb FY18, averaging. percent mainly, because of subdued food prices and lower than anticipated increase in house rents. The latter lowered core inflation- non-food-non-energy inflation, from. percent (YoY) in December FY18 to. percent during January and February FY18. This lowering of core inflation is corroborated by successive iterations (including March FY18) of the IBA-SBP consumer confidence surveys, which depict relatively well-anchored inflation expectations. Going forward, sticky core inflation along with moderate outlook of food prices amid abundant grain stocks and the recent increase in policy rate are expected to contain average inflation well below the FY18 target of. percent and close to it for FY19. This assessment takes into account the lagged impact of exchange rate flexibility and its second round effects (specifically through adjustments in fuel prices), demand pressures, and volatile global oil prices. The real sector is progressing well and growth remains on track. Agriculture sector, despite some shortfall in cotton production, is projected to post positive growth for the second consecutive year. Industrial sector has managed demand pressures through improved utilization of existing capacity and continuing additions in installed capacity. Consequently despite late start of sugarcane crushing. LSM posted growth of. percent during Jul-Jan FY18 as compared to. percent during the corresponding period in FY17. Due to transition of fixed investment into additional productive capacity and with favorable trend in global demand. LSM growth is expected to maintain its current momentum in the remaining months of FY18 as well. On the monetary front, relative improvement in financial intermediation, coming from sustained growth of private sector credit (PSC) is leading broad money (M2) growth. Despite small moderation in fixed investment, late start of sugarcane crushing season and lower production of fertilizer amid excess stocks, cumulative PSC flows reached PKR 354 billion during Jul-Feb FY18 as compared to PKR 3 billion during same period in FY17. However there has been deceleration in M2 growth in FY18. This deceleration was more pronounced in recent months due to deteriorating Net Foreign Assets (NFA) of the banking system. Given the favorable economic outlook, growth in PSC credit is expected to maintain its momentum throughout FY18 and well into FY19. Apart from the impact of NFA, the extent of government budgetary borrowing from the banking system would also determine the trend of M2 growth in coming months. Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Improved demand from major trade destinations and the Government's ongoing export package are generating the momentum of growth for Pakistan's exports. During Jul-Feb FY18 exports growth has reached 12. percent as compared to the decline of. percent in the same period last year. Despite the decline in new labor proceeding abroad, workers' remittances have recorded growth of. percent in FY18 so far. However the growth in imports remains high. Even with deceleration during the current year due to higher regulatory duties and exchange rate movements, import growth has remained high during Jul-Feb FY18 compared with the growth in the same period last year. As result, the current account deficit has reached USD 10. billion during Jul-Feb FY18 which is about 50 percent more than it was during the same period in FY17. Although the full impact of recent exchange rate depreciations on exports and imports is going to unfold gradually in the coming months, financing of the high current account deficit is challenging as healthy growth in FDI and higher official inflows were insufficient to finance it completely. Consequently SBP's foreign exchange reserves declined to USD 1.78 billion as of 2 March 2018. Going forward, along with focus on narrowing the current account gap. Government's plans to timely mobilize external inflows, both official and commercial, will play pivotal role in maintaining adequate level of SBP's foreign exchange reserves and anchoring sentiments in the FX markets. Following detailed deliberations, the Monetary Policy Committee is of the view that some time may be allowed for the impact of recent policy developments to unfold and has therefore decided to maintain policy rate at. percent for the next two months.

Nigeria,2018-04-04,"CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO 117 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING OF TUESDAY 3RD AND WEDNESDAY 4TH APRIL, 2018 Background The re-constituted Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) held its maiden meeting, the 260th meeting of the Committee, its first in 2018, on 3rd and 4th of April, 2018 against the backdrop of strengthening global growth and improving domestic economic conditions. The Committee assessed the developments in the global and domestic economic environments during the first quarter of 2018, including the risks to price stability, financial stability, and economic growth in the short-to-medium term. Nine members of the Committee attended the meeting. Global Economic Developments The strong headwinds which confronted the global economy in 2017 showed signs of moderation, giving way to prospects for stronger growth in 2018. Consequently global output is projected to grow by 39 per cent in 2018 from 37 per cent in 2017 on the heels of rebound in investment as a result of improvements in investor confidence, strengthening commodity prices, rising 1 aggregate demand and accommodative monetary policy, especially in some advanced economies. With the sustained recovery in oil prices, aggregate demand is expected to continue to firm up. Growth in the advanced economies is projected at 23 per cent in 2018, and 49 per cent for emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs). The Monetary Policy Committee noted some downside risks to the outlook for global growth to include: continuing normalization of monetary policy in the advanced economies; new US. trade policy; uncertainties associated with the BREXIT negotiations; and rising geo-political tensions in the Middle-East and on the Korean Peninsula. In the advanced and emerging market economies, inflation is projected at 19 and 45 per cent in 2018, respectively. However the broad indication from the IMF is that over the medium to long term, inflation may rise at a modest pace as general economic conditions remain subdued. Asset prices and long-term yields in major financial markets are also on the increase, confirming the possibility of a future rise in the price level. Domestic Output Developments Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) indicate that real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 192 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2017, up from 140 and 072 per cent in the third and second quarters, respectively. The economy grew overall by 083 per cent in 2017. The main drivers of real GDP growth were 2 agriculture (108%), industry (056%) and trade (035%). Non-oil real GDP grew by 145 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with a contraction of 076 per cent in third quarter of 2017, indicating that the economy is gradually returning to a path of sustainable positive growth. The Committee also noted the continuous positive outlook based on the Manufacturing, and Non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which stood at 567 and 572 index points, respectively, in March 2018, indicating expansion for the twelfth and eleventh consecutive months. The Committee believes that effective implementation of the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP) by the Federal Government and quick passage of the 2018 budget will continue to enhance aggregate demand and confidence in the Nigerian economy. Developments in Money and Prices The Committee noted that money supply (M2) grew marginally by 007 per cent in February 2018 (annualised to 042%), in contrast to the provisional growth benchmark of 1029 per cent for 2018. The development in M2 largely reflected growth in net domestic credit (NDC) of 405 per cent (annualised to 2430%), emanating majorly from net credit to government, which grew by 1999 per cent (annualised to 11994%) against the provisional benchmark of 3312 per cent. Credit to the private sector also grew by 149 per cent (annualised to 894%) in February 2018, compared with the 3 provisional annual benchmark of 1488 per cent. Net foreign assets (NFA), contracted by 282 per cent, annualized to 1692 per cent, compared with the provisional benchmark of -2931 per cent. Narrow money (M1), also contracted by 277 per cent (annualised to 1662%). The Committee urged the Federal Government to strongly exercise restraint on domestic borrowing in order to lower the cost of credit to the private sector. The Committee noted that the continued low level of lending by banks remains a constraint to growth of the real sector of the economy. The Committee advised the Management of the CBN to continue to provide the required policy impetus to engender improved credit delivery by the deposit money banks to the economy. Inflationary pressures in the economy continued to moderate with headline inflation (year-on-year) receding for the thirteenth consecutive month to 1433 per cent in February 2018 from 1872 per cent in January 2017. Month-on-month food inflation fell by 133 basis points to 1759 per cent in February 2018, and core inflation also declined marginally by 38 basis points to 1171 per cent during the same period. Money market interest rates reflected liquidity conditions in the banking system as the average inter-bank call rate increased to averagely 1242 per cent in February 2018 from 949 per cent in 4 December 2017. The Open buy back (OBB) rate also increased to 1319 per cent in February 2018 from 846 per cent in December 2017. The movement in the net liquidity position and interest rates reflected the combined effects of OMO auctions, foreign exchange interventions and statutory allocation to state and local governments. The Committee also noted the continuous improvement in the level of external reserves, which stood at US$46699 billion as at March 29, 2018. Market Capitalization (MC) improved by 102 per cent from N1361 trillion on December 29, 2017, to N1499 trillion during the same period. The Committee observed that, while this development may be a reflection of improved investor confidence in the economy, it cautioned that the Management of the Bank should carefully monitor the developments and to establish mechanisms for safeguarding the stability of the foreign exchange market in the event of a sudden capital reversal. The Committee observed the continued rise in oil prices, but acknowledged the inherent volatility in commodity prices and urged the Bank not to relent in building external reserves buffers against any future price downturns and as a means of sustaining investor confidence in the economy. The Committee noted the relative stability in the foreign exchange market, with declining premia across all segments of the market. It observed with satisfaction, the sustained high level of activity at the Investors' and Exporters' (I&E) window of the foreign exchange market. The window continues to attract more investors, thus boosting foreign exchange supply. Consequently total foreign exchange inflow through the central bank increased by 7300 per cent in February 2018, compared with the previous month. This was attributed to the increase in receipt of proceeds from Petroleum Profit Tax (PPT), royalties and crude oil & gas. Total outflow also increased in February 2018 by 1569 per cent, as a result of higher payments for invisibles, interbank transactions as well as JVC cash call payments. Overall Outlook and Risks Forecasts of key macroeconomic indicators give a positive outlook for the Nigerian economy in 2018. This is predicated on the quick passage and effective implementation of the 2018 budget, improved security, foreign exchange market stability as well as favourable crude oil prices. On the downside, the Committee noted the potential impact of the 2019 election-related spending, against the weak backdrop of tax revenue efforts, herdsmen related violence and rising yields in the advanced economies. Indications in the US and the UK point to higher interest rates in the short to medium term. The Considerations of the Committee The Committee noted with satisfaction the gradual return to macroeconomic stability as reflected in the third consecutive quarterly growth in real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2017. It also noted the continued moderation in all measures of inflation as well as sustained stability in the naira exchange rate and urged the Bank to sustain the stability to avoid a mission drift. In particular, the Committee welcomed the narrowing of the exchange rate premium between the BDC segment and the Investors' and Exporters' (I&E) window of the foreign exchange market. Overall the Committee noted that the recovery of the economy was strengthening, in view of the return to growth of the Services Sector. As the fiscal sector continues to settle its outstanding liabilities, it reduces its domestic debt profile, thus increasing the liquidity of the banking system. However the Monetary Policy Committee observed increasing monetization of oil proceeds as evident in the growing FAAC distribution, relative to the 2017 level of disbursements. The Committee urged the Government to initiate strong stabilization programmes and to freeze the growth in its aggregate expenditure and FAAC distributions in order to create savings; needed to stabilize the economy against future oil price related shocks. Notwithstanding the general improvement in macroeconomic conditions, the Committee noted the rather slow pace of moderation in food inflation. It also took note of the potential risk 7 of a pass-through from rising global inflation to domestic prices. Members however, expressed confidence that the tight stance of monetary policy would continue to complement other policies of government in addressing some of the structural issues underlying the stickiness of food prices. The Committee noted that at 14 per cent, the policy rate was tight enough to rein-in current inflationary pressures. The Committee, therefore, reaffirmed its commitment to price stability conducive to sustainable and inclusive growth. The Committee noted with satisfaction the gradual implementation of the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan, in an effort to stimulate economic recovery. In the same vein, the Committee urged quick passage of the 2018 Appropriation Bill by the National Assembly, so as to keep fiscal policy on track and deliver the urgently needed reliefs in terms of employment and growth for the citizenry. The Committee noted the relatively strong balance sheets of the deposit money banks' and the stable outlook. This is in spite of the concentration of non-performing loans in a few sectors, which the Committee observed was satisfactorily being addressed by adequate mechanisms established by the Bank to address the phenomenon. The Committee also noted that as Government pays off its huge contractor debts, a sizeable portion of these non- performing loans will be addressed. The Committee urged the 8 Bank to strengthen its supervisory oversight and early warning systems to promptly identify, monitor compliance with extant prudential regulations, sustain macro-prudential policy and manage emerging vulnerabilities in the banking system. The Committee reiterated the Bank's commitment to delivery of low interest credit as evidenced in its bold steps to adopt unconventional monetary policy to aid credit flow to vulnerable and growth enhancing sectors of the Nigerian economy. The Committee, therefore, enjoined the Bank to continue to support and encourage credit delivery at single digit interest rate through other mechanisms in the interim, while encouraging the banking system to establish frameworks to increase credit delivery to the employment generating sectors of the economy. In consideration of available data and evolving macroeconomic indicators, the Monetary Policy Committee is committed to revisiting its decisions in the short to medium term as the fundamentals evolve. The Committee's Decisions In reaching its decision, the Committee appraised potential policy options in terms of the balance of risks. The Committee also took note of the gains made so far as a result of its earlier decisions; including the stability of the foreign exchange market, the moderation in inflation rate as well as the restoration of economic growth. The launching of the Food Security Council by the Federal Government to improve food sustainability is a step in the 9 right direction. The Committee was concerned about the fiscal distortions associated with absence of buoyancy between GDP growth and tax revenue, and urged the fiscal authorities to deploy appropriate corrective measures to address this phenomenon. The Committee was of the view that further tightening would strengthen the impact of monetary policy on inflation with complementary positive effects on capital flows and exchange rate stability. Nevertheless it could potentially dampen the positive outlook for growth and financial stability. However the Committee is of the view that loosening would strengthen the outlook for growth by stimulating domestic aggregate demand through reduced cost of borrowing. This may, however, lead to a rise in consumer prices, generating exchange rate pressures on the currency in the process. The Committee also believes that loosening could worsen the current account balance through increased importation. On the argument to hold, the Committee believes that key macroeconomic variables have continued to evolve in a positive direction in line with the current stance of macroeconomic policy and should be allowed more time to fully manifest. In consideration of the foregoing, the Committee decided unanimously by a vote of all members present to retain the 10 Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) at 140 per cent alongside all other policy parameters. Consequently the MPC voted unanimously to retain the MPR at 140 per cent; CRR at 225 per cent; Liquidity Ratio at 300 per cent; and Asymmetric corridor at +200 and -500 basis points around the MPR. Thank you for listening. Godwin I Emefiele Governor. Central Bank of Nigeria 4th April, 2018 11."
Romania,2018-04-04,"In its meeting of 4 April 2018, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided:. In January 2018, the annual inflation rate rose significantly to 4.32 percent from 3.32 percent in December 2017, before increasing to 4.72 percent in February, slightly below the forecasted level. The major drivers include the base effects associated with cutting and scrapping a number of indirect taxes and non-tax fees and charges in the year-earlier period, as well as the recent hikes in electricity, natural gas and heating prices, accompanied by costlier fuels. The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate climbed at a faster pace, coming in at 2.8 percent in January and 2.9 percent in February, compared with 2.4 percent last December. Behind the increase stood the gradual build-up of demand-pull and cost-push inflationary pressures, combined with the impact from leu exchange rate movements, which hit services prices in particular. The average annual CPI inflation rate continued to advance up to 1.7 percent in January and 2.1 percent in February from 1.3 percent in December 2017; calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, the annual average stood at 1.6 percent in February, up from 1.1 percent at end-2017. In line with expectations, economic growth lost momentum in 2017 Q4, yet its annual dynamics remained robust at 6.9 percent, after a post-crisis high of 8.8 percent in 2017 Q3. On the demand side, the chief driving force of growth was further household consumption, but its contribution declined, while the positive contribution of gross fixed capital formation was on the rise, notching up to a record high from 2015 onwards. Conversely, net exports had a larger negative contribution to the advance in GDP. On the supply side, economic growth was underpinned by most components, such as services, industry, construction, net taxes. In 2017 as a whole, economic growth picked up to 7 percent, amid the significant increase in domestic demand, but also a rising negative contribution of net exports, which caused inter alia the current account deficit to widen its share in GDP to 3.4%. Statistical data for January 2018 point to still very high levels of the annual dynamics of industrial output as well as economic activity in trade and services, alongside however a slower annual growth rate of the net real wage. Monetary conditions were further less accommodative in 2018 Q1, amid the slight advance in relevant money market rates and the relative stability of the leu exchange rate. During the first two months of 2018, the annual growth rate of credit to the private sector remained at the 2017 Q4 average. The leu-denominated component further widened its share in total credit, to 62.9 percent at end-February 2018 (from a low of 35.6 percent in May 2012). During 2017 as a whole, the nominal dynamics of private sector credit stood at 5.6 percent, i.e. below the annual pace of economic growth, with the degree of financial intermediation thus still diminishing. The latest assessments reconfirm the outlook for the annual inflation rate to pick up further and level off thereafter above the variation band of the target over the very short time horizon, in line with the medium-term forecast in February 2018, which indicates the return of inflation to the upper bound of the variation band towards the end of this year. The uncertainties and risks surrounding the inflation outlook stem mainly from administered prices and volatile prices; they also stem from the fiscal policy stance and labour market conditions. Equally relevant are the developments in the economy and inflation in the euro area and hence the monetary policy stance of the ECB and of central banks in the region. Based on the currently available data, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided to keep unchanged the monetary policy rate at 2.25 percent per annum; moreover, the NBR Board decided to leave unchanged the deposit facility rate at 1.25 percent per annum and the lending (Lombard) facility rate at 3.25 percent per annum. In addition, the NBR Board decided to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board decisions aim to ensure and preserve price stability over the medium term in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth and amid safeguarding financial stability. The NBR Board underlines that the balanced macroeconomic policy mix and progress in structural reforms are of the essence in preserving a stable macroeconomic framework and strengthening the capacity of the Romanian economy to withstand potential adverse developments. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR website on 16 April 2018, at 3:00 p.m. The next monetary policy meeting of the NBR Board is scheduled for 7 May 2018, when a new quarterly Inflation Report is to be examined."
India,2018-04-05,"First Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2018-19 Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) Reserve Bank of India On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation1 at its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 6.0 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains at 5.75 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 6.25 per cent. The decision of the MPC is consistent with the neutral stance of monetary policy in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Assessment 2. Since the MPC's last meeting in February 2018, global economic activity has gathered further momentum, both in advanced and emerging market economies, though financial market volatility and potential trade wars pose a threat to the outlook. Among advanced economies (AEs), the US economy, which ended 2017 on a slightly weak note, appeared to have bounced back in Q1:2018; the unemployment rate remains low with hiring around multi-month highs. In the Euro Area, economic activity remained buoyant, although consumer spending and factory activity slowed down due to the strengthening of the euro, but a consistently falling unemployment rate and elevated consumer confidence continued to underpin the strength of the economy. The Japanese economy registered eight straight quarters of growth till Q4:2017; available data for 2018 point to a slower start to the year with weak machinery orders and an easing manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) in February-March. Economic activity remained robust in emerging market economies (EMEs) in Q1:2018. The Chinese economy started the year on a strong note; retail sales picked up pace indicating robust consumption, while industrial production also registered a strong increase in Q1:2018 on improved mining and manufacturing activity. In Brazil, economic activity is gaining momentum, driven by higher commodity prices. The Russian economy continued to recover in 1 From this resolution onwards, growth in gross domestic product (GDP) will be used as the headline measure of economic activity.2017-18 on February 28, revising India's real gross domestic product (GDP) growth marginally upward to 6.6 per cent from 6.5 per cent in the first advance estimates released on January 5. GDP growth in 2017-18 at 6.6 per cent was lower than 7.1 per cent in 2016-17 and the deceleration was broad-based, but each component revealed intra-year turning points. Private consumption growth  whose contribution to GDP growth in 2017-18 was 68 per cent  moderated in the second half. Goods and services tax (GST) implementation had an adverse, even if transient, effect on urban consumption through loss of output and employment in the labour-intensive unorganised sector. Government expenditure provided sustained support to aggregate demand, with a pick-up in pace in the second half. Gross fixed capital formation turned around in Q2 and accelerated in the second half  markedly so in Q3  reflecting the first signs of a sustained expansion in capital goods production and a modest revival of construction activity. Net exports dragged down aggregate demand in 2017-18 due to a surge in imports and deceleration in exports in Q3, the latter being driven in part by GST- related working capital disruptions. For Q4, high frequency indicators point to a further strengthening of demand conditions. Private consumption seems to be improving on the back of strong growth in domestic air passenger traffic and foreign tourist arrivals, rising sales growth of passenger vehicles and a strong upturn in the production of consumer durables. The growth in sales of two-wheelers and tractors reflects buoyant rural consumption. Capital goods production registered a 19-month high growth in January 2018, indicative of the likely traction in investment demand. Housing loans extended by banks have increased significantly, which is a positive for residential investment. External demand remains a weak link. Merchandise import growth has slowed because of gold imports; simultaneously export growth has also weakened.305.4 million tonnes in 2017-18, up by 1.6 per cent from last year. For the year 2017-18 as a whole, the CSO estimates that value added in industry decelerated in relation to the previous year; in terms of quarterly performance, however, expansion set in by Q2 and was built upon in Q3 and Q4. This was mainly driven by the rebound in manufacturing. The manufacturing PMI remained in an expansionary mode for the eighth consecutive month in March, although there was some moderation in Q4. Assessment of overall business sentiment for manufacturing also improved in Q4 as reflected in the Reserve Bank's Industrial Outlook Survey, driven by increasing output and new orders. Growth of value added in the services sector accelerated through the year, driven by trade, hotels, transport and communication and a significant pick-up in construction activity. Other high frequency indicators of services sector activity such as domestic air passenger traffic, international freight traffic, port traffic and commercial vehicles sales also expanded at a fair pace. The services PMI moved out of contraction and stabilised in March on a renewed increase in new business and strengthening expectations. Retail inflation, measured by the year-on-year change in the CPI, fell from a high of 5.1 per cent in January to 4.4 per cent in February due to a decline in inflation in food and fuel. Excluding the estimated impact of an increase in the house rent allowances (HRA) for central government employees under the 7th central pay commission (CPC), the headline inflation for February was at 4.1 per cent. Food inflation declined by 120 bps in February, pulled down by a sharp decline in vegetable prices, especially of onions and tomatoes, along with continuing deflation in pulses. The fall in prices was also observed in other food components such as eggs, sugar, meat and fish, oils, spices, cereals and milk. In the fuel and light group, inflation in respect of liquefied petroleum gas declined in line with international price movements. Furthermore, the rate of increase in prices of firewood and chips, and dung cake moderated. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel remained unchanged at 5.2 per cent for the third consecutive month in February, after rising from its trough in June 2017. Among its constituents, housing group inflation rose significantly, reflecting the HRA increase for central government employees. Excluding the HRA impact, inflation in this group was estimated markedly lower at 4.4 per cent. Inflation in the transport and communication group increased in February on account of the rise in petroleum product prices and transportation fares. Inflation either eased or remained at a low level in February in other major sub-groups such as household goods and services, recreation and amusement, education, and personal care and effects. Households' inflation expectations, measured by the March 2018 round of the Reserve Bank's survey of households, edged up for both three-month and one-year ahead horizons. Manufacturing firms covered in the Reserve Bank's Industrial Outlook Survey reported input price pressures and an increase in selling prices in Q4:2017-18, which are expected to continue in Q1:2018-19. Manufacturing and services firms polled by PMI also showed a rise in input and output prices in Q4.4. Liquidity in the system moved between surplus and deficit during February-March 2018. From a daily net average surplus of 272 billion during February 1-11, 2018, liquidity moved into deficit during February 12-March 1, reflecting a slowdown in government spending and large tax collections. After turning into surplus during March 2-15, the system moved into deficit again during March 16-22 mainly on account of quarterly advance tax outflows. Anticipating the seasonal tightening of liquidity at the end of March, the Reserve Bank conducted four additional longer tenor (24-31 days) variable rate repo operations aggregating 1 trillion, apart from the regular repo operations. In mid-March, additional liquidity of 1 trillion got released into the system through redemption of Treasury Bills issued under the Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS) in April and May 2017. On the whole, the Reserve Bank injected 60 billion and 213 billion on a net daily average basis in February and March, respectively. The weighted average call rate (WACR) inched closer to the policy repo rate from 12 basis points below the policy rate in January to 7 bps in February, and 5 bps in March. Merchandise export growth decelerated in January and February 2018, pulled down by a slowdown in exports of gems and jewellery, readymade garments and engineering goods. Import growth also moderated in February due to a decline in gold imports, lower growth in non-oil non-gold imports, and contraction in imports of transport equipment, vegetable oils and pulses. As import growth continued to exceed export growth in January-February, the trade deficit widened. The current account deficit increased in Q3:2017-18, primarily on account of the higher trade deficit. Net foreign direct investment moderated in April-January 2017-18 vis- Ã -vis the level a year ago. Foreign portfolio investors made net purchases in 2017-18, despite net sales in the wake of a global sell-off in February. India's foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 424.4 billion on March 30, 2018. Outlook 16. The 6th bi-monthly resolution of 2017-18 in February projected CPI inflation at 5.1 per cent in Q4:2017-18; and in the range of 5.1-5.6 per cent in H1:2018-19 and 4.5-4.6 per cent in H2, including the HRA impact, with risks tilted to the upside. Actual inflation outcomes in January-February averaged 4.8 per cent, largely reflecting the sharp decline in vegetable prices and significant moderation in fuel group inflation. The available information suggests that vegetable prices continued to moderate in March as well. Accordingly, inflation in Q4:2017-18 is now projected at 4.5 per cent. Several factors are likely to influence the inflation outlook. First, with the sharp moderation in food prices in February-March, the inflation trajectory in H1:2018-19 is expected to be lower than the projection in the February statement, despite a likely reversal in food prices in H1. Overall food inflation should remain under check on the assumption of a normal monsoon and effective supply management by the Government. Second, international crude oil prices have become volatile in the recent period, with a distinct hardening bias in the second half of March, even as the increase in shale production was more than expected. This has adversely impacted the outlook for crude oil prices. Third, on current assessment. Indian domestic demand is expected to strengthen during the course of the year. Fourth, the statistical impact of an increase in HRA for central government employees under the 7th CPC will continue till mid-2018, and gradually dissipate thereafter. Taking these factors into consideration, projected CPI inflation for 2018-19 is revised to 4.7-5.1 per cent in H1:2018-19 and 4.4 per cent in H2, including the HRA impact for central government employees, with risks tilted to the upside (Chart 1). Excluding the impact of HRA revisions. CPI inflation is projected at 4.4-4.7 per cent in H1:2018-19 and 4.4 per cent in H2.5 per cent in H1 and 7.3-7.4 per cent in H2.6, 2018. Jose J.

Poland,2018-04-11,"Warsaw, 11 April 2018 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 10-11 April 2018 r. The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged at: â–ª reference rate at 1.50%; â–ª lombard rate at 2.50% â–ª deposit rate at 0.50% â–ª rediscount rate at 1.75% Global economic conditions remain favourable. In the euro area, incoming data signal the continuation of a relatively robust economic growth, despite somewhat weaker corporate sentiment. Economic conditions also remain favourable in the United States, although monthly data point to a temporary slowdown of GDP growth in 2018 Q1. In China, in turn, economic growth continues at a fairly stable pace. Despite the ongoing global recovery, inflation abroad remains moderate on the back of the persistently low domestic inflationary pressure across many countries. In addition, agricultural commodity prices are still lower than a year ago, whereas oil prices have recently slightly increased. The European Central Bank keeps interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero, while still purchasing financial assets. The US Federal Reserve raised interest rates in March and continues to gradually reduce its balance sheet. In Poland, the annual GDP growth in 2018 Q1 was probably close to that recorded in the previous quarter. Economic growth is supported by rising consumption, fuelled by increasing employment and wages, disbursement of benefits and very strong consumer sentiment. At the same time, a marked recovery in investment is observed, benefiting from the increasing absorption of EU funds, a favourable demand outlook and high capacity utilisation. The rise in investment outlays is observed both in public sector  mainly in local government units - and in corporate sector. Favourable economic conditions abroad continue to support domestic activity growth. Despite the relatively high GDP growth and wages rising faster than last year, consumer price growth has declined recently, accompanied by low inflation net of food and energy prices. In the Council's assessment, current data continue to point to a favourable outlook for economic activity growth in Poland, despite the expected slight slowdown in GDP growth in the coming years. In line with the available forecasts, inflation will remain close to the target in the monetary policy transmission horizon. As a result, the Council judges that 1/2 the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability."
South Korea,2018-04-12,"Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period. This press release is the English version of the Bank of Korea's policy statement. In the case of any inconsistency, the original version in Korean will prevail. The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Board considers that the global economy has continued its robust growth. The global financial markets have shown high levels of volatility, with government bond yields and stock prices falling in line mainly with concerns about the worsening trade relations between the US and China. Looking ahead the Board sees global economic growth as likely to be affected by factors such as the movements toward spreading trade protectionism, the paces of monetary policy normalization in major countries, and the directions of the US government's economic policies. The Board judges that the solid trend of domestic economic growth has continued, as exports are sustaining their buoyancy and consumption and facilities investment have shown favorable movements. The recovery in employment conditions has slowed, with the extent of increase in the number of persons employed having lessened. Going forward the Board expects domestic economic growth to be generally consistent with the path projected in January. It anticipates that investment will slow, but that the trend of steady increase in consumption will continue, due in large part to improvements in household income conditions, and that exports will also sustain their favorable movements thanks to the buoyancy of the global economy. Consumer price inflation has continued at the low- to mid-1% level, due mainly to declines in the prices of livestock products and a slowdown in the pace of increase in petroleum product prices. Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has been in the low- to mid-1% range, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has remained at the mid-2% level. Looking ahead it is forecast that consumer price inflation, after remaining in the mid-1% range for some time, will pick up and gradually approach the target level from the second half of this year. For the year overall consumer price inflation is expected to be slightly below the level projected in January (1.7%). Core inflation will also gradually rise. The domestic financial markets have shown somewhat high volatility, in reflection of global financial market movements. Long-term market interest rates have fallen under the effects chiefly of changes in government bond yields in major countries. Stock prices and the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate have fluctuated considerably in line mainly with concerns about spreading trade protectionism and with the decline in risks related to North Korea. Household lending has shown a higher rate of expansion than in past years, although the amount of its expansion has continued to decline. The paces of increase in housing sales prices have slowed, especially in some parts of Seoul and its surrounding areas. Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As it is forecast that inflationary pressures on the demand side will not be high for the time being, while the domestic economy is expected to continue its solid growth, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance. In this process it will judge carefully whether it is necessary to adjust its accommodative monetary policy stance further, while closely checking future economic growth and inflation trends. It will also carefully monitor conditions related to trade with major countries, any changes in the monetary policies of major countries, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks."
Peru,2018-04-12,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR APRIL 2018 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 2.75% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 2.75 percent. This decision takes into account the following factors: Inflation in March continued declining for five consecutive months and, as anticipated, showed a rate below the lower band of the inflation target range (1.0 percent). This is explained mainly by the reversal of the supply shocks and by a level of economic activity that is lower than the potential level of growth. The YoY inflation rate is projected to return to be within the target range in the second quarter and to gradually converge thereafter to 2.0 percent by the end of the year. Moreover, trend inflation measurements showed levels close to the midpoint of the target range; Expectations of inflation in 12 months continued decreasing and registered a rate of 2.18 percent in March 2018; Economic activity continues to grow at levels below its potential level of growth, amid a context of low inflation, and The world economy continues to show positive indicators, although uncertainty in international financial markets has increased. The Board pays close attention to new data on inflation and inflation determinants to consider the convenience of making additional adjustments in the Central Bank's monetary policy stance should it be necessary. Recent indicators of inflation and activity reflect the following: Inflation in March showed a rate of 0.49 percent, as a result of which the YoY inflation rate fell from 1.18 percent in February to 0.36 percent in 2018. Inflation without food and energy recorded a rate of 0.85 percent, as a result of which the YoY rate increased from 1.97 percent in February to 1.99 percent in March, within the target range. Most indicators of business expectations deteriorated in March, although they continue to be on the optimistic side. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 1.50 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 3.30 percent for the first 15 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 15 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 3.30 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for the month of May on its Meeting of May 10, 2018."
Ukraine,2018-04-12,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to keep its key policy rate at 17.0%. After four hikes of the key policy rate, the current monetary conditions are sufficiently tight to bring inflation back to its mid-term target. In March, headline inflation continued to slow and stood at 13.2% yoy. At the same time, inflation exceeded the NBU's targets. Core inflation was also elevated (9.4% yoy). Persisting rapid growth in food prices was the main reason behind the high inflation readings. This was due to a pickup in exports of food products while output of some agricultural goods decreased. Continued growth in production costs, particularly labor costs, also contributed to the inflationary pressure. Consumer demand recovering fast on the back of improved social standards affected prices as well. Respectively, inflation expectations of different economic agents remained high. Alongside, the NBU's tight monetary policy restrained inflationary pressure, in particular via the exchange rate channel. The previous key policy rate hikes have expectedly made hryvnia financial instruments more attractive, which encouraged foreign capital inflows. Coupled with an increase in exporters' foreign currency revenues, this has determined an appreciation of the hryvnia exchange rate since late January 2018. The strengthening of the hryvnia, both against the US dollar and the currencies of Ukraine's trading partners, was mainly reflected in the prices of fuel and imported goods, and is expected to have a positive influence on future inflation expectations. When the supply of foreign currency exceeded the demand, the NBU conducted foreign exchange interventions to replenish international reserves. Increasing international reserves enhances the NBU's potential of maintaining the macroeconomic stability (parti-cularly in case of capital flows reversal) and meeting the inflation targets in the medium term. The NBU's headline inflation forecast remains the same: headline inflation will decline and return to the target range in mid-2019. In 2018, inflation will decelerate gradually to 8.9% in December, albeit remaining above the target. On the one hand, the hryvnia appreciation in the first quarter will curb price growth, primarily for non-food goods, and will thus contribute to core inflation declining faster than forecasted in January. Moreover, previous decisions to hike the key policy rate will continue to impact deposit interest rates of commercial banks, thus restraining inflation. On the other hand, inflationary pressure will be maintained by a higher-than-expected growth in food prices amid increased exports and stronger consumer demand driven by higher household income. Further, inflation will decrease thanks to the continued tight monetary policy, a rise in supply of food products, and a deceleration in imported inflation. As a result, inflation will return to its target range in the middle of 2019 to make 5.8% by the end of the year. In 2020, inflation will slow to 5.0%, thus hitting the central point of the target range (5.0% Â± 1 pp). The NBU has made no change to its economic growth projections for 20182020. The Ukrainian economy grew by 2.5% in 2017, exceeding the NBU's expectations. The economic growth was fostered by the expansion of domestic consumer demand and high investment activity. Same as before, the NBU forecasts real GDP growth to accelerate further to 3.4% in 2018. Private consumption will remain the main driver of economic growth. First, real wages will continue increasing at a fast pace, spurred by intensive labor migration. Second, the fiscal policy is easing on the back of higher social standards and other factors. Additionally, companies will continue to invest actively. Real GDP growth is projected to slow to 2.9% in 2019  2020. This will be due to fiscal easing effects wearing off and the central bank conducting a reasonably tight monetary policy to bring inflation back to the target. However, economic growth could be higher if more decisive action is taken to implement structural reforms. Exports are expected to rise further, driven by favorable terms of trade, a bumper crop, and Ukrainian companies gaining more access to external markets. Nevertheless, import growth is expected to outperform that of exports, as domestic consumer and investment demand expands and the real effective exchange rate gradually strengthens. This will widen the current account deficit moderately, from 1.9% of GDP in 2017 to 2.6% of GDP in 2020. The widening of trade deficit will be partly offset by a rise in remittances on the back of a further increase in the number of labor migrants, resulting, among other things, from eased employment conditions in neighboring countries. A key assumption of the above scenario is continuation of carrying out structural reforms and disbursing funding from the International Monetary Fund. This will in turn allow Ukraine to receive official financing from other institutions and to have access to international capital markets over the forecast horizon. In 2018, the NBU expects that Ukraine will receive about USD 2 billion in IMF loans, as well as loans from the European Union and the World Bank. This will push up international reserves to USD 21.6 billion in late 2018. However, in 20192020, the balance of payments is expected to run a deficit and international reserves will decrease slightly amid peak repayments on external public debt. The NBU believes that the main risk to the said macroeconomic forecast is that there may be no progress in implementing structural reforms, which is required for maintaining macroeconomic stability and receiving loans from the IMF. Any delays in taking the required steps to revive cooperation with Ukraine's official lenders narrows the country's opportunities to receive financing required for making public debt repayments, which will peak in 2018-2020. Therefore, the NBU deems that stepping up efforts to revive cooperation with the IMF is critical to maintaining macrofinancial stability in Ukraine. Another risk is that the government may ease its fiscal policy. In particular, further growth in social spending at a pace higher than that of labor productivity may increase inflationary pressures. Global risks of large-scale trade wars have risen significantly, which could cause dramatic fluctuations in global commodity prices, restrict access to external markets for Ukrainian exporters, and consequently, decrease foreign exchange earnings. A reversal in the favorable trends that have persisted in the global economy since early 2016 could have negative implications for the Ukrainian economy, which remains vulnerable to changes in external conditions. Taking into account an updated macroeconomic forecast and the assessment of the above risks, the NBU Board believes that current monetary conditions are tight enough to reduce inflation in the mid-term. In this light, the NBU Board has decided to keep its key policy rate at 17.0% per annum. However, if underlying inflation risks increase further, the NBU may raise the key policy rate again in order to bring inflation back to its mid-term target. As before, the central bank will seek to strike a balance between the need to reduce inflation and to minimize short-term negative consequences for economic growth and a resumption of lending. Delivering price stability and improving inflation expectations are regarded as the fundamental prerequisites for a fall in loan rates, a recovery in lending, and sustainable economic growth in the mid-term. The decision to maintain the key policy rate at 17.0% is approved by NBU Board Policy Rate Decision No. 204-D, dated 12 April 2018. A new detailed macroeconomic forecast will be published in the central bank's Inflation Report on 19 April 2018. The summary of the discussions by Monetary Policy Committee members that preceded this decision will be published on 23 April 2018. The next monetary policy meeting of the NBU Board will be held on 24 May 2018, as scheduled."
Israel,2018-04-16,"The inflation environment remains below the target, although there are continued indications of some increase in it. In February and March, the CPI increased by a rate slightlyhigher than forecast, but expectations and most forecasts for one year remain below the target, while expectations for the medium and long terms are anchored within the target range. According to indicators of economic activity, it may be assessed that in the first quarter, the economy continued to grow at a solid pace, perhaps even higher than the potential growth rate. Exports are increasing, driven by services exports. The labor market remains tight, and the downward trend in the unemployment rate continues. Wages are continuing to increase, though at a rate that is lowerthan in the past. The data and forecasts regarding the global economy indicate that the improvement is becoming entrenched, but there are signs of a decline in momentum, and the risks to continued growth are increasing. Concerns over a 'trade war' have increased, as have geopolitical risks. The Federal Reserve increased the federal funds rate, as expected, and is expected to raise it twice more this year. The exchange rate has not changed significantly since the last interest rate decision. At the beginning of the period, the shekel strengthened by about 2 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, and subsequently there was a depreciation by a similar rate. Housing market data continue to indicate a slowing of activity. The decline in the number of transactions continued, and in the past five months, home prices have declined by 2.4 percent. At the same time, there has been a significant decline in the number of building starts. TheMonetary Committee intends to maintain the accommodative policy as long as necessary in order to entrench the inflation environment within the target range. The Bank of Israel continues to monitor developments in inflation, the real economy, the financial markets, and the global economy,and will act to attain the monetary policy targets in accordance with such developments. For the file of data accompanying this notice, click here. Graphs and data (Hebrew). The inflation environment remains below the target, though some increase in it is apparent. The Consumer Price Index increased in February and March by a rate slightly higher than forecast (Figure 1 in the attached data file), and over the past 12 months, inflation was 0.2 percent. Inflation in nontradable goods prices continues to decline, while the inflation rate of tradable goods prices is becoming less negative (Figure 3). Since the previous interest rate decision, there has been a mixed trend in one-year inflation expectations from various sources, though they all remain below the target (Figure 4). Medium-term expectations derived from the capital market are stable (Figure 5), with second-year forward expectations slightly above the lower bound of the target range, and medium- and long-term expectations anchored within the range. Since the previous interest rate decision, there has been no significant change in the exchange rate. The shekel strengthened by 2 percent at the beginning of the period, and weakened by a similar amount thereafter (Figure 6). Since the previous interest rate decision, yields on government bonds in Israel and abroad have declined, and the spread between the nominal yield on 10-year Israeli government bonds and the yield on similar bonds in the US remained stable (Figure 7). The real yield spreads between corporateand government bonds continued to increase moderately, but remain very low (Figure 8). Economic activity continues to expand at a solid pace, which may even be higher than the potential growth rate (Figure 12). According to the second estimate of National Accounts data for the fourth quarter of 2017, the economy grew in the fourth quarter by 4.1 percent (seasonally adjusted, in annual terms). Indicators of activity in recent months permit the assessment that the growth rate in the first quarter of 2018 was similar. This can be seen in, for example, the Composite State of the Economy index, which increased by 0.4 percent in March (Figure 13), and the initial findings of the Companies Survey (Figure 14). Services exports are leading the growth of exports, but there has also been a slight improvement in goods exports. The labor market remains tight. The unemployment rate remains very low, and theparticipation rate and the employment rate remained at record highs (Figure 15); wages continue to increase, although there was some moderation in the rate of increase in recent months (Figure 16); and the ratio of job vacancies to unemployed persons is high, although growth of the job vacancy rate is moderating. Housing market data continue to indicate a slowdown in activity. The increase in home prices has halted, and there was a decline of 2.4 percent in home prices in the last five months for which data have been published (Figure 9). The volume of transactions continues to decline, particularly transactions made by those upgrading their homes. During the course of 2017, there were declines in building starts and in building completions, though in the second half of the year there was an increase in building permits (Figure 10). Mortgage volume increased slightly after a prolonged decline, with a slight decreasein mortgage interest rates (Figure 11). Data on the global economy indicate that the improvement is being entrenched. The OECD revised its growth forecast for the major economies upward, mainly due to the fiscal expansion in the US and the continued growth in global demand (Figure 17). However, various indices point to uncertainty, a weakening of momentum, and increased risk. There are growing concerns of a 'trade war', although the measures adopted thus far have a limited effect, and the sides are apparently trying to reach understandings. Geopolitical tensions have also increased. Tightening of financial conditions in the US pose further risk to the global economy. There were declines in equity markets, accompanied by high volatility (Figure 22). Most major central banks are continuing with accommodative monetary policies, and during the reviewed period, therewas a slight increase in inflation, but it remains below the central bank targets (Figure 21). The US economy is close to full employment, and is expected to continue its strong growth against the background of the expansionary fiscal policy decided upon by the administration in recent months, which is expected to also lead to an increase in the deficit and in the debt. The Federal Reserve increased the federal funds rate as expected, by 25 basis points, in its most recent decision, and is expected to increase the rate twice more during 2018. In the eurozone, the relatively rapid growth rate continues. The ECB continued with its accommodative monetary policy. The expansion of the Japanese economy is continuing for the ninth consecutive quarter. Economic activity improvedin emerging economies as well, but China was particularly impacted by uncertainty regarding the 'trade war'. The price of oil resumed its increase against the background of increased demand and geopolitical risks (Figure 23). The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on April 30, 2018. The next decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Monday. May 28, 2018."
Kazakhstan,2018-04-16,"Press-release – 7 The base rate reduced to 9.25% April 16, 2018 Almaty The National Bank of Kazakhstan has decided to reduce the base rate to the level of 9.25% with a corridor of +/-1%. The National Bank confirms its estimates regarding the continuing deceleration trend of the inflation until the end of the current year and during the next one. The inflationary expectations have continued to decrease. In spite of the observed volatility in the Russian stock and FX markets, the medium-term influence of the fundamental factors of the external sector is estimated as positive. According to the estimates of the National Bank, if the current dynamics of the macroeconomic indicators persist, the inflation rate will remain within the target corridor of 5-7% in 2018. In March the annual inflation rate has amounted to 6.6%. The growth of the production costs, a certain increase of the import costs under the influence of the price growth in the world markets and the emerging increase of the domestic demand among the households remain to be the main inflationary factors. The inflationary expectations of the households continued their gradual decrease. The results of the households' survey show that the expected inflation rate for a year ahead has decreased from 7.1% in December 2017 to 5.8% in March of the current year, reaching the historical minimum since the beginning of 2016. The indicators of the perceived inflation in March have remained on the same level as in February. The share of responders, who believe that in the past year the prices of goods had been increasing more rapidly than before, has amounted to 49% (52.1% in December 2017). The economic activity continues to demonstrate the positive dynamics. In January-February of 2018 the short-term economic indicator has increased by 5.2% in the annual terms. The positive growth rates in mining (crude oil and iron ore production increase) and mechanical manufacturing industries (growth in metallurgy, food production and in engineering), agriculture, trade and transportation industries persist. However, the decrease in the building industry by 4.5% is being observed. The growth rate of the fixed capital investments in January-February of 2018 has amounted to 54.4%. The situation in the foreign markets remains favorable for Kazakhstan. The dynamics of the external fundamental factors has not changed since the period of previous decision on the base rate. Since the beginning of the year the oil prices have been formed at the level above 65 US dollars per barrel. The inflation rates in the countries  main trade partners are evaluated as moderate. The influence of the risks coming from the countries  main trade partners, mostly, the Russian Federation, which have become a reason for the short-term volatility in the domestic FX market in the past few days, is assessed as short-term and moderate. That is why the National Bank does not consider it necessary to tighten the monetary policy conditions as a response to tenge depreciation. The monetary policy conditions continue to tend to neutrality in influencing the economy, keeping a balance between maintaining the price stability and promoting the attainment of the economic growth rates close to its potential level. Along with that the National Bank of Kazakhstan will continue the policy of the gradual reduction of the base rate, securing the maintenance of the neutral monetary conditions. The next decision on the base rate will be announced on June 4, 2018 at 17:00 Astana time."
Turkiye,2018-04-25,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term interest rates at the following levels:. a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate has been kept at 9.25 percent and borrowing rate has been kept at 7.25 percent,. b) One-week repo rate has been kept at 8 percent,. c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent, while lending rate has been increased from 12.75 percent to 13.5 percent. Recently released data indicate that economic activity maintains its strength. Domestic demand continues to expand and external demand contributes positively to exports. Current elevated levels of inflation and inflation expectations continue to pose risks on the pricing behavior. Upside movements in import prices have increased such risks. Accordingly, the Committee decided to implement a measured monetary tightening to support price stability. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. Tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained decisively until inflation outlook displays a significant improvement, independent of base effects and temporary factors, and becomes consistent with the targets. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Euroarea,2018-04-26,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We continue to expect them to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases. Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, we confirm that our net asset purchases, at the current monthly pace of â‚¬30 billion, are intended to run until the end of September 2018, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. The Eurosystem will continue to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme for an extended period of time after the end of its net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary. This will contribute both to favourable liquidity conditions and to an appropriate monetary policy stance. Following several quarters of higher than expected growth, incoming information since our meeting in early March points towards some moderation, while remaining consistent with a solid and broad-based expansion of the euro area economy. The underlying strength of the euro area economy continues to support our confidence that inflation will converge towards our inflation aim of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. At the same time, measures of underlying inflation remain subdued and have yet to show convincing signs of a sustained upward trend. In this context, the Governing Council will continue to monitor developments in the exchange rate and other financial conditions with regard to their possible implications for the inflation outlook. Overall, an ample degree of monetary stimulus remains necessary for underlying inflation pressures to continue to build up and support headline inflation developments over the medium term. This continued monetary support is provided by the net asset purchases, by the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the ongoing and forthcoming reinvestments, and by our forward guidance on interest rates. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Real GDP increased by 0.7%, quarter on quarter, in the fourth quarter of 2017, following similar growth in the previous quarter. This resulted in an average annual growth rate of 2.4% in 2017  the highest since 2007. The latest economic indicators suggest some moderation in the pace of growth since the start of the year. This moderation may in part reflect a pull-back from the high pace of growth observed at the end of last year, while temporary factors may also be at work. Overall, however, growth is expected to remain solid and broad-based. Our monetary policy measures, which have facilitated the deleveraging process, should continue to underpin domestic demand. Private consumption is supported by ongoing employment gains, which, in turn, partly reflect past labour market reforms, and by growing household wealth. Business investment continues to strengthen on the back of very favourable financing conditions, rising corporate profitability and solid demand. In addition, the broad-based global expansion is providing impetus to euro area exports. The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain broadly balanced. However, risks related to global factors, including the threat of increased protectionism, have become more prominent. Euro area annual HICP inflation increased to 1.3% in March 2018, from 1.1% in February. On the basis of current futures prices for oil, annual rates of headline inflation are likely to hover around 1.5% for the remainder of the year. Looking ahead, they are expected to rise gradually over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the continuing economic expansion, the corresponding absorption of economic slack and rising wage growth. Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) continues to expand at a robust pace, with an annual growth rate of 4.2% in February 2018, slightly below the narrow range observed since mid-2015. M3 growth continues to reflect the impact of the ECB's monetary policy measures and the low opportunity cost of holding the most liquid deposits. Accordingly, the narrow monetary aggregate M1 remained the main contributor to broad money growth, continuing to expand at a solid annual rate. The recovery in the growth of loans to the private sector observed since the beginning of 2014 is proceeding. The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations stood at 3.1% in February 2018, after 3.4% in January and 3.1% in December 2017, while the annual growth rate of loans to households remained unchanged at 2.9%. The euro area bank lending survey for the first quarter of 2018 indicates that loan growth continues to be supported by increasing demand across all loan categories and a further easing in overall bank lending conditions for loans to enterprises and loans for house purchase. The pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014 continues to significantly support borrowing conditions for firms and households, access to financing â€’ notably for small and medium-sized enterprises â€’ and credit flows across the euro area. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed the need for an ample degree of monetary accommodation to secure a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential and reducing vulnerabilities. The implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up to increase resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost euro area productivity and growth potential. Against the background of overall limited implementation of the 2017 country-specific recommendations, greater reform effort is necessary in euro area countries. Regarding fiscal policies, the ongoing broad-based expansion calls for rebuilding fiscal buffers. This is particularly important in countries where government debt remains high. All countries would benefit from intensifying efforts towards achieving a more growth-friendly composition of public finances. A full, transparent and consistent implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact and of the macroeconomic imbalance procedure over time and across countries remains essential to increase the resilience of the euro area economy. Improving the functioning of Economic and Monetary Union remains a priority. The Governing Council urges specific and decisive steps to complete the banking union and the capital markets union."
Colombia,2018-04-27,"The Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica, in its meeting today, decided to reduce the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp, placing it at 4.25%. For this decision, the Board mainly took into account the following aspects. In March, yearly inflation and the average of core inflation indicators once again fell more than expected, standing at 3.14% and 3.64%, respectively. This time, the slowdown of the CPI excluding food and of other core inflation indicators explained the slower pace of increase of consumer prices. The reversal of transitory shocks that took place in 2017, the appreciation of the peso, and a broad food supply, explain the fall in inflation recorded in the quarter. Inflation expectations have reduced. Those by analysts to December 2018 and 2019 stand, on average, at 3.37% and 3.16%, respectively. Those derived from public debt bonds to 2, 3, and 5 years, stand between 3.0% and 3.3%. External demand continues to recover, driven by developed economies and by the major emerging economies. Oil prices increased again, surpassing the averages registered in the last two years. The increase in the country's terms of trade and a better dynamics expected from external demand would continue favoring the recovery of the country's external income. The economic activity indicators available so far this year suggest that the economy would have continued with a low growth, albeit higher than in 2017. With these results, the technical staff of the Central Bank maintained its growth estimate for 2018 at 2.7%. Recovery in external demand, better terms of trade, the effect of the reductions in interest rates, and investment in civil works would explain the acceleration of GDP. However, the under-utilization of the productive capacity would be expanded in 2018. The preliminary estimate of the technical staff for GDP growth in 2019 is 3.7%. The forecasts by the Central Bank's technical staff suggest a slight closing of the current account deficit as a share of GDP. Based on this information, the Board considered the following factors for its decision. Weakness of the economic activity and uncertainty over its pace of recovery. On the one hand, the excess capacity is expected to expand in 2018. On the other, should the price of oil remain at current levels for a prolonged period, investment in the sector would increase and national income would improve. Uncertainty on the persistence of these factors is high. The lower inflation observed versus the inflation forecast and the reduction in inflation expectations, which could suggest a faster convergence of inflation to its target. Nevertheless, upside risks persist. One of them is an increase in food prices affecting expectations and delaying the convergence of inflation to 3.0%. Similarly, a stronger-than-expected depreciation of domestic currency that could be passed-through to domestic prices. Again, uncertainty on these events is high. In this environment, upon assessing the state of the economy and the risk balance, the Board deemed appropriate to reduce the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp, placing it at 4.25%. The Board will continue to carefully monitor the behavior of inflation and the forecasts for economic activity and inflation in the country, as well as the international context. Finally, the Board reiterates that the monetary policy will depend on the availability of new information. The decision to reduce the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp was approved unanimously by the Board of Directors. The Board decided that, starting today, the minutes of its meetings shall be published 5 business days after the meeting."
Russia,2018-04-27,"On 27 April 2018, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to keep the key rate at 7.25% per annum. Annual inflation remains low. The April weakening in the ruble against the backdrop of geopolitical tension will be a factor for consumer price growth paces to quicken as they move closer to 4%. However, this does not create risks of inflation overshooting the target. At the same time uncertainty remains over the potential impact of the recent developments on inflation expectations. Inflation is forecast to range between 34% as of the end of 2018 and hold close to 4% in 2019. The Bank of Russia still assumes that monetary policy will become neutral in 2018. At the same time, the Bank of Russia considers that the potential key rate reduction intended to bring about neutral monetary conditions has decreased given the rise in interest rates across advanced economies and country risk premium growth for Russia. Moving forward, in its decision-making the Bank of Russia will be guided by assessments of inflation risks, inflation dynamics and economic developments against the forecast. In making its key rate decision, the Bank of Russia recognised the following factors. Inflation dynamics. Inflation remains low, driven by long-term factors including, in the first place, a moderate recovery in domestic demand. Consumer prices grew at the pace of 2.4% in March, and consumer price growth in April is estimated at 2.32.5%. The recent weekly data on inflation are indicative of a still feeble response of consumer prices to the ruble weakening. The gradual depletion of the past year's vegetable stocks and the related growth in imports contributed to an expected slight increase in both monthly and annual inflation between March and April, relative to February. In March, household inflation expectations dropped to a historical low of 7.8%. That said, uncertainty is in place over how inflation expectations will respond to the April developments in financial markets. The Bank of Russia estimates that the ruble weakening will quicken inflation movement to 4% without the risks of overpassing this level, unless the external environment changes considerably. Inflation is forecast to range between 34% as of the end of 2018 and hold close to 4% in 2019. Monetary conditions. The Bank of Russia's estimates suggest that the potential for key rate reduction to shape neutral monetary conditions shrank somewhat. As the country risk premium increased and interest rates were revised upwards in advanced economies, the estimated neutral interest rate has shifted closer to its upper bound within the range of 67%. Economic activity. Business activity keeps on expanding and is hardly posing any disinflationary pressure on consumer price movements. This paves the way for inflation to return to 4%. Output growth continued throughout March, including industrial output, and capacity utilisation increased. Unemployment was close to its natural level. Economic activity is backed up by gradually recovering consumer demand as wages are growing and retail lending is expanding. GDP growth rate is estimated at 1.31.5% in the first quarter and 1.5-2% as of the end of 2018, which is in line with the potential economic growth rate. Inflation risks. The Bank of Russia registers a rise in inflation risks triggered by some internal and external factors. First, geopolitical factors and accelerated yield growth in advanced economies may cause surges in volatility in financial markets and affect expectations for the exchange rate and inflation. Furthermore, uncertainty still persists over the dimensions of fiscal decisions, which are needed to estimate the impact of such decisions on inflation. The Bank of Russia leaves unchanged its estimates of risks associated with consumer and oil price volatility, wage movements and possible changes in consumer behaviour. In its key rate decision-making the Bank of Russia will be guided by assessments of inflation risks, inflation dynamics and economic developments against the forecast. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next rate review meeting on 15 June 2018. The Board decision press release is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time. (% p.a.).

Georgia,2018-05-01,"01.05.2018 The National Bank Of Georgia Keeps Its Policy Rate Unchanged At 7.25% The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on May 1, 2018 and decided to keep the refinancing rate unchanged at 7.25 percent. As it was expected, once the temporary factors have mostly petered out, the inflation declined at the beginning of 2018 and it stood at 2.8 percent in March. According to the current forecast, other things equal, the inflation will remain close to its target level (3 percent) throughout the year. Despite the fact that aggregate demand remains below the potential level of output, thus having a downward pressure on inflation, the relatively higher volatility observed on international financial markets increases the risks of stronger transmission of inflationary pressures from the main trading partner countries. As a result, the committee deemed it appropriate to maintain the moderately tight monetary policy. The gradual easing of the policy will be considered once the factors pushing inflation upwards are sufficiently weakened. The high growth of economic activity continued at the beginning of 2018. Based on preliminary estimates, economy grew by 5.6% annually in March, while in the first quarter the real growth stood at 5.2%. According to current forecasts, as in 2017, relatively high growth of economic activity is expected to carry on in 2018, thus narrowing the negative output gap. The positive trends in the external sector persisted at the beginning of 2018. The first quarter of 2018 revealed high growth of exports and tourism revenues. The remittances continued to grow as well. However, the growth rate of imports is higher compared to the previous year. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all means and instruments at its disposal in order to ensure the price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on June 13, 2018."
United States,2018-05-02,"EDT May 2, 2018 Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate. Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low. Recent data suggest that growth of household spending moderated from its strong fourth-quarter pace, while business fixed investment continued to grow strongly. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have moved close to 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace in the medium term and labor market conditions will remain strong. Inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to run near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term. Risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic (more) For release at 2 p.m. EDT May 2, 2018 - 2 - conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were Jerome H Powell. Chairman; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Thomas I Barkin; Raphael W Bostic; Lael Brainard; Loretta J Mester; Randal K Quarles; and John C Williams."
Czech Republic,2018-05-03,"At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank decided to keep interest rates unchanged. The two-week repo rate thus remains at 0.75%, the discount rate at 0.05% and the Lombard rate at 1.50%. Six members voted in favour of this decision, and one member voted for increasing the two-week repo rate to 1.00%.. The decision adopted by the Bank Board is underpinned by a new macroeconomic forecast of the Czech National Bank. Consistent with the forecast is broad stability of market interest rates initially, followed by further growth in rates from late 2018/early 2019. According to the external assumptions of the new forecast, the current robust growth in the euro area will slow gradually, owing partly to the stronger euro. Industrial producer price inflation will fluctuate around 2%. By contrast, consumer price inflation will return only gradually to 2%. The European Central Bank is responding to persisting subdued inflation in the euro area with continued accommodative monetary policy. The 3M EURIBOR will thus not move close to zero until the end of next year. The Brent crude oil price will gradually decline from its current elevated levels almost to USD 60 a barrel at the end of next year. The euro-dollar exchange rate is expected to remain close to its current strengthened level. The recent decline in domestic inflation slightly below the target reflected the fade-out of last year's one-off factors and a fall in import prices. Domestic inflation pressures nonetheless remain strong, reflecting rapid wage growth amid buoyant growth of the Czech economy. These pressures will gradually ease, but the anti-inflationary effect of import prices will weaken as well. Import prices continue to reflect the strengthening koruna this year. Inflation will remain slightly below the target this year. Next year, however, stable growth in foreign producer prices amid distinctly slower appreciation of the koruna will foster a renewed increase in import prices. Inflation will thus return very close to the 2% target at the monetary policy horizon. The growth of the Czech economy will slow from last year's high pace, but will remain well above 3%. The increase in economic activity will be driven by continued brisk growth in household consumption and private and government investment. Fiscal policy will also support domestic demand growth via rising current government expenditure. By contrast, the current positive contribution of net exports to the growth of the Czech economy will disappear. It will reflect, on the one hand, faster growth in domestic demand, which will support imports, and on the other hand appreciation of the koruna, which will dampen export growth. The unemployment rate is at a record low and there is little room for it to decrease further. At the same time, therefore, employment growth will slow, whereas wage growth will remain high. The latter will moderate in the quarters ahead, but only slowly. This will be due to persisting labour market tightness and sharply rising labour productivity. According to the forecast, the koruna will appreciate further, owing among other things to a positive interest rate differential vis-Ã -vis the euro area. In addition, continued asset purchases by the European Central Bank will continue to foster appreciation of the koruna this year. Solid growth in external demand and real convergence of the Czech economy to euro area countries will also act in this direction. Next year, the koruna will appreciate much more modestly. This will be due to slowing growth in external demand and the European Central Bank's expected return to conventional monetary policy. Consistent with the forecast is broad stability of market interest rates initially, followed by further growth in rates from late 2018/early 2019. According to the forecast, interest rates will thus move towards their long-run neutral level in the course of next year. Continued very accommodative monetary policy of the European Central Bank will remain a significant barrier to a faster increase in domestic interest rates. Compared to the previous forecast, the inflation forecast for this year has been lowered, but at the monetary policy horizon the inflation outlook remains almost unchanged. The forecasted growth of the Czech economy has been increased slightly for both years. The path of interest rates is little changed. The forecast for the koruna-euro exchange rate is slightly weaker for this year but slightly stronger for next year."
Chile,2018-05-05,"P RESS RELEASE Thursday, 5 May 2018 Monetary Policy Meeting * At its monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to hold the monetary policy interest rate at 2.5%, so the intensity of the monetary impulse is unchanged. The decision was adopted by the unanimous vote of all the Board members. The international scenario and related risks are in line with the contents of the last Monetary Policy Report, including the downward bias on domestic activity. Growth prospects in the developed economies have stabilized around higher figures than the previous year's, although several of them have seen a moderation of their earlier optimism. US inflation has accelerated in the margin, while markets continue to anticipate the gradual withdrawal of the monetary stimulus, and the Federal Reserve has maintained the orientation of its monetary policy path. Prospects for the materialization of monetary policy in Europe and Japan have moderated. In this context, the dollar has appreciated, reversing the trend of previous months. Regarding emerging economies. China's first-quarter GDP remained as dynamic as the quarter before, and the numbers continue to sustain the rebalancing of activity and the moderation of growth going forward. In Latin America, activity has shown mixed results. Inflation data has moderated in several countries, and the market outlook suggests that it will remain low for some time, while in other economies the pressure from the appreciated dollar has become stronger. For most countries, global financial conditions remain favorable from a historic perspective. In recent weeks there have been some turbulences due to announced protectionist measures and geopolitical tensions; however, currently the main volatility indicators are very near those of the previous Meeting and the risk premiums remain bounded. In this context, most stock market indexes rose and so did long-term dollar interest rates, with different economies showing different magnitudes. Regarding commodities, the 10% increase in the Brent/WTI oil average prices stands out. Copper, with ups and downs, has hovered around its price of the previous Meeting. In the local financial market, long-term interest rates have not changed materially from the last Meeting, the same as risk premiums, which remain low from a historic standpoint. Stock market indexes rose in line with better business results. The peso depreciated with respect to the dollar in the last two weeks, following the trends of international markets. With respect to the credit market, the Bank Credit Survey for the first quarter of 2018 reported a somewhat stronger demand in several segments, and marginal improvements in the supply of consumer loans and commercial credit to big companies. Interest rates remain low and credit growth is still bounded. The latest data on activity and demand are consistent with the baseline scenario of the March Report. First-quarter growth in activity was significantly influenced by the increase in mining, favored by the low basis for comparison. Activity in the other sectors maintained the better performance of previous months, where worth highlighting was the greater contribution of several investment-related sectors. Investment in construction and other works continues to recover, while exports continue to grow in the main areas, consumer and business confidence are still in optimistic levels and financial conditions are comfortable. However, private salaried employment has yet to recover and nominal wages have decelerated in annual terms, which could take a toll on wage mass growth and possibly on consumption. The Economic Expectations Survey (EES) of April showed no major changes in expected growth for this year and next, both somewhat above 3.5%. Annual CPI inflation declined to 1.8% in March, while core inflationâ€”the CPIEFEâ€”was again 1.6%, with minor differences with the last Report's estimates. Its evolution, as has been the trend of the last few quarters, continues to be driven by the appreciation of the peso, the current state of capacity gaps and indexation to lower inflation rates. Y-o-y change in CPIEFE for goods persists in slightly negative ground, and for services it remains near 3%. Inflation expectations showed no significant changes. Accordingly, expectations one year ahead as measured by analysts' surveys stand between 2.5% and 2.7% and two years ahead, between 2.8% and 3.0%. The Board's decision considered that inflation will remain low during the better part of 2018, to then advance more robustly toward the target during next year, consistently with a gradual closure of capacity gaps. The Board foresees that it will keep the monetary stimulus at its current level until macroeconomic conditions tend to consolidate the convergence of inflation towards 3%. The persistence of inflation at low levels, especially its core component, means that the risks of not achieving the target within the policy horizon remain, a situation that will continue to be monitored with special care. Thus, the Board reaffirms its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the two-year policy horizon. The minutes of this Monetary Policy Meeting will be published at 8:30 hours of Friday, 18 May 2018. The next Monetary Policy Meeting will be held on 13 June 2018 and the statement thereof will be published at 18:00 hours the same day. ___ * The Spanish original prevails."
Romania,2018-05-07,"In its meeting of 7 May 2018, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided the following:. In March 2018, the annual inflation rate continued to increase to reach 4.95 percent, in line with the forecast, from 4.72 percent in the previous month. The faster pace owed mostly to the action of supply-side factors, especially the hike in fuel prices, but also to the adjusted CORE2 inflation, the annual rate of which stayed on an upward trend to 3.0 percent in March from 2.9 percent in February. The advance in the adjusted CORE2 index shows pressures from excess aggregate demand in the economy, the rise in production costs (labour force, utilities), some influences exerted by the dynamics of the leu exchange rate, as well as the further upward adjustment of short-term inflation expectations. The average annual CPI inflation rate followed a similar path, rising to 2.5 percent in March from 2.1 percent in February; calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, the annual average stood at 1.9 percent, up from 1.6 percent in February. The revised data on economic growth indicate a slightly more pronounced deceleration than previously published for 2017 Q4, its annual dynamics remaining, however, robust, at 6.7 percent (versus 6.9 percent initially). In 2017 as a whole, the growth rate of real GDP was revised to 6.9 percent (from 7 percent). On the demand side, the slight downward adjustment for 2017 Q4 reflected in both household consumption, the main driver of economic growth, and gross fixed capital formation. The negative contribution of net exports to the advance in real GDP remained unchanged. The latest statistical data show the deterioration of the balance on trade in goods and services and, consequently, the widening of the current account deficit in the first two months of 2018 compared to the same year-earlier period. The same interval reports fast-paced annual dynamics of industrial output, although slightly moderating, a swifter increase in new orders across manufacturing, as well as a still high annual growth rate of trade and services. Monetary conditions continued to be less accommodative in April, amid the rise in relevant money market rates and the relative stability of the leu exchange rate. The NBR strengthened control over liquidity across the banking system by conducting at mid-April time deposit-taking operations, with full allotment, at a rate equal to the policy rate. In March, the annual growth rate of credit to the private sector remained at 6.1 percent. The leu-denominated component further widened its share in total credit to 63.6 percent, against a low of 35.6 percent in May 2012. Annual dynamics of loans to households stepped up to 9.4 percent, driven largely by consumer credit. In today's meeting, the NBR Board examined and approved the May 2018 Inflation Report, which incorporates the most recent data and information available. The new scenario of the projection reconfirms the prospects for a slight pick-up and a levelling-off of the annual inflation rate over several months at values above the variation band of the target, followed by its return to the vicinity of the upper bound of the band at the end of this year. Compared to the previous Inflation Report, the path of the annual inflation rate is expected to stick to coordinates almost similar to those in the preceding projection. The uncertainties and risks surrounding the inflation outlook stem mainly from administered prices, labour market conditions and the future movements in the international oil price. Also relevant are the economic growth pace and developments in inflation in the euro area and hence the monetary policy stance of the ECB and of central banks in the region. Based on the currently available data, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided to increase the monetary policy rate to 2.50 percent per annum from 2.25 percent per annum; moreover, the NBR Board decided to raise the deposit facility rate to 1.50 percent per annum and the lending (Lombard) facility rate to 3.50 percent per annum. In addition, the NBR Board decided to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board decisions aim to ensure and preserve price stability over the medium term in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth and amid safeguarding financial stability. The NBR Board underlines that the balanced macroeconomic policy mix and the implementation of structural reforms designed to foster the growth potential over the long term are of the essence in preserving a stable macroeconomic framework and strengthening the capacity of the Romanian economy to withstand potential adverse developments. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be presented to the public in a press conference on 9 May 2018. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR website on 14 May 2018, at 3:00 p.m. The next monetary policy meeting of the NBR Board is scheduled for 4 July 2018."
Philippines,2018-05-09,"At its meeting on monetary policy today, the Monetary Board decided to increase the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) facility by 25 basis points to 3.25 percent. The interest rates on the overnight lending and deposit facilities were likewise raised accordingly. In deciding to raise the policy interest rate, the Monetary Board noted that latest forecasts have further shifted higher, indicating that inflation pressures could become more broad-based over the policy horizon. While inflation momentum has started to slow down, inflation may still breach the inflation target range of 3.0 percent Â± 1.0 percentage point for 2018 due primarily to temporary supply-side factors. Nevertheless, inflation is expected to return inside the target range in 2019. The Monetary Board assessed that the balance of risks to the inflation outlook continues to lean toward the upside, with price pressures emanating from possible adjustments in transport fares, utility rates, and wages. Given these considerations, the Monetary Board believes that a timely increase in the BSP's policy interest rate will help arrest potential second-round effects by tempering the buildup in inflation expectations. The Monetary Board observed that strong domestic demand allows some scope for a measured adjustment in the policy rate without adversely affecting the country's economic growth momentum. In assessing the stance of monetary policy, the Monetary Board also emphasizes that it continues to closely monitor domestic macroeconomic conditions as well as the evolving global economic environment, including the potential impact of the ongoing normalization of monetary policy in some advanced economies. Looking ahead, the BSP stands ready to undertake further policy action as necessary to ensure the achievement of its price and financial stability objectives."
Malaysia,2018-05-10,"At its Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today, the MPC of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.25 percent. The global economy continues to gain strength with growth being more broad based and synchronised across regions. Global trade sustained its strong momentum. In the advanced economies, higher wages and diminishing labour market slack remain supportive of growth. Additional policy support, particularly in the US, is expected to lift growth further. In Asia, growth will be driven by sustained domestic activity and strong external demand. Financial markets continue to face intermittent volatility amid rising trade tensions. Global growth prospects remain balanced although there are risks should trade and geopolitical tensions worsen. For the Malaysian economy, latest indicators point towards continued expansion in private sector activity and exports. Going forward, the positive growth momentum is expected to be sustained, driven by the strength in both domestic and external demand. Private consumption will be supported by favourable income and labour market conditions. Investment activity is projected to be sustained by implementation of ongoing infrastructure projects and capacity expansion by firms. On the external front, exports are expected to continue benefitting from the positive momentum in global growth and trade in advanced and regional economies. Overall, the prospects for the Malaysian economy remain strong. Headline inflation is expected to remain moderate for the year as a whole on expectations of a smaller effect from global cost factors. A stronger ringgit exchange rate compared to 2017 will mitigate import costs. However, the trajectory of headline inflation will be dependent on future global oil prices which remain highly uncertain. Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation, is projected to remain moderate amid stable demand conditions. Despite financial market volatility due to external developments, domestic financial markets have remained resilient. Malaysia's economic fundamentals are strongly anchored. The domestic economic outlook remains positive, the financial sector is strong and monetary and financial conditions are supportive of economic growth in the post-election environment. At the current level of the OPR, the degree of monetary accommodativeness is consistent with the policy stance to ensure that the domestic economy continues on a steady growth path amid lower inflation. The MPC will continue to monitor and assess the balance of risks surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation. Bank Negara Malaysia 10 May 2018."
Peru,2018-05-10,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR MAY 2018 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 2.75% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 2.75 percent. This decision takes into account the following factors: In April, the YoY inflation rate rose slightly to 0.48 percent, a rate still below the lower band of the inflation target range (1.0 percent). This is explained mainly by the reversal of the supply shocks in a context of economic activity that shows a lower level than the potential level of growth. Moreover, trend inflation measurements show levels close to the midpoint of the target range; The expected YoY rate of inflation fell slightly to 2.17 percent in April; Indicators of economic activity show clear signs of a greater dynamism, although GDP remains below its potential level of growth, and The world economy continues to show positive indicators, although there is still uncertainty in international financial markets. The YoY inflation rate is projected to return to be within the target range in the second quarter and to gradually converge to 2.0 percent by the end of the year. The Board considers that it is appropriate to maintain an expansionary policy stance until it is certain that this convergence will take place in a context of anchored inflation expectations. Recent indicators of inflation and activity reflect the following: Inflation in April showed a rate of -0.14 percent, as a result of which the YoY inflation rate rose from 0.36 percent in March to 0.48 percent in April. Inflation without food and energy recorded a rate of 0.01 percent, as a result of which the YoY rate fell from 1.99 percent in March to 1.91 in April, within the target range. Most indicators of business expectations improved in April and continue to be on the optimistic side. Moreover, several indicators of economic activity, consumption, and investment show a recovery as well. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 1.50 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 3.30 percent for the first 15 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 15 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 3.30 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for June on its Meeting of June 7, 2018."
Armenia,2018-05-15,"PRESS RELEASE 15.05.2018 At the May 15th of 2018 meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia (the CBA) decided to leave the refinancing rate unchanged, at the level of 6.0%. There was 0.3% deflation in April of 2018 against 1.0% inflation registered in the same month of the previous year, and the 12â€month inflation rate notably reduced during the month amounting to 2.4%. The low inflation environment owed to both the slowing of core inflation rate and the decline in seasonal prices. In the upcoming months, the CBA Board estimates, the inflation will remain within the lower part of the confidence band. The actual developments in the external sector in April demonstrate that trends for improving global economic growth and minor inflationary patterns in the main commodity markets of the world continued. In view of such developments, the CBA Board keeps anticipating inflationary effects proportional with expanding demand in the external sector. The CBA Board notes that economic activity in the first quarter of 2018 was relatively strong, driven by high productivity growths reported in industry, construction and services sectors. This was also concomitant with high rates by which the domestic demand recovered, and it is expected that the growth of the latter will, since the second quarter, decelerate to some extent, gradually approaching its equilibrium. The Board believes that inflation expectations have stabilized over the past period of the year and no additional inflationary pressures are expected in the upcoming months. At the same time, the Board reckons that the impact of political events in April and May on the financial market has been effectively absorbed thanks to the adequate toolkit the CBA used under its independence mandate. Taking the abovementioned into account, the Board finds it appropriate that current monetary conditions will still be maintained, while considering that, in light of predicted developments, a gradual offsetting of expansionary monetary conditions would be needed in the future to fulfil the inflation target. As a result, the expectation is that the 12â€month inflation rate will fluctuate within the confidence band in the forecast horizon, stabilizing around the 4% target. The risks to economic growth outlook and to the inflation deviating from its recovery path are estimated to be more balanced. Should there emerge such risks, the CBA will adjust the monetary policy directions accordingly, while ensuring the price stability. Detailed information that underlies the decision on setting of the interest rate will be available in Inflation Report (Monetary Policy Program, 2nd quarter, 2018), to be published by May 30, 2018.

Brazil,2018-05-16,"The Copom unanimously decided to maintain the Selic rate at 6.50% p.a. The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario:. The latest indicators show softening of economic activity in the context of a consistent, albeit gradual, recovery of the Brazilian economy. The global outlook has become more challenging and showed volatility. The evolution of risks associated, to a large extent, with normalization of interest rates in some advanced economies led to adjustments in international financial markets. As a result, risk appetite towards emerging economies has diminished. The Committee judges that inflation developments remain favorable, with various measures of underlying inflation running still at low levels. This includes the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy. Inflation expectations for 2018 collected by the Focus survey are around 3.5%. The Copom's inflation projections in the scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the Focus survey stand around 3.6% for 2018, and 3.9% for 2019. This scenario assumes a path for the policy interest rate that ends 2018 at 6.5% p.a., and 2019 at 8.0% p.a., and a path for the exchange rate that ends both 2018 and 2019 at R$/US$ 3.40. In the scenario with a constant interest rate, at 6.50% p.a., and a constant exchange rate, at R$/US$ 3.60*, the projections for both 2018 and 2019 stand around 4.0%. The Committee emphasizes that risks around its baseline scenario remain in both directions. On the one hand, possible propagation through inertial mechanisms of low inflation levels may lead to a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory. On the other hand, frustration of expectations regarding the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy may affect risk premia and increase the path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy. This risk intensifies in the case of further changes in the global outlook for emerging economies. The latter risk has intensified since the last Copom meeting. The Copom judges that it should base its decisions on the evolution of inflation projections and expectations, of the balance of risks, and of economic activity. External shocks should only lead to responses to second-round effects they might produce on prospective inflation (that is, in the propagation to prices in the economy that are not directly affected by the shock). These shocks, however, may change the balance of risks by reducing the chances that inflation will remain below target over the relevant horizon for monetary policy, through its possible second-round effects. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the wide array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to maintain the Selic rate at 6.50% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects the recent change in the balance of risks to prospective inflation and is consistent with convergence of inflation to target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, which includes 2018 and, to a greater extent, 2019. The Committee reiterates that economic conditions prescribe accommodative monetary policy, i.e., interest rates below the structural level. The Copom emphasizes that the evolution of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy contributes to the reduction of its structural interest rate. The Committee will continue to reassess estimates of this rate over time. In the Copom's assessment, the evolution of the baseline scenario and, mainly, of the balance of risks made it unnecessary to ease monetary policy further in order to mitigate the risk of delayed convergence of inflation toward the targets. Regarding the next meetings, the Committee deems appropriate to maintain its policy rate at its current level. The Copom emphasizes that the next steps in the conduct of monetary policy will continue to depend on the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, and on inflation projections and expectations. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Ilan Goldfajn (Governor). Carlos Viana de Carvalho. Carolina de Assis Barros. MaurÃ­cio Costa de Moura. OtÃ¡vio Ribeiro Damaso. Paulo Sergio Neves de Souza. Reinaldo Le Grazie. Sidnei CorrÃªa Marques, and Tiago Couto Berriel. * Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average R$/US$ exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the Friday prior to the Copom meeting."
Poland,2018-05-16,"Warsaw, 16 May 2018 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 15-16 May 2018 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged at: â–ª reference rate at 1.50%; â–ª lombard rate at 2.50%; â–ª deposit rate at 0.50%; â–ª rediscount rate at 1.75%. Global economic conditions remain favourable, despite a weakening in GDP growth in the major advanced economies at the beginning of the year. In the euro area, following a slowdown in GDP growth in 2018 Q1, which was probably of a temporary nature, incoming data suggest that economic situation continues to be favourable. Similarly, in the United States, economic conditions remain good, although GDP growth in this country also weakened in 2018 Q1. In China, in turn, economic growth has continued at stable rates for the past few quarters. Despite favourable global economic conditions, inflation abroad remains moderate on the back of persistently low domestic inflationary pressure across many countries. In addition, agricultural commodity prices are still lower than a year ago, whereas oil prices have recently increased. The European Central Bank keeps interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero, while still purchasing financial assets. At the same time, the US Federal Reserve continues to gradually reduce its balance sheet, signalling further interest rate rises in the future. According to GUS flash estimate, the annual GDP growth in Poland in 2018 Q1 stood at 5.1%. Economic growth is supported by rising consumption, fuelled by increasing employment and wages, disbursement of benefits and very strong consumer sentiment. This is accompanied by a recovery in investment. Also favourable economic conditions abroad continue to support economic activity growth. Notwithstanding relatively high economic growth and wages rising faster than last year, consumer price growth remains moderate. Inflation net of food and energy prices stays low. In the Council's assessment, current data continue to point to a favourable outlook for economic activity growth in Poland, despite the expected slight slowdown in GDP growth in the coming years. In line with the available forecasts, inflation will remain close to the 1/2 target in the monetary policy transmission horizon. As a result, the Council judges that the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability."
Thailand,2018-05-16,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 3/2018 Mr. Jaturong Jantarangs. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 16 May 2018 as follows. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 150 percent. One MPC member was unable to attend the meeting. In deliberating their policy decision, the Committee assessed that the Thai economy continued to gain further traction over the previous assessment, driven by both growth in the external sector and gradual improvements in domestic demand. Headline inflation gradually rose in line with the previous assessment. Core inflation was projected to rise slowly. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative and conducive to economic growth. Financial stability remained sound overall, but it was deemed necessary to monitor pockets of risks that might lead to the build-up of vulnerabilities in the financial system in the future especially given prolonged monetary accommodation. The Committee viewed that the current accommodative monetary policy stance remained conducive to the continuation of economic growth and should support the rise of headline inflation toward target in a sustainable manner, although the process would take some time. Thus the Committee decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at this meeting. The Thai economy as a whole continued to gain further traction, driven particularly by continued improvements in merchandise exports and tourism thanks to global economic growth. Although employment saw signs of improvement, private consumption growth remained moderate. This was partly because the economic recovery had yet to benefit household income and employment in a broad-based manner while household debt remained elevated. In the Committee's view, these issues must be addressed through structural policies. Private investment picked up further with the improved economic outlook and was projected to continue expanding with additional support from government projects. Meanwhile public expenditure would be a driver of growth but there remained risks of delays in budget disbursement. Furthermore Thailand's growth outlook was still subject to external risks that continued to warrant monitoring, including uncertainties pertaining to US economic and foreign trade policies, retaliatory measures from trading partners of the US, and geopolitical risks. Headline inflation edged up at a gradual pace as previously expected on the back of the expansion of domestic demand and the increase in oil prices. However headline inflation was projected to rise gradually as fresh food prices remained low due to high agricultural output thanks to favorable weather conditions. Core inflation was projected to rise slowly as demand-pull 2 inflationary pressures remained low, while structural changes, such as an expansion of e-commerce and rising price competition, contributed to more persistent inflation than in the past. Meanwhile the public's inflation expectations broadly increased. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative and conducive to economic growth with ample liquidity in the financial system. Overall government bond yields increased somewhat while real interest rates remained low. Such conditions allowed financing by the private sector to continue expanding with gradual improvements seen in the amount of credit extended to SMEs and consumer loans. On exchange rates, the baht depreciated against the US dollar due to the latter's recent strength against most currencies. However the baht's movements relative to those of trading partner currencies were largely unchanged. In the period ahead, the baht would likely remain volatile mainly due to uncertainties pertaining to monetary, fiscal, and foreign trade policies among major advanced economies. Thus the Committee would closely monitor exchange rate developments as well as impacts on the economy going forward. Financial stability remained sound but there continued to be a need to monitor pockets of risks that might pose vulnerabilities to financial stability in the future. These included, in particular, the search-for-yield behavior in the prolonged low interest rate environment that might lead to underpricing of risks, and the deterioration in debt serviceability of households and SMEs, especially those affected by changes in structural factors and business models. Looking ahead, the Thai economy as a whole was projected to continue to gain further traction particularly on the back of external demand. However the strength of the domestic demand and inflation developments in the period ahead must be monitored. Hence the Committee viewed that monetary policy should remain accommodative and would stand ready to utilize available policy tools to sustain economic growth while also ensuring financial stability."
Egypt,2018-05-17,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release May 17, 2018 In its meeting on May 17, 2018, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) main operation unchanged at 1675 percent, 1775 percent, and 1725 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept at 1725 percen. Annual headline inflation continued to decline in March and April 2018 to record 131 percent, while annual core inflation continued to decline in March to 116 percent and remained roughly unchanged in Apri. The headline and core annual rates thereby registered in April 2018 the lowest since May and April 2016, respectivel. Real GDP growth continued to improve for the fifth consecutive quarter, to record 53 percent in December 2017 and an average of 50 percent during 2017, the highest since 201. The unemployment rate registered further improvement in March 2018, declining to 106 percent, the lowest since December 201. The increase in international oil prices gained momentum in April and May 2018, leading to the materialization of an upside risk to the domestic inflation outloo. Nevertheless the outlook remains consistent with achieving the inflation target of 13 percent (Â±3 percent) in 2018 Q4 and single digits thereafte. Domestic risks surrounding the inflation outlook continue to include potential fiscal reform measures, the evolution of inflation expectations, as well as demand-side pressure. In addition to oil price developments, risks from the external economy continue to include the pace of tightening financial condition. The MPC's decision to keep the CBE's key policy rates unchanged is consistent with achieving the targeted disinflation pat. The MPC closely monitors all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust its stance to achieve its mandate of price stability over the medium ter.

Mexico,2018-05-17,"Banco de Mexico's Governing Board decides to maintain the target for the overnight interbank interest rate at a level of 7.50%. During the first quarter of 2018, the world economy kept growing in a generalized manner, although it moderated its pace. The reduction of slack in advanced economies has started to be reflected in several of them in gradual increases in both inflation and inflation expectations. The U.S. is expected to exhibit a strong economic growth in the following quarters. As was to be expected, in its FOMC meeting of May, the Federal Reserve left the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, reasserting its expectation of a gradual pace of increases in the target range for the federal funds rate, and stating that inflation will run near its symmetric 2% target. U.S. interest rates have also increased, especially those for the short- term, while the dollar strengthened in a generalized manner. Growth forecasts for the world economy for 2018 and 2019 remain unchanged as compared with those published at the beginning of the year. Nevertheless, several downside risks prevail, particularly for the medium and long term, including conditions of higher volatility in international financial markets due to the presence of greater-than- expected inflationary pressures, the escalation of protectionist trade measures, and the materialization of certain geopolitical events. In this context, most emerging economies' currencies depreciated considerably and presented an increase in their volatility. In the case of Mexico, the peso's weakening was also affected by domestic factors. In turn, interest rates rose, especially for the longest tenors. Available information suggests that, during the first quarter of 2018, economic activity in Mexico continued recovering, at a rate higher than that observed in the previous quarter. Exports maintained an upward trend, private consumption continued growing â€”although at a slower paceâ€” while investment rose. As for the economy's cyclical position, slack conditions remained tight. Although most recent data reveal a greater dynamism in economic activity, the balance of risks for growth continues biased downwards due to the uncertainty that still prevails in the economy. Banco de Mexico's monetary policy stance, adopted to keep medium- and long-term inflation expectations anchored, together with both the fulfillment of the fiscal objectives and the financial system's resilience, have contributed to place the Mexican economy in a better position to cope with possible adverse events. In the months ahead, the economy is expected to continue facing a complex environment, both in the external and domestic fronts. For this reason, it is particularly relevant that besides following a prudent and robust monetary policy, measures to foster greater productivity must also be adopted, as well as a sustainable consolidation of the public finances. Annual headline inflation continued to decrease, from 5.04% in March to 4.55% in April, with reductions in both its core and non-core components. During this period, core inflation diminished from 4.02% to 3.71% as a result of monetary policy actions and the fading of shocks that had an adverse effect on it last year. Non-core inflation dropped from 8.03% to 7.07% during the same period, mostly due to reductions in the prices of fruits, vegetables, and LP gas, which were partly offset by increases in gasoline prices. Headline inflation expectations for the end of 2018 decreased from 4.09% in March to 3.98% in April, while medium- and long-term inflation expectations remained around 3.50%. 1 The decline in inflation during the first four months of 2018 is consistent with the forecasts presented by Banco de Mexico in its October-December 2017 Quarterly Report. Looking ahead, on the basis of available information and considering the current monetary policy stance and the horizon in which it operates, inflation is expected to be in line with those forecasts. These projections consider an orderly behavior of the exchange rate, the absence of labor market pressures, and a continuing downward trend in non-core inflation for the rest of 2018 at the foreseen pace. The aforementioned scenario is subject to risks and to a high degree of uncertainty. Among the upside risks for inflation are that the peso exchange rate continues to be under pressure due to an environment of higher external interest rates and U.S. dollar strength, and uncertainty associated with both the NAFTA renegotiation and Mexico's elections. In the event of a scenario in which the real exchange rate would need to adjust. Banco de Mexico will make sure it is done in an orderly manner, and with no second- round effects on the economy's price formation process. The risk of additional shocks in agricultural product prices and upward pressures in the prices of certain energy goods prevails. Given the economy's cyclical conditions, unit labor costs could lead to upward inflationary pressures as well. As for downside risks, the possibility of the peso appreciating if NAFTA negotiations are favorable must be highlighted. In the presence of a highly uncertain environment, the balance of risks for inflation in relation to its expected path remains biased upwards. To guide its monetary policy actions. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board closely follows the development of inflation vis-Ã -vis its anticipated trajectory, taking into account the monetary policy stance adopted and the horizon in which monetary policy operates, as well as available information on all inflation determinants and on medium- and long-term inflation expectations, including the balance of risks to such factors. Considering the latest information on these elements and that the current monetary policy stance is consistent with annual headline inflation following a downward trend to its target. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board voted unanimously to maintain the target for the overnight interbank interest rate at a level of 7.50%. Looking ahead, the Governing Board will maintain a prudent monetary policy stance and will continue following closely the potential pass-through of exchange rate fluctuations on prices, the monetary policy stance relative to that of the U.S., and the conditions of slack in the Mexican economy. In the presence of factors that, by their nature, may involve risks to both inflation and inflation expectations, monetary policy will be conducted in a timely and firm manner to attain the convergence of inflation to its 3% target and to strengthen the anchoring of medium- and long-term inflation expectations."
Nigeria,2018-05-22,"Central Bank Of Nigeria Communique No 118 Of The Monetary Policy Committee Meeting Of Monday 21ST And Tuesday 22ND May, 2018 Background The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on the 21st and 22nd of May, 2018 against the backdrop of optimistic global growth outlook and sustained recovery in the domestic economy. The Committee examined the performance, risks, vulnerabilities in the global and domestic economies up to May 2018, and the outlook for the rest of the year. In attendance were nine members of the Committee. Global Economic Developments The momentum of global economic activities remained broadly sustained, with outcomes likely to be shaped by emerging geo-political issues including: easing geo-political tensions on the Korean Peninsula; reduced trade tensions between China and the United States; United States withdrawal from the 2015 Iranian Nuclear Deal; easy financing conditions in the Euro Area, the UK and Japan; as well as difficulties associated with the Brexit negotiations. Accordingly global output is projected to grow at 39 per cent in 2018, up from 38 per cent in 2017. Growth in the advanced economies is projected to 1 strengthen to 25 per cent in 2018 from 23 per cent in 2017 premised on improved investments and consumption spending. Similarly output growth in the emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) is projected to rise marginally at 49 per cent in 2018 reflecting improvements from 48 per cent in 2017, led by oil exporters, such as Russia. Brazil, and Nigeria. The Committee noted that despite these optimistic developments, the downside risks to global growth include: the geo-political tensions in the Middle-East; lingering uncertainties from BREXIT negotiations; and growing trend towards trade protectionism. Inflation in the advanced economies is projected to rise by 20 per cent and would remain subdued relative to the long term trend. In the emerging markets and developing economies, price developments could surge by 46 per cent in 2018. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts that inflation may rise modestly over the medium to long-term, due to rising asset prices and long- term yields in the major financial markets. Domestic Output Developments The Committee noted improvements in the domestic economy, attributable to the steady decline in inflation, rebound in oil prices and increase in production level, as well as the continued stability in the foreign exchange market. According to data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for Q4 2017 was revised upwards from 192 per cent to 211 per cent, while a growth of 195 per cent was recorded in the first quarter of 2018, up from a contraction of 091 per cent in the corresponding 2 period of 2017. The development was due to growth in the oil and non-oil sectors by 1477 and 076 per cent, respectively. The Monetary Policy Committee also noted the sustained positive outlook based on the Manufacturing, and Non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Indices (PMI), which rose for thirteenth and twelfth consecutive months to 569 and 575 index points, respectively, in April 2018. The Committee welcomed this development but believes that growth remains largely fragile and could benefit from further reforms and stimulus. In this regard, the MPC urged the various levels of government to accelerate the settlement of contractor debt and salary arrears as well as facilitate the quick implementation of the 2018 Federal Government budget. Developments in Money and Prices The Committee noted that broad money supply (M2) grew by 216 per cent in April 2018 from 126 per cent in March 2018, annualised to 648 per cent. This was in contrast to the provisional growth benchmark of 1048 per cent for 2018. The performance of M2 was mainly driven by the growth in Net Domestic Credit (NDC) of 624 per cent (annualised to 1872%), owing largely to net credit to government, which grew by 4613 per cent (annualised to 13839%) against the provisional benchmark of 5497 per cent. Credit to the private sector, however, contracted by 016 per cent (annualised to -047%) in April 2018, in contrast to the provisional annual benchmark of 564 per cent. Net Foreign Assets (NFA) grew by 738 per cent in April 2018, annualized to 2213 per cent, compared with the provisional benchmark of 1815 per cent. Narrow 3 money (M1), however, contracted by 331 per cent (annualised to -994%), compared with the provisional benchmark of 804 per cent. Inflationary pressures continued to moderate with headline inflation (year-on- year) declining for the fifteenth consecutive month to 1248 per cent in April 2018 from 1334 per cent in March 2018. Food and Core inflation also decelerated to 1480 and 1092 per cent from 1608 and 1118 per cent, respectively, during the same period. The average inter-bank call rate decreased to 334 per cent in April 2018 from 949 per cent in December 2017. Similarly the average Open Buy Back (OBB) rate fell to 296 per cent in April 2018 from 846 per cent in December 2017. The movement in the net liquidity position and interest rates reflected the combined effects of Open Market Operations (OMO) auctions, foreign exchange interventions and statutory allocation to state and local governments. The Committee welcomed the sustained improvement in the level of external reserves, which stood at US$4779 billion on May 18, 2018, compared with US$4673 billion at the end of March 2018. The Committee urged the Bank to sustain this momentum and continue to boost investor confidence in the economy. The Committee also welcomed the continued rise in the price of crude and called on the Federal Government to seize the opportunity to build fiscal buffers against future oil price shocks. The All-Share Index (ASI) decreased by 66 per cent from 43,,33054 on February 28, 2018 to 40,,47245 on May 18, 2018, owing largely to profit taking activities of investors, and capital reversals in response to monetary policy normalization in some advanced economies particularly, the United States. Similarly Market Capitalization (MC) fell by 57 per cent from N1555 trillion on February 28, 2018 to N1466 trillion on May 18, 2018. The Committee noted the need to maintain remunerative domestic rates to stem the trend towards huge capital outflow. The MPC welcomed the continued stability in the foreign exchange market, promoted by improved dollar liquidity in the market due to the high level of activity at the Investors' and Exporters' (I&E) window, that is equally driving rates towards convergence at all segments of the market. Total foreign exchange inflow through the economy from January to March 2018 stood at US$24719 billion, of which funding from the CBN was US$881 billion or 285 per cent, while autonomous sources accounted for the larger balance of US$1591 billion or 715 per cent of the total. In addition, the Committee welcomed the US$25 billion or RMB 15 billion Currency Swap between the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the People's Bank of China (PBoC). This swap, the Committee noted, will ease pressure in the foreign exchange market by the reduction in reliance on a third currency for trade settlement between Nigeria and China. They further noted that this swap arrangement could be the basis for an expanded and mutually beneficial economic relationship between Nigeria and China. The Overall Outlook and Risks 5 The macroeconomic environment that propelled the economy's exit from recession has remained positive and is likely to continue in the near-term. The expectation was premised on speedy implementation of the 2018 budget, improved security, continued stability in the foreign exchange market as well as increase in crude oil production and prices. The Committee noted the downside risks to the outlook to include: the late approval and implementation of the 2018 budget; farmers-herdsmen conflict; weak demand and consumer spending associated with outstanding salaries and contractor debt; and the growing level of sovereign debt. The outlook for inflation indicates continued moderation in the price level, even though the risks include huge liquidity injections that is expected to arise from the implementation of the proposed N912 trillion 2018 FGN budget; expenditure towards the 2019 elections; monthly FAAC injections, approval and implementation of the proposed new national minimum wage, possibly finance by a supplementary budget. These could impact aggregate demand and put pressure on domestic prices in the remaining months of 2018 and may dampen the gains already made by the Bank in stabilizing prices. Staff forecasts, given the anticipated liquidity injections into the economy, indicates upward trending pressure on domestic prices from the second half of fiscal 2018. Consequently the Committee advocates an orderly injection of the anticipated liquidity by the fiscal authorities to prevent a negative shock to prices that would derail the positive but fragile recovery so far achieved. Given the CBN's interventions, the current level of oil prices and developments in the global economy, we expect rates to remain stable in the foreign exchange market in the near-term. However the bearish signs in the capital market associated with profit taking activities of investors, call for a careful calibration of policy so as to moderate the trend of capital outflows in an era of monetary policy normalization in the United States. This is given that there are already indications of severe attacks on the foreign exchange markets of some emerging economies. Nevertheless there is significant high level of uncertainties that could arise from the fiscal operations of government in the near term. Amongst these are: when the implementation of the 2017 budget will end; dwindling revenue projections; as well as the possibilities of full implementation of the 2018 Federal budget. Consequently we expect a likely bunching of government spending in view of the late passage of the budget and government's commitment to honour prior obligations. This could pose a serious challenge to the Bank's price stability mandate. Revenue is expected to increase in view of the favourable prices of crude oil and improvements in non-oil revenue, particularly taxes. In addition, production levels have also increased in recent times and this is expected to be maintained. However the implications of a China-US trade deal on China's oil imports from Nigeria remain unclear, especially as the US has included energy imports on the list of items for negotiation with China. The Considerations of the Committee 7 The Committee expressed satisfaction on the positive outlook in the domestic economic environment as the real GDP grew for the fourth consecutive quarter by the first quarter of 2018 and the positive trend in the Manufacturing and Non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Indices in the first quarter of 2018. It noted the continued deceleration in headline inflation as well as stability in the foreign exchange market and therefore, called on the Bank to sustain the momentum in order to further subdue inflation and ensure growth. The Committee expressed satisfaction with the level of activities in the Investors' and Exporters' (I&E) window of the foreign exchange market. The Committee further noted the overall upward growth momentum of the economy with key activity sectors returning positive growth. Despite the improving macroeconomic environment, the Committee noted that disruptions to the supply chains in major food producing states of the country remains a concern as food prices remained sticky downwards. It also noted the potential adverse effect of the rising global inflation on domestic prices and therefore, urged the Government not to relent on curtailing the security challenges to advance controlling inflation to its historical path. Members of the Committee were satisfied with the progress made with the implementation of the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan, but were concerned on the effect of delay in the passage of the 2018 Appropriation could derail the programme and urged the Federal Government to sustain its implementation to further accelerate the economic recovery thus far achieved. The Committee urged the Government to set the machinery for the 8 effective implementation of the 2018 budget to further stimulate the economy. It also encouraged the Government to sustain current efforts at boosting tax revenue generation notwithstanding the increase in crude oil and other commodity prices. The MPC, however, noted the potential effects of expansionary fiscal budget of 2018 and the liquidity impact of rising FAAC distribution, following increase in the prices of crude oil as well as the build up in election related spending towards the 2019 general elections. The Committee took note of the improved performance of deposit money banks and observed that the relatively high levels of non-performing loans in the industry was moderating and urged Government to promptly settle outstanding contractor arrears as earlier promised. The Committee commended the effort of the Bank in achieving the positive outlook for the industry and advice the Bank to intensify efforts to further improve banking sector soundness. It called on the Bank to sustain its monitoring apparatus to ensure compliance with existing prudential regulations and early detection and management of emerging vulnerabilities. Also it similarly encouraged the Bank not to relent in ensuring that liquidity continues to flow from the banking sector to the real sector to further strengthen economic recovery and employment generation. The Committee's Decisions The Committee critically evaluated the policy options in terms of developments in the international and domestic environments, noting in particular progress made in stimulating output growth, including stability in the 9 foreign exchange market increase in the level of foreign exchange reserves, and sustained deceleration in the rate of inflation. The Committee considered the forecast of high liquidity injection in the second half of 2018, upward pressure on prices, driven largely by substantial expansionary fiscal policy, which will arise from the late passage of the 2018 appropriation bill, outstanding balance from the 2017 budget and the pre- election expenditures. Thus tightening would ensure the mop-up of excess liquidity. Mindful that despite the moderation in inflation, the current inflation rate is still above targeted single digit and that real interest rate only turned positive in the review period. The objective of the policy stance therefore, would be to accelerate a reduction in the inflation rate to single digit to promote economic stability, boost investor confidence, and promote foreign capital flows with complementary impact on exchange rate stability. Conversely the Committee believes that raising interest rate would, however, depress consumption and increase the cost of borrowing to the real sector. Moreover such policy would make deposit money banks to re-price their assets. In reviewing the choice of loosening, the Committee evaluated the potential impact of stimulating aggregate demand through lower cost of credit. Nevertheless the Committee deliberated on the effectiveness of the choice at a time when liquidity injection had been forecast to rise tangentially in the second half of the year. The outcome therefore, would most likely exacerbate inflationary pressure, cause higher pressure on the exchange rate as demand 10 for forex increases and return real rate into negative territory as nominal interest rate fall lower than the inflation rate. Owing to the poor transmission mechanism as a result of structural rigidities, the reduction in the MPR may not necessarily transmit to lowering market lending rate on account of the high cost of doing business. The Committee further noted that loosening could worsen the current account balance through increase in importation, margin lending, lowering of risk evaluation in accessing loans which will drive up loans and likely increase in NPLs with potential negative consequence on the stability of the banking industry. The cost of liquidity management would also rise considerably. The Committee, while arguing for a hold, observed that the downside risk to growth and upside risk to inflation appears balanced as growth is improving while inflation is moderating. Maintaining the current policy stance would sustain gradual improvements in both indices. It was noted that there is need to see how all the components of GDP would evolve in the second quarter of 2018 in order to gain greater clarity on the direction of monetary policy. In summary, the predominant argument for a hold at this time is to await more clarity on the evolution of key indicators ie. the passage and implementation of the budget, economic activities, and traction in fiscal policy in 2018. Overall the Committee was convinced that the economy needed a new impetus of increased lending by the banking system and would work with the Bank to adopt innovative ways to encourage the deposit money banks (DMBs) to adopt innovative ways to accelerate credit growth, including a reduction 11 in the policy rate when conditions for such a decision arise. The MPC noted that at single digit inflation and higher reserve levels, the risks associated with a policy rate reduction under conditions of wavering foreign capital inflows and an unstable oil market, including other severe uncertainties, could be better managed to deliver macroeconomic stability in Nigeria. In consideration of the foregoing, therefore, the Committee decided by a vote of 8 members to retain the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) at 140 per cent alongside all other policy parameters. One member, however, voted to increase the MPR by 50 basis points. Consequently the MPC voted to retain the: MPR at 140 per cent; CRR at 225 per cent; Liquidity Ratio at 300 per cent; and Asymmetric corridor at +200 and -500 basis points around the MPR. Thank you for listening. Godwin I Emefiele Governor. Central Bank of Nigeria 22nd May, 2018 12."
Turkiye,2018-05-23,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term interest rates at the following levels:. a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate has been kept at 9.25 percent and borrowing rate has been kept at 7.25 percent,. b) One-week repo rate has been kept at 8 percent,. c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent, while lending rate has been increased from 13.5 percent to 16.5 percent. Current elevated levels of inflation and inflation expectations continue to pose risks on the pricing behavior. Accordingly, the Committee decided to implement a strong monetary tightening to support price stability. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. Tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained decisively until inflation outlook displays a significant improvement. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
South Korea,2018-05-24,"Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period. This press release is the English version of the Bank of Korea's policy statement. In the case of any inconsistency, the original version in Korean will prevail. The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Board considers that the global economy has continued its robust growth. Financial markets in some emerging market economies with weak external soundness have shown instability, as capital outflows from them have increased. Looking ahead the Board sees global economic growth as likely to be affected by factors such as the paces of monetary policy normalization in major countries, the movements toward spreading trade protectionism, and the directions of the US government's economic policies. The Board judges that the solid trend of domestic economic growth has continued, as consumption and exports have shown favorable movements although facilities investment has slowed somewhat. Employment conditions have been sluggish, with the extent of increase in the number of persons employed having remained at a low level. Going forward the Board expects domestic economic growth to be generally consistent with the path projected in April. It anticipates that investment will slow but that the trend of steady increase in consumption will continue, and that exports will also sustain their favorable movements thanks to the buoyancy of the global economy. Consumer price inflation has risen to the mid-1% level, due mainly to increases in the prices of agricultural products. Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has also been in the mid-1% range, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has remained at the mid-2% level. Looking ahead it is forecast that consumer price inflation, after remaining in the mid-1% range for some time, will pick up and gradually approach the target level from the second half of this year. Core inflation will also gradually rise. The domestic financial markets have been generally stable. Although long-term market interest rates have increased, under the effects chiefly of rising government bond yields in major countries, the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has fluctuated within a relatively narrow range, in line mainly with the global strengthening of the US dollar and with the decline in risks related to North Korea. Household lending has sustained its higher rate of expansion than in past years, led by unsecured loans. The paces of increase in housing sales prices have slowed, especially in some parts of Seoul and its surrounding areas. Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As it is forecast that inflationary pressures on the demand side will not be high for the time being, while the domestic economy is expected to continue its solid growth, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance. In this process it will judge carefully whether it is necessary to adjust its accommodative monetary policy stance further, while closely checking future economic growth and inflation trends. It will also carefully monitor any changes in the monetary policies of major countries, conditions related to trade with major countries, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks."
Ukraine,2018-05-24,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to keep its key policy rate at 17.0%. The current monetary conditions are sufficiently tight to bring inflation to its medium-term target. Inflation continued to decline in AprilMay 2018, as projected by the NBU. According to the State Statistics Service of Ukraine, headline inflation decelerated to 13.1% yoy last month. This was a minor deviation from the NBU's latest forecast, caused by the most volatile components and likely to vanish in the coming months. In line with the NBU's preliminary estimates, inflation is expected to decrease markedly in May, reflecting both statistical base effect and a significant drop in food prices. The NBU's tight monetary policy continued to contain the underlying inflationary pressure. Thisin the core inflation measure that remained unchanged in April, at 9.4%, and was in line with the NBU's projections. The effect of the tight monetary policy has mostly been seen in the exchange rate channel, with the hryvnia having strengthened since the end of January 2018. There are signs of some improvement in inflation expectations as well. Headline inflation will continue to decrease gradually according to the NBU's forecast published in the April 2018 Inflation Report. It will reach 8.9% as of the end of 2018 and will return to its target range in mid-2019. This will be further driven by the monetary conditions, which are already sufficiently tight. At the same time, this forecast will remain relevant only if its key assumption materializes, which is the sustained progress in structural reforms, particularly under the IMF's Extended Fund Facility. These reforms are critical for both maintaining the macrofinancial stability and ensuring the long-term economic growth in Ukraine. The near future will be crucial for taking decisions that are important for extending cooperation with Ukraine's official lenders. The need for this cooperation has become stronger as developing countries' access to the global capital market is narrowing. Borrowing costs are rising for these countries amid the US dollar appreciation, increased geopolitical tensions, and risks of trade wars. The NBU Board believes that, conditional on the materialization of baseline scenario assumptions the current monetary stance is tight enough to reduce inflation over the medium term. In this light, the NBU Board has decided to keep its key policy rate at 17.0%. Alongside, if risks to lower inflation and macrofinancial stability rise, including due to a lack of progress in structural reforms and access to official financing, the NBU may hike the key policy rate to the level sufficient to drive inflation back to the established medium-term targets. The decision to maintain the key policy rate at 17.0% is approved by NBU Board Decision No. 287-D On the Key Policy Rate dated 24 May 2018. The next meeting of the NBU Board on monetary policy issues will be held on 12 July 2018 as scheduled."
South Africa,2018-05-24,"South African Reserve Bank PRESS STATEMENT EMBARGO DELIVERY 24 May 2018 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank In recent weeks, the resurgent US1 dollar and higher US long-bond yields have led to sharply lower capital flows to the emerging markets. These developments, coupled with persistently rising international oil prices, have contributed to the reversal of some of the recent rand strength, tilting the balance of risks to the domestic inflation outlook to the upside. Nevertheless, inflation is expected to remain within the inflation target range over the entire forecast period. The domestic economic growth outlook has improved moderately amid rising business and consumer confidence, despite a disappointing first-quarter performance in a number of key sectors. 1 United States MPC Statement May 24th, 2018 Page 1. 1 United States MPC Statement May 24th, 2018 Page 1 The year-on-year inflation rate, as measured by the consumer price index for all urban areas, reached a seven-year low of 3.8% in March 2018 before increasing to 4.5% in April, as the impact of the VAT2 increase and other levies became evident. Goods price inflation increased from 2.6% to 3.5% while services price inflation increased from 5.1% to 5.3%. The South African Reserve Bank's (SARB) measure of core inflation  which excludes food, fuel and electricity  increased from 4.1% to 4.5%. Year-on-year producer price inflation for final manufactured goods declined from 4.2% in February to 3.7% in March. The headline inflation forecast of the SARB is more or less unchanged since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), despite the upward adjustments to the international oil price assumption and the weaker starting point for the trade-weighted exchange rate. The impact of these adjustments on the inflation forecast was offset in part by a lower food price forecast and a lower starting point. This follows a succession of downside surprises in core goods and food price outcomes. The forecasts for 2018 and 2019 are unchanged at 4.9% and 5.2% respectively, while the forecast for 2020 is marginally higher at 5.2% compared with 5.1% previously. The peak of 5.5% is still expected in the first quarter of 2019 before the impact of the VAT increase largely dissipates. The forecast for core inflation is marginally lower, at 4.5% for 2018, but has deteriorated somewhat more than headline inflation in the coming two years, to 5.1% in both years, from 4.9% previously. A peak of 5.2% is expected in the first quarter of 2019. 2 value-added tax MPC Statement May 24th, 2018 Page 2. 2 value-added tax MPC Statement May 24th, 2018 Page 2 The implied starting point for the rand in the forecast is R12.37 against the US dollar compared with R11.97 at the time of the previous MPC meeting. Food prices, by contrast, are expected to increase by 4.9% in 2018 and by 5.5% in 2019, lower than in the previous forecast. There is a degree of uncertainty regarding the likely impact of the VAT increase and the sugar tax on food, and the extent to which these increases will be absorbed by manufacturers and retailers. Following persistent increases in international oil prices since February, the assumptions for Brent crude oil in the SARB's Quarterly Projection Model were revised upwards by US$7 per barrel to US$70 for 2018 and by US$5 per barrel, to US$67, for the next two years. Both the futures markets and the consensus forecasts indicate some moderation of prices over the next two years. The inflation expectations of market analysts reflected in the Reuters Econometer survey have moderated somewhat since March. In the May survey, median inflation was expected to average 4.9% in 2018, rising to 5.3% in 2020, compared with 5.0% and 5.5% respectively in the March survey. Expectations implicit in the break-even inflation rates (i.e. the yield differential between conventional and inflation-linked government bonds) are more volatile and more sensitive to exchange rate movements. These expectations show some increase following the recent rand weakness. While the longer-term expectations are back above 6.0%, the five-year break-even rate remains within the target range. The next BER3 inflation expectations survey will be published in July. 3 Bureau for Economic Research MPC Statement May 24th, 2018 Page 3. 3 Bureau for Economic Research MPC Statement May 24th, 2018 Page 3 The global economic backdrop has become more challenging amid continuing trade policy tensions between the US and China as well as other geopolitical risks. Although the economic growth outlook in the advanced economies generally remains positive, there are signs that the momentum may be slowing. Global inflation remains on a moderate upward trend, but still at low levels. However, the rising international oil prices could derail the relatively benign global inflation prognosis. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand has depreciated significantly, against the US dollar in particular, reversing much of the overvaluation seen at that time. Since then, the rand has depreciated by 6.0% against the US dollar, by 0.7% against the euro, and by 2.8% on a trade-weighted basis. The main driver of this recent rand weakness has been developments in the US financial markets, where Treasury yields exceeded 3.0% for the first time since July 2011. This was in response to wider fiscal deficits, rising inflation expectations and expectations of further US monetary policy tightening  a key risk highlighted in the previous MPC statement. As a consequence, a number of emerging markets have experienced capital outflows and currency depreciation, with those with wider current account deficits and other macroeconomic imbalances being most vulnerable. Month-to-date in May, non-residents have been net sellers of South African government bonds to the value of R33.6 billion, contributing to the sharp increase in long-term domestic bond yields. MPC Statement May 24th, 2018 Page 4 At this stage, the likelihood of further sustained dollar strengthening is unclear. Apart from US domestic issues, it is likely to be influenced by geopolitical risks, trade conflicts, and expectations of changes in monetary policy in other advanced economies. In the near term, the rand is expected to remain volatile, with movements dominated by the changing assessment of these global trends. Domestically, an expected moderate widening of the current account deficit, a result of deteriorating terms of trade, could also weigh on the rand. The domestic growth outlook remains challenging, although growth is still expected to outperform recent year outcomes. This is despite the possibility of a contraction in GDP4 in the first quarter of this year, following negative growth in both the mining and the manufacturing sectors. The SARB's forecast for GDP growth is unchanged at 1.7% for 2018, but has been revised up from 1.5% to 1.7% for 2019. The forecast for 2020 is unchanged at 2.0%. The forecast remains consistent with a closing of the negative output gap by 2020, but at a slightly faster pace than before. The continued increase in the composite leading business cycle indicator confirms the upward momentum in the economy. The growth outlook is underpinned by strong recoveries in both business and consumer confidence. The RMB5/BER Business Confidence Index, while still below the neutral level, increased by an unusually large 11 index points from 34 in the fourth quarter of 2017 to 45 in the first quarter of 2018. This is expected to be supportive of higher growth in gross fixed capital formation, particularly by the private 4 gross domestic product 5 Rand Merchant Bank MPC Statement May 24th, 2018 Page 5. This is expected to be supportive of higher growth in gross fixed capital formation, particularly by the private 4 gross domestic product 5 Rand Merchant Bank MPC Statement May 24th, 2018 Page 5 sector. The recent signing by government of the Independent Power Producer programme has added to the improved outlook. The FNB6/BER Consumer Confidence Index surged from negative territory to an all- time high in the first quarter, driven mainly by the positive reaction to domestic political developments. However, there is a general expectation that this move may represent an overshoot, and some correction is likely in the coming quarter. Nevertheless, consumption expenditure by households is expected to be the main driver of growth going forward, and the likely trend over the forecast period is stronger than previously expected. This is despite headwinds from the VAT and petrol price increases, as well as slow employment growth. Consumption expenditure growth is forecast to remain below 2.0% in both 2018 and 2019, but is expected to reach 2.5% in 2020, compared with 2.1% previously. Apart from improved confidence, this positive prognosis is supported by lower near- term inflation, lower interest rates, positive wealth effects, and real wage growth. Although growth in bank credit extension to households remains subdued and negative in real terms, a moderate upward trend has been evident since the beginning of 2017, alongside an improvement in household balance sheets. Nominal wage growth trends remain more or less unchanged, and upward pressure on inflation from this source is therefore expected to persist. Nominal average wage growth is expected to be sticky around the 7.0% level over the forecast period. Real wage increases are expected to remain positive and in excess of productivity growth. The outcome of the public-sector wage negotiations is still unclear. 6 First National Bank MPC Statement May 24th, 2018 Page 6. 6 First National Bank MPC Statement May 24th, 2018 Page 6 Employment trends remain a cause for concern. According to the Quarterly Labour Force Survey of Statistics South Africa, over the year to the first quarter of 2018, employment increased by 165 000, mainly in the informal sector of the economy. While unemployment declined from 27.7% to 26.7%, this was partly due to a marked increase in discouraged workers, underlining the lack of employment prospects. The MPC noted the relative stability of the inflation forecast, despite changes in a number of the key assumptions. As expected, the bottom of the inflation cycle has been reached, and the trajectory of headline inflation is forecast to remain within the target range. The April inflation outcome was in line with the SARB's short-term forecast and reflected a relatively moderate pass-through from the higher VAT and sugar tax. The full impact of the VAT increase may still be felt in the coming months. In contrast with the previous meeting, the MPC assesses the risks to the inflation forecast to have moved to the upside. This change is mainly due to global developments. A key uncertainty relates to the outlook for the dollar, which has appreciated against most currencies. The spillover effects on emerging markets could become more severe in the event of further significant increases in US bond yields. Oil prices also pose an upside risk to the inflation forecast. Current spot prices are significantly above the levels assumed in the Quarterly Projection Model. Furthermore, a slight moderation in prices followed by a flat trajectory is assumed in the coming two years. There may be a degree of upside risk to this assumption. MPC Statement May 24th, 2018 Page 7 Greater clarity with regard to electricity tariffs is expected in June when Nersa7 is scheduled to respond to Eskom's application for an increase in the order of 30%. The SARB's current assumptions are for an 8.0% increase from mid-2019 and a further similar increase in mid-2020. The possibility of an increase in excess of these assumptions poses an upside risk to our inflation forecast. The upside risks identified above are supply-side shocks. As has been noted in the past, the MPC attempts to â€˜look through' the first-round effects of such shocks and to react to second-round effects. The evolution of inflation expectations and wage settlements will be important indicators in this regard. The growth forecast has improved moderately, mainly for 2019, but remains too low to make serious inroads into the unemployment rate. The risks to the forecast remain on the upside, but slightly less so than at the previous MPC meeting. The weak first- quarter growth outcome is not expected to derail the upward trend and does not yet reflect the renewed business and consumer optimism. Despite the stronger expected trend in household consumption expenditure, there is still evidence of slack in the economy, and demand pressures in the economy are not assessed to pose a risk to the inflation outlook. In light of the change in the balance of risks to the inflation outlook, the MPC unanimously decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 6.5% per annum. 7 National Energy Regulator of South Africa MPC Statement May 24th, 2018 Page 8. 7 National Energy Regulator of South Africa MPC Statement May 24th, 2018 Page 8 At these levels, the MPC still assesses the stance of monetary policy to be accommodative and appropriate given the forecast inflation trajectory and the current state of the economy. However, with risks and uncertainties at high levels, the MPC will maintain its vigilance to ensure that inflation remains well within the inflation target range, and will adjust the policy stance should the need arise. The implied path of policy rates generated by the SARB's Quarterly Projection Model reflects one increase of 25 basis points during the final quarter of this year and a similar increase in mid-2019. Two further increases are indicated in 2020. The generated path remains a broad policy guide, and the extent to which the MPC follows it will be determined by, among other things, the MPC's assessment of the balance of risks to the forecast.

Pakistan,2018-05-25,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement May 25, 2018 Pakistan's economic growth is provisionally estimated to achieve thirteen-year high level of. percent for FY18. Concurrently headline inflation remains moderate and is expected to stay well below the annual target of. percent. However since the last meeting, in MPC's assessment the balance-of-risks to the sustainability of the healthy-growth-low-inflation nexus have shifted due to the following reasons. First the balance- of-payments picture, despite an increase in exports and some deceleration in imports, has further deteriorated due to sharp increase in international oil prices and limited financial inflows to date. Second the revised estimate for fiscal deficit stands at. percent of GDP as compared to initial target of. percent for FY18, reflecting significantly higher level of fiscal expansion than previously anticipated. These twin deficits- depicting the elevated aggregate demand in the country, are adversely affecting the near-term macroeconomic stability. The headline CPI inflation remains moderate averaging. percent during the first ten months of FY18, mainly owing to low food inflation. Indeed the average food inflation, clocked in. percent during Jul-Apr FY18, whereas the year-on-year food inflation was close to zero in March and April 2018. This has been possible due to adequate stocks of wheat and sugar along with smooth supply of perishables. Contrary to this, average of YoY NFNE-core inflation during the last two months has risen to. percent, which reflects the building up of inflationary pressures in the economy. significant change in the outlook for international oil prices with its impact on upward adjustments in domestic oil prices, strong demand, the lagged pass-through of exchange rate adjustments, food inflation maintaining its current course and the stoking of survey-based measures of inflationary expectations will largely determine the inflation path in the remaining period of FY18 and for FY19. Conditional upon these developments, the average inflation for FY18 is projected to remain within SBP's model-based range of.5-4. percent whereas the average FY19 inflation is estimated to be marginally above the annual target of percent. Turning to the supply side, the real sector has posted broad-based healthy growth in FY18. Helped by strong growth in major crops and modest increase in livestock, agriculture sector has not only recorded notable improvement over the last year but also surpassed the annual growth target of. percent. Meanwhile industrial sector grew by. percent, primarily because of vibrant construction activity and notable improvement in large-scale manufacturing. These gains in the commodity-producing sector along with growing aggregate demand have pushed the growth in services to. percent. Keeping in view this strong growth momentum and the upcoming investments in auto and construction allied industries, the government has set the real GDP growth target of. percent for FY19. However SBP's assessment of overall macroeconomic picture suggests that this target is ambitious and would critically depend on managing the growing pressures on the external account -discussed below, while ensuring that average inflation is contained close to its target in FY19. Broad money supply saw net expansion of only. percent during 1st Jul to 18th May FY18 as compared to. percent during the same period last year. The monetary expansion in FY18 is entirely driven by government borrowing for budgetary support and the continuation of well diversified healthy growth in credit to the private sector. The private businesses borrowed Rs. 482 MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN billion for both the working capital and fixed investments during Jul-Apr FY18. Meanwhile consumer financing also saw net expansion of Rs. 69 billion, which contributes to higher demand of industrial products, especially of automobiles and consumer durables. Barring the aforementioned risks associated with growth and recovering commodity prices, these trends are likely to persist in the coming months of FY19 as the private sector continues to adjust its funding needs in line with the requirements of the growing economy, especially related to CPEC investments. However the expansionary impact of net domestic assets on the broad money supply was partially offset by net contraction in foreign assets of the banking sector in FY18 so far. Specifically NFA of the banking sector saw net contraction of Rs 600 billion during 1st Jul to 18th May FY18, capturing the monetary impact of external sector developments. On the external front, the current account deficit widened to US$ 14. billion during the first ten months of FY18, which is. times the level of deficit realized during the same period last year. Despite strong recovery in exports (YoY increase of 13. percent during Jul-Apr FY18) and moderate increase in workers' remittances (YoY growth of. percent), the growing imports to support higher economic activity and the sharp increase in oil prices have pushed the current account deficit to higher level. In the absence of sufficient projected financial flows, portion of this higher current account deficit was managed by using country's own resources during FY18. Consequently SBP's liquid FX reserves saw net reduction of US$. billion to reach US$ 10. billion as of 18th May 2018. Reflecting the increasing pressures in the external sector. PKR has depreciated by. percent against the USD up till 24th May 2018. The near-term sustainability of prevailing higher current account deficit critically depends on the realization and further mobilization of financial flows. The need for deep rooted structural reforms to improve the country's competitiveness can hardly be over emphasized for medium to long term sustainability of balance of payments. In the light of the above discussions and developments, the Monetary Policy Committee has decided to increase the policy rate by 50bps to.50 percent effective from Monday 28th May 2018."
Israel,2018-05-28,"The inflation environment continues to rise, supported by the accommodative monetary policy, but remains below the target. One-year expectations and forecasts are slightly below the lower bound of the target range, and inflation expectations for two years and longer are within the target. In the first quarter as well, the economy grew at a solid pace and in a balanced manner. Services exports continued to grow at a rapid rate and growth in goods exports continued. The labor market remains tight. After some slowing, business sector wages resumed rising, at a more rapid rate. Data regarding theglobal economy remain positive, though the picture now is less even. In recent weeks, the risk of a trade war breaking out declined, but geopolitical risks continue, and the financial risk in emerging markets increased. In the US, the normalization of monetary policy is expected to continue, while in Europe. Japan, and the UK inflation is weakening and the withdrawal from monetary accommodation will likely be deferred. In the past year, the nominal effective exchange rate has been relatively stable. Since the previous interest rate decision, there has been an appreciation of 1.4 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. In the past 6 months, home prices declined by 2.7 percent. The number of transactions by buyers upgrading their homes continues to decline, but the most recent data indicate an increase in transactions by first home buyers. The decline in residential construction investment continues. TheMonetary Committee intends to maintain the accommodative policy as long as necessary in order to entrench the inflation environment within the target range. The Bank of Israel continues to monitor developments in inflation, the real economy, the financial markets, and the global economy,and will act to attain the monetary policy targets in accordance with such developments. For the file of data accompanying this notice, clickhere. Graphs and data. In the 12 months ending in April, the inflation rate was 0.4 percent (Figure 1 in the attached data file), and inflation measured by indices that exclude transitory effects is higher, though still below the target (Figure 2). The inflation rate of tradable goods prices continued to increase, impactedby the rise in energy prices and stabilization of the exchange rate, and is near zero. Inflation in nontradable items is relatively low (Figure 3). Since the previous interest rate decision, there has been an increase in inflation expectations from various sources: the 1-year inflation expectationsand forecasts are still below the lower bound of the target range (Figure 4), though forward expectations for inflation beginning from the second year are within the range, and longer-term expectations are anchored around the midpoint of the target range (Figure 5). The effective exchange rate remains relatively stable. Since the previous interest rate decision there has beenan appreciation of 1.4 percent, after a depreciation in the weeks preceding it (Figure 6). Since the previous interest rate decision, yields on government bonds in Israel and abroad have increased, and the spread between the nominal yield on 10-year Israeli government bonds and the yield on similar US Treasury securities was stable (Figure 7). The real-yield spreads between corporate and government bonds have widened since the beginning of the yearbut are still at a low level (Figure 8). Economic activity continued to expand at a solid pace in the first quarter of 2018, and the growth remains balanced: based on the firstestimate of National Accounts data (Figure 11). GDP grew by 4.2 percent (seasonally adjusted, in annual terms) and all the main uses increased, except for residential investment. Exports continued to grow. Services exports are growing rapidly but there was also growth of goods exports (Figure 13), impacted by opposing factors: a sharp decline in exports of pharmaceuticals and a steep increase in exports of electronic components. Durable goods purchases increased at a rapid pace against the background of elevated imports of vehicles, but there was also solid growth of current private consumption, public consumption (excluding defense imports), and nonconstruction investment. The labor market remains tight, with the unemployment rate still low and the participation and employment rates remaining high (Figure 14). After some slowdown in the preceding months, wages in the business sector resumed rising at a more rapid rate (Figure 15), against the background of an increase in the minimum wage and the strong demand for workers, reflected as well in the prolonged decline in the ratio of jobseekers to the number of job vacancies in most occupations (Figure 16). Since the decline in home prices began, they have declined by 2.7 percent (in the past six months for which data was published) (Figure 9). The number of transactions by homeowners upgrading their homes continues to decline, but the most recent data indicate an increase in transactions by first home buyers. New mortgage volume continues to increase and mortgage interest rates are stabilizing after declining in 2017 (Figure 10). Globaleconomic data remain positive, though after several quarters in which growth encompassed most economies, the current picture is less even. The IMF revised upward its growth forecast for major economies (Figure 17), and world trade continued to expand (Figure 18). In recent weeks the risk of a trade war breaking out has declined, and it appears that the sides are attempting to reach agreements. In contrast, geopolitical tension has increased. Equity market prices in advanced economies rose slightly, against the background of positive financial reports by US companies (Figure 19). Most major central banks continued to adopt accommodative monetary policy. Inflation in the US ranged near its target, while in Europe. Japan, and the UK it continued to weaken (Figure 20): a development that is likelyto defer steps to begin withdrawing from the monetary accommodation. The US economy is close to full employment and continued to grow at a solid pace in the first quarter. Leading indicators point to the positive momentum continuing in the second quarter. The Federal Reserve left the federal funds rate unchanged in its most recent decision, but is expected to increase the rate twice more in 2018. In Europe, moderate growth continued. The ECB left its accommodative monetary policy in place. In Japan, activity contracted in the first quarter, after eight quarters of expansion. Financial risk increased in emerging economies against the background of capital outflows that derived from the increased yields in the US and the strengthening of the dollar. Crude oil prices increased rapidly (Figure 22). The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on June 11, 2018. The next decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Monday. July 9, 2018, followed by a press briefing with the Governor."
Kazakhstan,2018-06-04,"Press-release –14 The base rate reduced to 9% June 4, 2018 Almaty The National Bank of Kazakhstan has decided to reduce the base rate to the level of 9% with a corridor of +/-1%. The annual inflation rate has continued to decrease within the target range for 2018. The current level of the base rate continues to ensure maintaining the inflation deceleration within the target corridor in the current and following year and the medium-term target for the inflation rate at the level of 4% as of the end of 2020. Along with that the monetary policy conditions remain neutral. However on the background of the possibility of the inflationary risks realization in both short- term and medium-term, the potential for the further cuts of the base rate in 2018 has decreased. In May the annual inflation has continued to decelerate and has amounted to 6.2%. In contrast to the beginning of the year the decrease for all components (food and nonfood goods and services to the households) is being observed. The main risks that limit the inflation deceleration until the end of the current year and in the following year are the increase of the world food prices, the import of the inflation from the countries  main trade partners, the growth of domestic consumption caused by the increase of consumer and investment demand. The current level of inflation in the countries  main trade partners is at the levels below the target values; however the potential of its disinflationary effect is gradually getting exhausted. The forecast estimates for the medium term demonstrate achievement of the target levels, which raise the risk of the inflationary pressure on the domestic inflation in Kazakhstan. The FAO Food Price index has increased by 2.7% in the annual terms. The cereal and dairy products prices have continued to increase. The tightening of the external monetary conditions is accompanied by the capital outflows from the developing countries. Observed since the beginning of 2018, the world oil market continues to exert the favorable influence. The oil price averaged at the level close to 70 US dollars per barrel. Since the beginning of the current year in the economy of Kazakhstan the increase in the households' consumption, sustained by the growth of the real income after two years of decrease and also by the consumer lending, is being observed. The dynamics of the economic activity persists. The value of the short-term economic indicator in January-April in 2018 has amounted to 5.0% in the annual terms. The positive contribution was made by the mining (4.9%) and manufacturing (5.9%) industries, trade (6.2%) and also the improving performance in agriculture (3.8%). The growth of the fixed capital investments has amounted to 28.9% in January-April 2018. Based on that, according to the estimates of the National Bank, the output and the domestic consumption gaps are turning positive, which will intensify the inflationary pressures. The inflationary expectations remain sensitive to the various shocks and mainly depend on the current situation in the market. In April due to the nominal exchange rate shock the expected level of inflation for the year ahead has increased to 6.3%, decreasing to 6.0% in May. The perceivable inflation continues to decrease. The share of the responders, who believes that â€œin the past 12 months the price of goods and services has increased with the faster rate than beforeâ€, has decreased from 48.8% in April to 46.2% in May. The monetary conditions remain on the neutral level. The deceleration of the downtrend of the actual inflation rate and also the increased probability of inflationary risks realization in the medium term restrict the National Bank to further reduce the base rate in the current year. With the purpose to manage the inflationary expectations and to further decrease them, it is possible that the monetary conditions might get tightened in perspective. The next decision on the base rate will be announced on July 9, 2018 at 17:00 Astana time."
India,2018-06-06,"Second Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2018-19 Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) Reserve Bank of India On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation at its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to: increase the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 25 basis points to 6.25 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF stands adjusted to 6.0 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate to 6.50 per cent. The decision of the MPC is consistent with the neutral stance of monetary policy in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Assessment 2. Since the last meeting of the MPC in April, global economic activity has continued to expand, though there has been some easing of momentum. Among advanced economies (AEs), the US economy began the year on a weak note on soft private spending and reduced residential investment; however, there seems to be a rebound in Q2:2018 with strong retail sales and improved employment data. The Euro Area growth decelerated in Q1; recent industrial production data as well as weak consumer and business sentiment suggest a loss of pace. The Japanese economy contracted in Q1, though it is expected to turn around in Q2 as indicated by recent data prints on exports and the manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI). Economic activity in major emerging market economies (EMEs) remained largely resilient. The Chinese economy maintained a strong momentum in Q1; more recent data on industrial production and PMI suggest that growth is likely to hold steady in Q2. The Russian economy appears to have picked up in recent months after a soft end to 2017; both 124 on heightened geo-political tensions, but moderated thereafter on expectations of easing of supplies by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia. Base metal prices, especially aluminium, have risen on account of US sanctions on Russia. Gold has witnessed selling pressure on a stronger dollar, but the metal gained last week on political uncertainty in the Euro Area. Inflation pressures have emerged in some key advanced and emerging economies, driven in part by rising commodity prices. Financial markets have been driven mainly by monetary policy expectations and geo- political developments. Equity market performance has varied across regions with modest gains in the AEs on strong Q1 earnings and abating of trade tensions, while stocks in major EMEs have faced sell offs on a rising dollar and expectations of further rate hikes by the Fed. The 10- year sovereign yield in the US crossed 3 per cent in mid-May on strong economic data as well as expectations of tighter monetary policy and fiscal expansion, but softened subsequently on safe haven demand; yields softened in other key AEs as well. In most EMEs, however, bond yields have risen on reduced foreign appetite for their debt due to growing dollar shortage in the global market and on prospects of higher interest rates in AEs. In currency markets, the US dollar touched its highest level in May since December 2017. The euro depreciated significantly against the dollar reflecting a combination of factors, including soft growth data for the Euro Area, which suggested that monetary policy normalisation by the European Central Bank could be delayed, and political uncertainty in its southern periphery. EME currencies have, by and large, depreciated against the US dollar. On the domestic front, the Central Statistics Office (CSO) released on May 31 the quarterly estimates of national income accounts for Q4:2017-18 and provisional estimates for 2017-18. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth for 2017-18 has been estimated at 6.7 per cent, up by 0.1 percentage point from the second advance estimates released on February 28. This increase in growth has been underpinned by a significant upward revision in private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) due especially to improved rural demand on the back of a bumper harvest and the government's thrust on rural housing and infrastructure. Quarterly data suggest that the economy grew at 7.7 per cent in Q4:2017-18  the fastest pace in the last seven quarters. Gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) growth accelerated for three consecutive quarters up to Q4. On the supply side, estimates of agriculture and allied activities have been revised upwards, supported by an all-time high production of foodgrains and horticulture during the year. On a quarterly basis, agriculture growth increased sharply in Q4:2017-18. On April 16, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast a normal south-west monsoon rainfall, which was reaffirmed on May 30. This augurs well for the agricultural sector. 23.9 per cent in March. Food inflation moderated for the fourth successive month, pulled down by vegetables due to lower than the usual seasonal increase in their prices, and pulses and sugar which continued to experience deflation. However, within the food group, inflation increased in respect of cereals, fruits, prepared meals, meat and fish. Fuel group inflation declined for the fifth month in a row in April mainly on account of a fall in the inflation of liquefied petroleum gas in line with international prices, and electricity. However, inflation in other major items of fuel such as firewood and chips, dung cake, kerosene and coal inched up. Inflation in the transport and communication sub-group accelerated due to the firming up of international crude oil prices, even though the domestic pass-through to petrol and diesel was incomplete. Inflation also picked up in clothing, household goods and services, health, recreation, education, and personal care and effects. The May 2018 round of the Reserve Bank's survey of households reported a significant rise in households' inflation expectations of 90 basis points (bps) and 130 bps, respectively, for three-month and one-year ahead horizons. Manufacturing firms polled in the Reserve Bank's IOS reported input price pressures and an increase in selling prices in Q1:2018-19. Firms polled 3496 billion on a daily net average basis due to increased government spending, especially in the second half of the month. Reflecting easy liquidity conditions, the weighted average call rate (WACR) softened to 5.89 per cent in April (from 5.96 per cent in March). However, surplus liquidity in the system moderated considerably in the first half of May and the system moved into deficit in the third week of May mainly due to inflows on account of the goods and services tax (GST). The Reserve Bank conducted an open market operation purchase auction on May 17, 2018 to inject liquidity of â‚¹100 billion into the system. The system again turned into surplus in the last week of May reflecting mainly the payment of food subsidies. Surplus liquidity absorbed under the LAF on a daily net average basis declined to â‚¹142 billion in May. The WACR in May at 5.88 per cent remained broadly at the April 2018 level. India's exports grew in April 2018 after a marginal dip in the preceding month, supported mainly by non-oil exports, particularly engineering goods and chemicals. Import growth decelerated sequentially in April 2018; a significant decline in imports of gold as well as pearl and precious stones more than offset the impact of rising crude oil prices. Nevertheless, the trade deficit expanded in March and April from its level a year ago. External financing remained comfortable in 2017-18. While net foreign direct investment in 2017-18 was broadly comparable with the previous year, net foreign portfolio flows were stronger due to a sharp turnaround in debt inflows. However, foreign portfolio investors withdrew US$ 6.7 billion on a net basis from the domestic capital market in 2018-19 (up to June 4) reflecting volatility in global financial markets. India's foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 412 billion on June 1, 2018. Outlook 15. The first bi-monthly resolution of 2018-19 in April projected CPI inflation in the range of 4.7-5.1 per cent in H1:2018-19 and 4.4 per cent in H2, including the HRA impact for central government employees with risks tilted to the upside. Excluding the impact of HRA revisions. CPI inflation was projected at 4.4-4.7 per cent in H1:2018-19 and 4.4 per cent in H2. Actual inflation outcomes since the April policy have evolved broadly on the lines of the projected trajectory. However, there has been an important compositional shift. While the summer momentum in vegetable prices was weaker than the usual pattern, there was an abrupt acceleration in CPI inflation excluding food and fuel. The headline inflation outlook is driven primarily by two countervailing effects. On the one hand. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel rose sharply in April over March by 80 basis points to reach an ex-HRA level of 5.3 per cent, suggesting a hardening of underlying inflationary pressures. Furthermore, since the MPC's meeting in early April, the price of Indian basket of crude surged from US$ 66 a barrel to US$ 74. This, along with an increase in other global commodity prices and recent global financial market developments, has resulted in a firming up of input cost pressures, as also confirmed in the Reserve Bank's IOS for manufacturing firms in Q2:2018-19. The resulting pick-up in the momentum of inflation excluding food, fuel and HRA has imparted persistence into higher CPI projections for 2018-19. 45-7.6 per cent in H1 and 7.3-7.4 per cent in H2, with risks evenly balanced (Chart 2). A major upside risk to the baseline inflation path in the April resolution has materialised, viz., 12 per cent increase in the price of Indian crude basket, which was sharper, earlier than expected and seems to be durable. Crude oil prices have been volatile recently and this imparts considerable uncertainty to the inflation outlook  both on the upside and the downside. Several other risks remain. First, global financial market developments have emerged as another important source of uncertainty. Second, the significant rise in households' inflation expectations as gathered in the May 2018 round of the Reserve Bank's survey could feed into wages and input 56."

Global economic conditions remain favourable. In particular, economic activity in the euro area is high, despite some weakening of GDP growth in 2018 Q1. Similarly, in the United States, economic conditions remain good, while incoming data suggest that a slowdown in GDP growth in 2018 Q1 was temporary. In China, in turn, economic growth has continued at stable rates for the past few quarters. Despite favourable global economic conditions, inflation abroad remains moderate on the back of persistently low domestic inflationary pressure across many countries. At the same time, oil prices  even with a recent decline  are still significantly higher than a year ago. The European Central Bank keeps interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero, while still purchasing financial assets. At the same time, the Federal Reserve continues to gradually reduce its balance sheet, signalling further interest rate increases. In Poland, annual GDP growth in 2018 Q1 was close to that recorded in the previous quarter. Economic growth is driven by rising consumption, fuelled by increasing employment and wages, disbursement of benefits and very strong consumer sentiment. This is accompanied by a further recovery in investment. In 2018 Q1, also rising inventories were a significant factor supporting economic growth, while contribution of net exports was negative. Notwithstanding relatively high economic growth and wages rising faster than in the previous year, consumer price growth remains moderate. Inflation net of food and energy prices stays low. In the Council's assessment, current data continue to point to a favourable outlook for economic activity growth in Poland, despite the expected slight slowdown in GDP growth in the coming years. In line with the available forecasts, inflation will remain close to the target in the monetary policy transmission horizon. As a result, the Council judges that the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability."
Turkiye,2018-06-07,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to increase the policy rate (one week repo auction rate) from 16.5 percent to 17.75 percent. Recently released data indicate a rebalancing trend in the economic activity. External demand maintains its strength, while domestic demand displays a more moderate course. Cost factors have been the main driver of the recent upsurge in inflation. On the other hand, price increases have shown a generalized pattern across subsectors. Despite the mild outlook for demand conditions, elevated levels of inflation and inflation expectations continue to pose risks on the pricing behavior. Accordingly, the Committee decided to further strengthen the monetary tightening to support price stability. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. Tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained decisively until inflation outlook displays a significant improvement. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Chile,2018-06-13,"P RESS RELEASE Wednesday, 13 June 2018 Monetary Policy Meeting * At its monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to hold the monetary policy interest rate at 2.5%, so the intensity of the monetary impulse is unchanged. The decision was adopted by the unanimous vote of all the Board members. The outlook for global growth shows no big changes and points to an expansion that on average will outperform that of the last three years. In the United States, data on prices, employment and wages suggest inflationary pressures have increased, as opposed to developments in Europe, where inflationary pressures appear more bounded. This has caused market expectations to anticipate a process of faster normalization of the US federal funds rate, and has sustained the strengthening of the dollar in multilateral terms. In its June meeting the Federal Reserve increased the policy rate for a second time this year. In this context, lower risk appetite has been observed, causing a depreciation of emerging economies' currencies, and in several of them spreads and long-term interest rates have increased. In any case, the growth forecasts have not changed significantly and most short-term indicators are generally stable. Exceptions are some countries in Latin America where adjustments to financial conditions have combined with idiosyncratic factors, giving way to downward revisions to their growth projections. Such are the cases of Argentina and Brazil. Regarding commodities, in recent days the copper price has risen significantly to near US$3.3 per pound. According to market reports, this rise would be transitory. The oil price is still above the estimates in the March Monetary Policy Report, so projections have been adjusted upwards. In the local financial system, the stability of long-term interest rates stands out, contrasting with many emerging economies. Interest rates on indexed securities have fallen, in line with higher inflation expectations. Domestic credit continues to be characterized by low interest rates and moderate growth in loans, beyond a rebound in commercial credit. The exchange rate has depreciated in line with the evolution of parities at the global level. Multilateral indicators show a milder depreciation of the Chilean peso. Activity and demand prints published since the last Meeting confirm a sustained recovery of the economy. The higher figures for the first four months of the year reflected the low base of comparison twelve months ago, the improved performance of several investment-related activities and some durables, as well as supply factors that are considered transitory. The labor market continues to show a lagged behavior regarding activity, in particular because of weak creation of private salaried employment. In contrast, importsâ€”of both consumer and capital goodsâ€”remain dynamic, business confidence (IMCE) and consumer confidence (IPEC) are at their best in several quarters, and financial conditions remain loose. In this context, compared with the last Meeting, the Economic Expectations Survey (EES) rose the expected growth for this year and next, in both cases to 3.8% (3.6% and 3.7% according to the April EES, respectively). The annual inflation of the CPI remained around 2% and the CPIEFE at 1.6%. The inflationary dynamic is still determined by the evolution of the exchange rate, in an economy where capacity gaps remain and by indexation to lower inflation rates. With this, the annual variation of the CPIEFE for goods persists in slightly negative territory and for services remains close to 3%. Inflation expectations have increased at shorter terms, approaching 3% one year head, coinciding with the higher price of oil and the peso depreciation of recent months. Two years ahead they are still around 3%. The Board's decision considered that both the latest data and the analysis in June's Monetary Policy Report point to decreased risks for inflation convergence. On the one hand, the recovery of the economy continues to consolidate and, on the other, perspectives for short term inflation have been revised upwards mainly due to the peso value of oil. Notwithstanding. CPIEFE inflation will have a similar path to the one forecasted in March in a line with an economy that still has capacity gaps. The Board foresees that the monetary stimulus will be kept around its current levels and will start to decrease as macroeconomic conditions keep driving inflation convergence towards 3%. Thus, the Board reaffirms its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the two-year policy horizon. The minutes of this Monetary Policy Meeting will be published at 8:30 hours of Thursday the 28 June 2018. The next Monetary Policy Meeting will take place on Monday 23-Tuesday 24 July 2018, and the statement thereof will be published at 18:00 hours of Tuesday 24. _The Spanish original prevails."
Georgia,2018-06-13,"13.06.2018 The National Bank Of Georgia Keeps Its Policy Rate Unchanged At 7.25% The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on June 13, 2018 and decided to keep the refinancing rate unchanged. In line with the current forecasts at the beginning of 2018 inflation rate declined towards the target level of 3% and stood at 2.5 percent in May. According to the forecasts, other things equal, inflation will be around the target throughout the year. Although aggregate demand is approaching the potential level of output, it still remains below it, thus exerting a downward pressure on inflation. Given relatively high volatility on international financial markets in recent period, the risks of having inflationary pressure transmitted from the main trading partner countries increased. Consequently, the Committee again deemed it appropriate to maintain the moderately tight monetary policy at this stage. The gradual easing of the policy will be considered once the factors pushing inflation upwards are sufficiently weakened. At the beginning of 2018, high growth of economic activity persisted. Based on preliminary estimates, in April economy grew by 6.5 percent annually, while in the first four months the annual real growth stood at 5.5 percent. The preliminary estimates reveal higher economic activity than the NBG forecasts indicated earlier. Hence, if the trend persists, the growth in 2018 will be relatively high as well, supporting the narrowing of the output gap at a faster pace. In line with the economic recovery, the growth rate of imports accelerated compared to last year and reached 23 percent in the five month of the current year, indicating an increase in domestic demand. On the other hand, the favourable trend in the external sector persists. Since the beginning of 2018, tourism revenues (25 percent annually) and exports (28 percent) have been increasing at a fast pace. Positive dynamics of remittances (21 percent) is also carrying on. To encourage the attraction of funds in lari, the Monetary Policy Committee decided to decrease the minimum reserve requirements on local currency funding from 7 to 5 percent. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all means and instruments at its disposal to ensure the price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on July 25, 2018."
United States,2018-06-13,"EDT June 13, 2018 Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in May indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a solid rate. Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has declined. Recent data suggest that growth of household spending has picked up, while business fixed investment has continued to grow strongly. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have moved close to 2 percent. Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term. Risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1-3/4 to 2 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were Jerome H Powell. Chairman; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Thomas I Barkin; Raphael W Bostic; Lael Brainard; Loretta J Mester; Randal K Quarles; and John C Williams."
Euroarea,2018-06-14,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. I would like to thank Deputy Governor Razmusa for her kind hospitality and express our special gratitude to her staff for the excellent organisation of today's meeting of the Governing Council. Since the start of our asset purchase programme (APP) in January 2015, the Governing Council has made net asset purchases under the APP conditional on the extent of progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation to levels below, but close to, 2% in the medium term. Today, the Governing Council undertook a careful review of the progress made, also taking into account the latest Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, measures of price and wage pressures, and uncertainties surrounding the inflation outlook. As a result of this assessment, the Governing Council concluded that progress towards a sustained adjustment in inflation has been substantial so far. With longer-term inflation expectations well anchored, the underlying strength of the euro area economy and the continuing ample degree of monetary accommodation provide grounds to be confident that the sustained convergence of inflation towards our aim will continue in the period ahead, and will be maintained even after a gradual winding-down of our net asset purchases. Accordingly, the Governing Council today made the following decisions:. First, as regards non-standard monetary policy measures, we will continue to make net purchases under the APP at the current monthly pace of â‚¬30 billion until the end of September 2018. We anticipate that, after September 2018, subject to incoming data confirming our medium-term inflation outlook, we will reduce the monthly pace of the net asset purchases to â‚¬15 billion until the end of December 2018 and then end net purchases. Second, we intend to maintain our policy of reinvesting the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time after the end of our net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. Third, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged and we expect them to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure that the evolution of inflation remains aligned with our current expectations of a sustained adjustment path. Today's monetary policy decisions maintain the current ample degree of monetary accommodation that will ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Significant monetary policy stimulus is still needed to support the further build-up of domestic price pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term. This support will continue to be provided by the net asset purchases until the end of the year, by the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the associated reinvestments, and by our enhanced forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates. In any event, the Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation continues to move towards the Governing Council's inflation aim in a sustained manner. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Quarterly real GDP growth moderated to 0.4% in the first quarter of 2018, following growth of 0.7% in the previous quarters. This moderation reflects a pull-back from the very high levels of growth in 2017, compounded by an increase in uncertainty and some temporary and supply-side factors at both the domestic and the global level, as well as weaker impetus from external trade. The latest economic indicators and survey results are weaker, but remain consistent with ongoing solid and broad-based economic growth. Our monetary policy measures, which have facilitated the deleveraging process, continue to underpin domestic demand. Private consumption is supported by ongoing employment gains, which, in turn, partly reflect past labour market reforms, and by growing household wealth. Business investment is fostered by the favourable financing conditions, rising corporate profitability and solid demand. In addition, the broad-based expansion in global demand is expected to continue, thus providing impetus to euro area exports. This assessment is broadly reflected in the June 2018 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. These projections foresee annual real GDP increasing by 2.1% in 2018, 1.9% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020. Compared with the March 2018 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real GDP growth has been revised down for 2018 and remains unchanged for 2019 and 2020. The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain broadly balanced. Nevertheless, uncertainties related to global factors, including the threat of increased protectionism, have become more prominent. Moreover, the risk of persistent heightened financial market volatility warrants monitoring. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation increased to 1.9% in May 2018, from 1.2% in April. This reflected higher contributions from energy, food and services price inflation. On the basis of current futures prices for oil, annual rates of headline inflation are likely to hover around the current level for the remainder of the year. While measures of underlying inflation remain generally muted, they have been increasing from earlier lows. Domestic cost pressures are strengthening amid high levels of capacity utilisation, tightening labour markets and rising wages. Looking ahead, underlying inflation is expected to pick up towards the end of the year and thereafter to increase gradually over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the continuing economic expansion, the corresponding absorption of economic slack and rising wage growth. This assessment is also broadly reflected in the June 2018 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation at 1.7% in 2018, 2019 and 2020. Compared with the March 2018 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for headline HICP inflation has been revised up notably for 2018 and 2019, mainly reflecting higher oil prices. Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth stood at 3.9% in April 2018, after 3.7% in March and 4.3% in February. While the slower momentum in M3 dynamics over recent months mainly reflects the reduction in the monthly net asset purchases since the beginning of the year. M3 growth continues to be supported by the impact of the ECB's monetary policy measures and the low opportunity cost of holding the most liquid deposits. Accordingly, the narrow monetary aggregate M1 remained the main contributor to broad money growth, although its annual growth rate has receded in recent months from the high rates previously observed. The recovery in the growth of loans to the private sector observed since the beginning of 2014 is proceeding. The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations stood at 3.3% in April 2018, unchanged from the previous month, and the annual growth rate of loans to households also remained stable, at 2.9%. The pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014 continues to significantly support borrowing conditions for firms and households and credit flows across the euro area. This is also reflected in the results of the latest Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises in the euro area, which indicates that small and medium-sized enterprises in particular benefited from improved access to financing. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed that today's monetary policy decisions will ensure the ample degree of monetary accommodation necessary for the continued sustained convergence of inflation towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute more decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential and reducing vulnerabilities. The implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up to increase resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost euro area productivity and growth potential. Regarding fiscal policies, the ongoing broad-based expansion calls for rebuilding fiscal buffers. This is particularly important in countries where government debt remains high. All countries would benefit from intensifying efforts towards achieving a more growth-friendly composition of public finances. A full, transparent and consistent implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact and of the macroeconomic imbalance procedure over time and across countries remains essential to increase the resilience of the euro area economy. Improving the functioning of Economic and Monetary Union remains a priority. The Governing Council urges specific and decisive steps to complete the banking union and the capital markets union."
Mongolia,2018-06-15,"MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Keeping the policy rate unchanged and Setting debt to income ratio Number: 2018/02 Effective date: June 15th, 2018 Amendments to the Law on Central Bank (the Bank of Mongolia) was approved by the Parliament of Mongolia and have been put into effect starting April 1st, 2018. In-line with the amendments, the Parliament appointed the Monetary Policy Committee as the official monetary policy decision making body which relies on a collective decision-making framework. Moreover, monetary policy decisions by the Committee are set to be made after meetings held in two phases. In this regard, the first meeting of the Committee was held on June 11th, followed by a second meeting on June 15th, during which current economic conditions, economic outlook and risks, monetary policy stance as well as alternative scenarios were discussed and a final decision was made by a majority of votes. The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Mongolia decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 10 percent and set a ceiling on debt to income ratio for personal consumption credits at 70 percent. Annual inflation measured by the consumer price index reached 6.1 percent nationwide and 6.6 percent in Ulaanbaatar city as of May 2018. Though economic growth is expected to pick up further, inflation outlook is stable around the target level of 8 percent. Despite rising prices of importing oil at the global market, prices of some exporting commodities have been improving, leading to a relatively stable outlook for terms of trade. Acceleration of economic activities in the first quarter has been consistent with the expectations of the Bank of Mongolia. Investments to the mining sector continued to expand; investor and consumer confidence have been recovering and business conditions have been gradually improving. However, surges of imports in tandem with higher exports may pose downside risks to the balance of payments. Though household income has been increasing gradually, rapid acceleration of consumption credit growth in recent years is expanding household debt. As such, with the purpose of alleviating household debt pressure and thus, preventing risk accumulation in the financial sector, the Bank of Mongolia set a ceiling for debt to income ratio on personal consumption credits issued by banks, to be in effect starting 2019. These policy decisions are consistent with the policy objective to stabilize inflation around the target level in the medium term, while continue to support economic growth and ensure macroeconomic and financial stability in the medium and long term. Extracts of the Committee meeting minutes will be released in two weeks on the Bank of Mongolia's website. MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE."
Peru,2018-06-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JUNE 2018 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 2.75% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 2.75 percent. This decision takes into account the following factors: In May, inflation showed a YoY rate of 0.93 percent, a rate below the lower band of the inflation target range. This is explained mainly by the reversal of the supply shocks in a context of a lower level of economic activity than the potential level of growth. On the other hand, trend inflation measurements show levels close to the midpoint of the target range; The expected YoY rate of inflation registered 2.22 percent in May; Indicators of economic activity show clear signs of a greater dynamism, although GDP remains below its potential level of growth, and The world economy continues to show positive indicators, although there is still uncertainty in international financial markets. The YoY inflation rate is projected to return to be within the target range in June and to gradually converge to 2.0 percent by the end of the year. The Board considers that it is appropriate to maintain an expansionary policy stance until it is certain that this convergence will take place when inflation expectations are anchored in a context in which the level of economic activity is close to its potential level of growth. Recent indicators of inflation and activity reflect the following: Inflation in May showed a rate of 0.02 percent, as a result of which the YoY inflation rate rose from 0.48 percent in April to 0.93 percent in May. Inflation without food and energy recorded a rate of 0.17 percent, as a result of which the YoY rate rose from 1.91 percent in April to 2.0 in May. Most indicators of business expectations improved in May and continue to be on the optimistic side. Moreover, a recovery is observed in several indicators of economic activity, consumption, and investment. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 1.50 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 3.30 percent for the first 15 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 15 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 3.30 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for July on its Meeting of July 12, 2018."
Russia,2018-06-15,"On 15 June 2018, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to keep the key rate at 7.25% per annum. The Bank of Russia has reviewed the inflation forecast upwards considering the planned increase of the value added tax in 2019. This measure will influence the next year consumer prices dynamics and may affect this year's dynamics as well. The Bank of Russia forecasts annual inflation to be 3.54% in late 2018 and increase for a short-term period to 44.5% in 2019. The consumer price growth rate will return to 4% in early 2020. The balance of risks up to the end of 2019 has shifted towards proinflationary risks. In making its key rate decisions the Bank of Russia will assess inflation risks, inflation dynamics and economic developments against the forecast. In making its key rate decision, the Bank of Russia recognised the following factors. Inflation dynamics. Annual inflation in general corresponds to the Bank of Russia's expectations. In April and May, the annual consumer price growth rate remained at the March level totalling 2.4%. Inflation for main consumer basket product groups showed mixed dynamics. On the one hand, amid growing global oil prices coupled with the increase in excises early this year, the prices of oil products in the domestic market saw a tangible rise. This factor was the key contributor to the growth of annual inflation for non-food goods up to 3.4% in May (vs 2.7% in April). The adopted decision to lower the excises for oil products from 1 June 2018 will help to slow down the price growth for this product group by the end of this year. On the other hand, fruit and vegetable prices saw a substantial decline, which led to the drop in annual food inflation to 0.4% in May (vs 1.1% in April). This is related to continuing high supply of food products. Inflation expectations of households and businesses saw a slight increase, which is primarily related to higher petrol prices. The weakening of ruble exchange rate in April moderately affects the dynamics of inflation and inflation expectations. In the coming months, prices will continue to adapt to the established level of the exchange rate and prices of oil products. According to the Bank of Russia estimates, planned tax revisions will make about a 1 percentage point contribution to inflation. Partially this effect may take place this year. The Bank of Russia forecasts annual inflation to be 3.54% in late 2018 and increase for a short-term period to 44.5% in 2019. The consumer price growth rate will return to 4% in early 2020. Monetary conditions are close to neutral. The Bank of Russia estimates that they are already causing almost no constraining impact on lending, demand and inflation dynamics. Monetary conditions are being formed, among other things, under the influence of earlier decisions to lower the key rate. At the same time, the conservative approach of banks to selecting borrowers encourages a gradual increase in credit without creating risks to price and financial stability. Deposits remain attractive for households at the current interest rate levels. Taking into account the impact of the suggested fiscal measures on inflation and inflation expectations, the transition to neutral monetary policy needs to be slower. Keeping somewhat tight monetary conditions allows to limit the scale of secondary effects arising from the tax policy decisions and stabilise annual inflation close to 4%. Economic activity. 2018 Q1 annual GDP growth was slightly below the March forecast, totalling 1.3%. This resulted from a slower than expected growth of fixed capital investment, including a decline in construction, together with the review of the data for 2017 by Rosstat. April saw improved investment and industrial activity, confirming the temporary nature of slower economic growth in March 2018. In view of this, the Bank of Russia kept unchanged its 2018 annual GDP growth forecast of 1.52%, which is in line with the potential economic growth rate. In 20192020, economic growth will stay close to the said figure. The Bank of Russia's forecast might be further updated to reflect a detailed estimate of influence that the set of fiscal measures, announced on 14 June 2018, will have on economic performance. The risk of some slowdown of economic activity persists in 2019. Although in the medium term if the scheduled measures are successfully implemented the expected economic growth could be faster compared to the Bank of Russia's baseline forecast*. Inflation risks. The balance of risks up to the end of 2019 has shifted towards proinflationary risks. The main risks are related to the effects of the adopted tax and fiscal policy decisions and to external factors. With regard to tax policy measures the Bank of Russia will pay special attention to the estimation of secondary effects (including the response of inflation expectations), which are difficult to capture at the moment. With respect to external conditions accelerated yield growth in advanced economies and geopolitical factors may cause surges in volatility in financial markets and affect expectations for the exchange rate and inflation. The Bank of Russia leaves mostly unchanged its estimates of risks associated with consumer and oil price volatility, wage movements and possible changes in consumer behaviour. These risks remain moderate. In the future, the Bank of Russia will explore the necessity of key rate changes by assessing inflation risks, inflation dynamics and economic developments against the forecast. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next rate review meeting on 27 July 2018. The Board decision press release is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time. Interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations will be published on the Bank of Russia's website in the section Interest rates on Bank of Russia operations, according to the Bank of Russia press release dd. 01.06.2018 â€œInterest rates on Bank of Russia operationsâ€. * Revised translation of the paragraph as compared with the version as of 13:30.

Philippines,2018-06-19,"At its meeting on monetary policy today, the Monetary Board decided to raise the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) facility by 25 basis points to 3.50 percent, effective Thursday, 21 June 2018. The interest rates on the overnight lending and deposit facilities were likewise raised accordingly. In deciding to raise the BSP's policy interest rate anew, the Monetary Board noted that inflation expectations remained elevated for 2018 and that the risk of possible second-round effects from ongoing price pressures argued for follow-through monetary policy action. Although inflation expectations remain within the target range for 2019, elevated expectations for 2018 highlight the risk posed by sustained price pressures on future wage and price outcomes. Equally important, while latest baseline forecasts have shifted lower for 2018-2019, upside risks continue to dominate the inflation outlook, even as various measures of core inflation continue to rise. Moreover, the impact of international oil and commodity price movements on overall inflation is expected to be stronger given prevailing robust aggregate demand conditions. Given these considerations, the Monetary Board believes that further policy action enables the BSP to reinforce its signal on safeguarding macroeconomic stability in an environment of rising commodity prices and ongoing normalization of monetary policy in advanced economies. The Monetary Board likewise reiterates its support for carefully coordinated efforts with other government agencies in implementing non-monetary measures to mitigate the impact of supply-side factors on inflation. The Monetary Board also emphasized the BSP's continued vigilance against developments, including excessive peso volatility, that could affect the outlook for inflation. The BSP is prepared to take further policy action as needed to achieve its price and financial stability objectives."
Brazil,2018-06-20,"The Copom unanimously decided to maintain the Selic rate at 6.50% p.a. The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario:. The temporary halt in the transportation sector in May makes it more difficult to assess the recent evolution of economic activity. April data suggest more consistent activity relative to previous months. Indicators for May and possibly June, however, are likely to reflect the effects of the aforementioned halt. The baseline scenario entertains continuation of recovery of economic activity in the Brazilian economy, at a more gradual pace. The global outlook remained more challenging and showed volatility. The evolution of risks associated, to a large extent, with normalization of interest rates in some advanced economies led to adjustments in international financial markets. As a result, risk appetite towards emerging economies has diminished. The Committee judges that, in the short run, inflation should reflect significant temporary upward pressures stemming from the halt in the transportation sector and from other relative price changes. Measures of underlying inflation are still running at low levels. This includes the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy. Inflation expectations for 2018 and 2019 collected by the Focus survey are around 3.9% and 4.1%, respectively. Expectations for 2020 are around 4.0%; and. The Copom's inflation projections in the scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the Focus survey stand around 4.2% for 2018, and 3.7% for 2019. This scenario assumes a path for the policy interest rate that ends 2018 at 6.5% p.a., and 2019 at 8.0% p.a., and a path for the exchange rate that ends 2018 at R$/US$ 3.63 and 2019 at R$/US$ 3.60. In the scenario with a constant interest rate, at 6.50% p.a., and a constant exchange rate, at R$/US$ 3.70*, the projections for 2018 and 2019 stand around 4.2% and 4.1%, respectively. The Committee emphasizes that risks around its baseline scenario remain in both directions. On the one hand, possible propagation through inertial mechanisms of low inflation levels in the past may lead to a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory. On the other hand, frustration of expectations regarding the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy may affect risk premia and increase the path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy. This risk intensifies in the case of further changes in the global outlook for emerging economies. The latter risk has intensified since the previous Copom meeting, whereas the risk that inflation would remain significantly below target over the relevant horizon has diminished. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the wide array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to maintain the Selic rate at 6.50% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation and the associated balance of risks and is consistent with convergence of inflation to target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, which includes 2018 and, mainly, 2019. The Committee reiterates that economic conditions prescribe accommodative monetary policy, i.e., interest rates below the structural level. The Copom emphasizes that the evolution of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy is essential to maintain low inflation in the medium and long run, for the reduction of its structural interest rate, and for sustainable recovery of the economy. The Copom judges that it should base its decisions on the evolution of inflation projections and expectations, of the balance of risks, and of economic activity. Shocks that produce relative price changes should only lead to a monetary policy response to their possible second-round effects (i.e., to the propagation to prices in the economy that are not directly affected by the shock). It is through such second-round effects that these shocks may affect inflation projections and expectations, and change the balance of risks. These effects may be mitigated by the level of economic slack and by inflation expectations anchored around the targets. Therefore, there is no mechanical relationship between recent shocks and the conduct of monetary policy. In the Copom's assessment, the evolution of the baseline scenario and of the balance of risks prescribes keeping the Selic rate at its current level. The Copom emphasizes that the next steps in the conduct of monetary policy will continue to depend on the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, and on inflation projections and expectations. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Ilan Goldfajn (Governor). Carlos Viana de Carvalho. Carolina de Assis Barros. Mauricio Costa de Moura. Otavio Ribeiro Damaso. Paulo Srgio Neves de Souza. Reinaldo Le Grazie. Sidnei Corr=AAa Marques, and Tiago Couto Berriel. *Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average R$/US$ exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the Friday prior to the Copom meeting."
Thailand,2018-06-20,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 4/2018 Mr. Jaturong Jantarangs. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 20 June 2018 as follows. The Committee voted 5 to 1 to maintain the policy rate at 150 percent. One member voted to raise the policy rate by 025 percentage point from 150 to 175 percent. One MPC member was unable to attend the meeting. In deliberating their policy decision, the Committee assessed that the Thai economy continued to gain further traction and would achieve higher growth than previously assessed, driven by stronger momentum from both domestic and external demand. Headline inflation was projected to rise slightly more than the previous assessment, while core inflation was expected to rise slowly. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative and conducive to economic growth. Financial stability remained sound overall, but it was deemed necessary to monitor pockets of risks that might lead to the build-up of vulnerabilities in the financial system in the future especially given prolonged monetary accommodation. The Committee viewed that the current accommodative monetary policy stance remained conducive to the continuation of economic growth and should support the rise of headline inflation toward target in a sustainable manner. Thus most members decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at this meeting. Nevertheless one member viewed that the economic expansion was sufficiently robust and that prolonged monetary accommodation might induce households and businesses to underestimate potential changes in financial conditions, and thus voted to raise the policy rate at this meeting in order to start building policy space. The Thai economy as a whole continued to gain further traction, driven by merchandise exports and tourism which continued to improve in tandem with global economic growth, and by stronger momentum from domestic demand. In particular, private consumption continued to expand, although elevated household debt and the economic expansion had yet to benefit household income and employment in a broad-based manner, resulting in a gradual improvement in purchasing power. In the Committee's view, these issues must be addressed through structural policies. Private investment was projected to continue expanding with additional support from public investment projects whose prospects became more certain, although their progress in the period ahead must be monitored. Meanwhile public expenditure would be a driver of growth but there remained risks of delays in budget disbursement. Furthermore Thailand's growth outlook was still subject to external risks that continued to warrant monitoring, especially US foreign trade policies and retaliatory measures from trading partners of the US, and geopolitical risks. 2 Headline inflation was projected to rise at a slightly faster pace than previously assessed toward target on the back of increases in oil prices. Core inflation was projected to edge up given gradual build-up in demand-pull inflationary pressures. Moreover structural changes, such as an expansion of e-commerce and rising price competition, still warranted monitoring as they might contribute to more persistent inflation than in the past. Meanwhile the public's inflation expectations were largely unchanged. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative and conducive to economic growth with ample liquidity in the financial system. Overall government bond yields increased somewhat compared with the previous meeting, while real interest rates remained low. Such conditions allowed financing by the private sector to continue expanding with improvements seen in the amount of credit extended to SMEs and consumer loans. On exchange rates, the baht depreciated against the US dollar and experienced volatile movements due to the monetary policy outlook of advanced economies and increased concerns about trade protectionism measures as well as risks related to emerging market economies. Looking ahead, the baht would likely remain volatile. Thus the Committee would closely monitor exchange rate developments as well as impacts on the economy going forward. Financial stability remained sound but there continued to be a need to monitor pockets of risks that might pose vulnerabilities to financial stability in the future. These included, in particular, the search-for-yield behavior in the prolonged low interest rate environment that might lead to underpricing of risks, and the deterioration in debt serviceability of households and SMEs, especially those affected by changes in structural factors and business models. Looking ahead, the Thai economy as a whole was projected to continue to gain further traction driven by both external and domestic factors. However there remained the need to monitor the strength of the domestic demand and inflation developments in the period ahead, as well as impacts of trade protectionism measures which remained highly uncertain. Hence the Committee viewed that monetary policy should remain accommodative."
Mexico,2018-06-21,"Banco de Mexico's Governing Board decided to raise the target for the overnight interbank interest rate to 7.75%. Available data suggests that the world economy increased its growth rate during the second quarter of 2018. However, there are signs of divergence among the main advanced economies. In the U.S., economic activity is expected to grow at a stronger pace, partly in response to the fiscal stimulus implemented, which, under conditions of reduced slack in the economy, may lead to greater inflationary pressures. As expected, in June the Federal Reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, and reiterated its forecast that such range will continue to increase gradually and its expectation that inflation will be near its symmetric 2% target in the medium term. Although growth forecasts for the world economy for 2018 and 2019 remain practically unchanged, uncertainty in the short term and downside risks in the medium term have increased. Among these risks, the intensification of protectionist trade measures, a possible tightening of financial conditions generated by inflationary surprises, and the escalation of certain geopolitical risks stand out. Under this environment, the U.S. dollar strengthened against most currencies, while risk aversion increased worldwide. Trade-related tensions and other geopolitical factors have also contributed to these developments. All of the above has caused a reallocation of investment portfolio towards safer assets. In this context, the currencies of most emerging economies depreciated significantly and exhibited higher levels of volatility. As for Mexico, since the last monetary policy decision, the peso depreciated further and also registered greater volatility. This behavior was influenced by both the aforementioned adverse external environment and other factors, such as the lack of agreement in the NAFTA renegotiation process and uncertainty associated with the country's forthcoming election. Interest rates in Mexico rose, especially those for short tenors. During the first quarter of 2018, economic activity in Mexico continued gaining strength, growing at a rate even higher than that observed in the previous quarter. These developments caused some tightening in the economy's slack conditions. Although, in line with expectations, available information for the second quarter suggests a slowdown of economic activity, forecasts for the year remain unchanged. Given the uncertainty caused by the complex environment faced by the economy. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board considers the balance of risks for growth maintains its bias to the downside. The Mexican economy is now in a better position to cope with adverse scenarios due to the central bank's monetary policy stance adopted to keep medium- and long-term inflation expectations anchored and to the attainment of the fiscal objectives and the financial system's resilience. Nevertheless, the economy is expected to continue facing a complex environment, in both the external and domestic fronts. For this reason, it is particularly relevant that, in addition to following a prudent and robust monetary policy, measures to foster greater productivity are adopted, as well as a sustainable consolidation of the public finances. Annual headline inflation continued to decrease, from 4.55% in April to 4.51% in May. Core inflation fell from 3.71% to 3.69% during the same period as a result of both monetary policy actions and the fading 1 of shocks that had an adverse effect on it last year. Non-core inflation fell from 7.07% to 6.99% during the same period, mostly due to reductions in the prices of agricultural products, which were partly offset by increases in gasoline and LP gas prices. Headline inflation expectations for the end of 2018 were revised from 3.98% in April to 3.94% in May, while those for the medium and long terms remained around 3.50%. The decline in inflation during the first five months of 2018 is consistent with its convergence to the target as forecasted by Banco de Mexico in its latest Quarterly Report. Nevertheless, some of the upside risks to inflation identified by the Central Bank have started to materialize. In particular, the peso exchange rate has depreciated even further, while the prices of gasoline and LP gas have been under pressure in line with increases in their international references. To the extent that these pressures persist, they could adversely affect the rate at which inflation declines. As for the tariffs imposed by the U.S. and the equivalent measures announced recently by Mexico, their effect on inflation is expected to be limited and short-lived. Considering all of the above, the risk of inflation converging to its target at a slower rate than that forecasted has increased, and therefore the attainment of the 3% target could be delayed if the monetary policy stance is not adjusted. The aforementioned scenario continues to be subject to risks and to a high degree of uncertainty. Among the upside risks to inflation are that the peso exchange rate continues to be under pressure due to an environment of higher external interest rates and U.S. dollar strength, and uncertainty associated with both the NAFTA renegotiation and Mexico's elections. In the event of a scenario in which the real exchange rate would need to adjust. Banco de Mexico will make sure it is done in an orderly manner, and with no second-round effects on the economy's price formation process. The risk of additional upward pressures on some energy product prices or of shocks on agriculture product prices also persists. Also, given the economy's position in the current business cycle, the behavior of unit labor costs could exert pressure on inflation. As for downside risks, the peso could appreciate if NAFTA negotiations turn out to be favorable. Summing up, since the last monetary policy decision, the balance of risks to the forecasted trajectory of inflation has deteriorated and remains biased upwards, in an environment of high uncertainty. To guide its monetary policy actions. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board follows closely the development of inflation vis-a-vis its anticipated trajectory, taking into account the monetary policy stance adopted and the time frame in which monetary policy operates, as well as available information on all inflation determinants and on medium- and long-term inflation expectations, including the balance of risks to such factors. Given that some inflationary risks have started to materialize and that the balance of risks for inflation has worsened and might affect the convergence of inflation to its target. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board has voted unanimously to raise the target for the overnight interbank interest rate to 7.75%. Looking ahead, the Governing Board will maintain a prudent monetary policy stance and will continue to follow closely the potential pass-through of exchange rate fluctuations to prices, the monetary policy stance relative to that of the U.S., and the conditions of slack in the Mexican economy. In the presence and possible persistence of factors that, by their nature, involve risks to both inflation and inflation expectations, monetary policy will be adjusted in a timely and robust manner to attain the convergence of inflation to its 3% target, and to firmly anchor medium- and long-term inflation expectations so that they attain such target."
Armenia,2018-06-26,"PRESS RELEASE 26.06.2018 At the June 26th of 2018 meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia (the CBA) decided to leave the refinancing rate unchanged, at the level of 6.0%. There was 1.0% deflation in May of 2018 against that of 0.2% reported in the same month of the previous year, and the 12â€month inflation rate continued reducing, amounting to 1.6% at the end of the month. The shaping of low inflation environment owed primarily to the decline in seasonal prices as a result of early seasonality. At the same time, core inflation was also somewhat lower from the Central Bank expectations. In the external sector, trends for improving global economic growth continued while developments in the international commodity markets are slightly more inflationary than anticipated. The acceleration of inflation in principal trade partner countries and other partner countries also determines the current and expected tightening of monetary conditions, which has been reflected in the increase in emerging country risks and raising interest rates. In view of such developments, the Board of the Central Bank anticipates some more inflation risks from the external sector. The Board notes that economic activity in the second quarter of 2018 was higher than anticipated, driven by a high productivity growth reported in construction and services sectors. On the demand side, it is mainly expressed by high growth rates of investments, whereas the growth of private consumption was relatively low amid the slowdown in growth rates of money transfers from abroad. In this case, the Board considers that the impact of aggregate demand on inflation has been weaker than expected. The latter was reflected in shaping lower levels of both core inflation and inflationary expectations. Taking the abovementioned into account, as well as the fiscal policy's moreâ€thanâ€expected contractionary impact on the economy, the Board of the Central Bank finds it appropriate that current monetary conditions will be maintained, leaving the refinancing rate unchanged on the back of rising world interest rates. In the meantime, the current low inflation environment notwithstanding, the Board reckons that a gradual offsetting of expansionary monetary conditions in the midâ€term will be needed in fulfillment of the inflation target. As a result, the expectation is that inflation will still remain low in the coming months, shaping within the confidence band in the second half of the year and stabilizing around the 4% target in the medium run. Should the risks to economic growth outlook and to the inflation deviating from its recovery path materialize, the Central Bank will adjust the monetary policy directions accordingly, while ensuring the price stability. Detailed information that underlies the decision on setting of the interest rate will be available in Press Release (Minutes on Interest Rate), to be published by July 10, 2018. Press Service of the Central Bank of Armenia."
Czech Republic,2018-06-27,"At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank unanimously increased the two-week repo rate by 25 basis points to 1%. At the same time, it increased the Lombard rate by 50 basis points to 2% and kept the discount rate unchanged at 0.05%.. The May forecast expected inflation to be slightly below the 2% target this year and return very close to it during next year. Consistent with the current forecast was broad stability of market interest rates initially, followed by further growth in rates from late 2018/early 2019. At its meeting today, however, the Bank Board assessed the risks to the current forecast as being inflationary. The outlook for foreign producer price inflation is higher compared to the assumptions of the forecast. This is particularly true for this year, owing to an increase in oil prices. The expected evolution of consumer prices, economic growth and euro interest rates is essentially unchanged in terms of annual averages. The market outlook for the Brent crude oil price is higher than the forecast. The expected dollar-euro exchange rate has shifted towards a weaker euro. These two factors are thus jointly fostering a higher koruna price of oil. Domestic inflation has gradually increased so far in Q2 and slightly exceeded the Czech National Bank's 2% target in May. The higher-than-forecasted inflation in May was due mainly to faster growth in prices of fuels and food. Slightly higher core inflation also contributed to a lesser extent. Growth in administered prices and the first-round effects of changes to indirect taxes were in line with the forecast. As forecasted, the growth of the Czech economy slowed in Q1. However, the slowdown was rather more pronounced than the central bank had expected. This was due mainly to a stronger negative contribution of net exports and lower additions to inventories. Household consumption also recorded slightly slower growth. Nevertheless, it remained robust due to a strong labour market and ensuing rapid growth in household income. By contrast, the contributions of fixed investment and government consumption to economic growth were stronger than forecasted. According to the monthly indicators, industrial and construction output and retail sales are slowing further. This suggests  in line with the Czech National Bank's current forecast  a further slowdown in annual economic growth in 2018 Q2. Labour market indicators point to continued overheating of the labour market. Employment continued to rise apace and exceeded the forecast amid strong labour demand. In line with expectations, unemployment declined slightly. The high labour demand coupled with a shortage of available labour led to a further marked increase in job vacancies. As expected, wage growth accelerated further in Q1. Although it fell short of the prediction in market sectors, it exceeded the forecast in non-market sectors. To sum up the important facts about recent developments in the Czech economy. GDP growth in Q1 was below the forecast. By contrast, inflation in May was higher than forecasted. The evolution of unemployment and wages was broadly in line with the Czech National Bank's forecast."
Egypt,2018-06-28,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release June 28, 2018 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 1675 percent, 1775 percent, and 1725 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 1725 percen. Annual headline and core inflation continued to decline since August 2017, recording in May 2018 the lowest level since April 2016 at 114 and 111 percent, respectivel. Unemployment also continued to decline, recording in 2018 Q1 the lowest rate since 2010 Q4 at 106 percen. Supported by foreign and domestic public investment demand, annual real GDP growth exhibited sustained increases since 2016 Q4, recording in 2018 Q1 a preliminary estimate of 54 percen. Meanwhile potential output is estimated to have benefited from structural reforms in the Egyptian economy, thereby easing inflationary pressures from the pickup in economic deman. Internationally financial conditions tightened, and oil prices rose, putting upward pressure on the magnitude of domestic fiscal consolidatio. The Ministry of Finance is targeting to achieve a primary balance surplus in the magnitude of 02 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2017/18 and 20 percent over the following fiscal year. Fiscal consolidation measures are expected to lead to one-off increases in the price level, which translate into temporary higher inflation rate. Yet as the recently implemented measures were anticipated, average annual headline inflation is expected to remain in line with the CBE's target announced in May 2017, namely 13 percent (Â±3 percent) in 2018 Q4. Single digit inflation is expected to be reached after the temporary effect of supply shocks dissipate. The setting of policy rates in previous MPC meetings has been consistent with this outloo. Accordingly the MPC decided that keeping key policy rates unchanged remains consistent with achieving the targeted disinflation pat. The MPC closely monitors all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust its stance to achieve its mandate of price stability over the medium ter.

Colombia,2018-06-29,"The Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica, in its meeting today, decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 4.25%. For this decision, the Board mainly took into account the following aspects. In the past two months, annual inflation stopped falling, and stood at 3.16% in May. In the same month, the average of core inflation indicators (3.43%) and the major components of the CPI also recorded relatively stable annual variations. Inflation expectations did not record important changes. Analysts' expectations are, on average, at 3.35% and 3.34% for December 2018 and 2019, respectively. Those derived from public debt bonds to 2, 3, and 5 years, stand between 3.0% and 3.2%. Growth of trading partners continues to recover, driven by developed economies and by the major emerging economies. Oil prices remain at levels higher than the averages registered in the last two years. The increase in the country's terms of trade and a better dynamics expected from external demand would continue favoring the recovery of the country's external income. Despite this, in the last month the Colombian peso has depreciated vis--vis the US dollar in an environment of increased risk premia. GDP results for the first quarter and indicators of economic activity for the second suggest that the economy would have continued to exhibit a low growth, but higher than in 2017. With these results, the technical staff of the Central Bank maintained its growth estimate for 2018 at 2.7%. However, the Bank's technical staff estimated that the productive capacity is still underused, and that it would expand in 2018. In the first quarter of 2018, the deficit in the balance of payments declined compared to the same period last year. The forecast of the Central Bank's technical staff for 2018 points to a slight closure of the external deficit as a share of GDP. Based on this information, the Board considered the following factors for its decision. Weakness of the economic activity and uncertainty over its pace of recovery. On the one hand, the excess of spare capacity would expand in 2018. On the other hand, should the price of oil remain at current levels for an extended period or should the increasing trend of confidence persist, the dynamics of aggregate demand could be greater than expected. The stability of inflation and its expectations above 3.0%, and some risks that could push inflation upwards. One of them is an increase in food prices that could affect expectations and delay convergence of inflation to 3.0%. Similarly, a stronger-than-expected depreciation of the peso that could be passed-through to domestic prices. Again, uncertainty on these events is high. In this context, after assessing the state of the economy and the risk balance, the Board deemed appropriate to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 4.25%. The Board will continue to carefully monitor the behavior of inflation and the forecasts for economic activity and inflation in the country, as well as the international context. Finally, the Board reiterates that the monetary policy will depend on the availability of new information. The decision to maintain the benchmark interest at 4.25% was approved unanimously by the members of the Board."
Romania,2018-07-04,"In its meeting of 4 July 2018, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided:. The annual CPI inflation rate rose to 5.22 percent in April and 5.41 percent in May (from 4.95 percent in March), thereby standing above the projected level. Behind this development stood supply-side factors, the larger-than-expected hikes in fuel prices and tobacco product prices in particular. The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate (which excludes from the CPI inflation a number of prices on which monetary policy has limited or no influence, i.e. administered prices, volatile prices, and tobacco and alcoholic beverage prices) fell, however, in May to 2.95 percent, from 3.09 percent in April, sliding below the March reading of 3.05 percent. The slowdown can be ascribed to processed food and services components, under the impact of slacker growth in international prices of some agri-food items and the movements in the EUR/RON exchange rate. In April, the average annual CPI inflation rate stood at 2.8 percent and in May at 3.3 percent, compared with 2.5 percent in March; calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, the annual average came in at 2.2 percent in April and at 2.6 percent in May, from 1.9 percent in March. Data on first-quarter economic growth point to a sharper-than-anticipated loss of momentum, with annual GDP dynamics slowing to 4 percent, from 6.7 percent in the final quarter of 2017. Household consumption was further the chief driver of growth, its contribution, however, shrinking considerably. Gross fixed capital formation continued to have a positive contribution, albeit lower from the previous period. By contrast, the contribution of net exports to the advance in real GDP improved, given the narrowing of the positive differential between the annual growth rate of imports and that of exports. Against this background, the current account deficit posted a slower pace of increase against the same year-ago period, while remaining at an elevated level. The latest statistical data show a deceleration in the annual growth of industrial output in April compared with 2018 Q1 and a pick-up in the annual rate of increase of activity in trade and services. Annual dynamics of unit wage costs in the industrial sector gathered further momentum, mirroring a slower advance in labour productivity. Monetary conditions were less accommodative May through June, amid the increase in relevant money market rates and in credit institutions' interest rates in relation to non-bank clients, as well as the relative stability of the leu exchange rate. The annual growth rate of credit to the private sector remained robust in Q2 (6.8 percent in April and 6.4 percent in May), outpacing the average dynamics recorded in the previous quarter. The stronger momentum was mainly attributable to the firming of the high dynamics of leu-denominated loans to households, driven by consumer credit, whose flow peaked at a historical high. The domestic currency component further widened its share in total credit to 64.7 percent, against a low of 35.6 percent in 2012. The latest assessments reconfirm the outlook for the annual inflation rate to level off above the variation band of the target over the next months, followed by its decline near the upper bound of the variation band at the end of this year, in line with the May 2018 medium-term forecast. The uncertainties and risks surrounding the medium-term inflation outlook are significant. They stem from labour market conditions, developments in administered prices and in oil prices, as well as from international financial market volatility. Also relevant are the economic growth pace in the euro area and globally and the danger of escalating trade protectionism. Based on the currently available data and with a view to ensuring the adequate dosage and pace of adjustment of the monetary policy stance, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided to keep unchanged the monetary policy rate at 2.50 percent per annum; moreover, the NBR Board decided to leave unchanged the deposit facility rate at 1.50 percent per annum and the lending (Lombard) facility rate at 3.50 percent per annum. In addition, the NBR Board decided to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board decisions aim to ensure and preserve price stability over the medium term in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth and amid safeguarding financial stability. The NBR Board underlines that the balanced macroeconomic policy mix and the implementation of structural reforms designed to foster the growth potential over the long term are of the essence in preserving a stable macroeconomic framework and strengthening the capacity of the Romanian economy to withstand potential adverse developments. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR website on 11 July 2018, at 3:00 p.m. The next monetary policy meeting of the NBR Board is scheduled for 6 August 2018, when a new quarterly Inflation Report is to be examined."
Thailand,2018-07-05,"Summary Conclusion of the Joint Meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) and the Financial Institutions Policy Committee (FIPC) on 29 June 2018 The Bank of Thailand announced the summary conclusion of the joint meeting of the MPC and the FIPC on 29 June 2018 to assess the risks to Thailand's financial stability as follows. The committees concluded that Thailand's financial stability remained sound. Economic growth continued to gain traction, which enhanced businesses' financial strength especially for large corporates. Banks and insurance companies maintained high capital buffers. Meanwhile Thailand's external stability remained solid given low external debts, continued current account surplus, and high international reserves. These factors helped cushion the spillover from external risks and volatility in global financial markets, notably due to G3 countries' economic and monetary policies and intensified concerns over trade protectionism. Nonetheless there remained some pockets of risks that could have notable implications on financial stability going forward, two of which were highlighted by the committees. First the build-up of risks in the real estate sector was noted. The proportion of new housing loans with high loan-to-value (LTV) ratio had been on the rise, while mortgagors' debt burden also rose relative to their income. In addition, oversupply continued to warrant monitoring. Second the search-for-yield behavior, which could lead to underpricing of risks, continued to persist especially in savings cooperatives. Fragilities continued to build up in the housing loan market. This was reflected in an increase in the share of new housing loans with loan-to-value (LTV) ratio exceeding 90 percent, as well as an increase in the loan-to-income (LTI) ratio. Moreover the quality of housing loan still deteriorated, as indicated by higher non-performing loan (NPL) ratio. Despite their strong financial positions, banks should exercise caution in granting such loans, which could add to households' debt burden and impair households' financial cushion going forward. On the other hand, there continued to be a need to monitor oversupply in the real estate market. Latest data showed that the amount of time required for developers to unload stocks of condominiums in certain locations and price ranges had become longer. And looking ahead, the fact that developers' financing via bank loans and bond issuances had been growing steadily suggested that new supply could accelerate in the future. Hence the committees viewed that further assessments should be conducted on competition in the housing loan market and oversupply of condominium in certain areas. Special attention should also be given to office and retail space supply, which could accelerate due to new mixed-use projects. The search-for-yield behavior continued to persist, especially that related to savings cooperatives, whose deposits and investments in securities continued to grow robustly. On top of 2 this, some large savings cooperatives had become increasingly reliant on short-term borrowings. Tightening financial conditions and higher interest rates in the future could thus affect these cooperatives' financing activity, funding costs, and mark-to-market values of investments, as well as overall liquidity in the cooperatives system. In the committees' view, it is urgent to further enhance the regulatory and legislative framework for supervising savings cooperatives, especially the large ones. This is to ensure that savings cooperatives are well-prepared for tightening financial conditions and operate in line with the underlying philosophy of cooperatives without posing risks to the financial system. The search-for-yield behavior in other areas did not show signs of concern. Investment in mutual funds continued to grow mainly from growth in fixed income funds, whereas foreign investment funds (FIFs) slowed down due to heightened volatility and risks from the external front. Meanwhile new issuances of low-rated corporate bonds had been on a downward trend following last year's default incidents. In this regard, the Office of the Securities and Exchange Commission has revised the regulations on the issuances and sales of debt securities to enhance investor protection and strengthen arrangers' operating standards to a more appropriate level. In the periods ahead. Thailand's financial system could still face several risk factors. Chief among them are uncertainties in G3 countries' economic and monetary policies, uncertainties surrounding trade protectionism, geopolitical risks, as well as domestic economic growth that is still not fully broad-based. Close monitoring is warranted for some pockets of risks that might add vulnerabilities to the Thai financial system. These include: the impact of tightening financial conditions on rollover risks and funding costs of corporates, especially those that rely heavily on bond issuances; debt serviceability of SMEs and households; oversupply in condominiums and a boost in office and retail space supply from new mixed-use projects; and the search-for- yield behavior that could lead to underpricing of risks, especially the search-for-yield behavior via savings cooperatives. The Bank of Thailand, the Office of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Office of Insurance Commission will continue to collaborate closely in assessing and monitoring risks to financial stability. The three regulators will also improve and enforce regulations to cope with emerging risks appropriately. These efforts are aimed at preventing the build-up of vulnerabilities that could potentially affect Thailand's overall financial stability."
Israel,2018-07-09,"The inflation environment continues to rise gradually, supported by the accommodative monetary policy, and is approaching the price stability target range. Inflation over the 12 months ending in May was 0.5 percent, and inflation according to adjusted indices remains below the target. Since the last interest rate decision, there has been an increase in inflation expectations from the various sources, and they are near or slightly above the lower bound of the price stability target range. Following rapid growth in the first quarter, economic growth in the second quarter is expected to stabilize at a pace that is in line with potential. Goods exports have moderated in recent months. The labor market remains tight and wages are increasing, while more companies are reporting difficulties in hiring workers. Data regarding theglobal economy remain positive, although global growth seems to be losing momentum. In recent weeks, the risk of an intensifying trade war has again increased. Inflation in the US converged with the Fed's target, and the Fed is continuing to raise the interest rate. In the other advanced economies, inflation is rising gradually, while monetary policy remains very accommodative. The effective exchange rate remains relatively stable. Since the previous interest rate decision, therehas been a depreciation of about 1 percent, following an appreciation in the weeks that preceded it. Home prices have declined by 2.4 percent since peaking in August of last year, while the rise in rental prices has accelerated somewhat. Both building starts and investment in residential construction show a significant decline. TheMonetary Committee intends to maintain the accommodative policy as long as necessary in order to entrench the inflation environment within the target range. The Bank of Israel continues to monitor developments in inflation, the real economy, the financial markets, and the global economy,and will act to attain the monetary policy targets in accordance with such developments. For the file of data accompanying this notice, click here. Graphs and data. The inflation environment continues to rise gradually, supported by the accommodative monetary policy, and is drawing close to the price stability target range. In the 12 months ending in May, the inflation rate was 0.5 percent (Figure 1 in the attached data file), and inflation indices that exclude transitory effects are higher, though still below the target (Figure 2). Annual inflation is expected to increase once the June 2017 inflation figure, which was particularly low, exits the 12-month calculation. Inflation in the prices of tradable goods remains negative, but is on an upward trend, impacted by the rise in energy prices and depreciation of the shekel against the dollar. Inflation in the prices of nontradable items resumed its increase in the past two months, led by the housing component (Figure 3). Since the previous interest rate decision, there has been an increase in one-yearinflation expectations from various sources (Figure 4). Forward expectations for inflation beginning from the second year also increased, and longer-term expectations remain anchored within the target range (Figure 5). According to the Research Department's staff forecast, inflation in the next four quarters is expected to be 1.4 percent. Since the previous interest rate decision there has beena depreciation of about 1 percent, following an appreciation in the weeks preceding it (Figure 6). Since the previous interest rate decision, yields on government bonds in Israel have increased, in contrast with declines in the other advanced economies, and therefore the spread between the nominal yield on 10-year USTreasury securities and the yield on similar Israel government bonds narrowed (Figure 7). The real-yield spreads between corporate and government bonds continued to widen, but are still at a low level (Figure 8). The second estimate of National Accounts data also shows that in the first quarter of 2018, economic activity continued to expand at a solid pace (Figure 11) and even slightly above potential, reflecting in part the large increase in vehicle imports in the first quarter that had a prominent effect. In contrast, the growth rates of exports and of investments were revised downward. Indicators of economic activity show some slowing of the growth rate. According to the initial data from the Companies Survey, the growth rate in the second quarter was in line with the potential rate (Figure 12); the Composite State of the Economy Index for May increased by 0.25 percent: slightly lower than the rate of increase in previous months; and the Purchasing Managers Index published by Bank Hapoalim declined in May and is slightly below the boundary that distinguishes between expansion and contraction. Goods exports have moderated in recent months (Figure 14). The labor market remains tight, with the unemployment rate still very low and the participation and employment rates remaining high (Figure 15). Wages continue to increase at a high rate (Figure 16), while there is strong demand for workers and companies are reporting constraints in hiring new workers. The increase in wages is reflected in the continued increase of unit labor cost. According to the Research Department's staff forecast. GDP is expected to grow at a rate of 3.7 percent in 2018 and 3.5 percent in 2019. Home prices stabilized in the most recent two months for which data have been published (February and March), after having declined by 2.4 percent from the peak reached in August (Figure 9). In contrast, the annual rate of increase in rental prices (in new and renewing contracts) continued to rise in May, to 2.9 percent. There is a significant slowing of the number of building starts and of investment in residential construction. New mortgage volume continued to increase, and mortgage interest rates remained stable after declining in 2017 (Figure 10). Globaleconomic data remain positive, although it seems that the growth is losing strength. International investment houses revised their growth forecasts for the major economies slightly downward (Figure 18), the growth rate of world trade slowed in recent months (Figure 19), and the decline in the global purchasing managers index signals a weakening of momentum. In recent weeks the risk of an intensifying trade war has again increased, and political tensions in Europe have increased. Equity market prices in advanced economies remained stable, in contrast with declines in the emerging markets (Figure 23). Inflation in the US continues to converge with the Fed's target, while in theother advanced economies it remains moderate but is increasing gradually (Figure 20). The US economy is close to full employment with a gradual increasein wages. At this point, second quarter growth seems high. The Federal Reserveis continuing with its path of raising the interest rate. It increased the federal funds rate this month, and is expected to increase it twice more in 2018. In Europe, following moderate growth in the first quarter, macroeconomic data for the second quarter also indicate moderate growth. The ECB announced a plan to halt bond purchases at the end of 2018, though the text of its announcementhas led to expectations that an interest rate increase would not take place before the fall of 2019. Monetary policy in Japan remains very accommodative. Financial risk in the emerging economies increased, as reflected by negative sentiment in the capital markets, capital outflows, and the weakening of currencies due to the increased yields in the US. Crude oil prices continued to increase, and there was a decline in commodity prices (Figure 21). The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on July 23, 2018. The next decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Wednesday. August 29, 2018."
Kazakhstan,2018-07-09,"PRESS - RELEASE –18 The base rate unchanged at 9% July 9, 2018 Almaty The National Bank of Kazakhstan has decided to keep the base rate at 9% with a corridor of +/- 1%. Annual inflation remains within the target range of 2018 and, according to the National Bank's estimates, its further dynamics will be formed within the target range of 2018 and 2019. However, on the background of possible realization of inflation risks in both short-term and medium-term, especially from the external sector and budgetary policy, the potential to ease monetary conditions further this year is limited. The inflation continued downward trend in accordance with the estimates of the National Bank. In the first half of 2018, lower rate of inflation (2.6%) compared to the same period of the previous year (3.7%) is being observed, which contributed to the downward slide in inflation to 5.9% in June. A slowdown in the inflation rate is due to the influence of favorable seasonal factors in food and agricultural markets and the continuing decline in the price levels for consumer goods by domestic producers. However, due to the low rate of inflation in the 3rd quarter of last year, which is taken into account in statistical calculations, the prominent deceleration of annual inflation by the end of this year, according to the National Bank' estimates, is not expected. Households have relatively stable inflation expectations. The quantitative assessment of the inflation for a year ahead in June remained at the level of February and May this year  6.0%. Changes in expectations in March (lower) and April (higher) reflected the impact of current market conditions. The perceivable inflation of households continues to improve. The share of the responders, who believe that â€œin the past 12 months the price of goods and services has increased with the faster rate than beforeâ€, reached a minimum level for the entire observation period and amounted to 44.2% in June. The maximum historical value is shown by the share of respondents who noted the lowest level or declining dynamics of consumer prices over the past year  22.5%. The economic activity continues to demonstrate the positive dynamics. In January-May of 2018 the short-term economic indicator amounted to 5.1% in the annual terms. A positive contribution to growth was made by all major industries  mining and manufacturing, communications, trade, transportation and agriculture. At the same time, an economic growth rate is above its potential output and is supported by the expansion of aggregate demand, both by domestic consumption and investment, and external demand, which intensify the inflationary pressures. One of the factors that will continue to ensure the increase of consumption spending, remains the socially oriented fiscal policy. The situation in foreign markets has become multidirectional. The dynamics of oil prices continues to have a positive impact, oil prices have been formed above 70 US dollars per barrel, experts' forecasts for further price dynamics remain favorable. In June, for the first time since the start of the year, global food prices have fallen. The FAO Food Price index has decreased by 1.3%, which is due to increased global trade tensions among countries. The cereal prices have continued to fall. However, the prospects for global cereal production would likely deteriorate further, which might add to inflationary pressure. In the medium term, expected increase of inflation in the countries  main trade partners is a factor that is likely to exacerbate inflationary pressures. In June, as a result of the tightening of global monetary conditions, the expected strengthening of the US dollar in the global markets and a change in the direction of capital flows from the currencies of emerging markets, including tenge, to the US dollars, were observed. In particular, the volume of short-term notes of the National Bank held by non-residents decreased from 454 billion tenge in March to 241 billion tenge in June this year, which was one of the factors that weakened tenge. Monetary conditions remain on the neutral level. In order to manage inflation expectations against the backdrop of unstable external factors and the likelihood of persistence of inflationary risks, will probably cause monetary conditions to tighten. Given that the operational benchmark of monetary policy  the indicator TONIA  is closer to the lower bound of the interest rate corridor, the National Bank is also considering the possibility to enhance the operational effectiveness of monetary regulation. In the second half of 2018, the issue of narrowing corridor boundaries will be considered. The next decision on the base rate will be announced on September 3, 2018 at 17:00 Astana time."
Malaysia,2018-07-11,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.25 percent. The global economy continues to expand albeit with some divergence across economies while global trade sustained its growth momentum. In the advanced economies, rising income and policy support, particularly in the US, will continue to drive growth. Growth in Asia will be supported by sustained domestic activity and external demand. However, the balance of risks to the outlook has tilted to the downside. The intensification of global trade tensions could affect sentiments and weigh on trade, investment and consumption. Coupled with ongoing monetary policy normalisation in the advanced economies, shifting investor expectations and sentiments could lead to further capital outflows and financial market adjustments in some emerging economies. The Malaysian economy continued to expand in the first half of 2018, supported by private sector activity with additional impetus from net exports. The positive growth performance is expected to be sustained, driven by both domestic and external demand. Private consumption will be underpinned by continued wage and employment growth, with an additional lift from higher household spending due to the tax holiday. Investment activity is projected to be supported by capacity expansion mainly in the export-oriented industries and ongoing infrastructure projects, particularly in the transport and utilities sub-sectors. The external sector will continue to benefit from the sustained global growth momentum. The growth outlook will be further supported with greater certainty in domestic policy in the coming months. Overall, the Malaysian economy is expected to remain on a steady growth path. Headline inflation for 2018 is projected to be lower than earlier forecast taking into consideration the impact of recent policy measures on domestic cost factors. The impact of these measures on inflation, however, is transitory. Headline inflation is likely to turn negative in some months and remain low in the first half of 2019 before trending upwards as these transitory effects lapse. Core inflation is nevertheless expected to remain relatively stable in line with sustained domestic demand. The positive domestic economic outlook, sound financial sector and improving current account surplus of the balance of payments will continue to support Malaysia's fundamentals. Domestic financial markets have remained resilient despite non-resident portfolio outflows. The ringgit exchange rate would be more reflective of the underlying fundamentals of the economy when the external and domestic uncertainties recede. Notwithstanding the heightened financial market volatility, the domestic monetary and financial conditions remain supportive of economic growth. Bank Negara Malaysia's monetary operations continue to ensure sufficient liquidity to support the orderly functioning of money and foreign exchange markets and intermediation activity. At the current level of the OPR, the degree of monetary accommodativeness is consistent with the intended policy stance. The MPC will continue to monitor and assess the balance of risks surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation. Bank Negara Malaysia 11 July 2018."
Poland,2018-07-11,"Warsaw, 11 July 2018 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 10-11 July 2018 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: â–ª reference rate at 1.50%; â–ª lombard rate at 2.50%; â–ª deposit rate at 0.50%; â–ª rediscount rate at 1.75%. Global economic conditions remain favourable. In the euro area, incoming data suggest continued favourable economic situation, despite a slightly slower GDP growth than in 2017. Similarly, in the United States, economic conditions remain sound, while incoming data suggest GDP growth in 2018 Q2 picked up. In China, in turn, economic activity has continued at stable rates for the past few quarters. Despite favourable global economic conditions, inflation abroad remains moderate on the back of persistently low domestic inflationary pressure across many countries and a decline in some agricultural commodity prices. At the same time, significantly higher oil prices than a year ago are increasing inflation rates. The European Central Bank keeps interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero. At the same time, the ECB continues to purchase financial assets, although it has announced a reduction in the scale of purchases from October 2018 and the termination of the programme by the end of the year. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates in June and continues to gradually reduce its balance sheet. In Poland, economic growth remains relatively high. It is driven by rising consumption, fuelled by increasing employment and wages, disbursement of benefits and very strong consumer sentiment. This is probably accompanied by a further recovery in investment. Notwithstanding relatively high economic growth and wages rising faster than in the previous year, consumer price growth remains moderate. The slightly higher annual CPI rate than in the previous months reflects the growth in fuel prices. At the same time, inflation net of food and energy prices stays low. The Council became acquainted with the results of the July projection of inflation and GDP, prepared under the assumption of unchanged NBP interest rates. In line with the July projection based on the NECMOD model, there is a 50-percent probability that annual price growth will be in the range of 1.5-2.1% in 2018 (against 1.6-2.5% in the March 2018 projection), 1.9-3.5% in 2019 (compared to 1.7-3.6%) and 1.7-3.9% in 2020 (compared to 1.9- 4.1%). At the same time, annual GDP growth  in line with this projection  will be with a 50-percent probability in the range of 4.0-5.2% in 2018 (against 3.5-5.0% in the March 2018 1/2 projection), 2.8-4.7% in 2019 (compared to 2.8-4.8%) and 2.44.3% in 2020 (compared to 2.64.6%). In the Council's assessment, current information and the results of the projection point to a favourable outlook for economic activity growth in Poland, despite the expected slowdown in GDP growth in the coming years. In line with the results of the projection, inflation will remain close to the target in the monetary policy transmission horizon. As a result, the Council judges that the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability. The Council adopted Inflation Report  July 2018."
South Korea,2018-07-12,"Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period. This press release is the English version of the Bank of Korea's policy statement. In the case of any inconsistency, the original version in Korean will prevail. The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Board considers that the global economy has continued its robust growth. The volatility in the global financial markets has expanded, as a result mainly of concerns about the trade disputes in the world and of the strengthening of the US dollar. Looking ahead the Board sees global economic growth as likely to be affected by factors such as the movements toward spreading trade protectionism, the paces of monetary policy normalization in major countries, and the directions of the US government's economic policies. The Board judges that the solid trend of domestic economic growth has continued, as consumption and exports have shown favorable movements although the adjustments in facilities and construction investment have persisted. Employment conditions are still sluggish, with the extent of increase in the number of persons employed having remained at a low level. Going forward the Board expects domestic economic growth to be slightly below the path projected in April, but to sustain a rate at its potential level. It anticipates that investment will slow but that the trend of steady increase in consumption will continue, and that exports will also sustain their favorable movements thanks to the buoyancy of the global economy. Consumer price inflation has remained at the mid-1% level, due mainly to the slowing pace of increase in agricultural and livestock product prices and despite the prices of petroleum products having risen greatly. Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has fallen into the low-1% range, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has remained at the mid-2% level. Looking ahead it is forecast that consumer price inflation, after remaining in the mid-1% range for some time, will pick up and gradually approach the target level. Core inflation will also gradually rise. The volatility of price variables in the domestic financial markets has expanded, in reflection of global financial market movements. The Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has risen significantly, in line with the global strengthening of the US dollar. Stock prices and long-term market interest rates have fallen to considerable extents, under the influence of heightened external uncertainties related chiefly to the US-China trade dispute. Household lending has sustained its higher rate of expansion than in past years, although the amount of its expansion has lessened somewhat. Housing sales prices have remained steady. Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As it is forecast that inflationary pressures on the demand side will not be high for the time being, while the domestic economy is expected to continue its solid growth, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance. In this process it will judge carefully whether it is necessary to adjust its accommodative monetary policy stance further, while closely checking future economic growth and inflation trends. It will also carefully monitor conditions related to trade with major countries, any changes in the monetary policies of major countries, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks."
Peru,2018-07-12,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JULY 2018 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 2.75% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 2.75 percent. This decision takes into account the following factors: In June, the YoY rate of inflation was within the inflation target range. The monthly rate of inflation reflects in part the rise in the excise tax. On the other hand, indicators of trend have risen compared to May, but continue to be close to the midpoint of the target range; The expected YoY rate of inflation registered 2.28 percent in June; Indicators of economic activity show clear signs of a greater dynamism, although GDP remains below its potential level of growth, and Greater risk and increased financial volatility, both associated with recent commercial tensions, could affect global economic activity. The YoY inflation rate is projected to remain within the target range in July and to gradually converge to 2.0 percent by the end of the year. The Board considers that it is appropriate to maintain an expansionary policy stance until it is certain that this convergence will take place when inflation expectations are anchored in a context in which the level of economic activity is close to its potential level of growth. Recent indicators of inflation and activity reflect the following: Inflation in June showed a rate of 0.33 percent, as a result of which the YoY inflation rate rose from 0.93 percent in May to 1.43 percent in June 2018. Inflation without food and energy recorded a rate of 0.28 percent, as a result of which the YoY rate rose from 2.0 percent in May to 2.23 in June, within the target range. Indicators of business expectations continue to be on the optimistic side, although they showed lower levels than in the previous month. Moreover, a recovery is observed in several indicators of economic activity, consumption, and investment. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 1.50 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 3.30 percent for the first 15 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 15 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 3.30 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for August on its Meeting of August 9, 2018."
Ukraine,2018-07-12,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to hike its key policy rate to 17.5% per annum, effective from 13 July 2018, aiming at bringing inflation back to the target range in 2019. The NBU believes that a number of factors can pose a threat to inflation decreasing to the target level  namely, a continued pickup in domestic demand, active labor migration, higher risks to receiving the next tranche from the International Monetary Fund and other related financing, excessively high inflation expectations, and lower investor interest to assets of developing countries. A tighter monetary policy will neutralize their effect, driving inflation down to 5.8% as of the end of 2019 and 5% in 2020. June 2018 saw a substantial slowdown in consumer price inflation that reached 9.9% yoy, which was somewhat below the NBU'sforecast published in the April 2018 Inflation Report. This was primarily the result of a considerable increase in supply of food products on the back of more favorable weather and a rise in imports. In addition, a strengthening in the hryvnia exchange rate, which was driven in particular by the tightening of monetary policy by the NBU, had a favorable effect on the costs of imported goods and the prices of goods and services costs of which heavily depend on imports. Core inflation also decelerated in June, to 9.0% yoy that was lower than expected. However, core inflation remaining high indicates that the underlying inflationary pressure is persistently strong. This is mainly the result of sustained growth in consumer demand, which is fueled by a rapid rise in incomes that substantially outpaces the rates of economic growth. The impact of inflation factors will become stronger in future, but the tight monetary policy will offset their effect and drive inflation back to the target range in 2019. The NBU keeps its inflation forecast for year-end 2018 unchanged at 8.9%. A faster-than-expected disinflation in MayJune 2018 will be neutralized in the second half-year. This is due to expectations of a greater-than-expected increase in administered prices at the end of the year, which is aimed at bringing domestic gas prices closer to the import parity price, and the subsequent rise in utility services prices. This factor will also influence inflation levels in the first three quarters of the next year, which will not allow the NBU to bring inflation to the target range before Q4 2019. However, this factor is beyond the reach of monetary policy and thus monetary policy tools cannot be used to neutralize it. At the same time, in H2 2018 and 2019 inflation will be exposed to a number of factors that should be eliminated by monetary policy tools, unlike the rise in administered prices. higher-than-expected domestic demand, which is, among other things, due to wage growth and greater remittances from labor migrantsless interest on the side of investors in Ukrainian sovereign debt as a result of the global trend of exiting developing countries' assets and postponed financing under the IMF cooperation programinflation expectations that continue to exceed the NBU's inflation targets.These are the factors which the Board aims to address with today's decision to hike the key policy rate. Under such conditions, the tighter monetary policy will be among the key factors to drive inflation down along the forecast path and bring it to the target range in Q4 2019. Therefore, the NBU makes no change to its inflation forecast for year-end 2019, that is 5.8%. In 2020, inflation will decelerate to 5.0%, the mid-point of the target range (5.0% Â± 1 pp). After speeding up in 2018, economic growth will slightly decelerate. The NBU believes that the forecast of 2018 real GDP growth of 3.4% is still relevant. Economic growth will continue to be mainly driven by private consumption, which in the current year will be fueled by the persisting high rate of growth in real wages on the back of high migration. Favorable terms of trade, a recovery in the industrial sector, together with greater access of Ukrainian exporters to foreign markets, will decrease the negative contribution of net exports to GDP. In 2019, real GDP growth will slow to 2.5% (2.9% in the previous forecast), due to the waning effects of higher social standards, the tight monetary conditions required to bring inflation back to its target, as well as tight fiscal policy resulting from the need to repay large volumes of public debt. In 2020, the real economy is expected to grow by 2.9%. Private consumption, additionally supported by rising remittances thanks to an increase in the number of labor migrants, will remain the main driver of economic growth in the medium-term. Meanwhile, investment growth will be restrained by businesses' higher labor costs. However, the contribution of net exports will remain negative over the forecast horizon, as imports will satisfy a significant portion of domestic demand and capital investment needs. A key assumption of the above scenario is based on Ukraine continuing to carry out structural reforms, as provisioned in the IMF-supported program. These reforms are essential to delivering macrofinancial stability and sustainable economic growth in the long-term. Access to the official financing provided by the IMF and other international lenders will enable the government to secure financing on the international capital markets on reasonable terms. The NBU expects that all of the required reforms will be carried out, and that in 2018 Ukraine will receive about USD 2 billion in IMF loans, as well as loans from the European Union and the World Bank. The aforesaid will ensure increase in the international reserves up to USD 20.7 billion by the end of this year. However, in 20192020, the balance of payments is expected to run a deficit, and international reserves will stand at about USD 20 billion amid peak repayments on external public debt. Accordingly, the main risk to the said macroeconomic forecast is that there may be no progress in implementing structural reforms, which is required for maintaining macrofinancial stability and continuing cooperation with the IMF. Any delays in taking the actions assigned in IMF-supported program reduce the likelihood that Ukraine will receive financing from the IMF, and narrow further the country's opportunities to secure financing on the international capital markets required for making public debt repayments, which will peak in 2018-2020. Therefore, receiving less than the planned amount will make financing budgetary spending more difficult. The following risks remain important:. continued capital outflow from developing economies, due to the central banks of advanced economies tightening their monetary policies faster than expecteda global economic downturn in the wake of large-scale trade warspersistently high labor migration.At the previous monetary policy meeting that took place in May 2018, the NBU Board said it could raise the key policy rate further if risks to lower inflation and macrofinancial stability increased. In this light, in view of the need to offset the outlined factors that could put pressure on inflation in 2018 and 2019, and taking into account the higher probability that the outlined risks could materialize, the NBU Boards deems it necessary to tighten monetary policy by raising the key policy rate. If there is good reason to believe that the above risks will increase further, or if new significant threats to lower inflation or macrofinancialstability appear, the NBU could raise the key policy rate again to a level required to bring inflation back to its target over the forecast horizon. The decision to raise the key policy rate to 17.5% has been approved by NBU Board Key Policy Rate Decision No. 443-D, dated 12 July 2018. A new detailed macroeconomic forecast will be published in the central bank's Inflation Report on 19 July 2018. A summary of the discussion by Monetary Policy Committee members that preceded this decision will be published on 23 July 2018. The next meeting of the NBU Board on monetary policy issues will be held on 6 September 2018 as scheduled."
Pakistan,2018-07-14,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STTAATTEE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement July 14, 2018 Pakistan has achieved thirteen-yyyeeeaaarrr high growth rate of 5.8 percent in FY18 and the average CPI inflation was well below the 6.0 percent target. However moving forward, the challenges to Pakistan's economy have further accentuated. First the provisional SBP estimate for fiscal deficit in FY18 is 6.8 percent as opposed to 5.5 percent estimated in May 2018. The current account deficit has also increased to $ 16.0 billion during JJuull-MMaayy FY18 as opposed to $ 11.1 billion in the corresponding period last yeaaarrr. This means that aggregate demand has proved to be higher than previously thought. Second June (YoY) inflation clocked in at 5.2 percent, and the average headline inflation for FY19 is expected to cross the 6.0 percent annual target. Core inflation nnnuuummmbers and their one-yyyeeeaaarrr ahead projections at around 7.0 percent also reflect demand pressures. Third on the external front, though both exports and workers' remittances are performing better, the sheer size of imports continues to pressurize FX reserves. The real economic activity repeated its strong FY17 performance. However towards the end of FY18, some challenges cast shadows on the capacity of the real sector to continue treading this high growth path. In the agriculture sector, the most important concern is shortage of water, which is likely to constrain agriculture production below the target in FY19. The manufacturing sector is also poised to show a mixed picture owing to high bbaassee-effect, the on-ggooiinngg monetary tightening and some sector specific issues whereas construction allied industries are likely to perform at par. Taking stock of these developments and the spillover on the services sector. SBP projects FY19 GDP growth to be around 5.5 percent as compared to the annual target of 6.2 percent. Turning to CPI, the average headline inflation for FY18 stands at 3.9 percent. However this picture is changing rapidly as is visible from rising (YoY) headline and core inflation for June 2018 at 5.2 and 7.1 percent, respectively. Based on these recent eestimates. SBP's model-bbaasseedd range for average CPI inflation is.0777.0 percent for FY19. This assessment relies on::: higher fiscal deficit;;; food inflation reverting to its normal behavior;;; unfavorable trend in international oil prices;;; lllagged pass-tthhrroouugghh of rupee depreciation;; and high ssuurrvveeyy-bbaasseedd measures of inflation expectations captured by July 2018 edition of IIBBAA-SBP's Consumer Confidence Survey. Monetary expansion in FY18 has been driven by government borrowing for budgetary support and healthy growth in credit to the private sector. Despite some slowdown in fixed investment and particular issues of the sugar and fertilizer sectors, stock of private sector borrowing increased by Rs.768 billion in FY18 which translates into a growth of 14.8 percent. In FY19, private sector credit is expected to increase by almost the same amount at a growth rate of about 13.0 percent. This will be driven primarily by the rise in need for working capital at the back of gestation of lagged fixed innnvvveeessstttmmmeeennnttt into production and rising exports. The expansionary impact of net domestic assets (NDA) on broad money supply has been partially neutralized by net contraction in foreign assets of the banking sector. NFA saw a net contraction of Rs.793 billion i.e. a negative impact of 5.4 percentage points on broad money growth during FY18. As a result, broad money supply saw a net expansion of 10.6 percent during FY18 as compared to 13.7 percent during FY17. Going forward the opposing direction of NFA from its NDA counterpart can keep broad money growth low in FY19. Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STTAATTEE BANK OF PAKISTAN The current account deficit deteriorated to $ 16.0 billion during the first eleven months of FY18, which is 1.4 times over the same period last year. A favorable impact of a strong recovery in eeexxxports (YoY growth of 13.2 percent in JJuull-MMaayy FY18) and increase in workers' remittances (3.0 percent in Jul-MMMaaayyy FY18) was more than offset by growing imports. Specifically strong demand for productive imports (metal, transport, machinery and petroleum) to support higher economic activity and a sharp increase in international oil prices have pushed the current account deficit to levels not sustainable beyond the short term. In the absence of matching financial flows, a notable portion of this higher current account deficit was financed by using the country's own resources. As a result. SBP's liquid FX reserves witnessed a net reduction of US$ 6.7 billion to reach US$ 9.5 billion as of July 6, 2018. These developments suggest that the nneeaarr-term management of the country's external accounts is of critical importance. Debating at length, the Monetary Policy Committee noted that the following factors are contributing to evolving economic challenges:: the mmuullttiipplliieerr-eeffffeecctt of a strong fiscal expansion durin the second half of FY18 is likely to offset the contractionary impact of monetary tightening in the recent months on domestic demand;;; higher international oil prices have continued to inflate the import bill;; rising inflation projections and the ensuing fall in real interest rates;; and a notable reduction in PKR and US interest rate differential. In order to curb aggregate demand and ensure nneeaarr-tteerrmm stability, the committee has decided to increase the policy rate by 100 bps to 7.50 ppeerrccent effective from 16 July 2018. Page."
South Africa,2018-07-19,"South African Reserve Bank PRESS STATEMENT EMBARGO DELIVERY 19 July 2018 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), several risks to the inflation outlook have begun to materialise. While headline inflation is comfortably within the inflation target band, indications are that we have passed the low point of the current cycle. Developments in the international environment have placed upward pressure on the inflation trajectory, while the domestic growth outlook remains challenging. The year-on-year inflation rate, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas, was 4.4% in May 2018 and accelerated to 4.6% in June. Goods price inflation increased to 4.2% (up from 3.5% in May), while services price inflation moderated to 4.9% (down from 5.3%). The South African Reserve Bank's (SARB) measure of core inflation  which excludes food, fuel and electricity  declined to 4.2% in June. Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods increased marginally to 4.6% in May. MPC Statement July 19th, 2018 Page 1. MPC Statement July 19th, 2018 Page 1 Despite remaining within the target band throughout the forecast period, the SARB's model projects an increase in headline inflation, peaking at levels closer to the upper end of the target range. Thus far, the impact of the value-added tax (VAT) increase appears to have been less than anticipated. However, the weaker rand exchange rate and the higher oil price assumptions result in a more elevated inflation trajectory. Headline inflation is now expected to average 4.8% in 2018 (down from 4.9%) before increasing to 5.6% in 2019 and decreasing again to 5.4% in 2020 (up from 5.2% in both years). Headline CPI inflation is expected to peak at around 5.7% in the first and second quarters of 2019 before declining to 5.3% at the end of 2020. Inflation expectations, as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research (BER) during the second quarter of 2018, are largely unchanged in the near term, averaging 5.2% in 2018, 5.4% in 2019 and 5.5% in 2020. Five-year-ahead inflation expectations are at a historical low of 5.4%. Expectations implicit in the break-even inflation rates (i.e. the yield differential between conventional and inflation-linked government bonds) declined marginally across all maturities. While the global economic outlook has remained broadly favourable, expectations are that world growth will begin to slow in the third quarter of 2018. In addition, escalating trade tensions are contributing to uncertainty around global trade. World trade volumes contracted sharply in April 2018  the worst performance since May 2015. The global inflation outlook remains benign but is on a moderate upward path. MPC Statement July 19th, 2018 Page 2. The global inflation outlook remains benign but is on a moderate upward path. MPC Statement July 19th, 2018 Page 2 largely due to the rising oil prices. The prices of most other commodities have been retreating. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand has depreciated by 7.2% against the US dollar, by 6.2% against the euro, and by 4.9% on a trade-weighted basis. At current levels, the SARB's model assesses the rand to be undervalued. It is likely that the local currency, along with other emerging market currencies, will remain volatile. The implied starting point for the rand is R13.40 against the US dollar compared with R12.37 at the time of the previous MPC meeting. A key external risk to the rand remains the possibility of tighter global financial conditions. However, the pace of monetary policy normalisation in the advanced economies continues to be gradual. At this stage, further policy tightening by the United States (US) Federal Reserve (Fed) is expected to follow a measured path in the absence of significant inflation or growth surprises. Higher-than-expected US fiscal deficits could result in a stronger monetary policy response. The domestic economic growth outlook for this year is weaker than we had expected in May. Following the broad-based contraction of 2.2% in the first quarter and early indications of modest growth in the second quarter, the SARB's forecast now indicates a growth rate of 1.2% for 2018 compared with 1.7% previously. The forecast for 2019 is 1.9%, marginally higher than the previous forecast of 1.7%, while the forecast for 2020 is unchanged at 2.0%. At these growth rates, the negative output gap is wider in the near term but is still expected to close in 2020. The composite leading business cycle indicator declined for the second consecutive month in April, consistent with a deteriorating outlook. Business confidence, as reflected in the Rand Merchant Bank (RMB)/BER business confidence index. MPC Statement July 19th, 2018 Page 3. Business confidence, as reflected in the Rand Merchant Bank (RMB)/BER business confidence index. MPC Statement July 19th, 2018 Page 3 decreased to 39 index points in the second quarter. In this context, gross fixed capital formation contracted by 3.2% in the first quarter and is expected to remain weak in 2018. Consumption expenditure by households, although slightly weaker than last year, is expected to be positively impacted by the improved consumer confidence and the increase in households' disposable income. In the near term, however, consumption expenditure is likely to be constrained by the VAT increase and other tax changes, weak employment growth as well as subdued growth in credit extension to households. Although credit extension to households increased earlier in 2018, year-on-year growth remains low. Average wage growth is expected to remain elevated at around 7% over the forecast period. This is particularly a concern if labour productivity growth continues to decline. Much of the upward pressure on wage inflation arises from the public sector wage settlement, which is at levels above headline inflation. Higher international oil prices will contribute to petrol price inflation in 2018. The impact on headline inflation is somewhat moderated by lower food price inflation. Annual food price inflation is expected to remain within the target range over the forecast period, and is not seen as a major risk to the inflation outlook. This is largely driven by an adequate supply of grains over the near term, alongside moderating meat price increases. The MPC noted the rising inflation trajectory which, while remaining within the target range, is moving closer to the upper end of the range. MPC Statement July 19th, 2018 Page 4. MPC Statement July 19th, 2018 Page 4 Key uncertainties in the global environment remain. The continued strength of the US dollar (which has appreciated against most currencies), any sustained elevation of oil prices, escalating trade tensions as well as geopolitical developments continue to pose risks to the inflation outlook. The rand will remain sensitive to changes in global monetary policy settings and investor sentiment towards the emerging markets. The MPC assesses the risks to the inflation forecast to be on the upside. A number of key risks and uncertainties highlighted in recent meetings persist. Electricity prices continue to pose a further upside risk. The growth forecast has deteriorated, and the outlook remains constrained. Demand pressures in the economy are not assessed to pose a risk to the inflation outlook. The MPC assesses the risks to the growth forecast to be more or less balanced. A firm commitment to credible structural policy initiatives and implementation is required to make a marked impact on employment and potential output. The MPC unanimously decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 6.5% per annum. At these levels, the MPC still assesses the stance of monetary policy to be accommodative and appropriate given the current state of the economy. However, the MPC has noted the deteriorating inflation outlook, driven mainly by supply-side factors. The approach of the MPC continues to be one of looking through the first- round effects and focusing on the second-round effects. With risks and uncertainties at higher levels, the MPC will continue to be vigilant and will not hesitate to act should there be second-round effects that take us significantly away from the midpoint of the inflation target range. MPC Statement July 19th, 2018 Page 5. MPC Statement July 19th, 2018 Page 5 The implied path of policy rates generated by the Quarterly Projection Model has changed since the previous MPC meeting. Whereas previously four increases of 25 basis points each by the end of 2020 were indicated, five increases of 25 basis points are now implied. As emphasised previously, the implied path remains a broad policy guide which can and does change in either direction between meetings in response to new developments and changing risks. The MPC does not mechanically respond to changes in the path, and the assessment of the balance of risks to the forecast cannot be done by the model.

Chile,2018-07-24,"Tuesday, 24 July 2018 Monetary Policy Meeting  July 2018 At its monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 2.5%, while maintaining the intensity of the monetary impulse. The decision was adopted by the unanimous vote of the Board members. Internationally, important developments have made the news since the June Monetary Policy Report. First, the difference between the US and other developed countries' cyclical position has deepened. The US economy shows narrowing gaps, especially in the labor market, with increasingly diverging activity and inflation figures from those of the Eurozone and Japan. This divergence has helped to strengthen the multilateral dollar. Second, there has been an increase in the risks associated with a scenario of trade conflict between the United States and other economies, in particular China. The entry into force of tariff increases for certain goods in the US and escalating announcements and statements by the various agents involved have affected markets, with generalized depreciations in the currencies of emerging and commodity exporting economies, a significant depreciation of the Yuan, and declines in commodity prices. Among these, it is worth noting the near 15% decline of the copper price since the June meeting. Notwithstanding, the world growth projections have not varied much. The Chilean peso has depreciated in line with the multilateral dollar and the copper price. Also, stock market indices have fallen, following the trends of international markets. However, long-term interest rates have remained fairly stable, marking a difference with most economies. The local risk premiums stand near the levels of the last meeting and remain low by historic standards. Market interest rates are still low and real credit growth remains bounded, despite an increase in the commercial loan portfolio in recent months. At the same time, a somewhat stronger demand is perceived in the consumer and business segments, together with some relaxation in the conditions for mortgage lending and loans to large companies. Figures for activity and demand after the June Monetary Policy Report show a more dynamic performance in investment-related lines, as reflected in the evolution of various items of wholesale trade, business services and the manufacturing industry. The machinery and equipment component continues to concentrate the greatest dynamism, which seems to be largely centered on the mining sector. On the other hand, housing and non-housing construction indicators show a deceleration in the margin and expectations in this sector have returned to pessimistic territory. About consumption, the dynamism of the durable sector continues to stand out, although with some slowdown lately. Consumer confidence shows new advances (IPEC), but the labor market continues to lag behind activity while wages are growing slowly if compared with their historical averages. The GDP growth outlook (EES) for this year increased to 4% in July (3.8% in June), while for 2019 and 2020 it remains at 3.8%. Year-on-year CPI inflation rose to 2.5% in June (2% in May), in line with forecasts and partly explained by increases in the annual variation in the more volatile components of the basket. The annual change in the CPIEFE rose to 1.9%, with goods inflation persisting in slightly negative numbers and services inflation somewhat above 3%. Market inflation expectations show no important changes, and remain near 3% at one and two years. The Board's decision considered that despite a more dynamic than expected behavior of the economy and a new upward correction to the short-term inflation outlookâ€” mainly because of the exchange rate increaseâ€”the medium-term projections in the June Report are not changed. However, the risks surrounding the international scenario and related negative implications have risen. The Board foresees that the monetary policy rate will return to its neutral level within the next few quarters, in line with the working assumption used in the last Report. Accordingly, the Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the two-year horizon. The minutes of today's Monetary Policy Meeting will be published at 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, 8 August 2018. The next Monetary Policy Meeting will be held on Tuesday, 4 September 2018 and the respective statement will be released at 18:00 of this latter date. _The Spanish original prevails."
Nigeria,2018-07-24,"CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO 119 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING OF MONDAY, 23RD AND TUESDAY, 24TH JULY, 2018 10 Background The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) held its 262nd meeting on Monday, 23rd and Tuesday, 24th July, 2018 amid fragile improvements in global growth and the domestic economic recovery. The Committee reviewed developments in the global and domestic economic and financial environments, as well as the outlook for the rest of the year. The MPC also assessed the risks to price stability, credit growth, employment creation and financial system stability, in the short-to-medium term. Ten (10) members of the Committee were in attendance. Global Economic Developments Global growth momentum remained promising despite rising trade tensions, uncertainties in BREXIT negotiations and scepticism over North Korea's commitment to the denuclearise the Korean Peninsula. Global growth was projected at 39 per cent in 2018, compared with 37 per cent in 2017, largely driven by the recovery in oil prices, rising asset prices and long term yield on major financial markets as well as a rebound in investment, manufacturing output and trade. In the Advanced Economies, growth was projected at 24 per cent in 2018, the same as in 2017. The growth was expected to be driven majorly by fiscal stimulus in the United States coupled with accommodative financial conditions. In the Emerging 1 Markets and Developing Economies output growth was projected at 49 per cent in 2018, up from 47 per cent in 2017, due largely to sustained recovery in global commodity prices (particularly crude oil); rebound in investment, manufacturing and trade as well as the strengthening of domestic consumption. The downside risks to global output growth remains the build-up in financial vulnerabilities; rising costs of borrowing in the Emerging Markets and Developing Economies; fragile corporate balance sheets; escalating trade protectionism, uncertainties around the BREXIT negotiations; heightened geopolitical tensions; and fiscal sustainability concerns. Global inflation was projected at 32 per cent in 2018, driven by rising energy prices, and currency depreciations in some emerging market and developing economies. In the advanced economies, inflation was projected to increase to 22 per cent in 2018, up from 17 per cent in 2017, as a result of increases in the cost of transport, housing, energy and food. Similarly inflation in the emerging markets and developing economies is projected to rise from 40 per cent in 2017 to 44 per cent in 2018, due to currency depreciations and rising energy prices. The Committee believes that global inflation is likely to remain subdued over the medium term relative to long term trends despite subsisting monetary accommodation in some advanced economies. Domestic Output Developments Economic recovery was sustained with a positive outlook over the medium-term, anchored on oil price recovery, fiscal spending and stability in the foreign exchange market. Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 195 per cent in the first quarter of 2018, compared with 211 per cent and a contraction of 091 per cent in the preceding and 2 corresponding quarters of 2017, respectively. The oil sector, which contributed 126 per cent in Q1 2018, compared with 076 per cent during Q4 2017 was the major source of the growth. The Purchasing Managers Indices (PMI) for manufacturing, and non-manufacturing activities rose for the fifteenth and fourteenth consecutive months to 570 and 575 index points, respectively, in June 2018. The Committee noted the positive impact of the sustained improvement in foreign exchange supply on the performance of manufacturing and other key sectors of the economy. The Committee welcomed the positive economic growth, but observed that the recovery was still fragile and called for the speedy implementation of the 2018 Federal Government Budget and the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP) to strengthen output growth in the Nigerian economy. Developments in Money and Prices The Committee observed that Narrow money (M1), contracted by 425 per cent, annualised to -849 per cent, relative to the provisional benchmark of 804 per cent. Broad money supply (M2), however, grew by 279 per cent in June 2018, annualised to 558 per cent, compared with the provisional growth benchmark of 1084 per cent for fiscal 2018. The increase in M2 was mainly driven by Net Foreign Assets (NFA), which grew by 1815 per cent in June 2018, annualised to 3630 per cent, compared with the provisional benchmark of 1815 per cent for 2018. The development reflected improvements in foreign receipts arising from favourable crude oil prices. On the other hand. Net Domestic Credit (NDC) contracted by 140 per cent, annualized to -280 per cent, compared with the provisional benchmark of 1245 per cent. The development was driven largely by the decrease in net credit to government, which contracted by 974 per cent in June 2018, annualised to -1948 per cent against the provisional 3 benchmark of 5497 per cent. Credit to the private sector similarly contracted by 004 per cent, annualised to -008 per cent in June 2018, in contrast to the provisional annual benchmark of 564 per cent. revised and seasonally adjusted money supply aggregate, however, showed an uptick. The new aggregate (M3), which is still being finalised by the Bank, appears to comprehensively capture the liquidity in and outside the banking system, compared with the existing M2. More details about the impact of M3 on macroeconomic variables would be reviewed at future MPC meetings. Headline inflation (year-on-year) trended downwards for the seventeenth consecutive month to 1123 per cent in June 2018 from 1161 per cent in May 2018. Food and Core inflation also fell to 1298 and 1040 per cent, from 1345 and 1071 per cent, respectively, over the same period. The Committee, however, noted the rise in the month-on-month inflation rate, to 124 per cent in June, from 109 per cent in May 2018. Food inflation (month-on-month) also increased from 133 per cent in May to 157 per cent in June 2018, representing an increase of 024 percentage point. During the same period, core inflation (month-on-month) also rose by 005 percentage point, from 098 per cent in May to 103 per cent, in June 2018. In view of the trend in rising month-on-month inflation rate, amid the slowly declining year-on-year headline inflation, indications were that inflationary pressures are rebuilding in the domestic economy. The review of developments in the money market revealed that the average inter-bank call rate fell to 50 per cent in June 2018, from 2543 per cent in May 2018, while the average Open Buy Back (OBB) rate decreased from 1837 per cent in May 2018 to 1084 per cent in June 2018. The trend in market rates and the net liquidity position 4 reflected the impact of the auction of Open Market Operations (OMO) bills, foreign exchange interventions. FAAC allocations to various levels of government, as well as the servicing of maturing CBN Bills. External reserves stood at US$472 billion on July 23, 2018. The Committee was optimistic and expected further increases in the level of external reserves in the near term, citing the favourable crude oil prices. The Committee, therefore, advised the Bank to sustain its current efforts to maintain investor confidence and ensure accretion to external reserves. The MPC also called on the Federal Government to continue to build fiscal buffers against possible oil price shocks in the future. Noting that the rise in the monthly distribution of revenues at the FAAC portend the danger of the absence of reserve buffers to absorb shocks in the future. Market Capitalisation (MC) also increased by 189 per cent to N1387 trillion on June 29, 2018, from N1361 trillion at end-December 2017. However ASI and MC fell by 724 per cent, respectively, on June 29, 2018 compared with the level at end-April 2018, due majorly to profit taking activities of investors, and the effect of monetary policy normalization in the United States. The Committee noted with satisfaction, the relative stability in the foreign exchange market and high level of activities, particularly, at the Investors' and Exporters' (I&E) window. The Committee noted the commencement of the currency swap deal with the People's Bank of China (PBoC) and observed that the availability of Renminbi currency to Nigerian investors would ease pressure in the foreign exchange market. The MPC 5 called for speedy implementation of the framework of the currency swap and urged the Bank to carry out sensitization programme for the public. The Overall Outlook and Risks to the Domestic Economy The forecasts of key macroeconomic indicators point to positive economic growth in the second half of 2018. The expectation is premised on the implementation of the 2018 budget, sustained stability in the foreign exchange market, as well as increase in crude oil production and prices. The MPC, cautioned that the downside risks to the growth outlook include: continuing delay in the implementation of the 2018 budget; worsening farmer-herdsmen conflicts in some parts of the country; continued non- payment of workers' salaries and pensions in some states; rising sovereign debt, as well as uncertainties surrounding the direction of trade, including the external demand for Nigeria's oil. Inflation forecast for the near term points to further moderation in price level in the short term. However the downside risks to inflation include: the impact of excess liquidity that could arise from the implementation of the approved N912 trillion 2018 FGN budget; pre-election spending; anticipated review of salaries and wages; security challenges; and monthly FAAC injections. Although these could boost aggregate demand, it would equally exert upward pressure on domestic prices for the rest of the year. The Committee, therefore, called for a co-ordinated fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies to stem the upward build-up in price pressures. The Committee observed that rates in the foreign exchange market have remained relatively stable in near term, supported by continued intervention in the market by the Bank, sustained increase in the price of crude oil in the international market, as well as positive developments in the external sector. The Considerations of the Committee The MPC noted with satisfaction the fourth consecutive quarters of growth in real GDP and the positive growth outlook in the domestic economy. This is shown by the sustained improvement in the Manufacturing and Non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' indices in the second quarter of the year. The MPC commended the approval of 2018 Federal Government budget and called for an accelerated implementation to further support the fragile growth recovery. The Committee also called for sustained implementation of the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP) to further stimulate output growth. The Committee was, however, concerned about the liquidity impact of the 2018 expansionary fiscal budget and increasing FAAC distribution, arising from rising prices of crude oil as well as the build-up in election related spending. Notwithstanding the positive direction of the outlook, the MPC reviewed the effects of the sustained monetary policy normalization in the US with implications for capital flow reversals, exchange rate and domestic price pressures, as well as other challenges to growth during the second half of 2018. The Committee took note of the sustained moderation in inflationary pressures, especially headline inflation, as well as stability in the foreign exchange market, but expressed concern on the threat posed by incessant herdsmen-farmers crisis in some key food producing states and the negative impact on food supply chains which would continue to exert upward pressure on food prices. The Committee, therefore, called on the Bank to continue to build on the progress already made to sustain the moderation in inflation. The MPC also observed with satisfaction high level of activities in the Investors' and Exporters' (I&E) window of the foreign exchange market which continued to supply liquidity in foreign exchange market, narrow exchange rate premium, and reduce speculative activities in the market. The MPC noted the continued improvements in the performance of deposit money banks and expressed optimism that the moderation in the levels of non-performing loans in the industry would continue. The Committee, therefore, called on the Federal Government to accelerate the settlement of outstanding contractor debts and also encourage the Bank to ensure strict compliance prudential guidelines. In discussing the economic report presented to the members, it was observed that as the prices of crude oil rose in 2017 and 2018, the monthly allocation to various levels of government also increased, suggesting that the Federal Government may not be saving adequately for the future. The Committee, therefore, advised the fiscal authority to build-up buffers, especially now that the price of crude oil is relatively high. The Committee's Decisions Informed by the developments in the global and domestic economic and financial environments, the Committee painstakingly reviewed the policy options available. In particular, the Committee considered the sustained positive growth in real GDP over the last quarter, stability in the foreign exchange market and high level of accretion to the external reserves. The MPC deliberated on the rise in food inflation, impact of the expected liquidity from expansionary 2018 FGN budget and rising FAAC disbursement in the second half of the year along with the build-up in pre-election year spending. The Committee strongly 8 considered the option of tightening believing that tightening would curtail the threat of a rise in inflation, even as the injection from the fiscal authorities would still provide the economy with substantial liquidity. Notwithstanding the deceleration in headline inflation, the current double digit inflation rate remains above the Bank's 6-9 per cent target range. In addition, the Committee was of the view that tightening would help stem the tide of capital flow reversals in the face of sustained monetary policy normalization in the US. This, the Committee believed would rein-in inflationary pressure and moderate inflation rate to single digit, increase real interest rate, build investor confidence with attendant positive impact on capital inflows and further stabilize the country's exchange rate. On the contrary, the Committee was of the view that raising interest rate at this time would weaken consumption and raise the cost of borrowing to investors in the domestic economy. In addition, the policy would trigger the re-pricing of financial assets by deposit money banks, thus further constrict credit to the real sector, and that would promote non-inclusive growth. In considering the option of loosening, the Committee assessed the potential effects of stimulating aggregate demand through lower cost of capital. This could stimulate consumption and aggregate demand. The Committee, however, considered its potential relevance, taking into account the expected liquidity injections from the 2018 budget, increased FAAC disbursements and election related spending ahead of the 2019 general elections. If these crystalize, it would exacerbate inflationary and exchange rate pressures as well as return the real interest rate into negative trajectory. Moreover lowering the policy rate may not translate to an automatic reduction in market rates due to poor transmission mechanism owing to structural rigidities. The Committee was also of the view that loosening could reverse the gains already made 9 on reduced importation which has strengthened the current account balance. It would also lower banks risk appetite and possible rise in NPLs which could negatively impact on the banking industry stability. In the discussion for a hold, it was noted that risks to the macroeconomic and financial environment appears fairly balanced with improvements in output growth and inflation. Holding policy at the current stance would support growth and further moderate inflation. The Committee, however, noted the preference of the public for loosening, concerns that the MPC had held the MPR at 14 per cent since July 2016 and also considering the dynamic nature of the market, the MPR may have lost its signalling effect to the market. The argument in favour of maintaining the current policy stance is to monitor the magnitude of the liquidity impact of the fiscal injections and election- related expenditure ahead of the 2019 general elections. Overall the MPC was of the opinion that, while it is difficult to encourage job creation in an environment with deficit infrastructure, the Committee believes that the Bank should continue to encourage deposit money banks (DMBs) to increase the flow of credit to the real economy to consolidate economic recovery. In this regard, the Committee believed that a heterodox approach to reform the market in order to strengthen the flow of credit would be appropriate at this time. Consequently credit constrained businesses, particularly the large corporations are encouraged to issue commercial paper to meet their credit needs and the Central Bank of Nigeria may, if need be, buy those instruments to complement the efforts of the DMBs. In addition, as a way of incentivise deposit money banks to increase lending to the manufacturing and agriculture sectors, a differentiated dynamic cash reserves requirement (CRR) regime would be implemented, to direct cheap long term bank credit at 9 per cent, with a minimum tenor of seven years and two years moratorium to employment 10 elastic sectors of the Nigerian economy. Details of this framework are being worked out by the Banking Supervision. Monetary Policy and Research Departments of the Bank and would be released soon. In consideration of the foregoing, therefore, the Committee decided by a vote of Seven members to retain the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) at 1400 per cent alongside all other policy parameters. Two members, however, voted to increase the MPR by 50 basis points, while one member voted to increase the MPR by 25 basis points. Consequently the MPC voted to retain the: MPR at 140 per cent; CRR at 225 per cent; Liquidity Ratio at 300 per cent; and Asymmetric corridor at +200 and -500 basis points around the MPR. Thank you for listening. Godwin I Emefiele Governor. Central Bank of Nigeria 24th July, 2018 11."
Turkiye,2018-07-24,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the policy rate (one week repo auction rate) constant at 17.75 percent. Recently released data indicate a more significant rebalancing trend in the economic activity. External demand maintains its strength, while signs of decelaration in domestic demand become more visible. Cost factors and volatility in food prices have been the main drivers of the recent upsurge in inflation. On the other hand, price increases have shown a generalized pattern across subsectors. Despite the milder impact of demand conditions on inflation, elevated levels of inflation and inflation expectations continue to pose risks on the pricing behavior. Accordingly, the Committee assessed that it might be necessary to maintain a tight monetary stance for an extended period. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. Tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained decisively until inflation outlook displays a significant improvement. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior, lagged impact of recent monetary policy decisions, contribution of fiscal policy to rebalancing process, and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Georgia,2018-07-25,"25.07.2018 The National Bank of Georgia reduces the monetary policy rate by 0.25 percentage points to 7.0% The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on July 25, 2018 and decided to cut the refinancing rate by 25 basis points. The reduction of the policy rate will continue at a slower pace than indicated in the previous forecasts. Currently, the policy rate stands at 7.0 percent. In line with the forecasts, at the beginning of 2018 inflation rate declined and remained around the target level of 3%. In June, the annual inflation equaled 2.2 percent, which is close to the target level. According to the forecasts, other factors being equal, inflation is expected to fluctuate near the target level. In the first half of the year, following the improvement in economic activity, the utput gap is closing at a faster pace than previously expected. Therefore, the downward pressure on inflation stemming from aggregate demand has declined. However, higher than expected appreciation of the nominal exchange rate reduced inflationary pressure. Moreover, the upward risks to inflation forecast have also weakened. Hence, the Monetary Policy Committee deemed appropriate to start the gradual exit from moderately tight monetary policy. However, following the recent improvement in aggregate demand, the monetary policy easing will continue at a slower pace than previously expected. The economic activity increased significantly in the first half of 2018 and, based on preliminary estimates, in the first five months of 2018 the real GDP growth equaled 6.1 percent, which is higher than previously anticipated, largely due to stronger than expected external demand. Meanwhile, growth in remittances and credit supports the improvement of domestic demand as well. As a result, the National Bank of Georgia revised the economic growth forecast upwards to 5.5 percent. Favourable trends in the external sector persisted. In particular, the exports of goods (28 percent) and tourism revenues (24 percent) continue to grow at a fast pace. Positive dynamics of remittances (18 percent annual growth) also persisted. However, the growth rate of imports accelerated as well (23 percent). To mitigate potential risks to the financial stability in the future, the monetary policy committee decided to increase the reserve requirements on short-term funds (remaining maturity less than one year) attracted in foreign currency from 20% to 25%. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all means and instruments at its disposal to ensure the price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on September 5, 2018."
Euroarea,2018-07-26,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We continue to expect them to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, we will continue to make net purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) at the current monthly pace of â‚¬30 billion until the end of September 2018. We anticipate that, after September 2018, subject to incoming data confirming our medium-term inflation outlook, we will reduce the monthly pace of the net asset purchases to â‚¬15 billion until the end of December 2018 and then end net purchases. We intend to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time after the end of our net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. While uncertainties, notably related to the global trade environment, remain prominent, the information available since our last monetary policy meeting indicates that the euro area economy is proceeding along a solid and broad-based growth path. The underlying strength of the economy confirms our confidence that the sustained convergence of inflation to our aim will continue in the period ahead and will be maintained even after a gradual winding-down of our net asset purchases. Nevertheless, significant monetary policy stimulus is still needed to support the further build-up of domestic price pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term. This support will continue to be provided by the net asset purchases until the end of the year, by the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the associated reinvestments, and by our enhanced forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates. In any event, the Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation continues to move towards the Governing Council's inflation aim in a sustained manner. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Quarterly real GDP growth moderated to 0.4% in the first quarter of 2018, following growth of 0.7% in the previous three quarters. This easing reflects a pull-back from the very high levels of growth in 2017 and is related mainly to weaker impetus from previously very strong external trade, compounded by an increase in uncertainty and some temporary and supply-side factors at both the domestic and the global level. The latest economic indicators and survey results have stabilised and continue to point to ongoing solid and broad-based economic growth, in line with the June 2018 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. Our monetary policy measures, which have facilitated the deleveraging process, continue to underpin domestic demand. Private consumption is supported by ongoing employment gains, which, in turn, partly reflect past labour market reforms, and by growing household wealth. Business investment is fostered by the favourable financing conditions, rising corporate profitability and solid demand. In addition, the broad-based expansion in global demand is expected to continue, thus providing impetus to euro area exports. The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook can still be assessed as broadly balanced. Uncertainties related to global factors, notably the threat of protectionism, remain prominent. Moreover, the risk of persistent heightened financial market volatility continues to warrant monitoring. Euro area annual HICP inflation increased to 2.0% in June 2018, from 1.9% in May, reflecting mainly higher energy and food price inflation. On the basis of current futures prices for oil, annual rates of headline inflation are likely to hover around the current level for the remainder of the year. While measures of underlying inflation remain generally muted, they have been increasing from earlier lows. Domestic cost pressures are strengthening and broadening amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets. Looking ahead, underlying inflation is expected to pick up towards the end of the year and thereafter to increase gradually over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the continuing economic expansion, the corresponding absorption of economic slack and rising wage growth. Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth increased to 4.4% in June 2018, up from 4.0% in May. M3 growth continues to benefit from the impact of the ECB's monetary policy measures and the low opportunity cost of holding the most liquid deposits. The narrow monetary aggregate M1 remained the main contributor to broad money growth. The recovery in the growth of loans to the private sector observed since the beginning of 2014 is proceeding. The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations rose to 4.1% in June 2018, after 3.7% in the previous month, while the annual growth rate of loans to households remained unchanged at 2.9%. The euro area bank lending survey for the second quarter of 2018 indicates that loan growth continues to be supported by easing credit standards and increasing demand across all loan categories. The pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014 continues to significantly support borrowing conditions for firms and households, access to financing  in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises  and credit flows across the euro area. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is still necessary for the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute more decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential and reducing vulnerabilities. The implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up to increase resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost euro area productivity and growth potential. Regarding fiscal policies, the ongoing broad-based expansion calls for rebuilding fiscal buffers. This is particularly important in countries where government debt remains high. All countries would benefit from intensifying efforts towards achieving a more growth-friendly composition of public finances. A full, transparent and consistent implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact and of the macroeconomic imbalance procedure over time and across countries remains essential to increase the resilience of the euro area economy. Improving the functioning of Economic and Monetary Union remains a priority. The Governing Council urges specific and decisive steps to complete the banking union and the capital markets union."
Colombia,2018-07-27,"The Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica, in its meeting today, decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 4.25% For this decision, the Board mainly took into account the following aspects. In June, inflation increased slightly, reaching 3.2%. Food as well as the groups of goods and services that were most affected by the exchange rate contributed the most to the increase of inflation. In the same month, all core inflation indicators declined, and their average stood at 3.33%. Inflation expectations recorded slight changes and remain above the 3.0% target. Analysts' inflation expectations stand, on average, at 3.37% and 3.33% for December 2018 and 2019, respectively. Those embedded in public debt bonds to 2, 3, and 5 years stand between 3.0% and 3.4%. Growth of the country's trading partners continues to be dynamic, driven by developed economies and by the major emerging economies. Oil prices remain at levels that surpass the averages recorded in the last two years. The increase in the country's terms of trade and a better dynamics expected from external demand would continue favoring the recovery of the country's external income. In this environment, the exchange rate has been relatively stable. GDP results for the first quarter and the indicators of economic activity for the second quarter suggest that the economy would have continued growing slowly, albeit faster than in 2017. With these results, the technical staff of the Central Bank maintained its growth estimate for 2018 at 2.7%. However, the Bank's technical staff estimated that the productive capacity of the economy is still underused, and that this situation would widen in 2018. The new figures of the external sector for the second quarter suggest that the adjustment of the external balance is somewhat slower than expected. However, for all of 2018, the forecast of the current account deficit as a share of GDP is still lower than in 2017. Based on this information, the Board considered the following factors for its decision. Uncertainty regarding the pace of recovery of economic activity. On the one hand, the excess capacity is expected to expand in 2018. On the other, should the price of oil remain at current levels for an extended period of time, or should the increasing trend in confidence persist, the dynamics of aggregate demand could be better than expected. Uncertainty in this regard is high. The stability of inflation and its expectations above the target, and some risks that could push inflation upwards and delay its convergence to 3.0% (among them, a stronger-than-expected depreciation of the peso that could be passed-through to domestic prices). Again, uncertainty on these events is high. In this environment, upon assessing the situation of the economy and balance of risks, the Board of Directors deemed appropriate to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 4.25%. The Board will continue to carefully monitor the behavior of inflation and the forecasts for economic activity and inflation in the country, as well as the international context. Finally, the Board reiterates that the monetary policy will depend on the availability of new information. The decision to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 4.25% was approved unanimously."
Russia,2018-07-27,"On 27 July 2018, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to keep the key rate at 7.25% per annum. Though annual inflation remains below the target, it is tending to return to 4%. The Bank of Russia forecasts that consumer prices will grow by 3.54% year-on-year at the end of 2018 and annual inflation will temporarily overshoot 4% in 2019 due to the planned increase of the value added tax. The annual consumer price growth rate will return to 4% in early 2020. The balance of risks is shifted towards proinflationary risks. Uncertainty persists over how strongly the tax measures may affect inflation expectations and how the external conditions will develop. In making its key rate decisions the Bank of Russia will assess inflation risks, inflation dynamics and economic developments against the forecast. The Bank of Russia considers that monetary policy is highly likely to shift to a neutral stance in 2019. Inflation dynamics. Annual inflation remains low. It stood at 2.3% in June and is expected to hold within the 2.52.6% range in July in line with the Bank of Russia's forecast. According to Bank of Russia estimates, a majority of annual inflation indicators reflecting the most sustainable price movements suggests that inflation is gradually returning to the target. Inflation for main consumer basket product groups continued to show mixed dynamics in June. The annual price growth rate in the food market was near zero. Fruit and vegetable prices went down on the back of the last year's high base effect, among other reasons. That said, annual inflation in other food product categories rose from 0.8% in May to 1.1% in June. The annual price growth rate in the non-food market jumped to 3.7% (vs 3.4% seen in May), driven mainly by rising petrochemical prices. Petrol price movements affected inflation expectations which continued to rise in June. Real-time July data show that petrol prices ceased to increase as a result of the decision to cut petrochemical excise taxes. In these circumstances, household inflation expectations stabilised in July. The annual services price growth rate held close to 4% in June. The Bank of Russia forecasts that annual inflation will stand at 3.54% at the end of 2018 and temporarily overshoot 4% in 2019 due to the planned increase of the value added tax. This increase will have a one-off effect on price dynamics. As a result annual consumer price growth rate will return to 4% in early 2020. Monetary conditions are close to neutral. The Bank of Russia estimates that they are already causing almost no constraining impact on credit, demand and inflation dynamics. Monetary conditions evolve, among other things, under the influence of earlier decisions to cut the key rate. Deposits remain attractive for households at the current interest rate levels. The conservative approach of banks to screening borrowers and the revision of risk ratios on unsecured consumer loans (effective from 1 September 2018) create conditions for lending growth that would pose no risks to price and financial stability. Given the effect of the planned fiscal measures on inflation and inflation expectations, monetary conditions should remain to some extent tight to limit the scale of secondary effects and stabilise annual inflation close to 4% over the forecast horizon. Economic activity. The updated Rosstat statistics reflect steadier economic growth in 2017 â€” early 2018 than previous estimates. It does not materially change the Bank of Russia's view regarding the influence of business activity on inflation, considering that the reviewed data mostly concern investment goods production. The FIFA World Cup made a positive contribution to the annual GDP growth rate in Q2 (0.10.2 pps). The Bank of Russia forecasts that in 2018 the Russian economy will post a 1.52% growth rate, which corresponds to its potential amid the remaining structural limitations. Inflation risks. The balance of risks is shifted towards proinflationary risks. Main risks are related to a high uncertainty over the scale of secondary effects of the adopted tax decisions (primarily, the response of inflation expectations) and the external factors. With regard to external conditions, accelerated yield growth in advanced economies and geopolitical factors may cause surges in volatility in financial markets and affect expectations for the exchange rate and inflation. The Bank of Russia leaves mostly unchanged its estimates of risks associated with consumer and oil price volatility, wage movements and possible changes in consumer behaviour. These risks remain moderate. In making its key rate decisions the Bank of Russia will assess inflation risks, inflation dynamics and economic developments against the forecast. The Bank of Russia considers that monetary policy is highly likely to shift to a neutral stance in 2019. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next key rate review meeting on 14 September 2018. The Board decision press release is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time. The reference to the Press Service is mandatory if you intend to use this material."
Brazil,2018-08-01,"The Copom unanimously decided to maintain the Selic rate at 6.50% p.a. The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario:. Recent indicators of economic activity reflect the effects of the temporary halt in the transportation sector, but there is evidence of subsequent recovery. The baseline scenario entertains continuation of recovery of economic activity in the Brazilian economy, at a more gradual pace than envisaged prior to the halt. The global outlook showed some accommodation recently, but remains more challenging. The main risks are associated with normalization of interest rates in some advanced economies and with uncertainty regarding global trade. Risk appetite towards emerging economies remained relatively stable, at a level below that observed earlier this year. June inflation reflected significant upward pressure from the halt in the transportation sector and other relative price changes. Recent data corroborate the view that these effects should be temporary. Measures of underlying inflation are still running at low levels. This includes the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy. Inflation expectations for 2018 and 2019 collected by the Focus survey are around 4.1%. The Copom's inflation projections in the scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the Focus survey stand around 4.2% for 2018, and 3.8% for 2019. This scenario assumes a path for the policy interest rate that ends 2018 at 6.5% p.a., and 2019 at 8.0% p.a., and a path for the exchange rate that ends 2018 at R$/US$ 3.70 and 2019 at that same level. In the scenario with a constant interest rate, at 6.50% p.a., and a constant exchange rate, at R$/US$ 3.75*, the projections for 2018 and 2019 stand around 4.2% and 4.1%, respectively. The Committee emphasizes that risks around its baseline scenario remain in both directions. On the one hand, possible propagation through inertial mechanisms of low inflation levels in the past and the high level of economic slack may lead to a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory. On the other hand, frustration of expectations regarding the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy may affect risk premia and increase the path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy. This risk intensifies in case the global outlook for emerging economies deteriorates. The Committee judges that the latter risks remain at higher levels. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the wide array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to maintain the Selic rate at 6.50% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation and the associated balance of risks and is consistent with convergence of inflation to target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, which includes 2019. The Committee reiterates that economic conditions prescribe accommodative monetary policy, i.e., interest rates below the structural level. The Copom emphasizes that the evolution of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy is essential to maintain low inflation in the medium and long run, for the reduction of its structural interest rate, and for sustainable economic recovery. The Committee stresses that the perception of continuation of the reform agenda affects current expectations and macroeconomic projections. The Copom judges that it should base its decisions on the evolution of inflation projections and expectations, of the balance of risks, and of economic activity. Shocks that produce relative price changes should only lead to a monetary policy response to their possible second-round effects (i.e., to the propagation to prices in the economy that are not directly affected by the shock). It is through such second-round effects that these shocks may affect inflation projections and expectations, and change the balance of risks. These effects may be mitigated by the level of economic slack and by inflation expectations anchored around the targets. Therefore, there is no mechanical relationship between recent shocks and the conduct of monetary policy. The Committee judges that the effects of recent shocks on inflation are revealing themselves temporary, but it is important to follow the baseline scenario and associated risks, and to assess possible persistent effects of shocks to inflation (i.e., their second-round effects). In the Copom's assessment, the evolution of the baseline scenario and of the balance of risks prescribes keeping the Selic rate at its current level. The Copom emphasizes that the next steps in the conduct of monetary policy will continue to depend on the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, and on inflation projections and expectations. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Ilan Goldfajn (Governor). Carlos Viana de Carvalho. Carolina de Assis Barros. MaurÃ­cio Costa de Moura. OtÃ¡vio Ribeiro Damaso. Paulo Sergio Neves de Souza. Reinaldo Le Grazie. Sidnei CorrÃªa Marques, and Tiago Couto Berriel. *Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average R$/US$ exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the Friday prior to the Copom meeting."
India,2018-08-01,"Third Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2018-19 Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) Reserve Bank of India On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation at its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to: increase the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 25 basis points to 6.5 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF stands adjusted to 6.25 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate to 6.75 per cent. The decision of the MPC is consistent with the neutral stance of monetary policy in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Assessment 2. Since the last meeting of the MPC in June 2018, global economic activity has continued to maintain steam; however, global growth has become uneven and risks to the outlook have increased with rising trade tensions. Among advanced economies (AEs), the US economy rebounded strongly in Q2, after modest growth in Q1, on the back of rising personal consumption expenditures and exports. In the Euro Area, weak growth in Q1 continued in Q2 due to subdued consumer demand, weighed down by political uncertainty and a strong currency. In Japan, recent data on retail sales, consumer confidence and business sentiment point to moderation in growth. Economic activity in major emerging market economies (EMEs) has slowed somewhat on volatile and elevated oil prices, mounting trade tensions and tightening of financial conditions. The Chinese economy lost some pace in Q2, pulled down by efforts to contain debt. The Russian economy picked up in Q1; recent data on employment, industrial production and exports indicate that the economy has gained further momentum. South Africa's economy contracted in Q1; though consumer sentiment has improved, high unemployment and weak exports pose challenges. In Brazil, economic activity suffered a setback in Q1 on nation-wide strikes; more recent data suggest that growth remained muted as industrial production contracted in May and the manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) declined.2 4. Global trade lost some traction due to intensification of trade wars and uncertainty stemming from Brexit negotiations. Crude oil prices, which remained volatile and elevated in May-June on a delicate demand-supply balance, eased modestly in the second half of July on higher supply from Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC producers. Base metal prices have fallen on the general risk-off sentiment triggered by fears of an intensification of trade wars. Gold prices have softened on a stronger dollar. Inflation remained firm in the US, reflecting higher oil prices and stronger aggregate demand. Inflation has edged up also in some other major advanced and emerging economies, driven, in part, by rising energy prices and pass-through effects from currency depreciations. Financial markets have continued to be driven mainly by monetary policy stances in major AEs and geopolitical tensions. Equity markets in AEs have declined on trade tensions and uncertainty relating to Brexit negotiations. Investors' appetite for EME assets has waned on increases in interest rates by the US Fed. The 10-year sovereign yield in the US has moderated somewhat from its peak on May 17 on safe-haven demand, spurred by escalating trade conflicts. Yields have softened in other key AEs as well. In most EMEs, however, movements in yields have varied reflecting domestic macroeconomic fundamentals and tightening global liquidity. Capital flows to EMEs declined in anticipation of monetary policy tightening in AEs. In currency markets, the US dollar appreciated, supported by strong economic data. The euro strengthened in June on receding political uncertainty and taper talk by the central bank. However, the currency has traded soft thereafter on mixed economic data and the rising US dollar. EME currencies, in general, have depreciated against the US dollar over the last month. On the domestic front, south-west monsoon has been recovering after a brief spell of deficiency in the second half of June. The cumulative rainfall up to July 31, 2018 was 6 per cent below the long-period average. In terms of spatial distribution, 28 of the 36 sub-divisions received normal or excess rainfall, whereas 8 sub-divisions received deficient rainfall as against three sub-divisions last year. The total sown area of kharif crops as on July 27 was 7.5 per cent lower than that a year ago. The live storage in major reservoirs as on July 26 was at 41 per cent of the full reservoir level compared with 36 per cent a year ago, which portends well for the rabi sowing season. Industrial growth, measured by the index of industrial production (IIP), strengthened in April-May 2018 on a y-o-y basis. This was driven mainly by a significant turnaround in the production of capital goods and consumer durables. Growth in the infrastructure/construction sector accelerated sharply, reflecting the government's thrust on national highways and rural housing, while the growth of consumer non-durables decelerated significantly. The output of eight core industries accelerated in June due to higher production in petroleum refinery products, steel, coal and cement. Capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector remains robust. The assessment based on the Reserve Bank's business expectations index (BEI) for Q1:2018-19 remained optimistic notwithstanding some softening in production, order books and exports. The July manufacturing PMI remained in expansion zone, although it eased from its level a month ago with slower growth in output, new orders and employment. Several high-frequency indicators of services activity increased at a faster pace in May-June. Tractor and two-wheeler sales growth accelerated significantly, suggesting strong rural demand. Passenger vehicle sales growth, an indicator of urban demand, also strengthened. Commercial vehicle sales growth remained robust despite some deceleration. Domestic air passenger traffic  another indicator of urban demand  maintained double-digit growth. Construction activity indicators also improved with cement production sustaining double digit growth for the eighth consecutive month in June. Steel consumption also3 accelerated in May. The services PMI expanded to a twelve-month high in June, after a marginal contraction in May, supported by expansion in new business and employment. Retail inflation, measured by the year-on-year change in the CPI, rose from 4.9 per cent in May to 5 per cent in June, driven by an uptick in inflation in fuel and in items other than food and fuel even as food inflation remained muted due to lower than usual seasonal uptick in prices of fruits and vegetables in summer months. Adjusting for the estimated impact of the 7th central pay commission's house rent allowances (HRA), headline inflation increased from 4.5 per cent in May to 4.6 per cent in June. Low inflation continued in cereals, meat, milk, oil, spices and non-alcoholic beverages, and pulses and sugar prices remained in deflation. Fuel and light group inflation rose sharply, pulled up by liquefied petroleum gas and kerosene. Inflation in firewood and chips ticked up, while electricity inflation remained low. The pass-through of global crude oil prices impacted inflation in domestic petroleum products as well as transport services. Inflation also picked up modestly in respect of education and health. The June round of the Reserve Bank's survey of households reported a further uptick of 20 basis points in inflation expectations for both three-month and one-year ahead horizons as compared with the last round. Manufacturing firms polled in the Reserve Bank's industrial outlook survey (IOS) reported higher input costs and selling prices in Q1:2018-19. The manufacturing PMI showed that input prices eased slightly in July, although they remained high. Input costs for companies polled in Services PMI in June also stayed elevated. Farm and non-farm input costs rose significantly. Notwithstanding some pick-up in February and March 2018, rural wage growth remained moderate, while wage growth in the organised sector remained firm. Systemic liquidity remained generally in surplus mode during June-July 2018. In June, the Reserve Bank absorbed surplus liquidity of around â‚¹140 billion on a daily net average basis under the LAF even as the system migrated from net surplus to a net deficit mode in the second half of the month due to advance tax outflows. Interest rates in the overnight call money market firmed up in June reflecting the increase in the repo rate on June 6, 2018. The weighted average call rate (WACR) traded, on an average, 12 basis points below the repo rate  the same as in May. Systemic liquidity moved back into surplus mode in early July with increased government spending but turned into deficit from July 10 onwards; on a daily net average basis, the Reserve Bank injected liquidity under the LAF of â‚¹107 billion in July. The WACR in July, on an average, traded 9 basis points below the policy rate. Based on an assessment of prevailing liquidity conditions and of durable liquidity needs going forward, the Reserve Bank conducted two open market operation (OMO) purchase auctions of â‚¹100 billion each on June 21 and July 19, 2018. Export growth picked up in May and June 2018 on a y-o-y basis, aided by engineering goods, petroleum products, drugs and pharmaceuticals, and chemicals. Import growth also accelerated largely due to an increase in crude oil prices. Among non-oil imports, gold imports declined due to lower volume, while imports of machinery, coal, electronic goods, chemicals, and iron and steel increased sharply. Double-digit import growth in May and June pushed up the trade deficit. On the financing side, net foreign direct investment (FDI) flows improved significantly in the first two months of 2018-19. With the tightening of liquidity conditions in AEs, growing geopolitical concerns and with the escalation of protectionist sentiment, net foreign portfolio investment (FPI) outflows from the domestic capital market have continued, albeit at an increasingly slower rate. India's foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 404.2 billion on July 27, 2018.4 Outlook 14. In the second bi-monthly resolution of 2018-19. CPI inflation for 2018-19 was projected at 4.8-4.9 per cent in H1 and 4.7 per cent in H2, including the HRA impact for central government employees, with risks tilted to the upside. Excluding the impact of HRA revisions. CPI inflation was projected at 4.6 per cent in H1 and 4.7 per cent in H2. Actual inflation outcomes have been slightly below the projected trajectory as the seasonal summer surge in vegetable prices has remained somewhat muted in comparison with its past behaviour and fruits prices have declined. The inflation outlook is likely to be shaped by several factors. First, the central government has decided to fix the minimum support prices (MSPs) of at least 150 per cent of the cost of production for all kharif crops for the sowing season of 2018-19. This increase in MSPs for kharif crops, which is much larger than the average increase seen in the past few years, will have a direct impact on food inflation and second round effects on headline inflation. A part of the increase in MSPs based on historical trends was already included in the June baseline projections. As such, only the incremental increase in MSPs over the average increase in the past will impact inflation projections. However, there is a considerable uncertainty and the exact impact would depend on the nature and scale of the government's procurement operations. Second, the overall performance of the monsoon so far augurs well for food inflation in the medium-term. Third, crude oil prices have moderated slightly, but remain at elevated levels. Fourth, the central government has reduced Goods and Services Tax (GST) rates on several goods and services. This will have some direct moderating impact on inflation, provided there is a pass-through of reduced GST rates to retail consumers. Fifth, inflation in items excluding food and fuel has been broad-based and has risen significantly in recent months, reflecting greater pass-through of rising input costs and improving demand conditions. Finally, financial markets continue to be volatile. Based on an assessment of the above-mentioned factors, inflation is projected at 4.6 per cent in Q2, 4.8 per cent in H2 of 2018-19 and 5.0 per cent in Q1:2019-20, with risks evenly balanced (Chart 1). Excluding the HRA impact. CPI inflation is projected at 4.4 per cent in Q2, 4.7-4.8 per cent in H2 and 5.0 per cent in Q1:2019-20. Turning to the growth outlook, various indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to be strong. The progress of the monsoon so far and a sharper than the usual increase in MSPs of kharif crops are expected to boost rural demand by raising farmers' income. Robust corporate earnings, especially of fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies, also reflect buoyant rural demand. Investment activity remains firm even as there has been some tightening of financing conditions in the recent period. Increased FDI flows in recent months and continued buoyant domestic capital market conditions bode well for investment activity. The Reserve Bank's IOS indicates that activity in the manufacturing sector is expected to remain robust in Q2, though there may be some moderation in pace. Rising trade tensions may, however, have an adverse impact on India's exports. Based on an overall assessment. GDP growth projection for 2018-19 is retained, as in the June statement, at 7.4 per cent, ranging 7.5-7.6 per cent in H1 and 7.3-7.4 per cent in H2, with risks evenly balanced; GDP growth for Q1:2019-20 is projected at 7.5 per cent (Chart 2).5 17. Even as inflation projections for Q2 have been revised marginally downwards vis-Ã - vis the June statement, projections for Q3 onwards remain broadly unchanged. Several risks persist. First, crude oil prices continue to be volatile and vulnerable to both upside and downside risks. In particular, while geopolitical tensions and supply disruptions remain an upside risk to oil prices, the fall in global demand due to further intensification of protectionist trade policies could pull down oil prices. Second, volatility in global financial markets continues to impart uncertainty to the inflation outlook. Third, households' inflation expectations, as measured by the Reserve Bank's survey, have risen significantly in the last two rounds, which could influence actual inflation outcomes in the months to come. Fourth, manufacturing firms polled in the Reserve Bank's industrial outlook survey have reported hardening of input price pressures in Q2 of 2018-19. However, if the recent softening of global commodity prices persists, it could mitigate some of the upward pressure on input costs. Fifth, though the monsoon has been normal temporally so far, its regional distribution needs to be carefully monitored in the context of key CPI components such as paddy. Sixth, in case there is fiscal slippage at the centre and/or state levels, it could have adverse implications for market volatility, crowd out private investment and impact the outlook for inflation. Seventh, uncertainty around the full impact of MSP on inflation will only resolve in the next several months once the price support schemes are implemented. Finally, the staggered impact of HRA revision by state governments may push headline inflation up. While the statistical impact of HRA revisions will be looked through, there is need to watch out for any second-round impact on inflation. Against the above backdrop, the MPC decided to increase the policy repo rate by 25 basis points. The MPC reiterates its commitment to achieving the medium-term target for headline inflation of 4 per cent on a durable basis. The MPC notes that domestic economic activity has continued to sustain momentum and the output gap has virtually closed. However, uncertainty around domestic inflation needs to be carefully monitored in the coming months. In addition, recent global developments raise some concerns. Rising trade protectionism poses a grave risk to near-term and long-term global growth prospects by adversely impacting investment, disrupting global supply chains and hampering productivity. Geopolitical tensions and elevated oil prices continue to be the other sources of risk to global growth.6 20. Dr.Chetan Ghate. Dr.Pami Dua. Dr.Michael Debabrata Patra. Dr.Viral V.

United States,2018-08-01,"EDT August 1, 2018 Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a strong rate. Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low. Household spending and business fixed investment have grown strongly. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remain near 2 percent. Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term. Risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1-3/4 to 2 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Jerome H Powell. Chairman; John C Williams. Vice Chairman; Thomas I Barkin; Raphael W Bostic; Lael Brainard; Esther L George; Loretta J Mester; and Randal K Quarles."
Czech Republic,2018-08-02,"At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank unanimously increased the two-week repo rate by 25 basis points to 1.25%. At the same time, it increased the Lombard rate by 25 basis points to 2.25% and the discount rate by 20 basis points to 0.25%.. The decision adopted by the Bank Board is underpinned by a new macroeconomic forecast of the Czech National Bank. Consistent with the forecast is a continued rise in interest rates towards their long-run neutral level. Room for an earlier increase in interest rates than assumed by the previous forecast has been created mainly by a deviation in the path of the koruna exchange rate due to global factors. More inflationary factors in the domestic economy have also contributed. According to the external assumptions of the forecast, economic growth in the euro area is expected to slow gradually. A weakening of the euro and higher energy prices have moved the outlook for both producer and consumer prices in the euro area upwards for this year. Inflation will thus be just below 2% over the next two years. This will enable the European Central Bank to end its asset purchase programme at the end of this year. However, the European Central Bank has stated that will not start increasing interest rates until some time later. The 3M EURIBOR is thus expected to remain negative until early 2020. The price of Brent crude oil will decline gradually from its current elevated level. The market expects the euro to appreciate slightly against the dollar from its current weakened level. The increase in domestic inflation above the 2% target during Q2 reflected, among other factors, growth in volatile consumer basket items  fuel and food prices. Administered prices of electricity increased as well. The overall fundamental inflation pressures remain strong and will rise even further in the short run. They are connected mainly with buoyant wage growth in the Czech economy. At the same time, the anti-inflationary effect of import prices will halt temporarily. Import prices reflect the koruna's recent depreciation stemming from a deterioration in sentiment on global markets. Until mid-2019, therefore, inflation will be above the 2% target, although still within its tolerance band. In the meantime, the overall inflation pressures will start to ease gradually owing to continued growth in interest rates, renewed appreciation of the koruna and slower wage growth. Inflation will thus return to the Czech National Bank's 2% target at the monetary policy horizon, i.e. in the second half of next year. During 2020, it will stay close to the target. The growth of the Czech economy will slow from last year's high pace this year. However, it will remain above 3% in the following years. It will be driven mainly by robust growth in household consumption, reflecting optimism of consumers in an environment of rapid growth in their income. Briskly rising external demand and increasingly distinct labour shortages will continue to motivate domestic firms to invest in machinery and equipment. Fiscal policy will contribute to domestic demand growth in 2018 and 2019 via faster drawdown of EU funds and a significant rise in current expenditure. By contrast, the monetary conditions will tighten further in the interest rate component and later also in the exchange rate component again. The contribution of net exports to economic growth will be temporarily negative this year. The strong economic growth is reflected in a very tight labour market. The unemployment rate is at a record low and there is little room for it to decrease further. Employment growth will therefore slow, while wage growth will remain high. However, it, too, will moderate gradually in the following years. After weakening temporarily, the koruna will return to an appreciation trend. The exchange rate forecast reflects a recent change in sentiment on foreign exchange markets and a related outflow of short-term capital from emerging markets. This global effect is expected to partly persist in the next two quarters. Nonetheless, the koruna will start to appreciate again at the close of this year. This appreciation will be driven by a distinctly positive interest rate differential vis-Ã -vis the euro area, the fading effects of asset purchases by the European Central Bank and real convergence of the Czech economy According to the forecast, the koruna will thus appreciate below CZK 25 to the euro in early 2019. Consistent with the forecast is a continued rise in interest rates towards their long-run neutral level. This is a reaction to marked inflation pressures from the domestic economy and, in the second half of this year, also to the temporary depreciation of the koruna. The broad stability of rates next year is a result of renewed appreciation of the koruna amid continuing very easy monetary policy of the European Central Bank. A subsequent tightening of its policy combined with a broadly stable koruna exchange rate will create room for further growth in domestic rates in 2020. Compared to the previous forecast, the inflation forecast is higher for the coming year, although only slightly at the monetary policy horizon. By contrast, the forecast for the growth of the Czech economy this year is markedly lower, while the outlook for next year remains unchanged. The shift of the exchange rate outlook towards weaker levels takes into account past market developments driven by the worsening of global sentiment. Together with other factors, this leads to a need for higher interest rates this year. The longer outlook for domestic rates is little changed."
Mexico,2018-08-02,"Banco de Mexico's Governing Board decided to maintain the target for the overnight interbank interest rate unchanged at 7.75%. Available data up to the second quarter of 2018 suggests that the world economy continued to grow at a relatively fast pace. However, there is an increasing divergence in the main advanced economies' performance. In particular, in contrast with the Eurozone. Japan and the U.K., which have grown below expectations, economic activity in the U.S. grew at a faster rate, partly in response to the fiscal stimulus implemented. Under conditions of reduced slack in the economy, this situation could exert greater pressures on inflation. As expected, in August the Federal Reserve kept the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged and reiterated its forecast of increasing it gradually. The world economy is subject to uncertainty in the short term and, to a larger extent, in the medium term. This is due to the risks associated with the intensification of trade-related disputes, to a possible tightening of financial conditions, and to geopolitical factors. International financial markets have undergone episodes of volatility in recent weeks. In particular, asset prices of emerging economies declined, particularly those of Asian countries. In contrast, since the last monetary policy decision, the Mexican peso appreciated and exhibited lower levels of volatility. This behavior reflected, in part, lesser uncertainty after the country's elections and an improvement in the outlook for the NAFTA renegotiation. Interest rates in Mexico decreased moderately for both short and long tenors. The latest information suggests that during the second quarter of 2018, economic activity in Mexico contracted with respect to the previous quarter. This result is partly the reflection of both the reversion in the dynamism that investment in construction had presented and the weakening of exports, although private consumption is expected to have exhibited positive results. As a result, slack conditions are estimated to have loosened, while in 2018 GDP growth is anticipated to fall to the lower half of the estimated range (2 to 3%) and, therefore, that slack conditions will continue to loosen. Given the uncertainty generated by the complex environment faced by the Mexican economy. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board considers that the balance of risks for growth maintains a bias to the downside. The Mexican economy is now in a better position to cope with adverse scenarios due to the central bank's monetary policy stance adopted to keep medium- and long-term inflation expectations anchored, the fiscal commitments, and the financial system's resilience. Nevertheless, the economy is expected to continue facing a complex environment, both in the external and domestic fronts. For this reason, it is particularly relevant that, in addition to following a prudent and robust monetary policy, measures to foster greater productivity are adopted and public finances are consolidated sustainably. During the first months of 2018, annual headline inflation decreased, in line with the trajectory forecasted by Banco de Mexico in its latest Quarterly Report. Nevertheless, since June, some of the risks to the upside that had been previously referred to materialized, due to higher-than-expected rises in the prices 1 of energy-related products, mainly those of gasoline and L.P. gas, which led to significant increases in non-core inflation. The referred change in relative prices affects the expected trajectory for headline inflation for the next twelve months, although its effects are estimated to be transitory. Core inflation, on the other hand, continues to follow a downward trend and is foreseen to continue to decrease within the time frame in which monetary policy operates. Under this context, expectations for headline inflation for the end of 2018 were adjusted from 4.00% in June to 4.25% in July, whereas those for the end of 2019 remained around 3.60%, and those for the medium and long terms around 3.50%. The above scenario continues to be subject to risks and to a high degree of uncertainty. Among the upside risks to inflation are pressures on the peso exchange rate due to an environment of higher external interest rates and U.S. dollar strength, and to persisting uncertainty in both the external and domestic fronts, among which the NAFTA renegotiation stands out. In the event of a scenario in which the real exchange rate would need to adjust. Banco de Mexico will make sure it takes place in an orderly manner, and with no second-round effects on the economy's price formation process. On the other hand, the risk of additional upward pressures on some energy prices or of increases in agricultural prices persists. There is also the risk that the trade policy measures adopted by the U.S. give rise to an escalation of protectionist and countervailing actions that could adversely affect the behavior of inflation. As for downside risks, the peso could appreciate if NAFTA negotiations turn out to be favorable. Summing up, since the last monetary policy decision, the balance of risks to the forecasted trajectory of inflation remains biased upwards, in an environment of high uncertainty. To guide its monetary policy actions. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board follows closely the development of inflation vis-Ã -vis its anticipated trajectory, taking into account the monetary policy stance adopted and the time frame in which monetary policy operates, as well as available information on all inflation determinants and on medium- and long-term inflation expectations, including the balance of risks for such factors. Given the Mexican economy's recent developments and, in particular, that the shocks that have affected inflation recently are of a transitory nature, and considering that core inflation is expected to continue on a downward trend. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board has voted unanimously to maintain the target for the overnight interbank interest rate unchanged at 7.75%. Looking ahead, the Governing Board will maintain a prudent monetary policy stance and will continue to follow closely the potential pass-through of exchange rate fluctuations to prices, the monetary policy stance relative to that of the U.S., and the conditions of slack in the Mexican economy. In the presence and possible persistence of factors that, by their nature, involve risks to both inflation and inflation expectations, monetary policy will be adjusted in a timely and robust manner to achieve the convergence of inflation to its 3% target and to firmly anchor medium- and long-term inflation expectations so that they attain such target."
Romania,2018-08-06,"In its meeting of 6 August 2018, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided:. The annual CPI inflation rate stopped increasing in June, when it stalled at 5.4 percent, above the variation band of the inflation target. The stagnation occurred as the impact of the faster annual rise in fuel prices and fruit and vegetables prices was offset by that of the slower growth of tobacco product prices and the slight deceleration in core inflation. The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate (which excludes from the CPI inflation a number of prices on which monetary policy has limited or no influence, i.e. administered prices, volatile prices, and tobacco product and alcoholic beverage prices) continued to fall somewhat, down to 2.9 percent in June from 2.99 percent in the prior month and 3.05 percent in March. The slowdown was ascribed to processed food and services components, largely under the influence of the dynamics of international prices of some agri-food items and the movements in the EUR/RON exchange rate. In June, the average annual CPI inflation rate reached 3.6 percent, against 3.3 percent in May; calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, the average annual rate came in at 2.9 percent from 2.6 percent in May. Provisional data on first-quarter economic growth point to its moderation to 4 percent from 6.7 percent in the final quarter of 2017. This development is a return towards the potential rate of increase, being accompanied by a contraction in excess aggregate demand. The major contribution, albeit on the wane against 2017 Q4, of household consumption was revised slightly downwards, while the positive contribution of gross fixed capital formation was revised upwards. The negative contribution of net exports to the advance in real GDP widened considerably, given that the new figures show the yearly dynamics of imports decelerating more slowly than previously announced, further running at quite elevated levels. The latest statistical data show a deceleration in the annual growth of industrial output in April-May compared with 2018 Q1, together with a significant increase, however, in the growth rate of new orders across manufacturing. Construction works kept declining in annual terms, owing to residential construction, whereas activity in trade further grew at a robust pace. The current account deficit widened year on year at a substantially slower rate. At the same time, the annual change of unit wage costs in the industrial sector climbed to 8.6 percent in May, up 2.4 percentage points versus April, amid slower growth in labour productivity. Monetary conditions have further been less accommodative, amid the increase in relevant money market rates and the slight appreciation trend of the leu versus the euro. The annual growth rate of credit to the private sector regained momentum in June, to 6.8 percent from 6.4 percent in May, driven by loans to households, but especially by credit to non-financial corporations. The leu-denominated component further widened its share in total private sector credit, to reach 65 percent (from a 35.6 percent low in May 2012). In today's meeting, the NBR Board examined and approved the August 2018 Inflation Report, which incorporates the most recent data and information available. The new scenario of the projection reconfirms the prospects for a decline in Q3 in the annual inflation rate, which is seen remaining above the variation band of the target, before dropping more visibly in the final months of 2018 towards the upper bound of the 1.5 percent-3.5 percent target band. The anticipated path of the annual inflation rate sticks to coordinates quasi-similar to those in the preceding projection over the short term, but has been slightly revised downwards over the longer time horizon. The uncertainties and risks surrounding the inflation outlook stem mainly from developments in administered prices (natural gas and electricity), volatile food prices and prices of some processed food items, as well as from labour market conditions and the fiscal policy stance. Also relevant are the future movements in the international oil price, the economic growth pace and the inflation dynamics in the euro area and the EU and hence the monetary policy stance of the ECB and of central banks in the region. Based on the currently available data, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided to keep unchanged the monetary policy rate at 2.50 percent per annum; moreover, the NBR Board decided to leave unchanged the deposit facility rate at 1.50 percent per annum and the lending (Lombard) facility rate at 3.50 percent per annum. In addition, the NBR Board decided to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board decisions aim to ensure and preserve price stability over the medium term in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth and amid safeguarding financial stability. The NBR Board underlines that the balanced macroeconomic policy mix and the implementation of structural reforms designed to foster the growth potential over the long term are of the essence in preserving a stable macroeconomic framework and strengthening the capacity of the Romanian economy to withstand potential adverse developments. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be presented to the public in a press conference on 8 August 2018, at 11:00 a.m. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR website on 13 August 2018, at 3:00 p.m. The next monetary policy meeting of the NBR Board is scheduled for 3 October 2018."
Philippines,2018-08-08,"At its meeting on monetary policy today, the Monetary Board decided to raise the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) facility by 50 basis points to 4.0 percent, effective Friday, 10 August 2018. The interest rates on the overnight lending and deposit facilities were likewise raised accordingly. In deciding to raise the BSP's policy interest rate anew, the Monetary Board noted that latest baseline forecasts have shifted higher over the policy horizon, indicating some risk of inflation exceeding the target in 2019. Upside risks also continue to dominate the inflation outlook, as the sustained increase in core inflation suggests broadening price pressures amid resilient aggregate demand conditions. Meanwhile, inflation expectations remain elevated, although staying within the target of 3.0 percent Â± 1.0 percentage point for 2019. For these reasons, the Monetary Board deemed stronger monetary action to be necessary to rein in inflation expectations and prevent sustained supply-side price pressures from driving further second-round effects, even as the previous monetary policy responses continue to work their way through the economy. The Monetary Board believed that the series of policy rate adjustments thus far in 2018 will help reduce further the risks to inflation, including those emanating from the ongoing normalization of monetary policy in advanced economies and its impact on the foreign exchange market, and bring inflation toward a target-consistent path over the medium term. Favorable conditions arising from sustained domestic growth also suggest that the economy can accommodate a further tightening of monetary policy settings. The Monetary Board likewise reaffirmed its support for carefully coordinated efforts with other government agencies in implementing non-monetary measures to further mitigate the impact of supply-side factors on inflation. The BSP reiterates its strong commitment and readiness to take all necessary policy actions to address the threat of high inflation and deliver on its primary mandate of price stability."
Thailand,2018-08-08,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 5/2018 Mr. Jaturong Jantarangs. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 8 August 2018 as follows. The Committee voted 6 to 1 to maintain the policy rate at 150 percent. One member voted to raise the policy rate by 025 percentage point from 150 to 175 percent. In deliberating their policy decision, the Committee assessed that the Thai economy continued to gain further traction, driven by both domestic and external demand. Headline inflation was projected to increase broadly in line with the previous assessment, while core inflation was expected to rise slowly. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative and conducive to economic growth. Financial stability remained sound overall, but it was deemed necessary to monitor risks that might lead to the build-up of vulnerabilities in the financial system in the future, especially those resulting from the prolonged period of monetary accommodation. The Committee viewed that the current accommodative monetary policy stance remained conducive to the continuation of economic growth and was appropriate given the inflation target. Thus most members decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at this meeting. Nevertheless one member viewed that the economic expansion was sufficiently robust and that prolonged monetary accommodation might induce households and businesses to underestimate potential changes in financial conditions, and thus voted to raise the policy rate at this meeting in order to curb financial stability risks that could affect the sustainability of economic growth over the longer term and to start building policy space. The Thai economy as a whole continued to gain further traction, driven by merchandise exports and tourism which continued to improve in tandem with global economic growth, and by stronger momentum from domestic demand. Merchandise exports were expected to achieve higher growth than previously assessed partly due to the relocation of production base to Thailand for some industries. Private consumption continued to expand supported by improvements in employment, but overall purchasing power was recovering gradually due to elevated household debt. Private investment was projected to continue expanding with additional support from greater certainty regarding the prospects of public investment projects, although their progress must still be monitored going forward. Public expenditure would continue to drive economic growth but there remained risks of delayed budget disbursement. Meanwhile the tourism sector was projected to achieve lower growth than previously assessed due to the recent Phuket tour boat sinking incident. Furthermore Thailand's growth outlook was still subject to risks that continued to warrant close monitoring, especially US foreign trade policies and retaliatory measures from trading partners of the US, risks of lower-than-expected growth in the tourism sector, and geopolitical risks. 2 The outlook for headline inflation was largely unchanged from the previous assessment with the annual average expected to be within target. However downside risks remained as fresh food prices could fluctuate sharply depending on weather conditions and agricultural output. Core inflation was projected to edge up given the gradual build-up in demand-pull inflationary pressures. The Committee would also continue to monitor, despite full potential economic growth, structural changes that might contribute to more persistent inflation than in the past such as the expansion of e-commerce, rising price competition, and upgrades to production efficiency which reduced costs of production. Meanwhile the public's inflation expectations were largely unchanged. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative and conducive to economic growth with ample liquidity in the financial system. Government bond yields were largely unchanged from the previous meeting, while real interest rates remained low. Such conditions allowed financing by the private sector to continue expanding as reflected in both business and consumer loan growth. The baht against the US dollar exchange rate experienced volatile movements due to the monetary policy outlook of advanced economies, as well as increased concerns about trade protectionism measures and risks related to emerging market economies. Such exchange rate movements were in line with those of most regional currencies. Looking ahead, the baht would likely remain volatile and thus the Committee would continue to closely monitor exchange rate developments as well as impacts on the economy. Financial stability remained sound but there was still a need to monitor risks that might pose vulnerabilities to financial stability in the future, especially the search-for-yield behavior in the prolonged low interest rate environment that might lead to underpricing of risks. In addition, the Committee would also closely monitor competition in the housing loan market, the oversupply of condominiums in certain areas, further accumulation of household debt given that deleveraging had yet to improve, and debt serviceability of SMEs especially those affected by changes in structural factors and business models. Looking ahead, the Thai economy as a whole was projected to continue to gain further traction driven by both external and domestic factors. However there remained the need to monitor the strength of the domestic demand, inflation developments, financial stability risks in the period ahead, as well as impacts of trade protectionism measures and risks of lower-than- expected growth in the tourism sector. Hence the Committee viewed that monetary policy should remain accommodative."
Armenia,2018-08-14,"PRESS RELEASE 14.08.2018 At the August 14th of 2018 meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia (the CBA) decided to leave the refinancing rate unchanged, at the level of 6.0%. There was 1.2% deflation in July of 2018 against that of 2.6% reported in the same month of the previous year, and the 12-month inflation rate somewhat increased, amounting to 2.3% at the end of the month. At the same time, core inflation reduced to some extent in July, still persisting at a relatively high level. The Board of the CBA considers that the 12-month inflation rate will approach the target in the upcoming months, fluctuating within the lower part of the confidence band. In the external sector, trends for improving global economic growth continued and inflationary developments in international commodity markets are in line with such developments. As the Board of the CBA estimates, there has been an increase in financial market volatilities in a number of countries of the region amid the imposed US trade restrictions and sanctions, which currently does not contain significant risks for Armenia's financial markets; yet in the emergence of any risk, the CBA will react adequately. The Board notes that economic activity in June of 2018 recovered owing to the accelerating growth in the processing industry and agriculture, following the slowdown at the beginning of the second quarter. The Board estimates that aggregate supply will gradually weaken due to the contractionary pace of fiscal policy, which is reflected in the considerable cost savings in relation to the planned ones. Taking into account the expected developments  a slowdown in domestic demand and weak inflation environment in the outside world  the CBA finds it appropriate to maintain expansionary monetary conditions by leaving the refinancing rate at the current level. At the same time, in view of the anticipated macroeconomic developments and the absence of such risks, keeping the monetary environment expansionary in the forthcoming period too is important in terms of fulfillment of the inflation target, on condition that it gradually eliminates in the medium run. As a result, the expectation is that inflation will remain within the lower part of the confidence band, stabilizing around the 4% target at the end of the forecast horizon. Should there be risks to economic growth outlook and to the inflation deviating from its recovery path, the CBA will adjust the monetary policy directions accordingly, while ensuring the price stability. Detailed information that underlies the decision on setting of the interest rate will be available in Inflation Report (Monetary Policy Program. Q3, 2018), to be published by August 28, 2018. Press Service of the Central Bank of Armenia."
Peru,2018-08-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR AUGUST 2018 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 2.75% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 2.75 percent. This decision takes into account the following factors: In July, the YoY rate of inflation and indicators of trend inflation showed levels within the inflation target range; The expected YoY rate of inflation was 2.33 percent in July; Indicators of economic activity show signs of increased dynamism, although GDP remains below its potential level of growth, and Greater risk and increased financial volatility, both associated with recent trade tensions, could affect global economic activity. The YoY inflation rate is projected to remain within the target range in August and to gradually converge to 2.0 percent by the end of the year. The Board considers that it is appropriate to maintain an expansionary monetary policy stance until it is certain that this convergence will take place when inflation expectations are anchored in a context in which the level of economic activity is close to its potential level of growth. Recent indicators of inflation and activity reflect the following: Inflation in July showed a rate of 0.38 percent, as a result of which the YoY inflation rate rose from 1.43 percent in June to 1.62 percent in July 2018. Inflation without food and energy recorded a rate of 0.27 percent, as a result of which the YoY rate rose from 2.23 percent in June to 2.33 in July, within the target range. Most indicators of business expectations improved in July and continue to be on the optimistic side. Moreover, a recovery is observed in several indicators of economic activity, consumption, and investment. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 1.50 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 3.30 percent for the first 15 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 15 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 3.30 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for September on its Meeting of September 13, 2018."
Egypt,2018-08-16,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release August 16, 2018 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 1675 percent, 1775 percent, and 1725 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 1725 percen. The anticipated adjustment of regulated prices in the context of the fiscal reform program pushed headline inflation up to 135 percent in July 2018 from 114 percent in May 201. On the other hand, core inflation continued to decline for the twelfth consecutive month to record 85 percent in July 2018, the lowest rate since more than two year. Annual real GDP growth stabilized in 2018 Q2 at the 54 percent rate registered in the previous quarter, which was mainly driven by net foreign demand as well as by domestic investmen. Job creation supported the decline of the unemployment rate to 99 percent in 2018 Q2, the lowest rate since 2010 Q. Global financial conditions continued to tighten, and trade tensions rose, pressuring among other factors currencies of select emerging economie. Furthermore international oil prices continued to be subject to geopolitical risk. The Ministry of Finance is targeting to achieve a primary surplus of 20 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2018/19, up from a preliminary 02 percent in the previous yea. The headline inflation outlook continued to be in line with the target path announced in May 2017, namely 13 percent (Â±3 percent) in 2018 Q4 and single digits after the temporary effect of fiscal supply shocks dissipate. The MPC decided that keeping key policy rates unchanged remains consistent with achieving this inflation outlook and target pat. The MPC closely monitors all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust its stance to achieve its mandate of price stability over the medium ter.

Hungary,2018-08-21,"At its meeting on 21 August 2018, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 22 August 2018:. In the Council's assessment, in parallel with the pick-up in domestic demand Hungarian economic output is close to its potential level. Growth of the Hungarian economy will pick up further in 2018, then, if the assumptions of the current projection hold, it will slow down gradually from 2019. The inflation target is still expected to be achieved in a sustainable manner from mid-2019, as the temporary, inflation-boosting effects of oil price changes fade. The Magyar Nemzeti Bank's single anchor is inflation. Under the flexible inflation targeting regime, the Monetary Council takes account of all factors influencing inflation developments on the five to eight-quarter horizon of monetary policy. These may include developments in commodity prices, changes in the external inflation environment, labour market conditions, the position of the real economy, developments in the exchange rate and credit market conditions. By taking into account all these factors, the Bank is able to assess the likely magnitude and persistence of future price changes, which in turn determines the monetary policy response. In July 2018, inflation stood at 3.4 percent and core inflation at 2.5 percent. Rising fuel prices were the main factor contributing to the increase in inflation. Inflation developments were in line with the Bank's expectations. The general, dynamic rise in whole economy wages has continued in recent months; however, inflationary pressures from wages continue to be moderate, consistent with the Bank's expectations. According to the ECB's projections, underlying inflation will continue to be moderate in the euro area in the coming years as well. If the assumptions in the June projection hold, the consumer price index will remain temporarily slightly above 3 percent in the coming months, reflecting the increase in oil prices. With inflation expectations anchored at low levels, higher oil prices are unlikely to generate second-round effects. Over the medium term, rising consumption leads to a gradual increase in underlying inflation. However, moderate external underlying inflation and inflation expectations stabilising at historically low levels, as well as multistage reductions in employers' social contributions and the VAT rate cuts this year, are slowing the rise in prices. The inflation rate is expected to ease back again as the direct effects of oil price increases fade, and the rise in underlying inflation will ensure that inflation meets the 3 percent target in a sustainable structure from the middle of 2019. The Hungarian economy grew strongly, by 4.6 percent in the second quarter of 2018 relative to a year earlier. Data on economic activity released since the previous interest rate decision suggest that robust economic growth is likely to continue. The unemployment rate fell to a historically low level. Lending to the corporate and household sectors continued to expand in June. Economic growth continues in a balanced structure. Looking ahead, the general strengthening of domestic demand will continue to play a central role in economic output developments. The country's current account balance relative to GDP is expected to remain in positive territory over the longer term as well. In the Council's assessment. GDP growth will be 4.4 percent in 2018, higher than last year, then, if the assumptions of the current projection hold, it will slow down gradually from 2019. Sentiment in international financial markets has been volatile in the period since the Council's previous interest rate decision. Expectations related to the policy stance of the world's leading central banks, developments related to global trade policy and the supply of oil as well as the events in Turkey influenced investors' appetite for risk. The Fed left its policy rate unchanged in August. The ECB expects to end its asset purchase programme at the end of December; therefore, the exerted direct effects on the long end of the yield curve will be smaller. However, policy interest rates will remain unchanged at least through the summer of 2019, and therefore the monetary policy environment in the euro area may remain loose. The ECB's monetary policy decisions may have a significant influence on the Magyar Nemzeti Bank's monetary policy. Asset price volatility increased in domestic financial markets in the second half of the period as a consequence of the volatile international financial market sentiment. The Bank assesses these developments in light of their relevance to its primary objective, i.e. the sustainable achievement of the inflation target, focusing on their persistence. Due to the different inflation paths expected in the countries of the region and the different characteristics of inflation targeting regimes, market prices suggest that monetary policy stances by regional central banks will continue to differ. In the Council's assessment, maintaining the loose monetary conditions is necessary to achieve the inflation target in a sustainable manner. To this end, the Monetary Council maintained the base rate, the overnight collateralised lending rate and the one-week collateralised lending rate at 0.9 percent and the overnight deposit rate at -0.15 percent. The Council will maintain the HUF 75 billion upper limit on the stock of three-month deposits. In addition, the Council set the average amount of liquidity to be crowded-out for the third quarter of 2018 at least at HUF 400-600 billion. Furthermore, the Council stated that the actual amount of liquidity to be crowded out must reach a level sufficient to ensure the maintenance of the loose monetary conditions. On the next occasion, in September 2018, the Council will decide on the amount of liquidity to be crowded out and will take this into account in setting the stock of central bank swap instruments. In June, the Monetary Council set the maximum stock of monetary policy interest rate swaps in the first three quarters of 2018 at HUF 900 billion. The Bank will continue mortgage bond purchases and the monetary policy interest rate swap facility as programmes, and therefore they constitute an integral part of the set of monetary policy instruments. Financing costs fell as a result of the mortgage bond purchases, which encouraged issuance in the primary market, thereby facilitating the increase in fixed-rate lending. The fundamentals of the Hungarian economy continue to be stable. Accompanied by dynamic growth, the country's external debt has declined significantly, and its net lending continues to be persistently strong. Its fiscal position is sustainable, the budget deficit is low and the public debt-to-GDP ratio has been contracting. The foreign currency debt ratio has fallen sharply. The debt cap rules, to be introduced in the autumn, will facilitate healthy, sustainable growth of housing loans. The Magyar Nemzeti Bank's single anchor is inflation. The inflation target is still expected to be achieved in a sustainable manner from mid-2019, as the temporary, inflation boosting effects of oil price changes fade. In the Council's assessment, maintaining the base rate and the loose monetary conditions is still necessary to achieve the inflation target in a sustainable manner. The current volatile international environment continues to suggest a more cautious approach. The Council will ensure the maintenance of loose monetary conditions, necessary to achieve the inflation target in a sustainable manner, by using the current set of monetary policy instruments."
Israel,2018-08-29,"The rise in the inflation environment continues, supported by the accommodative monetary policy, and it appears that the inflation environment is moving toward entrenchment within the price stability target range. Inflation over the past 12 months is in the lower part of the target range, and 1-year inflation expectations are around its lower bound. The main risk to the entrenchment of inflation within the target is the possibility of a sharp appreciation in the shekel. Although second quarter growth was relatively low, it apparently does not indicate a change in trend, with most of the decline in growth deriving from fluctuations in vehicle imports. Current indicators of activity support the assumption that the economy has returned to a faster pace of growth in the third quarter. The labor market remains tight, and wages continue to rise at a solid pace, particularly in the business sector. The growth rate ofthe global economy increased in the second quarter, but weakness in momentum is apparent, and the growth rate of world trade continues to slow. US inflation is ranging around the two percent target, and the Federal Reserve is expected to raise its interest rate twice more in 2018. In Europe and Japan, core inflation remains low and the accommodative monetary policy continues. The shekel remainsstable against major currencies. Since the previous interest rate decision, there has been an appreciation of about 2.3 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, mainly as a result of the weakening of emerging market currencies. The downward trendin home prices, which began approximately a year ago, has halted. The increase in new mortgage volume continues, and mortgage interest rates remain stable. TheMonetary Committee intends to maintain the accommodative policy as long as necessary in order to entrench the inflation environment within the target range. The Bank of Israel continues to monitor developments in inflation, the real economy, the financial markets, and the global economy,and will act to attain the monetary policy targets in accordance with such developments. For the file of data accompanying this notice, click here. In the 12 months ending in July, the inflation rate was 1.4 percent, and for the pasttwo months annual inflation has been in the bottom part of the target range. Part of the increase in inflation derives from volatile components of the CPI, such as energy prices and the fruit and vegetables component (Figure 1 in the attached data file), but the upward trend in inflation extends to adjusted indices as well (Figure 2). The rate of inflation in the prices of tradable goods turned positive for the first time since 2013, impacted by the rise in energy prices and the cumulative depreciation of the shekel against the dollar (Figure 3). One-year inflation expectations from the various sources are aroundthe lower bound of the target range (Figure 4). Forward expectations for medium terms are entrenched within the target, while longer term expectations are anchored near the midpoint of the target range (Figure 5). The shekel remains stable against major currencies. However, since the last interest rate decision there has been an appreciation of approximately 2.3 percent in terms of the effective exchange rate, mostly due to the sharp weakening of the Turkish lira (Figure 6). The increase in wages, the strong private consumption, and the expansionary fiscal policy will supporta continued increase in inflation. The main risk to the entrenchment of inflation within the target range is the possibility of a sharp appreciation in the shekel. After the previous interest rate decision, government bond yields declined slightly, and they remain lower than yields in the US and higher than yields in Europe (Figure 7). The yield spreads between corporate bonds and parallel government bonds remain low (Figure 8). According to the first estimate of second quarter National Accounts data, the growth rate slowed, though apparently it is not a change in trend, and in general the economy continues to grow at around its potential pace <b> (Figure 11). The decline in growth derives mainly from fluctuations in vehicle imports, while the contraction in services exports data follows an extended period of solid growth (Figure 13). Current private consumption is growing at a solid and stable pace. In contrast, investment in residential construction continues to contract (Figure 12). Current indicators of activity support the assumption that in the third quarter the economy will return to a faster pace of growth, as can be seen in the Business Tendency Survey and the Composite State of the Economy Index (Figure 14). The labor market remains tight: the unemployment rate is very low, and the participation and employment rates are at high levels (Figure 15). Wages continue to increase at a solid pace (Figure 16), especially in the business sector. The downward trend in home prices that began approximately a year ago has halted (Figure 9). The number of transactions by first home buyers and by buyers upgrading their homes increased slightly, after a prolonged decline. The increase in new mortgage volume continued, and mortgage interest rates remained stable (Figure 10). The rate of global growth picked up in the second quarter, but weakness in momentum is apparent. In particular, the growth rate of world trade continues to slow (Figure 18), against the background of concerns ofan increase in the severity of the trade war and the volatility in emerging economies' financial markets. In contrast, the positive trend in the US equity market continues (Figure 22). The IMF kept its global growth forecast unchanged, even though growth projections for the eurozone and Japan declined slightly (Figure 17). US inflation is ranging around the target of 2 percent. Inflation rose in Europe and Japan as well, but core inflation remains low (Figure 19). Activity data for the US indicate continued positive momentum, supported by the fiscal expansion. The labor market, private consumption, and industrial production continue to display resilience. The monetary contraction is expected to continue, with the Federal Reserve expected to raise its interest rate twice more in 2018. In Europe, growth is stabilizing at a rate slightly lower than that of 2017, and the accommodative monetary policy continues. Even though the ECB is due to stop the quantitative easing at the end of the year, it is not expected to raise the interest rate before the fall of 2019. In Japan, growth recovered in the second quarter. Capital outflows and concern of a trade war continue to weigh on emerging economies. The slowdown in growth in China led the government there to announce steps supporting growth. Turkey's economy is in a severe crisis, but its effect on the global economy is relatively small. Oil prices declined slightly after prolonged increases over the past year. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on September 12, 2018. The next decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Monday. October 8, 2018, followed by a press briefing by the Governor."
South Korea,2018-08-31,"Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period. This press release is the English version of the Bank of Korea's policy statement. In the case of any inconsistency, the original version in Korean will prevail. The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Board considers that the global economy has continued its robust growth. In the global financial markets, some emerging market economies with weak external soundness have seen unease again, including capital outflows and sharp depreciations of their currencies. Looking ahead the Board sees global economic growth as likely to be affected by factors such as the movements toward spreading trade protectionism, the paces of monetary policy normalization in major countries, and the directions of the US government's economic policies. The Board judges that the solid trend of domestic economic growth has continued, as consumption and exports have shown favorable movements although the adjustments in facilities and construction investment have persisted. Employment conditions have become more sluggish, with the extent of increase in the number of persons employed having lessened significantly. Going forward the Board expects domestic economic growth to be generally consistent with the path projected in July and sustain a rate at its potential level. It anticipates that investment will slow but that the trend of steady increase in consumption will continue, and that exports will also sustain their favorable movements thanks to the buoyancy of the global economy. Consumer price inflation has remained at the mid-1% level as the increases in service fees and agricultural product prices have slowed, despite the accelerating pace of increase in the prices of petroleum products. Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has fallen to the 1% level, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has been in the mid- to upper-2% range. Looking ahead it is forecast that consumer price inflation, after remaining in the mid- 1% range for some time, will pick up and gradually approach the target level. Core inflation will also gradually rise. The domestic financial markets have been generally stable. Long-term market interest rates have fallen, affected by the financial unease in some emerging market economies and the sluggishness of employment. Stock prices had declined, due mainly to concerns about the US-China trade dispute, but have since rebounded as these concerns have eased somewhat. The Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has fluctuated in line with changes in the value of the dollar globally. Household lending has sustained its higher rate of expansion than in past years, although the amount of its expansion has lessened somewhat. Housing sales prices have remained steady overall, but have risen rapidly in some parts of Seoul and its surrounding areas. Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As it is forecast that inflationary pressures on the demand side will not be high for the time being, while the domestic economy is expected to continue its solid growth, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance. In this process it will judge carefully whether it is necessary to adjust its accommodative monetary policy stance further, while closely checking future economic growth and inflation trends. It will also carefully monitor conditions related to trade with major countries, any changes in the monetary policies of major countries, financial and economic conditions in emerging market economies, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks."
Kazakhstan,2018-09-03,"PRESS - RELEASE – 27 The base rate unchanged at 9% September 3, 2018 Almaty The National Bank of Kazakhstan has decided to keep the base rate unchanged at 9% with a corridor of +/-1%. Current and expected by the end of 2018 annual inflation rate remains within the target range (5-7%). However, the increased impact of the inflation factors, both from the recovering domestic demand and the world economy, reduces the potential for inflation slowdown in the medium- term. Respectively, the risks of inflation staying near the upper range of the target corridor in 2019 (4- 6%) are rising, exceeding the target for 2020 (below 4%). The National Bank closely monitors the dynamics of indicators that may affect inflation in the next 1-2 years, but currently does not consider it necessary to take corrective actions. In the case of strengthening of the actual and projected inflationary pressures, the National Bank does not exclude the possibility of monetary policy tightening. In August the annual inflation increased to 6.0% midpoint of the target range of 5-7% by the end of 2018. Despite a slowdown in annual growth of prices for food products (5.1%) and paid services (4.9%), the dynamics of the non-food component (8.2%) prevents further reduction of the overall inflation rate. The nature of the inflationary background is largely determined by supply-side factors that formally are not dependent on the National Bank's monetary policy. Consumer Price Index is mostly influenced by rising producer prices, especially in the manufacturing, unexpected supply shocks, and increase in the aggregate (consumer and investment) demand. Consumer demand is stimulated by the renewed since the beginning of this year growth of real income of the population against the background of increased social expenditures from the state budget and wages in the economy, as well as consumer lending to households by banks. In the medium term, the effect of this factor on inflation will be gradually diminished due to expectations of a reduction in the fiscal stimulus of the economy. In the first 7 months of 2018 investment in fixed assets increased by 23.7%, and was backed by the implementation of projects in the oil and gas industry, manufacturing and construction. The economic activity continues to demonstrate the positive dynamics. In January-July of 2018 the short-term economic indicator amounted to 104.9%. A positive contribution to growth was made by all major industries  mining (5.4%) and manufacturing (4.9%), transportation (4.9%), communications (5.2%) and trade (6.1%). Expectations for further economic growth have remained at a high level, with a possible slowdown in 2019 due to the high base of the current and past years. The balance of risks in the external sector continues to shift to a negative direction. Crude oil prices remain at a relatively higher level, close to 70 US dollars per barrel, but are not able to compensate the negative consequences from the arisen uncertainty in the relationship between the world's largest economies. In July FAO index fell by 3.7% in the annual terms. Nevertheless, growth in food consumption in the world will remain stable in the long-term, and amid falling global food reserves will further increase the index in the medium - long run. Inflation rate of the main trading partners is below the target. However, on the horizon of up to one year, the expected acceleration of external inflationary processes is the main risk that contributes to the move of inflation in Kazakhstan beyond the upper limit of the target corridor. The US policy to promote economic growth, as well as the policy of the Federal Reserve to raise key interest rates, led to capital outflow and weakening of emerging market currencies, including Kazakhstan's main trading partners. Further tightening of external monetary conditions will continue to have an inflationary pressure on emerging markets. Inflationary expectations in Kazakhstan demonstrate a long-term trend towards a decline. According to the recent results (July), the quantitative assessment of the inflationary expectations was formed at the level of 5.6%. The perceivable inflation continues to improve. The share of the responders, who believes that in the past 12 months the price of goods and services has increased with the faster rate than beforeâ€, has decreased from 52.1% at the beginning of the year to 43.5% in July. Despite the positive trend, unforeseen shocks can have a significant impact on the dynamics of inflationary expectations, which make them unstable in the short term. Monetary conditions in Kazakhstan are close to neutral levels. The current nature of monetary policy contributes to the preservation of macroeconomic stability in the country and the growth of the economy at the level of potential values. However, on the background of tenge weakening, which was observed in recent months, as well as in the case of confirmation of estimates of slower deceleration of the actual inflation compared to the previously forecasted level, it is possible that the monetary conditions might get tightened before the end of this year in order to minimize the risks associated with growing negative expectations. The next decision on the base rate will be announced on October 15, 2018 at 17:00 Astana time. For more detailed information please contact: +7 (727) 2704 585 e-mail: press@nationalbank.kz."
Chile,2018-09-04,"Tuesday, 4 September 2018 Monetary Policy Meeting  September 2018 At its monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 2.5%. The decision was adopted by the unanimous vote of the Board members. The external scenario continues to be characterized by an increase in perceived risk in the emerging world, particularly for those economies seen as the most vulnerable. In recent weeks there has been a significant depreciation of emerging currencies, mixed movements in commodity prices, still negative capital flows and higher risk premiums. All this in a context where the divergence between monetary policies in the developed world persists and trade tensions between the United States and China have increased. Nonetheless, the outlook for global growth has limited corrections. In China, conjunctural economic activity figures have shown a sharper slowdown than predicted by the market, so the authority has activated several measures to boost demand. In the local financial system, it is worth noting the further depreciation of the Chilean peso, which has been lower in multilateral terms. This has been in line with external developments, including the stronger US dollar at the global level, the fall in the copper price and intensified problems in some emerging economies. In this context, the almost null variation of long-term interest rates and local market risk indicators compared with the previous meeting stands out, opposing the movements seen in several economies. The domestic stock market coupled with slumps that have been observed in other emerging-countries' stock markets. Domestic credit continues to be characterized by low interest rates and moderate growth in loan amounts, where the ongoing rise in the commercial portfolio deserves mention. Second-quarter activity and demand data showed a better than expected performance of the economy that has spread to more sectors. Faster growth in trade, manufacturing and some services stands out. On the expenditure side, strong dynamism of investment in machinery and equipment was observed again, plus higher private consumption and significant inventory build-up. Although the unemployment rate has increased, the labor market has begun to show some signs of recovery. In particular, private salaried employment grew at rates above 1% annually for the second consecutive moving quarter. Business (IMCE) and household (IPEC) expectations, despite a marginal drop, remain in positive territory, and financial conditions are still comfortable. The private expectations for economic growth (EES) continue to point to growth of the order of 4% for this year and the following two. Annual CPI inflation rose to 2.7% in July, in line with expectations. As in June, its increase was mainly driven by greater annual variation of the more volatile components of the basket. Meanwhile, the annual increase of the CPIEFE remained at 1.9%, with goods inflation again in marginally negative figures and services just above 3%. Market expectations for inflation increased slightly at shorter terms. At one and two years they have stayed near 3%. In its decision the Board considered that the analysis contained in the September Monetary Policy Report and data collected after its statistical cutoff, point to the evolution of macroeconomic conditions that make less necessary to maintain the current monetary stimulus. Economic growth has exceeded forecasts, thus reducing the activity gap faster and consolidating the prospects of an earlier convergence of inflation to the target. Given the medium-term implications of this scenario, the Board believes that the monetary stimulus should start being gradually withdrawn in the coming months. Likewise, it reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% in the two-year horizon. The minutes of this Monetary Policy Meeting will be published at 8:30 hours of Monday 24 September 2018. The next Monetary Policy Meeting is scheduled to take place on Wednesday 17-Thursday 18 of October 2018 and the statement thereof will be released 18:00 hours of Thursday 18. _The Spanish original prevails."
Georgia,2018-09-05,"05.09.2018 NBG Keeps Its Policy Rate unchanged at 7.0% The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on September 5, 2018 to and decided to keep the refinancing rate unchanged at 7.0 percent. The annual inflation has decreased in the beginning of 2018 and, in line with forecasts, moved around the target rate of 3% throughout the year. In August annual inflation reached 3.1%. According to current forecast, other things equal, the inflation both this year and in the medium term will fluctuate around the target rate. The macroeconomic risks have risen given the regional developments, causing increased volatility on financial markets. However, even in case these risks are realized, the significant deviation of inflation from its target is not expected. According to the NBG estimates, there still is the necessity of gradual exit from tight monetary policy, although how this process will be carried out depends on the magnitude of external risks. Economic activity in the first half of 2018 was quite high, with the preliminary estimates of economic growth in the first seven months reaching 5.5%. Such dynamics is conducive to narrowing the output gap at a fast rate. The positive trends in the external sector have been maintained. Goods export is growing at a high rate (with the y-o-y growth of 29% in the first seven months). In the same period the tourist revenues have grown by 22%. The remittances from abroad have continued growing at a high rate as well  18% annually. However, given the strengthening of domestic demand, the goods import growth rate has also increased significantly (23%). The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all means and instruments at its disposal in order to ensure the price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on October 24, 2018."
Malaysia,2018-09-05,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.25 percent. The global economic expansion is continuing, albeit with increasing divergence across economies and signs of a slower momentum. In the advanced economies, growth will remain underpinned by strong labour market conditions and policy support. In Asia, growth will be supported by sustained domestic activity and external demand. Although global growth is currently sustained, risks to growth have increased. Trade tensions continue to be a key source of downside risk. Greater volatility in the international financial markets and monetary policy normalisation in the advanced economies could lead to further capital outflows and financial market adjustments in emerging economies. For Malaysia, supply disruptions in the mining and agriculture sectors led to more moderate growth in the second quarter of 2018. On the demand side, growth remained supported by private sector activity with further impetus from net exports. Looking ahead, private consumption, which was boosted by the tax holiday, will continue to be driven by steady wage and employment growth. Investment activity is projected to be underpinned by continued capacity expansion in key sectors, particularly in the export-oriented industries, driven by favourable demand and efforts to enhance automation. Public sector spending however is expected to weigh on growth as the Government embarks on reprioritisation of expenditure. The external sector will continue to benefit from the sustained global growth momentum. In the immediate term, the economy faces downside risks stemming from heightened trade tensions, prolonged weakness in the mining and agriculture sectors and some domestic policy uncertainty. On balance, the Malaysian economy is expected to remain on a steady growth path. Headline inflation was at 0.9% in July 2018. Going forward and continuing into 2019, headline inflation is expected to edge upwards taking into consideration the impact of policy measures on domestic cost factors. The impact of the changes in the consumption tax policy on headline inflation will be transitory and lapse towards the end of 2019. Underlying inflation is nevertheless expected to remain relatively stable. In line with regional economies, the domestic financial markets continue to experience non-resident portfolio outflows due to ongoing global developments. Despite these adjustments, domestic financial markets remain resilient with domestic monetary and financial conditions supportive of economic growth. The financial sector remains sound, with financial institutions continuing to operate with strong capital and liquidity buffers. In addition, the domestic economy maintains its underlying fundamental strength, with steady economic growth, low unemployment and current account surplus of the balance of payments. Bank Negara Malaysia's monetary operations will continue to ensure sufficient liquidity to support the orderly functioning of money and foreign exchange markets and intermediation activity. At the current level of the OPR, the degree of monetary accommodativeness is consistent with the intended policy stance. The MPC will continue to monitor and assess the balance of risks surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation. Bank Negara Malaysia 05 September 2018."
Poland,2018-09-05,"Warsaw, 5 September 2018 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 4-5 September 2018 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: â–ª reference rate at 1.50%; â–ª lombard rate at 2.50%; â–ª deposit rate at 0.50%; â–ª rediscount rate at 1.75%. Global economic conditions remain favourable. In the euro area, economic situation continues to be favourable, despite slightly slower GDP growth than in 2017. In the United States, economic growth is higher than in the previous year, which confirms that economic conditions in this country are strong. In China, economic activity growth has continued at a stable pace for the past few quarters. Despite favourable global economic conditions, inflation abroad remains moderate. At the same time, an increase in oil prices in the recent months has driven up inflation indices in many countries. The European Central Bank keeps interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero. At the same time, the ECB continues to purchase financial assets, although it has announced a reduction in the scale of purchases from October 2018 and the termination of the programme by the end of the year. The Federal Reserve continues to gradually tighten monetary policy. In Poland, the 2018 Q2 GDP data point to high economic growth. It is driven by rising consumption, fuelled by increasing employment and wages, disbursement of benefits and very strong consumer sentiment. This is accompanied by a rise in investment, both in the public sector and among big enterprises. In 2018 Q2, exports picked up markedly, leading to a positive contribution of net exports to GDP growth. Notwithstanding high economic growth and wages rising faster than in the previous year, consumer price growth remains moderate. The slightly higher annual CPI rate than in 2018 Q1 reflects mainly the growth in fuel prices. At the same time, inflation net of food and energy prices continues to be low. In the Council's assessment, current information point to a favourable outlook for economic growth in Poland, despite the expected slowdown in GDP growth in the coming years. In line with the available forecasts, inflation will remain close to the target in the monetary policy transmission horizon. As a result, the Council judges that the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability."
Ukraine,2018-09-06,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to hike its key policy rate to 18% per annum, effective from 7 September 2018. Despite a decline in inflation since the start of the year, this trend may be hampered if certain risks materialize. The tighter monetary policy will help neutralize these risks and bring inflation to its target range in late 2019 and to achieve the medium-term target of 5% in 2020. In July 2018, consumer price inflation continued to decelerate, reaching 8.9% yoy and closely approaching the target range set in the Monetary Policy Guidelines for 2018 and the Medium Term (6.5% Â± 2 pp as of the end of Q3 2018). According to the NBU's preliminary estimations, in August, inflation was also close to this level. The decline in inflation in July was generally in line with the most recent macroeconomic forecast of the NBU. A sizable increase in domestic and imported supply of food products, which dampened price growth, contributed to lower inflation. In addition, hryvnia appreciation in the first half-year influenced prices of non-food products. Core inflation decelerated in July, to 8.8% yoy, which was also expected by the NBU. However, core inflation remaining high indicates that the underlying inflationary pressure is persistently strong. This is mainly the result of the rapid growth in real wages, which leads to higher production costs and sustained consumer demand. The NBU maintains its forecast made in July that inflation will retreat to 8.9% in 2018, return to the target range in late 2019, and meet the medium-term target of 5% in 2020. Further slowdown in inflation will be constrained by the expected increase in administered prices in Q4 2018, which is aimed at bringing domestic gas prices closer to the import parity price. Same as in its July forecast, the NBU projects that sustained domestic consumer demand and high inflation expectations will continue to bolster price growth. At the same time, inflation will be curbed by the tight monetary policy conditions determined by the series of key policy rate hikes, including the today's decision. The NBU expects that the depreciation pressure on the hryvnia seen since July 2018 will not have much influence on the inflation trend. This is due to the fact that currencies of the majority of Ukraine's main trading partners have depreciated more than the hryvnia over this time. These foreign market trends neutralize the impact the change in the hryvnia exchange rate against USD could have had on imported inflation. Moreover, the NBU continues to be active on the interbank foreign exchange market: since the start of Q3 2018, the NBU sold foreign currency to the amount of more than USD 700 million on net in order to smooth out excessive fluctuations in the exchange rate. Foreign exchange interventions mitigate the effect on foreign exchange fluctuations on inflation. Success in continuing cooperation with the International Monetary Fund remains the major precondition for bringing inflation down to the target. New loans from the IMF, and related financing from other Ukrainian partners, are expected to boost the country's macrofinancial stability and signal to other market players that Ukraine is making progress with reforms. However, since July's Board monetary policy decision, there has been a significant increase in external risks, which could prevent inflation from returning to its target. The most significant risk here is higher pressure on the currencies of developing economies due to further capital outflow. This could make it more difficult for Ukrainian borrowers to secure financing on the international financial markets, and affect the competitiveness of Ukrainian exports. The risks of less benign global commodity market conditions are also rising, driven by an escalation of large-scale trade conflicts. The first signs that this risk has started to materialize are already evident on the global steel and oil markets. In addition, internal risks also remain important. Inflation expectations could worsen, as the volatility of the hryvnia exchange rate increases, and next year's presidential and parliamentary elections draw near. Domestic demand rising at a faster pace than projected, due to high wage growth, could also prevent inflation from decreasing. At the previous monetary policy meeting that took place in July 2018, the NBU Board said it could raise the key policy rate further if it saw an increase in the probability that risks of inflation would materialize. In view of a higher probability that these risks could materialize the NBU Board deems it necessary to tighten monetary policy by raising the key policy rate. The NBU Board believes that raising the key policy rate by 0.5 pp is sufficient to bring inflation back to its target within the timeframe set by the forecast. If risks of inflation materialize, the NBU could raise the key policy rate again to a level required to bring inflation back to its target within a reasonable timeframe. The decision to raise the key policy rate to 18% has been approved by NBU Board Key Policy Rate Decision No.593-D, dated 6 September 2018. A summary of the discussion by Monetary Policy Committee members that preceded this decision will be published on 17 September 2018. The next meeting of the NBU Board on monetary policy issues will be held on 25 October 2018 as scheduled."
Euroarea,2018-09-13,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Vice-President. Mr Dombrovskis. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We continue to expect them to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, we will continue to make net purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) at the current monthly pace of â‚¬30 billion until the end of this month. After September 2018, we will reduce the monthly pace of the net asset purchases to â‚¬15 billion until the end of December 2018 and we anticipate that, subject to incoming data confirming our medium-term inflation outlook, we will then end net purchases. We intend to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time after the end of our net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. The incoming information, including our new September 2018 staff projections, broadly confirms our previous assessment of an ongoing broad-based expansion of the euro area economy and gradually rising inflation. The underlying strength of the economy continues to support our confidence that the sustained convergence of inflation to our aim will proceed and will be maintained even after a gradual winding-down of our net asset purchases. At the same time, uncertainties relating to rising protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility have gained more prominence recently. Significant monetary policy stimulus is still needed to support the further build-up of domestic price pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term. This support will continue to be provided by the net asset purchases until the end of the year, by the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the associated reinvestments, and by our enhanced forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates. In any event, the Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation continues to move towards the Governing Council's inflation aim in a sustained manner. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro area real GDP increased by 0.4%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2018, following growth at the same rate in the previous quarter. Despite some moderation following the strong growth performance in 2017, the latest economic indicators and survey results overall confirm ongoing broad-based growth of the euro area economy. Our monetary policy measures continue to underpin domestic demand. Private consumption is supported by ongoing employment gains, which, in turn, partly reflect past labour market reforms, and by rising wages. Business investment is fostered by the favourable financing conditions, rising corporate profitability and solid demand. In addition, the expansion in global activity is expected to continue, supporting euro area exports. This assessment is broadly reflected in the September 2018 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. These projections foresee annual real GDP increasing by 2.0% in 2018, 1.8% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020. Compared with the June 2018 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real GDP growth has been revised down slightly for 2018 and 2019, mainly due to a somewhat weaker contribution from foreign demand. The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook can still be assessed as broadly balanced. At the same time, risks relating to rising protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility have gained more prominence recently. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 2.0% in August 2018, down from 2.1% in July. On the basis of current futures prices for oil, annual rates of headline inflation are likely to hover around the current level for the remainder of the year. While measures of underlying inflation remain generally muted, they have been increasing from earlier lows. Domestic cost pressures are strengthening and broadening amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets, which is pushing up wage growth. Looking ahead, underlying inflation is expected to pick up towards the end of the year and thereafter to increase gradually over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the continuing economic expansion and rising wage growth. This assessment is also broadly reflected in the September 2018 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation at 1.7% in 2018, 2019 and 2020, which is unchanged from the June 2018 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections. Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth declined to 4.0% in July 2018, from 4.5% in June. Apart from some volatility in monthly flows. M3 growth is increasingly supported by bank credit creation. The narrow monetary aggregate M1 remained the main contributor to broad money growth. The recovery in the growth of loans to the private sector observed since the beginning of 2014 is proceeding. The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations stood at 4.1% in July 2018, while the annual growth rate of loans to households stood at 3.0%, both unchanged from June. The pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014 continues to significantly support borrowing conditions for firms and households, access to financing  in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises  and credit flows across the euro area. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is still necessary for the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute more decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential and reducing vulnerabilities. The implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up to increase resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost euro area productivity and growth potential. Regarding fiscal policies, the broad-based expansion calls for rebuilding fiscal buffers. This is particularly important in countries where government debt is high and for which full adherence to the Stability and Growth Pact is critical for safeguarding sound fiscal positions. Likewise, the transparent and consistent implementation of the EU's fiscal and economic governance framework over time and across countries remains essential to bolster the resilience of the euro area economy. Improving the functioning of Economic and Monetary Union remains a priority. The Governing Council urges specific and decisive steps to complete the banking union and the capital markets union."
Peru,2018-09-13,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR SEPTEMBER 2018 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 2.75% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 2.75 percent. This decision takes into account the following factors: In August, the YoY rate of inflation and the indicators of trend inflation showed levels within the inflation target range; The expected YoY rate of inflation was 2.39 percent in August; Some indicators of economic activity show temporary signs of lower dynamism and economic activity remains below its potential level of growth, and Greater risk and increased financial volatility, both associated with recent commercial tensions, could affect global economic activity. The YoY inflation rate is projected to remain within the target range in September and to gradually converge to 2.0 percent by the end of the year. The Board considers that it is appropriate to maintain an expansionary policy stance until it is certain that this convergence will take place when inflation expectations are anchored in a context in which the level of economic activity is close to its potential level of growth. Recent indicators of inflation and activity reflect the following: Inflation in August showed a rate of 0.13 percent, as a result of which the YoY inflation rate fell from 1.62 percent in July to 1.07 percent in August 2018. Inflation without food and energy recorded a rate of 0.09 percent, as a result of which the YoY rate fell from 2.33 percent in July to 2.04 percent in August, within the target range. Most indicators of business expectations continue to be on the optimistic side in August. Moreover, a more gradual recovery is observed in indicators of economic activity. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 1.50 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 3.30 percent for the first 15 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 15 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 3.30 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for October on its Meeting of October 11, 2018."
Turkiye,2018-09-13,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to increase the policy rate (one week repo auction rate) from 17.75 percent to 24 percent. Recently released data indicate a more significant rebalancing trend in the economic activity. External demand maintains its strength, while slowdown in domestic demand accelerates. Recent developments regarding the inflation outlook point to significant risks to price stability. Price increases have shown a generalized pattern across subsectors, reflecting the movements in exchange rates. Deterioration in the pricing behavior continues to pose upside risks on the inflation outlook, despite weaker domestic demand conditions. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to implement a strong monetary tightening to support price stability. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. Tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained decisively until inflation outlook displays a significant improvement. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior, lagged impact of recent monetary policy decisions, contribution of fiscal policy to rebalancing process, and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Russia,2018-09-14,"On 14 September 2018, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to raise the key rate by 0.25 pp to 7.50% per annum. Changes in external conditions observed since the previous meeting of the Board of Directors have significantly increased proinflationary risks. The Bank of Russia forecasts annual inflation to be 5-5.5% in 2019 and return to 4% in 2020. This forecast takes into account the decisions taken with regard to the key rate and to the suspension of foreign currency purchases in the domestic market under the fiscal rule. The Bank of Russia will consider the necessity of further increases in the key rate, taking into account inflation and economic dynamics against the forecast, as well as risks posed by external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. Inflation dynamics. Annual inflation is returning to 4% faster than expected. Annual consumer price growth increased to 3.1% in August, which is slightly higher than the upper bound of the Bank of Russia forecast. The upward movement of inflation in August is related to the increase in annual food price growth to 1.9%. This was supported by changes in the balance of supply and demand in certain food markets and the past year's low base effect. Also, prices are adjusting to the ruble exchange rate that has weakened since the beginning of the year. According to Bank of Russia estimates, most annual inflation indicators reflecting the most sustainable price movements are growing. Inflation expectations of both households and businesses have slightly increased on the back of the foreign exchange rate volatility. According to the monitoring data of the Bank of Russia, some businesses may adjust their prices in line with the scheduled VAT increase already in late 2018. The ruble's depreciation is related to capital outflow due to changes in external conditions. At the same time, the current account balance remains high thanks to stable prices of Russian export goods and significantly exceeds the amount of external debt repayments scheduled for the coming months. In this context, the Bank of Russia's decision to suspend foreign currency purchases in the domestic market under the fiscal rule will serve to curtail exchange rate volatility and its influence on inflation over the next few quarters. According to the Bank of Russia forecast that takes into account the decisions taken with regard to the key rate and to the suspension of foreign currency purchases in the domestic market under the fiscal rule, by the end of 2018 the consumer price growth rate will be 3.8-4.2%. Annual inflation will peak in the first six months of 2019 reaching 5.0-5.5% by the end of 2019. Quarterly year-on-year consumer price growth rate will draw close to 4% as early as in the second half of 2019. Annual inflation will slow down to 4% in the first half of 2020 when the effects of ruble's weakening and the VAT rise peter out. Monetary conditions. Monetary conditions have slightly tightened under the influence of external factors. OFZ yields have seen a significant increase. Interest rates in the deposit and credit market are gaining momentum. The increase of the key rate will help maintain real interest rates on deposits in the positive territory, which will support the attractiveness of savings and the balanced growth in consumption. Economic activity. Updated estimates for 2018 Q2 show that annual GDP growth stood at 1.9%, in line with Bank of Russia expectations. The Bank of Russia keeps unchanged its 2018 annual GDP growth forecast of 1.5-2%, which corresponds to the potential economic growth rate. The economic growth forecast for 2019-2021, included in the baseline scenario, was updated to take into account changes in external conditions and the estimated influence of the set of fiscal and structural measures to be taken by 2024 on economic performance. In 2019, the forthcoming VAT increase might have a slight constraining effect on business activity, mostly in the beginning of the year. Newly attracted budgetary funds will be used to boost government spending, including spending on investments, as early as 2019. As a result, according to the Bank of Russia forecast. GDP growth in 2019 will range between 1.2% and 1.7%. The following years might see higher growth rates as planned structural measures are implemented. Inflation risks. The balance of risks has further shifted towards proinflationary risks. Main risks stem from highly uncertain external conditions and their impact on financial markets. Further yield growth in advanced economies, capital outflow from emerging markets together with geopolitical factors might cause volatility in financial markets to persist, and affect exchange rate and inflation expectations. The Bank of Russia leaves mostly unchanged its estimates of risks associated with oil price volatility, wage movements and possible changes in consumer behaviour. These risks remain moderate. The Bank of Russia will consider the necessity of further increases in the key rate, taking into account inflation and economic dynamics against the forecast, as well as risks posed by external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next rate review meeting on 26 October 2018. The press release on the Bank of Russia Board decision is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time. The reference to the Press Service is mandatory if you intend to use this material."
Hungary,2018-09-18,"At its meeting on 18 September 2018, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 19 September 2018:. In the Council's assessment, in parallel with the pick-up in domestic demand Hungarian economic output is close to its potential level. Growth of the Hungarian economy will pick up further in 2018, then, if the assumptions of the current projection hold, it will slow down gradually from 2019. The inflation target is still expected to be achieved in a sustainable manner from mid-2019. The Magyar Nemzeti Bank's (MNB) single anchor is inflation. Under the flexible inflation targeting regime, the Monetary Council takes account of all factors influencing inflation developments on the five to eight-quarter horizon of monetary policy. These may include developments in commodity prices, changes in the external inflation environment, labour market conditions, the position of the real economy, developments in the exchange rate and credit market conditions. By taking into account all these factors, the Bank is able to assess the likely magnitude and persistence of future price changes, which in turn determines the monetary policy response. Incoming macroeconomic data for the past quarter were in line with the Bank's expectations. In August 2018, inflation stood at 3.4 percent, while core inflation decreased to 2.3 percent. Volatile fuel and unprocessed food prices were the main factors contributing to the increase in inflation in the summer months. Inflationary pressures from wages continue to be moderate. According to the European Central Bank's (ECB) projections, underlying inflation will continue to be moderate in the euro area in the coming years as well. If the assumptions in the September projection hold, the consumer price index will remain above 3 percent in the short term. From September, the increase in excise taxes will also contribute to upward pressure on inflation, in addition to fuel and unprocessed food prices, while core inflation excluding indirect tax effects will remain stable around 2.5 percent. With inflation expectations anchored at low levels, second-round effects are not expected to arise. According to our projection, rising consumption will lead to a gradual increase in underlying inflation. As temporary effects fade, the inflation rate is expected to ease back again, and the rise in underlying inflation will ensure that inflation meets the 3 percent target in a sustainable structure from mid-2019. The Hungarian economy grew strongly, by 4.8 percent in the second quarter of 2018 relative to a year earlier. Data on economic activity suggest that robust economic growth is likely to continue. The unemployment rate has fallen to a historically low level. Lending to the corporate and household sectors continued to expand in July; however, proportion of long-term, fixed-rate lending to corporates continues to be low. Looking ahead, economic growth is expected to continue across a broad range of sectors. The general strengthening of domestic demand will continue to play a central role in economic output developments. In the Council's assessment. GDP growth will be 4.4 percent in 2018, higher than last year, then, if the assumptions of the current projection hold, it will slow down gradually from 2019. Meanwhile, the country's current account balance is expected to remain in positive territory over the longer term as well. Sentiment in international financial markets has been volatile in the period since the Council's previous interest rate decision. Developments in international trade policies and events related to vulnerable emerging countries influenced investors' appetite for risk. Asset price volatility increased in domestic financial markets as a consequence of the volatile international financial market sentiment. The Bank assesses these developments in light of their relevance to its primary objective, i.e. the sustainable achievement of the inflation target, focusing on their persistence. The current volatile international environment continues to suggest a more cautious approach. The monetary conditions in the euro area may remain loose. The ECB's decisions may have a significant influence on the Magyar Nemzeti Bank's monetary policy. The Bank's primary objective is to achieve the inflation target in a sustainable manner. For this reason, in the Council's assessment, maintaining the loose monetary conditions is necessary. The Council, however, reviewed its monetary policy instruments and is prepared for the gradual and cautious normalisation of monetary policy. In order to maintain the loose monetary conditions, the Monetary Council held the base rate, the overnight collateralised lending rate and the one-week collateralised lending rate at 0.9 percent and the overnight deposit rate at -0.15 percent. The Council left the average amount of liquidity to be crowded-out for the fourth quarter of 2018 unchanged, at least at HUF 400-600 billion. On the next occasion, in December 2018, the Council will decide on the amount of liquidity to be crowded out and will take this into account in setting the stock of central bank swap instruments. Consistent with the practice of leading central banks, the MNB is also prepared for the gradual and cautious normalisation of monetary policy. The set of unconventional instruments affecting short-term yields will be simplified, and the Monetary Council will publish the background material to the Bank's instrument strategy. In addition, the set of unconventional instruments affecting long-term yields will be fine-tuned. The set of central bank instruments affecting short-term yields will become more simple and transparent after the Council's decision to phase out the three-month deposit facility by the end of 2018. The current HUF 75 billion stock of three-month central bank deposits will decline to zero by the end of December 2018. The interest rate remunerated on required reserves and preferential deposits will remain equal to the central bank base rate. In the future, required reserves will be the main policy instrument. Furthermore, in its background material to the Bank's instrument strategy, the Monetary Council will communicate about the future role of the individual unconventional monetary policy instruments. Looking forward, the Bank will adjust the monetary conditions necessary to achieve the inflation target in a sustainable manner by creating an optimal combination of two of its instruments: swaps providing forint liquidity and the interest rate corridor. As part of the fine-tuning of the unconventional policy instruments affecting long-term yields, the Council made a decision to phase out the monetary policy IRS tenders and the mortgage bond purchase programme by the end of 2018. The Council set the annual maximum stock of monetary policy IRS for 2018 at HUF 1,100 billion. The mortgage bond programme will be ended in two stages: purchases in the primary market will continue until 31 December 2018 and purchases in the secondary market until 30 September 2018. In the meantime, the Funding for Growth Scheme Fix (FGS fix) will be introduced. The MNB will sterilise the liquidity provided under this programme by a preferential deposit facility bearing interest at the central bank base rate. This will contribute to developing a healthy structure for SME lending, while having a neutral impact on liquidity developments. The Monetary Council will launch the FGS fix with a total amount of HUF 1,000 billion in early 2019. With the new programme, the Council's specific objective is to raise the proportion of long-term, fixed-rate lending to SMEs to an adequate level. In contrast with previous phases, the Bank will sterilise excess liquidity supply arising from lending under the FGS fix by using the preferential deposit facility. The Bank will publish the most important features and introduction aspects of the programme in the form of a background material. The Council is prepared for the gradual and cautious normalisation of monetary policy, which will start depending on the outlook for inflation. The inflation target is still expected to be achieved in a sustainable manner from mid-2019. To ensure this, in the Council's assessment, maintaining the base rate and the loose monetary conditions is necessary."
Brazil,2018-09-19,"The Copom unanimously decided to maintain the Selic rate at 6.50% p.a. The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario:. Recent indicators of economic activity point to recovery of the Brazilian economy, at a more gradual pace than envisaged early this year. The global outlook remains challenging, with reduction of risk appetite towards emerging economies. The main risks continue to be associated with normalization of interest rates in some advanced economies and with uncertainty regarding global trade. The Committee judges that various measures of underlying inflation are running at appropriate levels. This includes the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy. Inflation expectations for 2018 and 2019 collected by the Focus survey are around 4.1%. Expectations for 2020 remain around 4.0%, and those regarding 2021 retreated to around 3.9%; and. The Copom's inflation projections in the scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the Focus survey stand around 4.1% for 2018, and 4.0% for 2019. This scenario assumes a path for the policy interest rate that ends 2018 at 6.5% p.a., and 2019 at 8.0% p.a., and a path for the exchange rate that ends 2018 at R$/US$ 3.83, and 2019 at R$/US$ 3.75. In the scenario with a constant interest rate, at 6.50% p.a., and a constant exchange rate, at R$/US$ 4.15*, the projections for 2018 and 2019 stand around 4.4% and 4.5%, respectively. The Committee emphasizes that risks around its baseline scenario remain in both directions. On the one hand, the high level of economic slack may lead to a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory. On the other hand, frustration of expectations regarding the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy may affect risk premia and increase the path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy. This risk intensifies in case the global outlook for emerging economies deteriorates. The Committee judges that the latter risks have increased. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the wide array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to maintain the Selic rate at 6.50% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation and the associated balance of risks and is consistent with convergence of inflation to target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, which includes 2019. The Copom emphasizes that the evolution of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy is essential to maintain low inflation in the medium and long run, for the reduction of its structural interest rate, and for sustainable economic recovery. The Committee stresses that the perception of continuation of the reform agenda affects current expectations and macroeconomic projections. The Copom judges that it should base its decisions on the evolution of inflation projections and expectations, of the balance of risks, and of economic activity. Shocks that produce relative price changes should only lead to a monetary policy response to their possible second-round effects (i.e., to the propagation to prices in the economy that are not directly affected by the shock). It is through such second-round effects that these shocks may affect inflation projections and expectations, and change the balance of risks. These effects may be mitigated by the level of economic slack and by inflation expectations anchored around the targets. Therefore, there is no mechanical relationship between recent shocks and the conduct of monetary policy. The Copom reiterates that economic conditions still prescribe stimulative monetary policy, i.e., interest rates below the structural level. This stimulus will begin to be removed gradually if the outlook for inflation at the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy and/or its balance of risks worsen. In the Copom's assessment, the evolution of the baseline scenario and of the balance of risks prescribes keeping the Selic rate at its current level. The Copom emphasizes that the next steps in the conduct of monetary policy will continue to depend on the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, and on inflation projections and expectations. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Ilan Goldfajn (Governor). Carlos Viana de Carvalho. Carolina de Assis Barros. Mauricio Costa de Moura. Otavio Ribeiro Damaso. Paulo Srgio Neves de Souza. Reinaldo Le Grazie. Sidnei Corr=AAa Marques, and Tiago Couto Berriel. *Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average R$/US$ exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the Friday prior to the Copom meeting."
Thailand,2018-09-19,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 6/2018 Mr. Jaturong Jantarangs. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 19 September 2018 as follows. The Committee voted 5 to 2 to maintain the policy rate at 150 percent. Two members voted to raise the policy rate by 025 percentage point from 150 to 175 percent. In deliberating their policy decision, the Committee assessed that the Thai economy continued to gain traction, driven by both domestic and external demand. Headline and core inflation were projected to increase broadly in line with the previous assessment. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative and conducive to economic growth. Financial stability remained sound overall, but it was deemed necessary to monitor risks that might lead to the build- up of vulnerabilities in the financial system in the future, especially those resulting from the prolonged period of monetary accommodation. The Committee viewed that the current accommodative monetary policy stance remained conducive to the continuation of economic growth and was appropriate given the inflation target. Thus most members decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at this meeting. Nevertheless two members viewed that the continued economic expansion was sufficiently robust and that prolonged monetary accommodation induced households and businesses to underestimate potential changes in financial conditions, and thus voted to raise the policy rate at this meeting in order to curb financial stability risks that could affect the sustainability of economic growth over the longer term and to start building policy space. The Thai economy as a whole continued to gain traction, driven by merchandise exports and tourism which continued to improve in tandem with global economic growth, and by continued momentum from domestic demand. Growth in merchandise exports was expected to slow down somewhat due to trade protectionism measures between the US and China but would be partially offset by benefits from the relocation of production base to Thailand for some industries. Private consumption was expected to continue to achieve higher growth supported by improvements in income and employment, but overall purchasing power was recovering gradually due to elevated household debt. Meanwhile public expenditure would grow at a lower rate than previously assessed due to constrained budget disbursement. Private investment was projected to continue expanding with additional support from greater certainty regarding the prospects of public investment projects and the relocation of production base to Thailand, although the progress of public investment projects must still be monitored going forward. Furthermore the Thai economy would be subject to downside risks and uncertainties regarding US foreign trade policies that could be additionally announced, retaliatory measures from trading partners of the US, as well as geopolitical risks. The annual average of headline inflation was expected to rise slowly in line with the previous assessment. However downside risks remained as fresh food prices could fluctuate 2 sharply depending on weather conditions and agricultural output. Core inflation was projected to edge up at a somewhat lower rate than previously assessed given the gradual build-up of demand- pull inflationary pressures. The Committee viewed that, despite full potential economic growth, structural changes might contribute to more persistent inflation than in the past. Such changes included the expansion of e-commerce, rising price competition, and upgrades to production efficiency which reduced costs of production. Meanwhile the public's inflation expectations were largely unchanged. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative and conducive to economic growth with ample liquidity in the financial system. Overall government bond yields increased slightly, while real interest rates remained low. Such conditions allowed financing by the private sector to continue expanding as reflected in higher growth in both business and consumer loans. With regard to exchange rates, the baht appreciated against regional currencies since the last meeting due to concerns over external stability in emerging market economies. Looking ahead, the baht would likely remain volatile and thus the Committee would continue to closely monitor exchange rate developments as well as impacts on the economy. Financial stability remained sound but there was still a need to monitor risks that might pose vulnerabilities to financial stability in the future, especially the search-for-yield behavior in the prolonged low interest rate environment that might lead to underpricing of risks. The Committee was concerned about competition in the housing loan market which led to looser credit standards. In addition, the Committee deemed it necessary to monitor the oversupply of condominiums in certain areas, further accumulation of household debt given that deleveraging had yet to improve, and debt serviceability of SMEs especially those affected by changes in structural factors and business models. Looking ahead, the Thai economy as a whole was projected to continue to gain traction driven by both external and domestic factors. However there remained the need to monitor inflation developments and financial stability risks in the period ahead, as well as risks arising from impacts of trade protectionism measures of the US and retaliatory measures by major advanced economies. Hence the Committee viewed that monetary policy should remain accommodative, although the need for currently accommodative monetary policy would be gradually reduced."
Mongolia,2018-09-20,"MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Keeping the policy rate unchanged Number: 2018.03 Effective date: 20 September 2018 The Monetary Policy Committee meeting was held on 20 September 2018, and it was decided to keep the Policy rate unchanged at 10 percent. As of August 2018, annual inflation measured by the consumer price index has reached 6.0 percent nationwide and 6.4 percent in Ulaanbaatar city. In the medium term inflation is expected to stabilize around the central bank's target rate of 8 percent. Although supply related inflationary pressures are forecasted to decline, demand-pull pressure supported by economic recovery is rising at a nonaccelerating pace. Economic growth continued to gain momentum as mineral exports increased owing to relatively high prices of commodities and investments expanded following economic recovery. Considering the momentum, the Bank of Mongolia revised its 2018 growth projections up, yet the economy remains highly susceptible to circumstances in external conditions. For instance, exchange rate volatility of togrog in the last quarter reflects direct and indirect effects from rising imports, capital outflows from emerging and developing markets, appreciation of USD against other currencies and changes in commodity prices driven by economic sanctions, set on certain countries, and trade war related factors. In an external environment of rising uncertainties, building resilience of the financial market agents and maintaining internal and external balance of the economy are crucial for the economic stability in the medium to long term. The Bank's decision to maintain the policy rate unchanged is consistent with its aim to stabilize inflation around the target rate and would support business and economic activities. The Monetary Policy Committee acknowledges the risks associated with external conditions and considering further developments in the external environment and its impact on domestic financial market, will discuss increasing the policy rate and sanctions for any identified violations of the policy on consumer credit during the following meeting. In order to address the pressure of credit growth on household debt, balance of payments and overall financial stability, under the framework of macroprudential policy it is decided to set a maturity limit of 30 months on non-mortgage consumer credits, effective from January 1, 2019. Finally, a risk weight on unhedged foreign exchange loans is raised to 150%, effective from January 1, 2019. Extending foreign currency credit to unhedged borrowers or households and corporations with limited income in foreign currency, would create pressure on borrower's debt and augment the vulnerabilities in the economy and financial sector. The action to raise the risk weight is intended to shield the financial system stability. Extracts of the meeting minutes will be released in two weeks on the Bank of Mongolia's website.

South Africa,2018-09-20,"South African Reserve Bank PRESS STATEMENT EMBARGO DELIVERY 20 September 2018 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), risks to the inflation outlook have continued to materialise and the inflation outlook has deteriorated in response to both domestic and external developments. The impact of elevated oil prices and a weaker exchange rate on domestic fuel costs is increasingly evident. At the same time, domestic growth has weakened further. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas was 5.1% in July and declined to 4.9% in August. Goods price inflation was 5.0% (down from 5.3% in July), while services price inflation was unchanged at 5.0%. The Bank's measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity, declined to 4.2% in August (down from 4.3%). Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods increased to 6.1% in July (up from 5.9% in June). Despite remaining within the inflation target range throughout the forecast period, the SARB's model projects an increase in headline inflation, peaking at levels closer to MPC Statement September 20th, 2018 Page 1. Despite remaining within the inflation target range throughout the forecast period, the SARB's model projects an increase in headline inflation, peaking at levels closer to MPC Statement September 20th, 2018 Page 1 the upper end of the target range. Headline inflation is now expected to remain at an average of 4.8% in 2018, before increasing to 5.7% in 2019 (up from 5.6%) and moderating to 5.4% in 2020. Headline CPI inflation is expected to peak at around 5.9% in the second quarter of 2019. The impact of the VAT increase continues to be muted. The more elevated headline inflation trajectory is explained by the weaker rand exchange rate and higher oil prices. Average wage growth is expected to remain elevated at around 7% over the forecast period. Much of the upward pressure on wage inflation arises from the public sector wage settlements, which are at levels above headline inflation. Wage growth is an important driver of services price inflation. Elevated international oil prices will contribute to fuel price inflation. Other administered prices are expected to increase at rates above the upper end of the inflation target range, as water and electricity tariffs rise, alongside rates and taxes in major metros. The impact on headline inflation continues to be moderated by lower food price inflation. Inflation expectations, as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research during the third quarter of 2018 are marginally higher, averaging 5.3% in 2018 and 5.6% in 2019 and in 2020. Five-year inflation expectations have increased marginally to 5.5% (up from 5.4%). Expectations implicit in the break-even inflation rates (i.e. the yield differential between conventional and inflation-linked government bonds) have continued to edge upwards across all maturities. While the global economic outlook is expected to remain broadly favourable over the short term, medium term risks are tilted to the downside due to elevated policy MPC Statement September 20th, 2018 Page 2. While the global economic outlook is expected to remain broadly favourable over the short term, medium term risks are tilted to the downside due to elevated policy MPC Statement September 20th, 2018 Page 2 uncertainty. This uncertainty arises from escalating trade tensions and tightening global financial conditions. The global inflation outlook is on a moderate upward path, largely due to rising oil prices and higher GDP growth rates in some advanced economies. Since the July MPC, the rand has depreciated by 7.3% against the US dollar, by 8.1% against the euro, and by 7.1% on a trade-weighted basis. At current levels, the SARB's model assesses the rand to be undervalued. The implied starting point for the rand is R14.20 against the US dollar, compared with R13.40 at the time of the previous meeting. Tighter global financial conditions and the change in investor sentiment towards emerging markets remain key external risks to the rand, and it is likely that the rand, along with other emerging market currencies, will remain volatile. However, the pace of monetary policy normalisation in the advanced economies continues to be gradual and further policy tightening by the US Fed is expected to follow a measured path in the absence of significant inflation or growth surprises. The domestic economy has entered a technical recession, following two consecutive quarters of contracting economic activity. Quarter-on-quarter GDP contracted by 0.7% in the second quarter and GDP data for the first quarter was revised down from -2.2% to -2.6%. However, on a year-on-year basis. GDP growth in the first quarter was 0.8% and 0.4% in the second quarter. The SARB now forecasts growth in 2018 to average 0.7% (down from 1.2% in July). The forecast for 2019 and 2020 is unchanged at 1.9% and 2.0% respectively. At these growth rates, the negative output gap is wider in the near term, but is still expected to close by the end of 2020 as GDP growth rates exceed potential growth. MPC Statement September 20th, 2018 Page 3. MPC Statement September 20th, 2018 Page 3 The SARB composite leading business cycle indicator increased in June, largely reflecting an improvement in the measures of external sector activity. However, business confidence, as reflected in the RMB/BER business confidence index, decreased to 38 index points in the third quarter. Growth in gross fixed capital formation is expected to remain weak. Household consumption expenditure contracted by 1.3% in the second quarter, declining for the first time in two years. In the medium term, the increase in disposable income is expected to be supportive of consumption expenditure. However, household consumption expenditure is likely to be constrained by recent tax changes, weak employment growth as well as subdued growth in credit extension to households. Although credit extension to households has been increasing during 2018, year-on-year growth remains low. The MPC noted the rising inflation trajectory which, while remaining within the target range, is moving further away from the mid-point of the target range. The MPC assesses the risks to the inflation outlook to be on the upside. The Committee remains concerned about growing risks to the inflation outlook, mainly due to exchange rate risks related to both domestic and external factors, elevated international oil prices and the possibility of higher electricity tariffs. However, demand pressures in the economy are not assessed to pose a significant risk to the inflation outlook. The MPC assesses the risks to the growth forecast to be moderately on the downside. The Committee continues to be of the view that current challenges facing the economy are primarily structural in nature and cannot be solved by monetary policy alone. Commitment to credible structural policy initiatives and implementation thereof is MPC Statement September 20th, 2018 Page 4. Commitment to credible structural policy initiatives and implementation thereof is MPC Statement September 20th, 2018 Page 4 required to make a marked impact on the cost structure of the economy, potential output and employment. Monetary policy is most effective in addressing cyclical growth. The MPC has decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 6.5% per annum. Four members preferred an unchanged stance and three members preferred a 25 basis points increase. The Committee continues to assess the stance of monetary policy to be accommodative. However, the MPC remains concerned about the deteriorating inflation outlook, driven mainly by multiple supply-side factors. The approach of the Committee continues to be to look through the first-round effects and focus on the possible second-round effects. With risks and uncertainties at higher levels, the MPC will continue to be vigilant and will not hesitate to act should it become necessary. The implied path of policy rates generated by the Quarterly Projection Model is for five rate hikes of 25 basis points by the end of 2020. As emphasised previously, the implied path remains a broad policy guide which can and does change in either direction between meetings in response to new developments and changing risks.

Armenia,2018-09-25,"PRESS RELEASE 25.09.2018 At the September 25, 2018 meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) decided to leave the refinancing rate unchanged, at the level of 6.0%. There was 0.6% inflation in August of 2018 compared to 0.4% deflation registered in the same month of the previous year, and the 12-month inflation rate increased, amounting to 3.3% at the end of the month. The Board of the CBA states that both the headline and core inflations were within the CBA's predictions and estimates that in the upcoming months the 12-month inflation will still be running at a slightly lower level from the target. In the external sector, global economic growth trends continued in line with expectations, with weaker inflationary patterns observable in international markets of basic commodities. At the same time, the Board of the CBA considers that despite a gradual tightening of financing conditions in global capital markets, its impact on the volatility of financial markets in the developing countries has somewhat weakened. The Board notes that higher-than-expected economic growth (8.3%) has been reported according to the first half 2018 results, and in January-August, compared to the same period of the previous year, the economic activity indicator has reached 7.7%, largely owing to high growth in services. At the same time, the estimation is that the impact of the fiscal policy implementation (which remained contractionary over the third quarter) on aggregate demand is being partially offset by persisting investment activity in the private sector. Taking into account the aforementioned developments, the Board of the CBA finds it appropriate to maintain expansionary monetary conditions and leave the refinancing rate unchanged. At the same time, in view of the anticipated macroeconomic developments, keeping the monetary environment expansionary is important for fulfillment of the inflation target, on condition that it gradually eliminates in the future. As a result, the expectation is that inflation will run somehow lower from the target, stabilizing around the 4% value in the forecast horizon. Should there be risks to economic growth outlook and to the inflation deviating from its forecasted path, the CBA will adjust the monetary policy directions accordingly, while ensuring the price stability. Detailed information that underlies the decision on setting of the interest rate will be available in Press Release (Minutes on Interest Rate) to be published by October 9, 2018.

Nigeria,2018-09-25,"CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO 120 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING OF MONDAY 24th AND TUESDAY 25th SEPTEMBER, 2018 Background The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on the 24th and 25th of September, 2018 and evaluated developments in the global and domestic economic and financial environments in the first eight months of 2018, as well as the outlook for the rest of the year. Ten members of the Committee were in attendance. Global Economic Developments The Committee noted the uneven expansion in global output amidst growing trade tension, rising oil prices and debt levels as well as currency depreciation in most of the notable emerging markets and developing economies. These developments notwithstanding, there was evidence of resilient financial markets and output growth in the advanced economies led by the United States, which experienced sharp improvements in output growth. In the Euro area. United Kingdom and Japan, the pace of growth was moderate but steady, while in the Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs), growth was sluggish and relatively uneven. Growth in the advanced economies was projected to remain at 24 per cent in 2018, same as in 2017, led by the US which grew by 41 per cent in Q2 2018 and is projected to grow by 29 per cent in 2018. The Euro area and Japan, grew by 04 and 07 per cent, respectively, in Q2 and are projected to grow by 22 and 10 per cent, respectively, in 2018. In the EMDEs and Developing Economies, growth is expected to remain strong at 49 per cent in 2018 compared with 47 per cent in 2017. Growth in the EMDEs is expected to be led by India and China, which are projected to grow by 73 and 66 per cent, respectively, in 2018. On average, the momentum of the global economy remained on track towards achieving the 2018 growth projections of 39 per cent as financial conditions remain broadly favourable with limited spill over of trade tensions amongst the general political sentiments. However the recent episodes of large-scale flooding in major areas across the globe could pose some threat to growth. Accordingly the MPC believes that rising oil prices, tighter financial conditions, higher yields in the advanced economies and capital flow reversal from the EMDEs, resulting in pressure on currencies of some countries with fragile conditions, as well as growing trade tensions between the US and China, would continue to shape developments in the EMDEs in the medium term. Domestic Output Developments Available data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that real GDP growth declined by 45 basis points as the economy grew by 150 per cent in the second quarter of 2018, down from 195 per cent in the preceding quarter, but 2 higher than 072 per cent in the corresponding quarter of 2017. The growth slowdown was traceable to contraction in the oil sector in the second quarter of 2018, compared with the previous quarter. The Committee noted that non-oil real GDP grew by 205 per cent, reflecting the strong performance of construction, services and agriculture, which grew, by 766, 419 and 119 per cent, respectively. Furthermore the non-oil sector was similarly supported by the stability in the foreign exchange market, continued implementation of the 2017 capital budget and the on-going interventions of the Bank in the real sector of the economy. The MPC was of the view that even though growth remained weak, the effective implementation of the 2018 FGN capital budget and policies that would encourage credit delivery to the real sector of the economy would boost aggregate demand, stimulate economic activity and reduce unemployment in the country. Developments in Money and Prices The Committee noted that relative to the level at end-December 2017. Broad Money (M2) grew by 298 per cent in August 2018, annualised to 447 per cent, but below the provisional benchmark of 1048 per cent for 2018. The growth in M2 was largely driven by growth in Net Foreign Assets (NFA) of 1863 per cent in August 2018, annualised to 2794 per cent and above the provisional growth benchmark of 1815 per cent for the year. Net Domestic Credit (NDC), however, contracted by 418 per cent, annualized to 627 per cent, in contrast to the growth benchmark of 1245 per cent for 2018. The contraction in NDC was attributed to the 3468 per cent contraction in net credit to the Government in August 2018. Conversely, credit to the private sector grew marginally by 081 per cent in August 2018 from a contraction of 013 per cent in July 2018, annualized to 121 per cent, against the annual benchmark of 564 per cent. The MPC observed that despite the under-performance of key monetary aggregates, headline inflation (year-on-year) inched up to 1123 per cent in August 2018, from 1114 per cent in July 2018. The rise in headline inflation was from food, while core inflation declined, indicating that supply side factors were driving the price increase. The near-term upside risks to inflation remained the dissipation of the base effect, expected 2019 election-related spending, continued herdsmen attack on farmers and the current episodes of flooding which has destroyed crops and would affect food supply and prices. In this regard, the Committee urged the fiscal authorities to ensure sustained implementation of the 2018 budget to relieve the supply side growth constraints, as well as address the flooding incidence which has become perennial, on a permanent basis. The average inter-bank call rate declined from 90 per cent in July 2018, to 40 per cent on September 20, 2018. Similarly the average Open Buy Back (OBB) rate declined from 1144 to 472 per cent over the same period. The relative decline in market rates reflected the increased statutory allocations to states and local governments and maturing securities. The development did not significantly transmit to retail interest rates as average maximum lending rates marginally declined to 3093 per cent in August from 3109 per in July 2018. Similarly average prime lending rate decreased to 1665 per cent in August from 1683 per cent in 4 July 2018. The weighted average deposit rate also declined to 457 per cent in August from 479 per cent in July 2018, widening the spread between the average lending rate and weighted average deposit rate to 2636 per cent in August 2018 from 2630 per cent in July 2018. The Committee noted the decrease in external reserves to US$44 billion on September 20, 2018 from US$45 billion at the end-July 2018. Total foreign exchange inflow through the economy fell by 3834 per cent to US$600 billion in July from US$973 billion in June 2018. The Committee believes that accretion to external reserves should strengthen in the last quarter of 2018, with crude oil price remaining above the budget benchmark price of US$5100 per barrel and oil production increasing to 23 million barrels per day. The Committee, noted the relative stability in both the Investors' and Exporters' (I&E) window of the foreign exchange market, which was sustained by autonomous inflows and measures taken by the Bank to deepen the foreign exchange market and curb speculative practices. The MPC expressed concern at the decline in major capital market indices. Similarly Market Capitalization (MC) decreased by 1433 per cent to N1138 trillion on September 21, 2018 from N1387 trillion at end-June 2018. The development was due largely to sustained profit- taking by portfolio investors and capital reversals as foreign yields become increasingly more attractive. The Overall Outlook and Risks Available data and forecast of key macroeconomic indicators show a positive outlook for the economy in the third quarter of 2018. The Committee expects that sustained implementation of the 2018 budget, improvements in the security situation and sustained stability in the foreign exchange market will stabilize prices and strengthen economic growth. Growth in the non-oil sector, especially agriculture, manufacturing, services and light industries are expected to drive output growth over the medium term. The Committee, however, identified the downside risks to the outlook to include: the impact of increased monetary policy normalization in the advanced economies and the strengthening US dollar. Others are: the late implementation of the 2018 budget, weakening demand and consumer spending, build-up in contractor debt, low minimum wage, impact of flooding on agricultural output and other economic activities, continuing security challenges across the North-East and North-Central zones, and growing level of sovereign debt. The outlook for the year, however, remains positive as the economy is projected to grow by 175 per cent in 2018, anchored on continued stability in the foreign exchange market, sustained high price and production of oil and improved electricity supply. Inflation outlook suggests a mild resurgence of inflationary pressure in the economy, traceable largely to cost-push factors, election related spending, amongst other domestic factors. The moderating factors to the outlook would 6 include; improved power supply, increased expenditure on capital projects and improved security conditions, all of which may exert downward pressure on consumer prices in the near-term. The Considerations of the Committee The Committee appraised the macroeconomic environment and noted that at its July meeting, modest stability had been achieved in key indicators, including inflation, exchange rate and external reserves. In particular, relative stability had returned to the foreign exchange market, buoyed by a robust level of external reserves with inflation trending downwards for the 18th consecutive month. These gains so far achieved appear to be under threat of reversal, following new data which provides evidence of weakening fundamentals. The Committee identified rising inflation and pressure on external reserves created by capital flow reversal as the current challenges to growth. It noted that inflationary pressures have started rebuilding and capital flow reversals have intensified as shown by the bearish trend in the equities market even though the exchange rate remains very stable. The Committee was concerned that the exit from recession may be under threat as the economy slowed to 195 and 150 per cent in Q1 and Q2 2018, respectively. The Committee noted that the slowdown emanated from the oil sector, with strong linkages to employment and growth in other key sectors of the economy. In this regard, the Committee urged government to take advantage of the current rising oil prices to rebuild fiscal buffers, strengthen government finances in 7 the medium term and reverse the current trend of decline in output growth. The MPC also called on the fiscal authorities to intensify the implementation of the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP) to stimulate economic activity, bridge the output gap and create employment. The Committee noted that disruptions to the food supply chain in major food producing states due to the combined effects of poor infrastructure, flooding and the on-going security challenges resulted in a rise in food prices, contributing to the uptick in headline inflation. The Committee was, however, optimistic that as harvests progress in the coming months, pressure on food prices would gradually recede, while growth enhancing measures would over the medium term have some moderating impact on food prices. The MPC expressed concern over the potential impact of liquidity injections from election related spending and increase in FAAC distributions which is rising in tandem with increase in oil receipts. The Committee was concerned with the rising level of non-performing loans in the banking system, traced mainly to the oil sector and urged the Bank to closely monitor and address the situation. It also expressed concern over the weak intermediation by Deposit Money Banks and its adverse impact on credit expansion and investment growth by the private sector. In view of the above developments, the MPC noted that the economy was still confronted with growth headwinds and inflationary pressures. It reiterated the need for synergy between monetary and fiscal policies as a viable option for 8 macroeconomic stability. The Committee, therefore, identified two likely policy options as tightening or maintaining the status quo ante. Tightening would tame inflationary pressures, stem the reversal in portfolio capital, improve the external reserves position and maintain stability in the foreign exchange market. Conversely the MPC felt that raising rates would further weaken growth as credit would become more expensive. NPLs would increase further, leading to a deceleration in output. In the Committee's opinion, the upward adjustment would not only signal the Bank's commitment to price stability but also its desire to maintain positive real interest rates. decision to hold all policy parameters constant would sustain gradual improvements in output growth, maintain the current monetary policy stance and await a clearer understanding of the quantum and timing of liquidity injections into the economy before deciding on possible adjustments. The MPC, however, called on the government to fast track the implementation of the 2018 budget to help jumpstart the process of sustainable economic recovery, and to facilitate passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill in order to increase the contribution of the sector to overall GDP. The Committee's Decision In light of the above, the MPC decided by a vote of seven members to retain the MPR at 14 per cent. However three out of these seven members voted to raise the Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR) by 150 basis points, an indication 9 that left to them, we should have tightened. The other three members voted to tighten by raising the MPR by 25 basis points. In summary, the MPC voted to: I Retain the MPR at 14 per cent; II. Retain the asymmetric corridor of +200/-500 basis points around the MPR; III. Retain the CRR at 225 per cent; and IV. Retain the Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent. Thank you. Godwin I Emefiele Governor. Central Bank of Nigeria 25th September 2018 10."
Czech Republic,2018-09-26,"At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank increased the two-week repo rate (2W repo rate) by 25 basis points to 1.50%. At the same time, it increased the Lombard rate to 2.50% and the discount rate to 0.50%. Six members voted in favour of this decision and one member voted for leaving interest rates unchanged.. This decision is underpinned by the current macroeconomic forecast, presented in August, and by an assessment of information obtained since the current forecast was prepared. According to the current forecast, inflation will be above the Czech National Bank's 2% target for the rest of this year. It will return to the target at the monetary policy horizon and remain close to the target during 2020. Consistent with this outlook is a continued rise in interest rates towards their long-run neutral level. At its meeting today, the Bank Board assessed the risks to the current inflation forecast at the monetary policy horizon as being balanced and insignificant. The changes in the outlook for foreign variables are negligible. The forecast for consumer and producer prices this year is slightly lower, as is the outlook for foreign economic activity. In the longer term, expected foreign developments are virtually unchanged. The market outlook for the Brent crude oil price is almost unchanged as well. The euro-dollar exchange rate is marginally weaker over the entire forecast horizon than expected in the current forecast. Following a temporary decline in July, domestic annual inflation rose again in August. Overall, it was only slightly below the forecast. Food price inflation was substantially lower than forecasted. Core inflation, by contrast, was higher than predicted. Fuel prices maintained their high growth rate and were only slightly below the forecast. In line with the forecast, growth in administered prices gradually accelerated further. The growth of the Czech economy slowed in line with the forecast in Q2 and was only marginally lower than forecasted. As expected, fixed investment and household consumption were still the biggest contributors to GDP growth. The contribution of government consumption was also positive, though rather smaller than expected. Conversely, additions to inventories and net exports dampened GDP growth. Their deviations from the forecast largely offset each other. Monthly indicators suggest continued solid economic growth in Q3. Sustained high consumer confidence and strong growth in household income continue to be reflected in rising retail sales. Industrial production and construction output have also recorded buoyant growth over the last two months. The labour market is still creating strong inflationary pressures in line with the forecast. Employment continued to go up in Q2. As expected, unemployment dropped only slightly. Labour shortages coupled with strong labour demand led to a further increase in job vacancies. Wage growth remained stable in line with the forecast. While wage growth fell slightly short of the prediction in market sectors, it exceeded it in non-market sectors. After the August forecast was drawn up, the koruna initially weakened slightly against the euro but later strengthened again in the course of September. Its average level in Q3 so far is only marginally stronger than forecasted. The previous depreciation of the koruna was due to a decrease in financial investors' confidence in emerging markets and continued growth in US interest rates. By contrast, the increase in domestic interest rates is fostering appreciation of the koruna. To sum up the important facts about recent developments in the Czech economy, the current macroeconomic forecast is materialising."
Philippines,2018-09-26,"At its meeting on monetary policy today, the Monetary Board decided to raise the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) facility by 50 basis points to 4.5 percent, effective Friday, 28 September 2018. The interest rates on the overnight lending and deposit facilities were raised accordingly. The Monetary Board recognized that a further tightening of monetary policy was warranted by persistent signs of sustained and broadening price pressures. Latest baseline forecasts have shifted higher for both 2018 and 2019, with risks to the outlook still leaning toward the upside. With supply-side forces expected to continue to drive inflation in the coming months, inflation expectations have remained elevated amid indications of second-round effects. Meanwhile, domestic demand conditions have generally held firm, even as the previous monetary policy responses continue to work their way through the economy. The Monetary Board, therefore, decided to raise the BSP policy interest rate anew to further anchor inflation expectations and to safeguard the inflation target over the policy horizon. The Monetary Board believed that a tighter monetary policy stance will help steer inflation toward a target-consistent path over the medium term by reducing further risks to the inflation outlook, including those emanating from exchange rate volatility given the continued uncertainty in the external environment amid geopolitical tensions and the normalization of monetary policy in advanced economies. At the same time, the Monetary Board emphasized the need for timely and appropriate non-monetary measures that will further mitigate the impact of supply-side factors on inflation, including rice tariffication. The BSP reassures the public of its strong commitment to take all necessary policy actions to address the threat of high inflation and deliver on its primary mandate of price stability."
United States,2018-09-26,"EDT September 26, 2018 Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in August indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a strong rate. Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low. Household spending and business fixed investment have grown strongly. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remain near 2 percent. Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term. Risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 2 to 2-1/4 percent. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Jerome H Powell. Chairman; John C Williams. Vice Chairman; Thomas I Barkin; Raphael W Bostic; Lael Brainard; Richard H Clarida; Esther L George; Loretta J Mester; and Randal K Quarles."
Egypt,2018-09-27,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release September 27, 2018 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 1675 percent, 1775 percent, and 1725 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 1725 percen. Annual headline inflation rose to 142 percent in August 2018 from 114 percent in May 2018, while annual core inflation continued to decline for the twelfth consecutive month to record 85 percent in July 2018, before increasing slightly to 88 percent in August 201. As anticipated, upward adjustments of regulated prices as well as higher prices of fresh fruits and vegetables contributed to the widening spread between headline and core inflation since June 201. Annual real GDP growth stabilized in 2018 Q2 at the 54 percent rate registered in the previous quarter, which was mainly driven by net foreign demand as well as by domestic investmen. Meanwhile job creation supported the decline of the unemployment rate to 99 percent in 2018 Q2, the lowest rate since 2010 Q. The pass-through to domestic inflation from developments in emerging market economies remained contained due to stabilization and structural policies that support improving macroeconomic fundamental. The MPC decided that keeping key policy rates unchanged remains consistent with achieving the target path for headline inflation that was announced in May 2017, namely 13 percent (Â±3 percent) in 2018 Q4 and single digits after the temporary effect of fiscal supply shocks dissipate. The MPC closely monitors all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust its stance to achieve its mandate of price stability over the medium ter.

Colombia,2018-09-28,"The Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica, in its meeting today, decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 4.25%. For this decision, the Board mainly took into account the following aspects. In August, inflation and the average of core inflation indicators stood at 3.1% and 3.8%, respectively. These figures are similar to those recorded a month ago and below those registered a year ago. The food items and the goods and services most affected by the exchange rate are the CPI groups that contribute to keep inflation close to its 3.0% target. Other large groups, (i.e., non-tradables and regulated items) press inflation upwards.. Inflation expectations recorded slight changes and remain above 3.0%. Analysts' expectations are, on average, 3.2% and 3.3% for December 2018 and 2019, respectively. Those embedded in public debt bonds to 2, 3, and 5 years stand between 3.3% and 3.4%. The average growth of the country's trading partners remains dynamic, driven mainly by the developed economies. The international price of oil and the terms of trade continued to increase and continue driving the national income. The measures of risk premia for Colombia have not recorded significant changes and remain at historically low levels, despite the increase in the risk premia for some emerging countries that exhibit important macroeconomic imbalances. GDP growth in the second quarter of 2018 was close to the estimate. The economic activity indicators available for the third quarter suggest that the economy would have continued growing slowly, albeit somewhat faster than in the first half of the year. With these results, the technical staff of the Central Bank maintained its growth estimate for 2018 at 2.7%. However, the Central Bank's technical staff estimated that the under-utilization of productive capacity persists, and that by the end of 2018 it will be something higher than in 2017. For 2018, a current account deficit (as a share of GDP) similar to the one recorded in 2017 is forecast. Based on this information, the Board considered the following factors for its decision. Weakness of the economic activity and uncertainty over its pace of recovery. The stability of observed and expected inflation at levels close to 3.0%. The effects of changing international financial conditions on the Colombian economy. In this environment, upon assessing the situation of the economy and balance of risks, the Board of Directors deemed appropriate to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 4.25%. The Board will continue to carefully monitor the behavior of inflation and the forecasts for economic activity and inflation in the country, as well as the international context. Finally, the Board reiterates that the monetary policy will depend on the availability of new information. The decision to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 4.25% was approved unanimously."
Pakistan,2018-09-29,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement September 29, 2018 Since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee in July 2018. Pakistan has witnessed notable changes on the political front. This has had positive impact on the business and consumer confidence in the country as reflected in multiple surveys. The smooth transition between governments addresses the political uncertainty observed hitherto, but concerns on the economic front continue to persist on the back of rising inflation and large twin deficits, that are likely to compromise the sustainability of the high real economic growth path. Inflation is inching up, particularly from March 2018 onwards. So far, in the first two months of FY19, headline CPI inflation has averaged. percent as compared to. percent for the corresponding months of FY18, and an average of. for all of FY18. The jump is even more pronounced in core inflation- key measure reflecting the underlying inflationary pressures in the economy. For FY19. SBP's inflation projections show that the average headline inflation is expected to fall in the revised forecast range of.5-7. percent. This assessment takes stock of the following factors: higher than anticipated increase in international oil prices; an upward revision in domestic gas prices; further increase in regulatory duties on imports; and the continuing second round impact of previous exchange rate depreciations. Following healthy growth of. percent in FY18, economic activity is likely to slowdown in FY19 as the general macroeconomic policy mix is focusing towards stabilization. Specifically the transmission of SBP's policy rate hikes by 175 bps since January 2018 is still unfolding. The government is also now pursuing fiscal consolidation program and has further announced regulatory measures to slowdown the growing pressures on the external front. As result, domestic demand is projected to decelerate in the coming months of FY19. The recent monetary and fiscal measures are likely to affect Large Scale Manufacturing. Furthermore the latest information shows that cotton production is expected to miss its FY19 target of 14. million bales with downside implications for agriculture sector growth. The ancillary services sector is expected to miss its FY19 target as well. Some positive impact is expected from the contribution of exports led production and higher fertilizer production amidst depleting stocks and better availability of energy. After incorporating the latest information on both demand and supply. SBP projects the real GDP growth for FY19 at around. percent. The current account deficit continues to pose challenge. Despite some growth in workers' remittances and exports in the first two months of FY19, notable increase in the value of oil imports has kept the current account deficit at US$2. billion, as compared to US$2. billion, in the corresponding period last year despite non-oil imports declining during the period. Owing to these developments SBP's net liquid FX reserves have declined to US$. billion as of 19th September, 2018 compared to US$. billion at the end of FY18. Broad money supply saw seasonal contraction of. percent during 1st July to 14th September FY19 as compared to the contraction of. percent during the same period last year. During this period, however. Private Sector Credit (PSC) performed relatively better. The main reasons for the continuing growth of PSC involve: the improved availability of energy; relatively conducive exports demand amid GSP plus status; and the higher working capital needs due to capacity additions in the last three years. Accordingly PSC growth is expected to continue, but at slower pace than in FY18. Similarly monetary growth is expected to remain between 10. to 1. percent in FY19. Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN In this backdrop, the Monetary Policy Committee noted that: while non-oil imports are responding to the contractionary measures surge in oil prices is masking this improvement, and as result the current account deficit remains high; rising trends in inflation mean that real interest rates have fallen and further; the unfolding global developments, whether in terms of oil-price shocks, protectionist trade policies and/or falling flows to the emerging markets, all pose challenges to macroeconomic management in Pakistan. In light of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation discussed above, the MPC is of the view that further consolidation efforts are required to ensure macroeconomic stability and therefore has decided to raise the SBP target policy rate by 100 bps to. percent effective from 1st October 2018.

Poland,2018-10-03,"Warsaw, 3 October 2018 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 2-3 October 2018 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: reference rate at 1.50%; lombard rate at 2.50%; rediscount rate at 0.50%; rediscount rate at 1.75%. Global economic conditions remain favourable. In the euro area, the economic situation continues to be favourable, despite slightly slower GDP growth than in 2017. In the United States, economic growth is higher than in the previous year, which confirms that economic conditions in this country are strong. In China, activity growth has continued at a stable pace for the past few quarters. Since the beginning of the year, global energy commodity prices, including those of oil, have risen substantially. This has contributed to higher inflation in many countries. At the same time, core inflation in the external environment of the Polish economy, including the euro area, remains moderate, despite continued strong economic conditions. The European Central Bank keeps interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero. At the same time, the ECB continues to purchase financial assets, although it is reducing the scale of the purchases and has announced its termination until the end of the year. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates in September while continuing the gradual reduction of its balance sheet. In Poland, incoming data point to economic conditions remaining strong. GDP growth is driven by rising consumption, fuelled by increasing employment and wages, disbursement of benefits and very high consumer sentiment. This is accompanied by a rise in investment. Activity growth is also supported by favourable economic conditions abroad. Notwithstanding high economic growth and wages rising faster than in the previous year, consumer price growth remains moderate. The slightly higher annual CPI than in 2018 Q1 reflects mainly the growth in fuel prices. At the same time, inflation net of food and energy prices continues to be low. In the Council's assessment, current information points to a favourable outlook for economic growth in Poland, despite the expected slowdown in GDP growth in the coming quarters. In line with the available forecasts, inflation will remain close to the target in the monetary policy transmission horizon. As a result, the Council judges that the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability."
Romania,2018-10-03,"In its meeting of 3 October 2018, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided:. The developments in the annual CPI inflation rate over the first two months of Q3 overall were in line with expectations. In July, the indicator fell to 4.56 percent from 5.4 percent in the previous month, subsequently reaching 5.06 percent in August. The evolution versus June owed to supply-side factors and to some base effects, with the main influences being attributable to the slowdown in the growth rate of administered prices and fuel prices. The faster annual increase in vegetable and fruit prices acted in the opposite direction. The annual adjusted CORE 2 inflation rate (which excludes from the CPI inflation a number of prices on which monetary policy has limited or no influence, i.e. administered prices, volatile prices, and tobacco product and alcoholic beverage prices) continued to fall slightly, down to 2.8 percent in August, after having remained flat at 2.9 percent in July. The decline was further induced by processed food and services, mainly under the influence of the dynamics of international prices of some agri-food items and given the movements in the EUR/RON exchange rate. The average annual CPI inflation rate reached 3.9 percent in July and 4.2 percent in August against 3.6 percent in June; calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, the average annual rate came in at 3.2 percent in July and 3.5 percent in August versus 2.9 percent in June. Provisional data on economic growth in 2018 Q2 point to its slightly regaining momentum, in annual terms, to 4.1 percent from 4.0 percent in the previous quarter. Household consumption continued to be the main driver of GDP growth, closely followed by the change in inventories, whereas the contribution of gross fixed capital formation turned negative again. The contribution of net exports to the advance in GDP was further negative, but improved slightly against the previous quarter, as the growth rate of imports posted a more visible deceleration than that of exports. The latest statistical data show a step-up in the annual pace of increase of industrial output in July compared with the previous months, especially across manufacturing, and further robust dynamics for the activity in trade and services. Construction works kept declining in annual terms, particularly on account of residential construction. The annual growth rate of unit labour costs across the economy as a whole moderated slightly in Q2, while remaining, however, at an elevated level. At the same time, the annual change of unit wage costs in the industrial sector continued to pick up in Q2, but went down in July, amid the upturn in the annual dynamics of labour productivity. The relevant interbank money market rates saw their positive spread vis-Ã -vis the monetary policy rate narrow gradually over the past two months. The EUR/RON exchange rate remained relatively stable. The robust growth of credit to the private sector extended into July and August, at a pace of 6.6 percent, with the share of the leu-denominated component in total private sector credit reaching 65.3 percent (from a 35.6 percent low in May 2012). In turn, the share of loans to households peaked in August at a new historical high of 53.2 percent of total private sector credit. The latest assessments reconfirm the outlook for the annual inflation rate to decline further towards the upper bound of the variation band of the target at the end of this year, in line with the August 2018 medium-term forecast. The uncertainties and risks surrounding the inflation outlook stem mainly from developments in the prices of some food items, in administered prices (natural gas and electricity) and fuel prices, as well as from labour market conditions and the fiscal policy stance. Also relevant are the pace of global economic growth amid protectionist trends, the outlook for the economy and inflation in the euro area and the EU and hence the monetary policy stance of the ECB and of central banks in the region. Based on the currently available data, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided to keep unchanged the monetary policy rate at 2.50 percent per annum; moreover, the NBR Board decided to leave unchanged the deposit facility rate at 1.50 percent per annum and the lending (Lombard) facility rate at 3.50 percent per annum. In addition, the NBR Board decided to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board decisions aim to ensure and preserve price stability over the medium term in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth and amid safeguarding financial stability. The NBR Board underlines that the balanced macroeconomic policy mix and the implementation of structural reforms designed to foster the growth potential over the long term are of the essence in preserving a stable macroeconomic framework and strengthening the capacity of the Romanian economy to withstand potential adverse developments. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR website on 10 October 2018, at 3:00 p.m. The next monetary policy meeting of the NBR Board is scheduled for 6 November 2018, when a new quarterly Inflation Report is to be examined."
Mexico,2018-10-04,"Banco de Mexico's Governing Board decided to maintain the target for the overnight interbank interest rate at 7.75%. During the second quarter of 2018, the world economy continued to grow at a moderate pace, and the divergence among the main advanced economies' performance increased. Indeed, in contrast with the Eurozone. Japan and the U.K., which have grown below expectations, economic activity in the U.S. exhibited higher growth, partly in response to the fiscal stimulus implemented. Under conditions of reduced slack in the economy, this could exert greater pressure on inflation. As expected, in September the Federal Reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate and reiterated its forecast of increasing it gradually, thus leading to an increase in interest rates for all terms. The world economy continues to be subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to risks associated mainly with a further intensification of international trade disputes, a further tightening of financial conditions, and with geopolitical factors. In this environment, international financial markets have recently undergone episodes of volatility and the prices of emerging economies' assets have performed negatively. Nevertheless, differences related to each country's macroeconomic fundamentals and to idiosyncratic factors have been observed. Thus, since the last monetary policy decision, the Mexican peso has been more resilient than other emerging market currencies. In addition to Mexico's prudent macroeconomic management, this result was also associated with the favorable developments related to the trade negotiation with the United States and Canada. Concerning interest rates in Mexico, those of short tenors fluctuated slightly while those of medium and long tenors increased. The latest information suggests that at the beginning of the third quarter of 2018 economic activity in Mexico expanded, after having contracted during the second quarter. Slack conditions in the economy are estimated to have remained similar to those observed during the previous quarter. Given the complex environment the Mexican economy faces. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board considers that the balance of risks for growth continues biased to the downside. This bias has decreased at the margin as a result of the recently approved trade agreement with the United States and Canada. The Mexican economy is well poised to cope with adverse external and domestic scenarios due to the central bank's monetary policy stance adopted to keep medium- and long-term inflation expectations anchored, the fiscal commitments, and the financial system's resilience. In this regard, despite the decreased uncertainty associated with Mexico's trade relationship with the U.S. and Canada, the Mexican economy continues facing a complex environment characterized, among other factors, by the risk of tighter external financial conditions. Under these circumstances, it is particularly relevant that, in addition to following a prudent and robust monetary policy, measures to foster greater productivity are adopted and public finances are consolidated sustainably. Since June, higher-than-expected rises in the prices of energy-related products have been observed, mainly of gasoline and L.P. gas. Although these shocks are transitory, they have affected the rate at which core inflation has been declining, due to the indirect effects of these price increases on production costs, and they have also delayed the convergence of headline inflation to its target. In this regard, although these price increases stem from higher international references, the gradual adjustment of 1 domestic gasoline prices has made such increases more persistent. This has contributed to keep non- core inflation high for a long period. Although core inflation has been subject to the aforementioned indirect effects, projections that it will continue decreasing within monetary policy's period of influence are maintained. In this context, expectations for headline inflation for the end of 2018 have been adjusted from 4.25% in July to 4.50% in September, while those for the end of 2019 have increased from 3.60% to 3.70%, respectively. Expectations for core inflation for the end of 2018 decreased from 3.60 to 3.53% during the same months and those for the end of 2019 remained practically unchanged. Expectations for headline inflation for the medium and long terms remain around 3.50%. The expected evolution of inflation continues to be subject to risks and to a high degree of uncertainty. Among the upside risks are pressures on the peso exchange rate due to an environment of higher external interest rates and to other external or domestic factors. In this regard, should there be a real exchange rate depreciation. Banco de Mexico will make sure this takes place in an orderly manner and with no second-round effects on the economy's price formation process. On the other hand, the following risks persist: additional upward pressures on energy prices, as indicated by the futures prices of some of these products; escalating protectionist measures worldwide that could affect inflation negatively; and, greater-than-anticipated levels of public expenditure. In addition, if wage negotiations are not consistent with productivity gains, inflationary pressures on the economy could also appear. As for downside risks, the ratification of the new trade agreement with the U.S. and Canada could have a favorable impact on markets and on the Mexican peso exchange rate. Considering all of the above, the balance of risks to the forecasted trajectory of inflation remains biased upwards, in an environment of uncertainty. To guide its monetary policy actions. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board follows closely the development of inflation vis-Ã -vis its anticipated trajectory, taking into account the monetary policy stance adopted and the time frame in which monetary policy operates, as well as available information on all inflation determinants and on medium- and long-term inflation expectations, including the balance of risks for such factors. Given the Mexican economy's recent developments, that the shocks that have affected inflation recently are of a transitory nature, and that the expected trend for core inflation remains downward. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board has voted by majority to maintain the target for the overnight interbank interest rate unchanged at 7.75%. One member voted for increasing the rate by 25 basis points. The Governing Board will monitor the potential pass-through of the shocks that have affected non-core inflation as well as other factors that could affect the evolution of core inflation, which is particularly relevant in the present scenario, since this indicator is still above 3%. In this regard, the central bank will take the necessary actions, specifically, maintaining or possibly strengthening the current monetary policy stance so that headline inflation converges to Banco de Mexico's target within monetary policy's period of influence. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board will maintain a prudent monetary policy stance and will continue to follow closely the potential pass-through of exchange rate fluctuations to prices, the monetary policy stance relative to that of the U.S. under an adverse external environment, and the conditions of slack in the Mexican economy. In the presence and possible persistence of factors that, by their nature, involve risks to both inflation and inflation expectations, monetary policy will be adjusted in a timely and robust manner to achieve the convergence of inflation to its 3% target and to strengthen the anchoring of medium- and long-term inflation expectations so that they attain such target."
India,2018-10-05,"Fourth Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2018-19 Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) Reserve Bank of India On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation at its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 6.5 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains at 6.25 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 6.75 per cent. The decision of the MPC is consistent with the stance of calibrated tightening of monetary policy in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Assessment 2. Since the last MPC meeting in August 2018, global economic activity has remained resilient in spite of ongoing trade tensions, but is becoming uneven and the outlook is clouded by several uncertainties. Among advanced economies (AEs), the United States (US) economy appeared to have sustained pace in Q3:2018 as reflected in strong retail sales and robust industrial activity. In the Euro area, economic activity remained subdued due to overall weak economic sentiment, weighed down mainly by political uncertainty. The Japanese economy has so far maintained the momentum of the previous quarter, buoyed by recovering industrial production and strong business optimism. Economic activity in major emerging market economies (EMEs) has been facing headwinds from both global and country-specific factors. In China, industrial production growth has moderated with slowing exports and the ongoing deleveraging of the financial system weighing on growth prospects. The Russian economy has been gathering steam with the manufacturing sector turning around, and the employment scenario remaining upbeat on rising oil prices. In Brazil, economic activity is recovering from the setback in Q2, supported by improving business and consumer sentiment, though weak domestic demand and the sluggish pace of recovery in manufacturing activity point to a slow revival. The South African economy slipped into recession in Q2:2018, pulled down by the negative contribution from agriculture on account of a strong unfavourable base effect. Growth in global trade is weakening as reflected in export orders and automobile production and sales. Crude oil prices eased during the first half of August on concerns of reduced demand from EMEs due mainly to the spillover from country-specific turmoil, and accentuated by rising supplies. However, prices rebounded on expectation of reduced2 supplies due to sanctions on Iran and falling US stockpiles. Base metal prices witnessed selling pressure in anticipation of weak demand from major economies. Gold prices continued to slide lower on a strong US dollar, though they recovered somewhat on safe- haven demand from the mid-August lows. Inflation remained firm in the US, reflecting tightening labour market and elevated energy prices, while it persisted much below the central bank's target in Japan. In the Euro area, inflation pressures have been sustained by elevated crude prices. Inflation in many key EMEs has risen on surging crude prices and currency depreciations, caused by a firm dollar and domestic factors. Global financial markets continued to be affected by monetary policy stances in major AEs, the spreading of contagion risks from specific EMEs, and geopolitical developments. Among AEs, equity markets in the US touched a new high, driven by technology stocks, while in Japan, they were boosted by the weak yen. In contrast, stock markets in the Euro area suffered losses on signs of a slowdown and budget concerns in some member states. Sharp sell-offs have occurred on waning appetite of foreign portfolio investors for EME equities. The 10-year sovereign yield in the US has traded sideways, falling on dovish Fed guidance only to recover by end-September on robust economic data. Among other AEs, bond yields in the Euro area hardened in September on risk aversion following the sharp rise in financial market volatility in August. In contrast, bond yields in Japan moved in a narrow range, driven by the central bank's yield curve management policy. In most EMEs, yields rose due to domestic factors and/or contagion effects from the stress in other EMEs. In currency markets, the US dollar witnessed selling pressures since August on reduced investor expectations of rate hikes by the US Fed. However, it recovered in the last week of September on a rate hike by the Fed and strong economic data. The euro remained in bearish territory due to fiscal risks in some member countries and expectations of weak growth. EME currencies continued to depreciate against the US dollar. On the domestic front, real gross domestic product (GDP) growth surged to a nine- quarter high of 8.2 per cent in Q1:2018-19, extending the sequential acceleration to four successive quarters. Of the constituents, gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) expanded by double digits for the second consecutive quarter, driven by the government's focus on the road sector and affordable housing. Growth in private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) accelerated to 8.6 per cent, reflecting rising rural and urban spending, supported by retail credit growth. However, government final consumption expenditure (GFCE) decelerated, largely due to a high base. The growth of exports of goods and services jumped to 12.7 per cent, powered by non-oil exports on the back of strong global demand. In spite of import growth continuing to surge, high exports growth helped reduce the drag from net exports on aggregate demand. On the supply side, growth of gross value added (GVA) at basic prices accelerated in Q1, underpinned by double-digit expansion in manufacturing activity which was robust and generalised across firm sizes. Agricultural growth also picked up, supported by robust growth in production of rice, pulses and coarse cereals alongside a sustained expansion in livestock products, forestry and fisheries. In contrast, services sector growth moderated somewhat, largely on account of a high base. Construction activity, however, maintained strong pace for the second consecutive quarter. The fourth advance estimates of agricultural production for 2017-18 released in August placed foodgrains production at a high of 284.8 million tonnes, 1.9 per cent higher than the third advance estimates (released in May 2018) and 3.5 per cent higher than the final estimates for the previous year. The progress of the south-west monsoon has been marked by uneven spatial and temporal distribution, with an overall deficit of 9 per cent in precipitation. However, the first advance estimates of production of major kharif crops for 2018-19 have placed foodgrains production at 141.6 million tonnes, 0.6 per cent higher than last year's level. The live storage in major reservoirs (as on September 27) rose to 76 per cent of the full capacity, which was 17 per cent higher than last year and 5 per cent higher than the average of the last 10 years. This bodes well for the rabi sowing season.3 9. Industrial growth, measured by the index of industrial production (IIP), accelerated in June-July 2018 on a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis, underpinned mainly by high growth in consumer durables, notably two-wheelers, readymade garments, stainless steel utensils, auto components and spares, and accessories. Growth in consumer non-durables also accelerated in July. The infrastructure and construction sector continued to show solid growth. Primary goods growth accelerated, driven by mining, electricity and petroleum refinery products. Growth in capital goods production spiked in June, but decelerated sharply in July. The output of eight core industries growth remained strong in July, driven by coal, petroleum refinery products, steel and cement, but moderated in August. Capacity utilisation (CU) declined from 75.2 per cent in Q4:2017-18 to 73.8 per cent in Q1:2018-19, while seasonally adjusted CU increased by 1.8 percentage points to the long-term average of 74.9 per cent. Based on the Reserve Bank's business expectations index (BEI), the assessment for Q2:2018-19 improved, led by enhanced production, order books, exports and capacity utilisation. The August and September manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) remained in expansion zone; the September print rebounded close to the July level confirming robustness of manufacturing activity. High-frequency indicators of services in July and August present a mixed picture. Indicators of rural demand, viz., growth in tractor and two-wheeler sales, slowed down. Passenger vehicle sales, an indicator of urban demand, declined possibly due to rising fuel prices. However, growth in air passenger traffic â€“ another indicator of urban demand â€“ remained robust. Transportation sector indicators, viz., commercial vehicle sales and port cargo, expanded at an accelerated pace. Steel consumption and cement production, indicators of construction activity, showed strong growth. The services PMI remained in expansion zone in August and September, though it decelerated from July, with slower expansion in new business and employment. Retail inflation, measured by the y-o-y change in the CPI, fell from 4.9 per cent in June to 3.7 per cent in August, dragged down by a decline in food inflation. Some softening of inflation in items other than food and fuel also contributed to the decline. Adjusting for the estimated impact of an increase in house rent allowance (HRA) for central government employees, headline inflation was at 3.4 per cent. Inflation in the food and beverages group declined sharply in the absence of seasonal uptick in prices of fruits and vegetables. Of the three key vegetables, the prices of tomatoes declined due to strong mandi arrivals, while those of onions and potatoes remained muted. Continued deflation in prices of pulses and sugar accentuated the decline in food inflation. Inflation in other items of food â€“ cereals, meat and fish, milk, spices and non-alcoholic beverages â€“ remained benign. Inflation in the fuel and light group continued to rise on the back of a significant increase in liquefied petroleum gas prices, tracking international product prices. Kerosene prices rose as oil marketing companies reduced subsidies in a calibrated manner. While remaining elevated. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel moderated due to softening in inflation in housing; pan, tobacco and intoxicants; personal care; and transportation. While the September round of the Reserve Bank's survey of households reported a sharp uptick of 50 basis points in three-month ahead inflation expectations over the last round, one-year ahead expectations moderated by 30 basis points. Inflation expectations for both input prices and selling prices of manufacturing firms, polled by the Reserve Bank's industrial outlook survey, firmed up in Q2:2018-19. The manufacturing and services PMIs also reported an increase in input costs and selling prices in Q2, reflecting a pass-through of higher costs to clients. On the other hand, growth in wages in the rural and organised manufacturing sectors remained contained. Systemic liquidity alternated between surplus and deficit during August-September 2018, reflecting the combined impact of expansion of currency in circulation. Reserve Bank's forex operations and movements in government cash balances. From a daily net average surplus of â‚¹ 201 billion during August 1-19, 2018, liquidity moved into deficit during August4 20-30. After turning into surplus during August 31-September 10 due to increased government spending, the system again moved into deficit during September 11-29 on the back of an increase in government cash balances and Reserve Bank's forex interventions. Based on an assessment of the evolving liquidity conditions, the Reserve Bank conducted two open market purchase operations in the second half of September to inject â‚¹ 200 billion of durable liquidity. LAF operations absorbed, on a daily net average basis, â‚¹ 30 billion in August, but injected â‚¹406 billion in September. The weighted average call rate (WACR), on an average, traded below the repo rate by 15 basis points (bps) in August and by 4 bps in September. Exports maintained double digit growth in July and August 2018, driven mainly by petroleum products (which benefitted from elevated crude oil prices), engineering goods, gems and jewellery, drugs and pharmaceuticals, and chemicals. However, imports grew faster than exports, reflecting not only a higher oil import bill, but also higher imports of gold, coal, electronic goods and machinery. This led to a widening of the trade deficit to US$ 35.3 billion in July-August 2018 from US$ 24.6 billion a year ago over and above the expansion in Q1:2018-19. However, higher net services receipts and private transfer receipts helped contain the current account deficit to 2.4 per cent of GDP in Q1:2018-19 from 2.5 per cent a year ago. On the financing side, net foreign direct investment (FDI) flows improved in April- July 2018. By contrast, foreign portfolio investors have been net sellers in both the equity and debt segments so far on a cumulative basis in 2018-19 due to higher US interest rates, risk- off sentiment in EMEs and escalation of trade wars. India's foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 400.5 billion on September 28, 2018. Outlook 17. In the third bi-monthly resolution of August 2018. CPI inflation was projected at 4.6 per cent in Q2:2018-19, 4.8 per cent in H2 and 5.0 per cent in Q1:2019-20, with risks evenly balanced. Excluding the HRA impact. CPI inflation was projected at 4.4 per cent in Q2:2018- 19, 4.7-4.8 per cent in H2 and 5.0 per cent in Q1:2019-20. Actual inflation outcomes, especially in August, were below projections as the expected seasonal increase in food prices did not materialise and inflation excluding food and fuel moderated. Going forward, the inflation outlook is expected to be influenced by several factors. First, food inflation has remained unusually benign, which imparts a downward bias to its trajectory in the second half of the year. Inflation in key food items such as pulses, edible oils, sugar, fruits and vegetables remains exceptionally soft at this juncture. The risk to food inflation from spatially and temporally uneven rainfall is also mitigated, as confirmed by the first advance estimates that have placed production of major kharif crops for 2018-19 higher than last year's record. An estimate of the impact of an increase in minimum support prices (MSPs) announced in July has been factored in the baseline projections. Secondly, the price of the Indian basket of crude oil has increased sharply, by US$ 13 a barrel, since the last resolution. Thirdly, international financial markets remained volatile with EME currencies depreciating significantly. Finally, the HRA effect came off its peak in June and is dissipating gradually on expected lines. Taking all these factors into consideration, inflation is projected at 4.0 per cent in Q2:2018-19, 3.9-4.5 per cent in H2 and 4.8 per cent in Q1:2019-20, with risks somewhat to the upside (Chart 1). Excluding the HRA impact. CPI inflation is projected at 3.7 per cent in Q2:2018-19, 3.8 - 4.5 per cent in H2 and 4.8 per cent in Q1:2019-20. Turning to the growth outlook, the GDP print of Q1:2018-19 was significantly higher than that projected in the August resolution. Private consumption has remained robust and is likely to be sustained even as the recent rise in oil prices may have a bearing on disposable incomes. Improving capacity utilisation, larger FDI inflows and increased financial resources to the corporate sector augur well for investment activity. However, both global and domestic financial conditions have tightened, which may dampen investment activity. Rising crude oil prices and other input costs may also drag down investment activity by denting profit margins of corporates. This adverse impact will be alleviated to the extent corporates are able to pass on increases in their input costs. Uncertainty surrounds the outlook for exports. Tailwinds from the recent depreciation of the rupee could be muted by the slowing down of global trade5 and the escalating tariff war. Based on an overall assessment. GDP growth projection for 2018-19 is retained at 7.4 per cent as in the August resolution (7.4 per cent in Q2 and 7.1-7.3 per cent in H2), with risks broadly balanced; the path in the August resolution was 7.5 per cent in Q2:2018-19 and 7.3-7.4 per cent in H2. GDP growth for Q1:2019-20 is now projected marginally lower at 7.4 per cent as against 7.5 per cent in the August resolution, mainly due to the strong base effect (Chart 2). While the projections of inflation for 2018-19 and Q1:2019-20 have been revised downwards from the August resolution, its trajectory is projected to rise above the August 2018 print. The outlook is clouded with several uncertainties. First, the government announced in September measures aimed at ensuring remunerative prices to farmers for their produce, although uncertainty continues about their exact impact on food prices. Secondly, oil prices remain vulnerable to further upside pressures, especially if the response of oil-producing nations to supply disruptions from geopolitical tensions is not adequate. The recent excise duty cuts on petrol and diesel will moderate retail inflation. Thirdly, volatility in global financial markets continues to impart uncertainty to the inflation outlook. Fourthly, a sharp rise in input costs, combined with rising pricing power, poses the risk of higher pass- through to retail prices for both goods and services. Firms covered under the Reserve Bank's industrial outlook survey report firming of input costs in Q2:2018-19 and Q3. However, global commodity prices other than oil have moderated, which should mitigate the adverse influence on input costs. Fifthly, should there be fiscal slippage at the centre and/or state levels, it will have a bearing on the inflation outlook, besides heightening market volatility and crowding out private sector investment. Finally, the staggered impact of HRA revision by the state governments may push up headline inflation. While the MPC will look through the statistical impact of HRA revisions, there is need to be watchful for any second-round effects on inflation. The inflation outlook calls for a close vigil over the next few months, especially because the output gap has virtually closed and several upside risks persist. Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged. The MPC reiterates its commitment to achieving the medium-term target for headline inflation of 4 per cent on a durable basis. The MPC notes that global headwinds in the form of escalating trade tensions, volatile and rising oil prices, and tightening of global financial conditions pose substantial risks to the growth and inflation outlook. It is, therefore, imperative to further strengthen domestic macroeconomic fundamentals.6 23. Regarding the policy repo rate. Dr.Pami Dua. Dr.Ravindra H. Dholakia. Dr.Michael Debabrata Patra.

Israel,2018-10-08,"The inflation environment has not changed markedly since the previous interest rate decision, despiteslightly lower than expected recent CPI readings: The annual inflation rate is in the lower part of the target range, and expectations for the various ranges remained in their environment of the previous interest rate decision. Nevertheless, the Monetary Committee assesses that the forces supporting an increase in inflation still prevail; the main risk to the entrenchment of inflation within the target is the possibility of a sharp appreciation in the shekel. Preliminary estimates of third quarter activity support the assessment that the economy continued to grow at a solid pace, while the second quarter growth rate was affected by transitory factors. The downward trend in the current account surplus is a further indication of the expansion of demand in the economy. The labor market remains tight. Based on the Research Department's staff forecast. GDP is expected to grow by 3.7 percent in 2018 and by 3.6 percent in 2019. The macro picture conveyed by the global economy remains positive, particularly in the US, but various indicators point to a softening of momentum in view of a worsening of the trade war, an increase in political risk in Europe, and volatility in financial markets of emerging economies. The Federal Reserve is expected to raise thefederal funds rate, while in Europe and Japan core inflation remains low and the accommodative monetary policy continues. The shekel is at an appreciated level similar to that of the previous interest rate decision, despite volatility between the meetings, with a slight appreciation of 0.2 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate for the intermeeting period. The downward trendin home prices, which began approximately a year ago, has halted. The increase in new mortgage volume continues, and mortgage interest rates remain stable. Building starts increased in the second quarter, but their volume remains very low. TheMonetary Committee intends to maintain the accommodative policy as long as necessary in order to entrench the inflation environment within the target range. The Bank of Israel continues to monitor developments in inflation, the real economy, the financial markets, and the global economy,and will act to attain the monetary policy targets in accordance with such developments. For the file of data accompanying this notice, click here. Since the previous interest rate decision, there has not been a marked change in the inflation environment: The CPI readings for July and August were slightly lower than expected, and the past year's increase in the annual inflation rate, which reached above the lower bound of the target, stopped: in the 12 months ending in August, the inflation rate was 1.2 percent. All CPI components, except communication, contributed positively to annual inflation in the past 3 months (Figure 1 in the attached data file). The rate of inflation in prices of tradable goods remains positive, impacted by an increase in energy prices, and the rate of increase of nontradable goods prices remains stable (Figure 3). Expectations for the various ranges remained in the same environment as at the time of the previous interest rate decision. In the coming months, there is likely to be a transitory decline in the inflation rate to below the lower bound of the target range, but 1-year inflation expectations from various sources are around the lower bound (Figure 4). Forward expectations for medium terms are entrenched within the target range, and the expectations for longer terms are anchored around the midpoint of the target (Figure 5). According to the Research Department's staff forecast, the inflation rate over the coming four quarters will be 1.4 percent. The shekel remains relatively stable at an appreciated level. After the previous interest rate decision, it strengthened but subsequently weakened, and for the intermeeting period overall there was a slight appreciation of approximately 0.2 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate (Figure 6). The forces supporting an increase in inflation still prevail: The increase in wages in the economy, robust private consumption, inflation abroad, and an expansionary fiscal policy all support the continued rise of the inflation rate in the coming year. The main risk to the entrenchment of the inflation rate within the target is the possibility of a sharp appreciation of the shekel. After the previous interest rate decision, government bond yields increased, in view of a sharp rise in corresponding yields in the US. In the past month, there was a slight decline in the yield spreads between corporate bonds and parallel government bonds, after a prolonged increase since the beginning of the year. Regarding economic activity, preliminary estimates of third quarter activity point to continued growth at a solid pace, while second quarter growth was impacted by transitory factors, among other things by volatility in vehicle purchases. The Composite State of the Economy Index for August increased by 0.4 percent (Figure 12); the Consumer Confidence Index increased both for the current and expectation indices; the Purchasing Managers Index declined in August, but remains at a level signifying expansion. Initial findings from the Companies Survey for the third quarter and findings from the Business Tendency Survey support this assessment as well. The downward trend in the Current Account surplus continues, primarily as a result of the increase in goods imports in the past year. This indicates expansion of demand, which againstthe background of full employment is steered to expansion of imports (Figure 13). The labor market remains tight: the unemployment rate remains low and the employment and participation rates are high. The ratio of job vacancies to total employee posts remains high, and wages continue to increase at a solid pace (Figure 17), primarily in the business sector. According to the Research Department's staff forecast. GDP is expected to grow by 3.7 percent in 2018 and by 3.6 percent in 2019. The downward trend in home prices that began approximately a year ago has halted, and recent readings point to an increase (Figure 9). The number of transactions, particularly by first home buyers, continued to rise, after a prolonged decline since the middle of 2016. Building starts increased in the second quarter, but their level remains low. New mortgage volume continues to expand, and mortgage interest rates have been stable in recent months (Figure 10). The macro picture conveyed by the global economy remains positive but various indicators point to a softening of momentum: particularly the slowing in the growth rate of world trade (Figure 19) against the background ofa worsening of the 'trade war', an increase in political riskin Europe, and volatility in financial markets of emerging economies (Figure 23). In contrast, the positive trend in the US continues. The OECD slightly loweredthe global growth forecast, due to the eurozone and some other economies (Figure 18). US inflation hovered around the 2 percent target, and in Europe and Japan inflation also rose but core inflation remains low (Figure 20). Indicators of activity in the US point to continued solid growth in the third quarter as well, supported by the fiscal expansion: the labor market, private consumption and industrial production remain robust. The monetary contraction is expected to continue: According to the Federal Reserve's forecast, the federal funds rate will increase once more in 2018 and three times in 2019.In Europe, the growth rate moderated compared with that of 2017, due to a decline in the growth rate of private consumption. Even though the ECB is expected to stop the quantitative expansion at the end of the year, it is not expected to raise the interest rate in the short term, and thus monetary policy remains accommodative. In Japan, there was a recovery in activity in the second quarter, and the policy remains very accommodative. The rise in yields in the US and concern of a trade war continue to weigh on emerging economies. The slowdown in growth in China is reflected in a slowing of investments in infrastructure and in weakness in the manufacturing sector. Oil prices resumed their increases, against the background of supply-side influences (Figure 21). The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on October 22, 2018. The next decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Monday. November 26, 2018."
Peru,2018-10-11,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR OCTOBER 2018 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 2.75% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 2.75 percent. This decision takes into account the following factors: In September, the YoY rate of inflation and the indicators of trend inflation showed levels within the inflation target range; The expected YoY rate of inflation was 2.44 percent in September; Some indicators of economic activity show temporary signs of lower dynamism and economic activity remains below its potential level of growth, and Greater financial volatility, associated with recent commercial tensions and uncertainty in the international markets, could affect global economic activity. The YoY inflation rate is projected to remain within the target range in October and to gradually converge to 2.0 percent in the short-term. The Board considers that it is appropriate to maintain an expansionary policy stance until it is certain that this convergence will take place when inflation expectations are anchored in a context in which the level of economic activity is close to its potential level of growth. Recent indicators of inflation and activity reflect the following: Inflation in September showed a rate of 0.19 percent, as a result of which the YoY inflation rate rose from 1.07 percent in August to 1.28 percent in September 2018. Inflation without food and energy recorded a rate of 0.04 percent, as a result of which the YoY rate rose from 2.04 percent in August to 2.09 percent in September, within the target range. Most indicators of business expectations continue to be on the optimistic side in September. Moreover, a more gradual recovery is observed in indicators of economic activity. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 1.50 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 3.30 percent for the first 15 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 15 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 3.30 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for November on its Meeting of November 8, 2018."
Kazakhstan,2018-10-15,"PRESS - RELEASE – 34 The base rate raised to 9.25% October 15, 2018 Almaty The National Bank of Kazakhstan has decided to raise the base rate by 0.25 percentage points to 9.25% while preserving the existing corridor of +/-1%. The decision was stipulated by the increased proinflationary risks, including those arising from the exchange rate volatility, mentioned in the previous decisions on the base rate. The National Bank maintains its estimates for the dynamics of projected inflation near the upper boundary of the target corridor for 2019, i.e. closer to 6%, and draws attention to the growing uncertainty in inflation expectations caused by external factors. Further decisions on the base rate will be determined by the correspondence of the projected inflation to its target corridor. In order to improve the operational efficiency of monetary operations, the necessity to narrow the corridor of the interest rate will be considered. At present inflationary background is characterized as moderate. In September the annual inflation was formed at the level of 6.1%. Rise of prices in the markets of sugar, cereal, bakery products, eggs, poultry led to an increase in food inflation from 5.1% in August to 5.7% in September, despite the seasonal decline in prices for fruits and vegetables on the background of the high supply. The non-food inflation was influenced by the increase in the prices for solid fuel in view of lower prices for fuel and lubricants, as well as moderate price dynamics for other non-food items and paid services to the population. Industrial production prices for finished consumer goods rose at a moderate pace (3.6% in annual terms). However, increase in prices which continue to be high in the manufacturing industry (10.3%) will create pressure on consumer prices on the horizon of up to 6-12 months. According to the National Bank's estimates, inflation in the current year will be within the target corridor of 5-7%, and in 2019 it will smoothly enter the new corridor of 4-6%, being closer to its upper boundary of the target corridor. In August and September, there was an increase in inflation expectations of households (from 5.6% in July to 5.9% and 6.4%, respectively) on the background of increased fluctuations of the exchange rate, which confirms their unsteady nature in the short-term. The perceivable inflation also increased  the share of the responders, who believe that â€œin the past 12 months the price of goods and services has increased with the faster rate than beforeâ€, amounted to 42.5% in September, compared to 41.3% in August. Domestic demand continues to expand due to the growth of real income of households (for 8 months  rise by 3.5%) and the rise in the volume of consumer loans (in August  12% in annual terms). In the medium term, the growth of household income will be supported by the upcoming increase in the minimum wage level, putting inflationary pressure on the economy. The output gap remains positive, reflecting that the actual growth of the economy is higher than its potential level. In January-September 2018 the short-term economic indicator amounted to 104.8%. The mining industry (4.9%) and manufacturing (5.1%), transport (4.6%) and trade (6.7%) made a positive contribution to the growth. The situation in the external sector is accompanied by tightening of monetary conditions by leading central banks, as well as the central banks of some developing countries in response to capital outflow and the weakening of their national currencies. The risk of inflationary pressure from the external sector persists as well as in the period of the previous decision on the base rate. The actual inflation in the countries  major trading partners in the current year and expectations for its further acceleration to levels above target indicators in the current year and the next year remain as the key risk factors. The new level of the base rate will allow to increase the demand for tenge assets and to maintain monetary conditions at a level close to neutral. The necessity to tighten monetary conditions will be determined by the correspondence of the projected inflation to its target corridor. In order to improve the effectiveness of monetary policy, the National Bank sees the need for further improvement of the short-term predictability of the targeted TONIA rate within the target corridor, including bringing the targeted rate closer to the base rate. The next decision on the base rate will be announced on December 3, 2018 at 17:00 Astana time.

Hungary,2018-10-16,"At its meeting on 16 October 2018, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 17 October 2018:. In the Council's assessment, in parallel with the pick-up in domestic demand Hungarian economic output is close to its potential level. Growth of the Hungarian economy will pick up further in 2018, then, if the assumptions of the current projection hold, it will slow down gradually from 2019. The inflation target is still expected to be achieved in a sustainable manner from mid-2019. The Magyar Nemzeti Bank's (MNB) single anchor is inflation. Under the flexible inflation targeting regime, the Monetary Council takes account of all factors influencing inflation developments on the five to eight-quarter horizon of monetary policy. These may include developments in commodity prices, changes in the external inflation environment, labour market conditions, the position of the real economy, developments in the exchange rate and credit market conditions. By taking into account all these factors, the Bank is able to assess the likely magnitude and persistence of future price changes, which in turn determine the monetary policy response. In September 2018, inflation rose to 3.6 percent and core inflation to 2.4 percent. In addition to a sharp rise in volatile items, particularly fuel and unprocessed food prices, the increase in excise taxes on tobacco products, were the main factors contributing to the pick-up in price level. In line with the Bank's expectations, the measures of underlying inflation were broadly unchanged, staying stable at around 2.5 percent. Both core inflation excluding indirect tax effects and sticky-price inflation stagnated, while demand-sensitive inflation rose modestly. As a result, the difference between the consumer price index and the measures of underlying inflation widened further. Inflationary pressures from wages continued to be moderate. Oil prices have increased since the previous interest rate decision. According to the European Central Bank's (ECB) projection, underlying inflation will continue to be moderate in the euro area in the coming years as well. If the assumptions in the September projection hold, the consumer price index will remain above 3 percent in the short term. Beginning from the autumn months, the increase in excise taxes will also contribute to upward pressure on inflation, in addition to fuel and unprocessed food prices, while core inflation excluding indirect tax effects will remain stable around 2.5 percent. With inflation expectations anchored at low levels, second-round effects are not expected to arise. Rising consumption in the September projection will lead to a gradual increase in underlying inflation. As temporary effects fade, the inflation rate is expected to ease back again, and the rise in underlying inflation will ensure that inflation meets the 3 percent target in a sustainable structure from mid-2019. The Hungarian economy grew strongly, by 4.9 percent in the second quarter of 2018 relative to a year earlier. Data on economic activity suggest that robust economic growth is likely to continue. The unemployment rate has fallen to a historically low level. Lending to the corporate and household sectors continued to expand in August; however, the proportion of long-term, fixed-rate lending to the corporate sector continues to be low. Looking ahead, economic growth is expected to continue across a broad range of sectors. The general strengthening of domestic demand will continue to play a central role in economic output developments. In the Council's assessment. GDP growth will pick up and stand at 4.4 percent in 2018, then, if the assumptions of the current projection hold, it will slow down gradually from 2019. Meanwhile, the country's current account balance is expected to remain in positive territory over the longer term as well. On the whole, sentiment in international financial markets has deteriorated in the period since the Council's previous interest rate decision. Expectations related to the monetary policy stance of the world's major central banks as well as news about international trade policies, developments in the supply of crude oil and Italy's government budget were the main factors influencing investors' appetite for risk. The current volatile international environment continues to suggest a more cautious approach. The Bank assesses these developments in light of their relevance to its primary objective, i.e. the sustainable achievement of the inflation target, focusing on their persistence. Monetary conditions in the euro area may remain loose. The ECB's decisions may have a significant influence on the Magyar Nemzeti Bank's monetary policy. Taking into account the country's long-term national and economic policy strategy objectives, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank's Monetary Council increased Hungary's official gold reserves significantly, in line with its previous decision. Accordingly, the amount of gold reserves expanded from the earlier 3.1 tons to 31.5 tons in October 2018. The Magyar Nemzeti Bank purchased gold for the first time since 1986. Following the significant increase in the physical form of the stock of gold reserves, it has already been transported to Hungary. The Bank's primary objective is to achieve the inflation target in a sustainable manner. For this reason, in the Council's assessment, maintaining the loose monetary conditions is necessary. Consistent with the practice of leading central banks, the MNB is also prepared for the gradual and cautious normalisation of monetary policy. As part of the instrument strategy presented in September, the Monetary Council will phase out the three-month deposit facility by the end of 2018. In the future, required reserves will be the main policy instrument. Looking forward, the Bank will adjust monetary conditions necessary to achieve the inflation target in a sustainable manner by creating an optimal combination of two of its instruments: the stock of swap instruments providing forint liquidity and the interest rate corridor. As part of the fine-tuning of the unconventional policy instruments affecting long-term yields, mortgage bond purchases in the secondary market ended, consistent with the Council's September decision. In addition, the mortgage bond purchase programme in the primary market will be completed and the monetary policy IRS instrument will be phased out by the end of 2018. Furthermore, the Monetary Council will launch the Funding for Growth Scheme Fix at the beginning of 2019. The MNB will sterilise the liquidity provided under this programme using a preferential deposit facility bearing interest at the central bank base rate. In order to maintain the loose monetary conditions, the Monetary Council held the base rate, the overnight collateralised lending rate and the one-week collateralised lending rate at 0.9 percent and the overnight deposit rate at -0.15 percent. In addition, in September the Council left the average amount of liquidity to be crowded-out for the fourth quarter of 2018 unchanged, at least at HUF 400-600 billion. On the next occasion, in December 2018, the Council will decide on the amount of liquidity to be crowded out and will take this into account in setting the stock of central bank swap instruments. The Council is prepared for the gradual and cautious normalisation of monetary policy, which will start depending on the outlook for inflation. The inflation target is still expected to be achieved in a sustainable manner from mid-2019. To ensure this, in the Council's assessment, maintaining the current level of the base rate and the loose monetary conditions is necessary."
Chile,2018-10-18,"Thursday, 18 October 2018 Monetary Policy Meeting  October 2018 In its monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points to 2.75%. The decision was adopted by the unanimous vote of its members. The external scenario continues to be characterized by financial markets' volatility, in a context of increasing divergence of the US economy from its peers in the developed world. At the same time, trade tensions have tended to focus on US-China relations. The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark rate again in September, while the market adjusted upward the expected trajectory for 2019 and 2020. This pushed long-term interest rates and risk aversion up in most of the countries, and the prices of riskier assets saw important corrections at the global level. In the Eurozone. Brexit negotiations and the definition of Italy's fiscal deficit have created uncertainty in markets. In turn. China increased the monetary impulse once more, while its currency continued to depreciate against the dollar. Financial pressures on the rest of the emerging economies have tended to moderate. Commodity prices, although with important ups and downs, have seen increases in most products, copper included. Chile's currency and stock prices, as in most emerging economies, saw significant fluctuations in recent weeks. In the domestic fixed-income market, worth noting was the rise of short-term rates in line with expectations about the MPR. Meanwhile, long- term rates have had limited increases, smaller than those of their external peers, in a context where the country's financial risk indicators remained contained. Domestic credit continues to be characterized by low interest rates and stronger growth in commercial loans. The Bank Credit Survey for the third quarter of 2018 showed less restrictions for granting loans to households and big companies and stronger demand in the different segments, especially households, big companies and real estate. Mining activity had some setbacks owing to some specific factors in some mines. The other sectors evolved as foreseen in the September Monetary Policy Report. Investment, especially in machinery and equipment, continues to lead the increase in domestic spending. The good performance of durable consumption also stands out. The review of complementary sources of information on the labor market -including administrative records- indicates increased dynamism of employment and salaries than suggested by the surveys. Corporate expectations (IMCE) are still in the optimistic zone, while household expectations (IPEC) have relapsed somewhat in recent months and now stand slightly below their neutral threshold. Anyway, expectations about the economic situation of households one year ahead are still positive. For the period 2018-2020, the markets' outlook for GDP growth (EES) is consistent with the baseline scenario of the latest Report. September's inflation (0.3%) was slightly below projections, affected by one-off developments, such as lower food inflation. With this, annual CPI inflation rose to 3.1% and CPIEFE inflation rose to 2.1%, with a sustained acceleration of the more output- gap sensitive prices, such as the non-regulated services in the CPIEFE basket. Private expectations for inflation remain around 3% for December of this year and for one and two years ahead. The Board's decision considered that capacity gaps have narrowed in recent quarters and will continue to do so in line with forecasts in the Monetary Policy Report, taking both headline and core inflation near 3% in the coming quarters. In this scenario, the Board believes that the monetary stimulus should begin to be reduced to ensure that inflation perspectives remain close to the target. Bearing in mind that, in the baseline scenario of the Report, the monetary policy rate will converge to its neutral level in 2020, a timely start of this process allows proceeding with graduality and caution. This will provide the necessary room for the Board to define the appropriate pace of the monetary stimulus withdrawal. Thus, the Board reaffirms its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the two- year horizon. The minutes of this Monetary Policy Meeting will be published at 8:30 hours of Tuesday 6 November 2018. The next Monetary Policy Meeting is scheduled to take place on Tuesday 4 December 2018 and the statement thereof will be released the same day at 18:00 hours. _The Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2018-10-18,"Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period. This press release is the English version of the Bank of Korea's policy statement. In the case of any inconsistency, the original version in Korean will prevail. The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.50% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Board considers that the global economy has continued its sound growth. The global financial markets have shown increased volatility, with government bond yields rising and stock prices falling in major countries. Looking ahead the Board sees global economic growth as likely to be affected by factors such as the movements toward spreading trade protectionism, the paces of monetary policy normalization in major countries, and the directions of the US government's economic policies. The Board judges that the domestic economy has sustained a rate of growth at its potential level generally, as consumption and exports have shown favorable movements although the adjustments in facilities and construction investment have persisted. Employment conditions have remained sluggish, with the number of persons employed having risen only slightly. Going forward the Board expects domestic economic growth to be somewhat below the path projected in July, but to sustain a rate that does not diverge significantly from its potential level. It anticipates that investment will slow but that the trend of steady increase in consumption will continue, and that exports will also sustain their favorable movements thanks to the buoyancy of the global economy. Consumer price inflation has risen to the upper-1% level, due mainly to an acceleration in the pace of increase in agricultural product prices and to the ending of a temporary reduction of electricity fees. Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has remained at the 1% level, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has been in the mid- to upper-2% range. Looking ahead it is forecast that consumer price inflation will fluctuate in the mid- to upper-1% range. Core inflation will also gradually rise. In the domestic financial markets, stock prices have fallen significantly and the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has risen to a considerable extent, in line mainly with the escalation of the US-China trade dispute and the rapid decline in stock prices globally. Long-term market interest rates have increased, in reflection of the changes in interest rates in major countries. Household lending has sustained its higher rate of expansion than in past years, although the amount of its expansion has lessened somewhat. Housing sales prices had risen substantially in some parts of Seoul and its surrounding areas, but their pace of increase has slowed since the Korean government's announcement of measures to stabilize the housing market. Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As it is forecast that inflationary pressures on the demand side will not be high for the time being, and that the domestic economy will sustain a rate of growth that does not diverge significantly from its potential level, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance. In this process it will judge whether it is necessary to adjust its accommodative monetary policy stance, while closely checking future economic growth and inflation trends. It will also carefully monitor conditions related to trade with major countries, any changes in the monetary policies of major countries, financial and economic conditions in emerging market economies, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks."
Euroarea,2018-10-25,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Vice-President. Mr Dombrovskis. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We continue to expect them to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, we will continue to make net purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) at the new monthly pace of â‚¬15 billion until the end of December 2018. We anticipate that, subject to incoming data confirming our medium-term inflation outlook, we will then end net purchases. We intend to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time after the end of our net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. Incoming information, while somewhat weaker than expected, remains overall consistent with an ongoing broad-based expansion of the euro area economy and gradually rising inflation pressures. The underlying strength of the economy continues to support our confidence that the sustained convergence of inflation to our aim will proceed and will be maintained even after a gradual winding-down of our net asset purchases. At the same time, uncertainties relating to protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility remain prominent. Significant monetary policy stimulus is still needed to support the further build-up of domestic price pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term. This support will continue to be provided by the net asset purchases until the end of the year, by the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the associated reinvestments, and by our enhanced forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates. In any event, the Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation continues to move towards the Governing Council's inflation aim in a sustained manner. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro area real GDP increased by 0.4%, quarter on quarter, in both the first and the second quarter of 2018. Incoming information, while somewhat weaker than expected, remains overall consistent with our baseline scenario of an ongoing broad-based economic expansion, supported by domestic demand and continued improvements in the labour market. Some recent sector-specific developments are having an impact on the near-term growth profile. Our monetary policy measures continue to underpin domestic demand. Private consumption is fostered by ongoing employment growth and rising wages. At the same time, business investment is supported by solid domestic demand, favourable financing conditions and corporate profitability. In addition, the expansion in global activity is expected to continue supporting euro area exports, though at a slower pace. The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook can still be assessed as broadly balanced. At the same time, risks relating to protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility remain prominent. Euro area annual HICP inflation increased to 2.1% in September 2018, from 2.0% in August, reflecting mainly higher energy and food price inflation. On the basis of current futures prices for oil, annual rates of headline inflation are likely to hover around the current level over the coming months. While measures of underlying inflation remain generally muted, they have been increasing from earlier lows. Domestic cost pressures are strengthening and broadening amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets. Looking ahead, underlying inflation is expected to pick up towards the end of the year and to increase further over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion and rising wage growth. Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth stood at 3.5% in September 2018, after 3.4% in August. Apart from some volatility in monthly flows. M3 growth is increasingly supported by bank credit creation. The narrow monetary aggregate M1 remained the main contributor to broad money growth. The growth of loans to the private sector strengthened further, continuing the upward trend observed since the beginning of 2014. The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations rose to 4.3% in September 2018, from 4.1% in August, while the annual growth rate of loans to households stood at 3.1%, unchanged from the previous month. The euro area bank lending survey for the third quarter of 2018 indicates that loan growth continues to be supported by increasing demand across all loan categories and favorable bank lending conditions for loans to enterprises and loans for house purchase. The pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014 continues to significantly support borrowing conditions for firms and households, access to financing  in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises  and credit flows across the euro area. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is still necessary for the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute more decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential and reducing vulnerabilities. The implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up to increase resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost euro area productivity and growth potential. Regarding fiscal policies, the broad-based expansion calls for rebuilding fiscal buffers. This is particularly important in countries where government debt is high and for which full adherence to the Stability and Growth Pact is critical for safeguarding sound fiscal positions. Likewise, the transparent and consistent implementation of the EU's fiscal and economic governance framework over time and across countries remains essential to bolster the resilience of the euro area economy. Improving the functioning of Economic and Monetary Union remains a priority. The Governing Council urges specific and decisive steps to complete the banking union and the capital markets union."
Turkiye,2018-10-25,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the policy rate (one week repo auction rate) constant at 24 percent. Recently released data show that rebalancing trend in the economy has become more noticeable. External demand maintains its strength while slowdown in economic activity continues, partly due to tighter financial conditions. Recent developments regarding the inflation outlook point to significant risks to price stability. Price increases have shown a generalized pattern across subsectors, reflecting the movements in exchange rates. Although weaker domestic demand conditions will partially mitigate the deterioration in the inflation outlook, upside risks on the pricing behavior continue to prevail. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to maintain the tight monetary policy stance. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. Tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained decisively until inflation outlook displays a significant improvement. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior, lagged impact of recent monetary policy decisions, contribution of fiscal policy to rebalancing process, and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Ukraine,2018-10-25,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to keep its key policy rate at 18.0% per annum. The current and forecast monetary conditions are sufficiently tight to bring inflation to its medium-term target of 5% in 2020. In September 2018, consumer price inflation reached 8.9% yoy, having exceeded both the upper limit of the target range (6.5% Â± 2 pp set for the end of Q3 2018) and the July projections of the NBU (8.3%). The moderate drop in inflation compared with previous months was due to slower growth in food prices, driven by an increase in domestic and imported supply of food products, as well as lower global food prices. At the same time, the underlying inflationary pressure remains strong. This is reflected in the sustained high reading of core inflation (8.7% yoy in September), which is above the NBU's July projections. Domestic demand remaining high and further growth in production costs, including labor costs, put an upward pressure on prices.The hryvnia weakening against the US dollar in JulyAugust influenced prices of some goods, especially imported ones.The rapid growth in global crude oil prices seen in the past months passed through to fuel prices and contributed to higher cost of other goods and services.The above factors and the approaching presidential and parliamentary elections to take place next year affected the inflation expectations. In particular, expectations of households deteriorated. Businesses, banks, and financial analysts maintain high inflation expectations, at levels much above the NBU's inflation targets. Inflation will decline, although it will take longer than expected to meet the target. Having considered the above factors and the anticipated rise in administered prices, the NBU has revised its 2018 inflation forecast upwards, from 8.9% to 10.1%. The increase in consumer demand, robust wage growth, and the recent jump of crude oil prices will continue to impact consumer price inflation next year. This will keep inflation above the target range for longer than expected. Inflation is projected to decline to 6.3% as of the end of 2019. It will enter the target range in Q1 2020 and reach the medium-term target of 5.0% at the end of 2020. The slowdown in inflation will be mostly driven by the tight monetary conditions, which the NBU Board believes have formed as a result of the previous key policy rate hikes. Such conditions will ensure the balance between the need to reduce inflation and bring it to the target and the need to maintain the economic growth. At the same time, other factors will enhance the tight monetary policy stance. Banks are expected to continue raising interest rates on hryvnia deposits of households due to shrinking bank liquidity surplus and in response to the previous key policy rate hikes. This will incentivize Ukrainians to shift from spending towards more saving. Moreover, next year, labor migration from Ukraine will not put such a significant upward pressure on wages as in the previous two years. Price rises will also be contained by prudent fiscal policy and the moderate pace of imported inflation on the back of reasonably low exchange rate volatility. Among other things, exchange rate and inflation expectations are expected to benefit from positive signs that some progress has been achieved in ensuring cooperation with official lenders, in particular entering into a new arrangement with the IMF that will carry over for the next year. After speeding up in 2018, economic growth will slightly decelerate. The NBU has made no change to its economic growth projections for 20182020. As before, the central bank expects that economic growth will accelerate to 3.4% in the current year. The growth will be mainly propped up by private consumption, as household income increases further. The investment activity of companies will also remain rather buoyant. In 2019, real GDP growth will decelerate to 2.5%, due to a slowdown in the global economy, a fall in global commodity prices, tight fiscal policy resulting from the need to repay large volumes of public debt, as well as tight monetary conditions required to bring inflation back to its target. In 2020, economic growth will speed up to 2.9%. The growth will be fueled by a mostly gradual easing in monetary policy, which will become possible after inflation stabilizes at a level close to the target, as well as by the economy's greater investment attractiveness. External accounts will be in equilibrium in 2019  2020. The current account deficit will continue to hover between 2.5% and 3% of GDP, and will be offset by official financing and private capital inflows. The NBU's macroeconomic forecast is based on the assumption that Ukraine will continue to cooperate with the International Monetary Fund under a new Stand-By Arrangement. The new Stand-By Arrangement can definitely be regarded as a positive development for Ukraine. First, new loans from the IMF, and related financing from other Ukrainian partners, will boost the country's macrofinancial stability. Second, the new arrangement is an anchor for state policy, and will therefore lay the foundation for an improvement in expectations and Ukraine's access to the global capital markets. The NBU sees a further deterioration in inflation expectations and external conditions as the main risks that the said macroeconomic forecast may not materialize, including that inflation may not meet its 2020 target. First, inflation expectations could continue to rise, driven by a new political cycle. Second, external conditions could deteriorate. a more rapid slowdown in the global economy, including in the economies of Ukraine's main trading partnersdecline in global commodity pricesfurther energy price rise in the global marketscapital outflow from developing economies, including Ukraine, due to the central banks of leading countries tightening their monetary policies at a fast clip.Taking into account an updated macroeconomic forecast and the assessments of the above risks, the NBU Board believes that existing monetary conditions are tight enough to reduce inflation in the mid-term. In this light, the NBU Board has decided to keep its key policy rate at 18.0% per annum. However, the NBU will continue to keep a close watch on factors of underlying inflationary pressures, in particular on consumer demand, inflation expectations and any progress achieved in ensuring cooperation with international official lenders. If inflation pressures do not ease or build up, the central bank could raise the key policy rate again. The decision to keep the key policy rate at 18.0% has been approved by NBU Board Policy Rate Decision No.714-D, dated 25 October 2018. A new detailed macroeconomic forecast will be published in the central bank's Inflation Report on 1 November 2018. A summary of the discussion by Monetary Policy Committee members that preceded this decision will be published on 5 November 2018. The next meeting of the NBU Board on monetary policy issues will be held on 13 December 2018 as scheduled."
Colombia,2018-10-26,"The Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica, in its meeting today, decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 4.25%. For this decision, the Board mainly took into account the following aspects. Annual consumer inflation in September stood at 3.23%, and the average of core inflation indicators declined once more (3.28%). Inflation expectations recorded slight changes and remain above 3.0%. Analysts' expectations stand at 3.3%, and those embedded in public debt bonds at around 3.5%. The average growth of the country's trading partners has been somewhat weaker than estimated. The international price of oil and the terms of trade continue at levels that favor national income. Global risk aversion has increased. In this environment, the risk premia for emerging countries including Colombia have increased slightly, and their currencies have depreciated vis--vis the US dollar. Economic activity indicators for the third quarter suggest that the economy would have continued growing at a similar pace as in the first half of the year. The technical staff considers that the underuse of the productive capacity of the economy persists. For 2018, a current account deficit as a share of GDP similar to the one recorded in 2017 is forecast. Based on this information, the Board considered the following factors for its decision. Weakness of the economic activity and uncertainty over its pace of recovery. Observed inflation and its expected convergence to the 3.0% target. The effects of changing international financial conditions on the Colombian economy. In this environment, upon assessing the situation of the economy and balance of risks, the Board of Directors deemed appropriate to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 4.25%. The Board will continue to carefully monitor the behavior of inflation and the forecasts for economic activity and inflation in the country, as well as the international context. Finally, the Board reiterates that the monetary policy will depend on the availability of new information. The decision to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 4.25% was approved unanimously."
Russia,2018-10-26,"On 26 October 2018. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to keep the key rate at 7.50% per annum. The domestic financial market has stabilised in the time since the previous Board meeting. However, pro-inflationary risks remain elevated, especially over a short-term horizon. The uncertainty over future external conditions persists. The Bank of Russia forecasts annual inflation to be 5-5.5% in 2019 and return to 4% in 2020. The Bank of Russia will consider the necessity of further increases in the key rate, taking into account inflation and economic dynamics against the forecast, as well as risks posed by external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. Inflation movements. Annual inflation is on track to return to 4%, consistent with the Bank of Russia forecast. The annual rate of consumer price growth totalled 3.4% in September (3.5% according to the 22 October estimate). This September's upward movement of inflation was largely driven by annual food price growth accelerating to 2.5%. This was supported by changes in the balance of supply and demand in certain food markets. Also, prices are adjusting to the ruble exchange rate that has weakened since the beginning of the year. According to Bank of Russia estimates, most annual inflation indicators reflecting the most sustainable price movements are growing. The price expectations of businesses remain heightened, triggered by the weakening of the ruble which took place since the beginning of the year and the forthcoming VAT rise. Household inflation expectations, albeit lower in October, are markedly above the current year's average Q1-Q2 readings. Uncertainty persists over their subsequent movements. The domestic financial market saw a stabilisation in the second half of September and in early October, with exchange rate volatility declining. This was helped by the Bank of Russia's September decision to raise the key rate and suspend foreign currency purchases in the domestic market under the fiscal rule through the end of 2018, as well as a certain stabilisation in the external environment. The Bank of Russia forecast assumes consumer price growth rate at 3.84.2% by the end of 2018. One-off factors are expected to trigger a temporary acceleration in annual inflation, which will peak in the first six months of 2019 and run at 5.0-5.5% by the end of 2019. Quarterly year-on-year consumer price growth rate will draw close to 4% as early as the second half of 2019. Annual inflation will slow down to 4% in the first half of 2020 when the effects of the ruble's weakening and the VAT rise peter out. Monetary conditions. A certain tightening in monetary conditions is ongoing. In the time since the previous Board meeting. OFZ yields have moved lower but are still markedly above this year's Q1 readings. Under these conditions, a further rise in interest rates is progressing in the deposit and credit market. This enables positive real interest rates on deposits to sustain in positive territory, which will support the attractiveness of savings and balanced growth in consumption. Economic activity. The Russian economy is growing at rates close to its potential. This September saw a rise in industrial output; sectoral output trends remained mixed, however. Consumer demand expanded at moderate rates, mainly on the back of non-food sales. Bank of Russia estimates show that investment growth was continued in the third quarter. The Bank of Russia keeps unchanged its 2018 annual GDP growth forecast of 1.5-2%. The Bank of Russia's view of the Russian economy's mid-term growth prospects has also remained mainly unchanged. In 2019, the forthcoming VAT increase might have a slight constraining effect on business activity (mostly in the beginning of the year). The newly attracted budgetary funds will be used to boost government spending, including spending on investments, as early as 2019. As a result, according to the Bank of Russia forecast. GDP growth in 2019 will range between 1.2% and 1.7%. The following years might see higher growth rates as the planned structural measures are implemented. Inflation risks. The balance of risks remains skewed towards pro-inflationary risks, especially over a short-term horizon. The stabilisation in the domestic financial market comes with continuing uncertainty over future external conditions and their impact on financial asset prices. Further yield growth in advanced economies, capital outflow from emerging markets together with geopolitical factors might lead to the amplification of volatility in the financial markets, and affect exchange rate and inflation expectations. The Bank of Russia leaves mostly unchanged its estimates of risks associated with oil price volatility, wage movements and possible changes in consumer behaviour. These risks remain moderate. The Bank of Russia will consider the necessity of further increases in the key rate, taking into account inflation and economic dynamics against the forecast, as well as risks posed by external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next rate review meeting on 14 December 2018. The Board decision press release is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time. The reference to the Press Service is mandatory if you intend to use this material."
Brazil,2018-10-31,"The Copom unanimously decided to maintain the Selic rate at 6.50% p.a. The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario:. Recent data on economic activity continue to indicate recovery of the Brazilian economy, at a more gradual pace than envisaged early this year. The global outlook remains challenging, with risk appetite towards emerging economies at levels below those seen early this year. The main risks continue to be associated with normalization of interest rates in some advanced economies and with uncertainty regarding global trade. The Committee judges that various measures of underlying inflation are running at appropriate levels. This includes the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy. Inflation expectations for 2018, 2019 and 2020 collected by the Focus survey are around 4.4%, 4.2% and 4.0%, respectively. Expectations for 2021 remain around 3.9%; and. The Copom's inflation projections in the scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the Focus survey stand around 4.4% for 2018, 4.2% for 2019, and 3.7% for 2020. This scenario assumes a path for the Selic rate that ends 2018 at 6.5% p.a., increases to 8% p.a. over the course of 2019, and remains at that level until the end of 2020. In the scenario with a constant interest rate, at 6.50% p.a., and a constant exchange rate, at R$/US$ 3.70*, the projections for 2018, 2019, and 2020 stand around 4.4%, 4.2%, and 4.1%, respectively. The Committee emphasizes that risks around its baseline scenario remain in both directions, but with higher weight on the last two risks. On the one hand, the high level of economic slack may lead to a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory. On the other hand, frustration of expectations regarding the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy may affect risk premia and increase the path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy. This risk intensifies in case the global outlook for emerging economies deteriorates. The Committee judges that the degree of asymmetry in the balance of risks has diminished since its previous meeting. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the wide array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to maintain the Selic rate at 6.50% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation and the associated balance of risks and is consistent with convergence of inflation to target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, which includes 2019 and, with a smaller weight, 2020. The Copom emphasizes that the evolution of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy is essential to maintain low inflation in the medium and long run, for the reduction of its structural interest rate, and for sustainable economic recovery. The Committee stresses that the perception of continuation of the reform agenda affects current expectations and macroeconomic projections. The Copom judges that it should base its decisions on the evolution of inflation projections and expectations, of the balance of risks, and of economic activity. Shocks that produce relative price changes should only lead to a monetary policy response to their possible second-round effects (i.e., to the propagation to prices in the economy that are not directly affected by the shock). It is through such second-round effects that these shocks may affect inflation projections and expectations, and change the balance of risks. These effects may be mitigated by the level of economic slack and by inflation expectations anchored around the targets. Therefore, there is no mechanical relationship between recent shocks and the conduct of monetary policy. The Copom reiterates that economic conditions still prescribe stimulative monetary policy, i.e., interest rates below the structural level. This stimulus will begin to be removed gradually if the outlook for inflation at the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy and/or its balance of risks worsen. In the Copom's assessment, the evolution of the baseline scenario and of the balance of risks prescribes keeping the Selic rate at its current level. The Copom emphasizes that the next steps in the conduct of monetary policy will continue to depend on the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, and on inflation projections and expectations. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Ilan Goldfajn (Governor). Carlos Viana de Carvalho. Carolina de Assis Barros. MaurÃ­cio Costa de Moura. OtÃ¡vio Ribeiro Damaso. Paulo Sergio Neves de Souza. Reinaldo Le Grazie. Sidnei CorrÃªa Marques, and Tiago Couto Berriel. *Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average R$/US$ exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the Friday prior to the Copom meeting."
Czech Republic,2018-11-01,"At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank increased the two-week repo rate (2W repo rate) by 25 basis points to 1.75%. At the same time, it increased the Lombard rate to 2.75% and the discount rate to 0.75%. Five members voted in favour of this decision, one member voted for leaving interest rates unchanged and one member voted for raising them by 50 basis points.. The decision adopted by the Bank Board is underpinned by a new macroeconomic forecast of the Czech National Bank. Consistent with the forecast is a continued rise in interest rates towards their long-run neutral level. According to the external assumptions of the new forecast, the euro area economy will record ongoing growth, but its pace will continue to slow slightly. A weakening of the euro and a distinct rise in energy prices are reflected in rising producer and consumer prices. Euro area inflation will thus be just below 2% over the next two years. This will enable the European Central Bank to end its asset purchase programme at the end of this year. However, it has stated that it will not start increasing interest rates until quite some time later. The 3M EURIBOR is thus expected to remain negative until the end of next year. The oil price rose sharply recently but is expected to decline gradually in the quarters ahead. The market expects the euro to appreciate slightly against the dollar from its current weakened level. The overall inflation pressures in the domestic economy remain strong. This is due mainly to buoyant wage growth and continued growth of the real economy. At the same time, the inflationary effect of import prices was restored, reflecting growth in foreign prices as well as the weakened koruna. Inflation will increase further early next year. In the subsequent period, however, the inflation pressures will ease owing to growth in interest rates, renewed appreciation of the koruna and a gradual slowdown in wage growth. Inflation will approach the Czech National Bank's 2% target from above over the monetary policy horizon, i.e. in late 2019 and early 2020. It will then stay at the target during the rest of 2020. The growth of the Czech economy has slowed. However, it will stay above 3% on average this year and in the following two years. It will continue to be driven mainly by growth in household consumption, reflecting buoyant growth in household income and optimistic expectations. Rising demand and increasingly distinct labour shortages are motivating domestic firms to invest, which is helping to improve labour productivity. Public investment expenditure will also grow further as a result of higher drawdown of EU funds. Fiscal policy will also contribute to domestic demand growth this year and the next via a significant rise in current expenditure. The continued economic growth is reflected in a tight labour market. The unemployment rate is at a record low and there is little room for it to decrease further. This will lead to slower employment growth. Wage growth will remain high, but will moderate gradually. The exchange rate forecast for the end of this year reflects persisting negative sentiment on global foreign exchange markets. This global effect is expected to partly persist in the next two quarters. However, the koruna will start appreciating again next year, driven by a distinctly positive interest rate differential vis-Ã -vis the euro area and continued real convergence of the Czech economy. In the following period, the appreciation will slow in connection with the start of monetary policy normalisation by the European Central Bank. Consistent with the forecast is a continued rise in interest rates towards their long-run neutral level. The rate increase at the close of this year is mainly a response to depreciation of the koruna, which leads to a renewed inflationary effect of import prices. Pronounced inflation pressures from the domestic economy act in the same direction. The subsequent broad stability of rates during next year is a result of the forecasted appreciation of the koruna amid continuing very easy monetary policy in the euro area. A tightening of policy by the European Central Bank will then create room for further gradual growth in domestic rates in 2020. The overall story of the forecast is essentially unchanged. The biggest change from the previous forecast is later renewal of the appreciation of the koruna. Coupled with higher foreign producer price inflation, it leads to higher import price inflation and subsequently also higher headline inflation. The headline inflation forecast has therefore shifted slightly upwards at the monetary policy horizon. Together with other factors, the weaker koruna leads to a higher interest rate path next year. The prediction for domestic economic growth is virtually unchanged."
Romania,2018-11-06,"In its meeting of 6 November 2018, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided:. The annual CPI inflation rate dropped to 5.03 percent in September 2018 from 5.06 percent in August, standing slightly above the projected level following faster annual growth in vegetables prices. By contrast, the other consumer basket components posted lower annual dynamics. The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate (which excludes from the CPI inflation a number of prices on which monetary policy has limited or no influence, i.e. administered prices, volatile prices, and tobacco product and alcoholic beverage prices) continued to fall, down to about 2.7 percent in September from 2.85 percent in August. The decline owed mainly to the processed food segment, under the influence of movements in international prices of some agri-food items. The average annual CPI inflation rate reached 4.5 percent in September versus 4.2 percent in August; calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, the average annual rate followed a similar path, rising to 3.8 percent from 3.5 percent in the previous month. New data on economic growth reconfirm its marginal step-up to 4.1 percent year on year in 2018 Q2 from 4.0 percent in the previous quarter. On the demand side, the composition of GDP drivers saw a significant change, consisting mainly in an upward revision to 3.7 percentage points of the contribution of the change in inventories. Compared to 2018 Q1, household consumption recorded a slower annual pace of increase, whereas the path of gross fixed capital formation reversed, taking 1.1 percentage points off the real GDP advance. The contribution of net exports was further negative, but improved slightly against the previous data, as the growth rate of exports gained stronger momentum than that of imports. The latest statistical data show mixed developments July through August compared to 2018 Q2: a faster annual increase in industrial output and slower growth in trade and services, while the volume of construction works declined in annual terms, particularly on account of the residential buildings segment, which was also affected by a strong base effect. At the same time, after having relatively stalled in 2018 Q2, the annual growth of unit wage costs in the industrial sector decelerated in the first two months of Q3, amid improved dynamics of labour productivity. The relevant interbank money market rates saw their positive spread vis-Ã -vis the monetary policy rate widen slightly during October, while the EUR/RON exchange rate remained relatively stable. The annual growth rate of credit to the private sector moderated slightly in September (to 6.3 percent, from 6.6 percent in August), as a result of slower dynamics of the leu-denominated component, on the back of housing loans and credit to non-financial corporations; conversely, the annual pace of increase of domestic currency-denominated consumer loans regained momentum to reach 13.3 percent. The share of the leu-denominated component in total private sector credit widened to 65.4 percent in September (from a 35.6 percent low in May 2012). In today's meeting, the NBR Board examined and approved the November 2018 Inflation Report, which incorporates the most recent data and information available. The new scenario of the projection reconfirms the prospects for the annual inflation rate to decline further towards the upper bound of the variation band of the target in December 2018, before dropping and remaining in the upper half of the band until the end of the forecast horizon. The uncertainties and risks surrounding the inflation outlook stem mainly from developments in fuel prices worldwide, in administered prices (natural gas and electricity), in the prices of food items and tobacco products, as well as from labour market conditions and the fiscal and income policy stance. Also relevant are the pace of euro area and global economic growth amid protectionist trends and Brexit-related uncertainties, as well as the monetary policy stance of the ECB and of central banks in the region. Based on the currently available data, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided to keep unchanged the monetary policy rate at 2.50 percent per annum; moreover, the NBR Board decided to leave unchanged the deposit facility rate at 1.50 percent per annum and the lending (Lombard) facility rate at 3.50 percent per annum. In addition, the NBR Board decided to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board decisions aim to ensure and preserve price stability over the medium term in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth and amid safeguarding financial stability. The NBR Board underlines that the balanced macroeconomic policy mix and the implementation of structural reforms designed to foster the growth potential over the long term are of the essence in preserving a stable macroeconomic framework and strengthening the capacity of the Romanian economy to withstand potential adverse developments. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be presented to the public in a press conference on 8 November 2018, at 11:00 a.m. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR's website on 13 November 2018, at 3:00 p.m. The next monetary policy meeting of the NBR Board is scheduled for 8 January 2019."
Poland,2018-11-07,"Warsaw, 7 November 2018 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 6-7 November 2018 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: reference rate at 1.50%; lombard rate at 2.50%; deposit rate at 0.50%; rediscount rate at 1.75%. Global economic conditions remain favourable, although signs of a weakening have appeared in some economies. In the euro area. GDP growth declined in 2018 Q3, and some indicators of economic conditions deteriorated. At the same time, in the United States growth has picked up slightly, which confirms that economic conditions in this country are still very strong. In turn, in China activity growth is gradually slowing down. A rise in uncertainty about the global economic outlook contributed to some weakening of sentiment in the international financial markets. Concurrently, energy commodity prices have decreased slightly, following their previous sharp rise. The relatively high level of these prices continues to add to inflation in many countries. At the same time, core inflation in the external environment of the Polish economy, including the euro area, remains moderate. The European Central Bank keeps interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero. Alongside that, the ECB continues to purchase financial assets, although it has reduced the scale of the purchases and has announced their termination by the end of the year. The Federal Reserve continues to gradually tighten monetary policy. In Poland, incoming data point to economic conditions remaining strong, although in 2018 Q3 GDP growth was probably lower than in the first half of the year. GDP growth is still driven by rising consumption, albeit at a slightly lower rate than in the previous quarters, that is fuelled by increasing employment and wages as well as very high consumer sentiment. This is accompanied by a rise in investment. Notwithstanding relatively high economic growth and wages rising faster than in the previous year, consumer price growth remains moderate. At the same time, inflation net of food and energy prices continues to be low. The Council became acquainted with the results of the November projection of inflation and GDP, prepared under the assumption of unchanged NBP interest rates. In line with the November projection based on the NECMOD model, there is a 50-percent probability that annual price growth will be in the range of 1.7-1.9% in 2018 (against 1.5- 2.1% in the July 2018 projection), 2.6-3.9% in 2019 (compared to 1.9-3.5%) and 1.9-3.9% in 2020 (compared to 1.7-3.9%). At the same time, annual GDP growth  according to this projection  will be with a 50-percent probability in the range of 4.4-5.2% in 2018 (against 4.0-5.2% in the July 2018 projection), 2.7-4.4% in 2019 (compared to 2.8-4.7%) and 2.3-4.2% in 2020 (compared to 2.4-4.3%). In the Council's assessment, current information and the results of the projection point to a relatively favourable outlook for economic conditions in Poland, although a gradual slowing in GDP growth is expected in the years ahead. In line with the projection, inflation in 2019 will probably exceed 2.5%, boosted, among others, by a rise in energy prices remaining beyond the impact of monetary policy, but will remain within a band for deviations from the target. In the medium term, in turn, the expected slowdown in economic growth will have a dampening effect on inflation. In effect, in the monetary policy transmission horizon inflation will remain close to the target. The Council judges that the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability. The Council adopted the Inflation Report  November 2018."
Malaysia,2018-11-08,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.25 percent. The global economic expansion continues, although with signs of moderating momentum. In the advanced economies, growth will continue to be mainly driven by positive labour market conditions and policy support. Growth in Asia will be supported by domestic activity amid weaker external demand. Risks to the global growth outlook remain tilted to the downside, with trade tensions continuing to be a key source of downside risk. Continued volatility in international financial markets and monetary policy normalisation in some advanced economies could lead to further capital outflows and financial market adjustments in emerging economies. For the Malaysian economy, latest indicators point towards continued expansion in private sector activity. Private consumption will remain the main driver of growth, supported by conducive labour market conditions. Investment activity is projected to be sustained by continued capacity expansion in key sectors, driven by positive demand and efforts to enhance automation. Public sector spending, however, is likely to weigh on growth, amid continued reprioritisation of expenditure by the Government. The recent announcements by the Government have provided more clarity on fiscal and economic development policies. On the external front, exports are projected to provide an additional lift to growth, albeit to a lesser extent, due to moderating global growth momentum. The domestic economy continues to face downside risks stemming from any further escalation in trade tensions and prolonged weakness in the mining and agriculture sectors. Nevertheless, on balance, the Malaysian economy is expected to remain on a steady growth path in 2018 and 2019. The annual average headline inflation will be low in 2018. Moving into 2019, headline inflation is projected to increase primarily due to higher projected global oil prices and the floating of domestic fuel prices. While the impact of the consumption tax policy will contribute to higher headline inflation in 2019, it will lapse towards the end of 2019. Underlying inflation is expected to remain contained in the absence of strong demand pressures. In line with regional economies, the domestic financial markets continue to experience non-resident portfolio outflows due to global developments. Nevertheless, the financial markets remain orderly with domestic monetary and financial conditions supportive of economic growth. The financial sector is sound, with financial institutions operating with strong capital and liquidity buffers. Importantly, the domestic economy maintains its underlying fundamental strength, with steady economic growth, low unemployment and surplus in the current account of the balance of payments. Bank Negara Malaysia's monetary operations will continue to ensure sufficient liquidity to support the orderly functioning of money and foreign exchange markets and intermediation activity. At the current level of the OPR, the degree of monetary accommodativeness is consistent with the intended policy stance. The MPC will continue to monitor and assess the balance of risks surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation. The meeting also approved the schedule of MPC meetings for 2019. In accordance with the Central Bank of Malaysia Act 2009, the MPC will convene six times during the year. The meetings will be held over two days, with the Monetary Policy Statement released at 3 p.m. on the second day of the MPC meeting. 23 and 24 January 2019 (Wednesday and Thursday). 4 and 5 March 2019 (Monday and Tuesday). 6 and 7 May 2019 (Monday and Tuesday). 8 and 9 July 2019 (Monday and Tuesday). 11 and 12 September 2019 (Wednesday and Thursday). 4 and 5 November 2019 (Monday and Tuesday).

United States,2018-11-08,"EST November 8, 2018 Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a strong rate. Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has declined. Household spending has continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment has moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remain near 2 percent. Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term. Risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2 to 2-1/4 percent. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Jerome H Powell. Chairman; (more) For release at 2 p.m. EST November 8, 2018 - 2 - John C Williams.

Armenia,2018-11-13,"PRESS RELEASE 13.11.2018 In the November 13, 2018 meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) decided to leave the refinancing rate unchanged: at the level of 6.0%. There was 0.1% inflation in October of 2018, in which circumstance the 12-month inflation rate has reduced to 2.8% at the end of the month. At the same time, the core inflation rate has also slowed down slightly. The Board of the CBA estimates that in the upcoming months the inflation environment will be stable and the 12-month inflation rate will be running within the lower part of the confidence band. Global economic growth trends are persisting, under which the central banks of leading countries gradually tighten their monetary policy conditions. In the meanwhile, the inflation environment in the international markets of basic commodities has somewhat weakened, and the Board of the CBA considers that inflationary pressures from the external sector are not anticipated in the coming months. The Board notes that certain weakening of economic activity was observable over the third quarter of 2018 mainly due to contracted output in agricultural production and decelerated growth rates in the construction sector. The estimation is that the current fiscal policy continues to have a contractionary effect on domestic demand. Moreover, the pace of fiscal policy implementation in 2019 may also leave a significant impact on the developments in domestic demand. Taking into account the aforementioned developments as well as sharing the same opinion that the monetary conditions at present are rather expansionary, the Board of the CBA finds it appropriate to maintain the refinancing rate at the current level. At the same time, in view of the anticipated macroeconomic developments, keeping the monetary environment expansionary for a longer period of time is essential for fulfillment of the inflation target, on condition that it gradually eliminates in the medium run. As a result, the expectation is that inflation will still be running within the lower part of the confidence band, stabilizing around the 4% value at the end of forecast horizon. Risks to fulfillment of the inflation target at the end of forecast horizon are assessed by the Board to be downside, due to external and internal factors. However, should there be risks to the inflation and economic growth outlook deviating from the prediction scenario, the CBA will adjust the monetary policy directions accordingly, while ensuring the price stability. Detailed information that underlies the decision on setting of the interest rate will be available in Inflation Report (Monetary Policy Program, 4th quarter 2018) to be published by November 27, 2018.

Philippines,2018-11-14,"At its meeting on monetary policy today, the Monetary Board decided to raise the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) facility by 25 basis points to 4.75 percent, effective Friday, 16 November 2018. The interest rates on the overnight lending and deposit facilities were raised accordingly. While the latest inflation forecasts show inflation settling within the target band of 3.0 percent Â± 1.0 percentage point in both 2019 and 2020, after considering the impact of non-monetary measures, including the rice tariffication bill and the suspension of the oil excise tax, the Monetary Board decided to raise the policy rate by 25 basis points given the upside risks to the inflation outlook and given that inflation expectations have remained elevated as supply-side and possible wage pressures continue to drive price developments. At the same time, the Monetary Board believes that prospects for the domestic economy remain generally favorable and allow some scope for a measured adjustment in the policy rate to rein in inflation expectations and preempt further second-round effects. The Monetary Board deemed it necessary to respond with proactive policy action to help temper the risks to the inflation outlook, including those emanating from the continued uncertainty in the external environment amid tighter global financial conditions and trade tensions among major economies. Nevertheless, the Monetary Board continues to emphasize the need for follow-through non-monetary measures to mitigate the impact of supply-side factors on inflation. The BSP remains prepared to take appropriate policy actions as needed to ensure the achievement of its price and financial stability objectives."
Thailand,2018-11-14,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 7/2018 Mr. Titanun Mallikamas. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 14 November 2018 as follows. The Committee voted 4 to 3 to maintain the policy rate at 150 percent. Three members voted to raise the policy rate by 025 percentage point from 150 to 175 percent. In deliberating their policy decision, the Committee assessed that the Thai economy continued to gain traction despite signs of moderating external demand. Headline and core inflation were projected to increase broadly in line with the previous assessment. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative and conducive to economic growth. Financial stability remained sound overall, but it was deemed necessary to monitor risks that might lead to the build-up of vulnerabilities in the financial system in the future, especially those resulting from the prolonged period of monetary accommodation. The Committee viewed that the current accommodative monetary policy stance remained conducive to the continuation of economic growth and was appropriate given the inflation target. Thus most members decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at this meeting. Nevertheless three members viewed that the continued economic expansion was sufficiently robust and that prolonged monetary accommodation induced households and businesses to underestimate potential changes in financial conditions, and thus voted to raise the policy rate at this meeting in order to curb financial stability risks that could affect the sustainability of economic growth over the longer term and to start building policy space. The Thai economy as a whole continued to gain traction despite some signs of slowing export growth owing in part to trade protectionism measures between the US and China, a slowdown of the electronics cycles, and trading partner countries' weather conditions which were temporary factors. Meanwhile tourism exhibited a slower growth especially due to a declined number of Chinese tourists. However domestic demand momentum continued to expand. Private consumption was expected to expand on the back of improvements in income and employment in non-agricultural sector but was restrained by elevated household debt. Private investment was projected to continue expanding owing to the relocation of production base to Thailand and public-private partnership projects for infrastructure investment. Public expenditure would grow at a slower pace than previously assessed due to delayed investment by some state-owned enterprises. Overall the Thai economy would continue to expand but would be subject to increasing downside risks from trade protectionism measures between the US and China, which could have larger impacts than expected, and from geopolitical risks. The annual average of headline inflation was expected to rise slowly in line with the previous assessment. However downside risks increased due to fluctuations in energy and fresh food prices. Core inflation was projected to rise broadly in line with the previous assessment 2 given the gradually rising demand-pull inflationary pressures. The Committee viewed that structural changes contributed to more persistent inflation than in the past. Such changes included the expansion of e-commerce, rising price competition, and technological development which reduced costs of production. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative and conducive to economic growth with ample liquidity in the financial system. Short-term government bond yields increased slightly. Real interest rates remained low, allowing financing by the private sector to continue expanding as reflected in both business and consumer loan growth. With regard to exchange rates, the baht depreciated against the US dollar, in the same direction with regional currencies, due to concerns over growing risks to the global economy. Looking ahead, the baht would likely remain volatile and thus the Committee would continue to closely monitor exchange rate developments as well as impacts on the economy. Financial stability remained sound overall but there remained a need to monitor risks that might pose vulnerabilities to financial stability in the future, especially the search-for-yield behavior in the prolonged low interest rate environment that might lead to underpricing of risks. The competition in the mortgage loan market, which led to looser credit standards, was addressed to a certain extent by the revision in macroprudential measure on mortgage loans. In addition, the Committee deemed it necessary to monitor further household debt accumulation and debt serviceability of SMEs especially those affected by changes in structural factors and business models. Looking ahead, the Thai economy as a whole was projected to continue to gain traction despite moderating external demand and potential risks from larger-than-expected impacts of trade protectionism measures between the US and China. Furthermore there remained a need to monitor developments of inflation and financial stability risks going forward. The Committee viewed that monetary policy should remain accommodative, although the need for currently accommodative monetary policy would be gradually reduced."
Egypt,2018-11-15,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release November 15, 2018 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 1675 percent, 1775 percent, and 1725 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 1725 percen. Headline inflation rose to 160 percent and 177 percent in September and October 2018, respectively, affected by inflation of select fresh vegetable. This comes after fiscal consolidation measures led headline inflation to rise from the twenty-five-month low of 114 percent in May 201. Nevertheless excluding regulated and volatile food items, core inflation continued to decline to average 87 percent between July and October 201. Meanwhile annual real GDP growth stabilized at 54 percent in 2018 Q2, after rising for six consecutive quarter. The positive contribution of private domestic demand and net exports declined, while that of public domestic demand increase. Moreover the pass-through to domestic inflation from global financial market developments remained contained due to domestic policy measures that support improving macroeconomic fundamental. International oil prices recently declined yet remain subject to volatility due to potential supply-side factor. As headline inflation for October 2018 has been affected by a higher-than-forecasted increase in the prices of fresh vegetables, there is an upside risk of a slight deviation from the inflation target announced in May 2017, which records 13 percent (Â±3 percent) on average during 2018 Q. However monetary policy tools are utilized to anchor inflation expectations, contain demand-side pressures and second-round effects of supply shock. Given the contained underlying inflationary pressures and the transitory nature of the supply shock related to select fresh vegetables, the MPC decided to keep key policy rates unchange. Current policy rates remain in line with achieving single digit inflation as soon as the effects of fiscal consolidation measures dissipat. The Ministry of Finance is targeting to achieve a primary surplus of 20 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2018/19, up from a preliminary 02 percent in the previous yea. The MPC closely monitors all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust its stance to achieve its mandate of price stability over the medium ter.

Mexico,2018-11-15,"Banco de Mexico's Governing Board decided to raise the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to 8.00%. During the third quarter of 2018, the world economy continued to grow, albeit at a more moderate pace, with an increased divergence among different regions and countries. In contrast with the Eurozone. Japan and the U.K., which have grown below expectations, economic activity in the U.S. grew at a relatively high rate, partly in response to the fiscal stimulus implemented. Under such an environment, global inflation remained on an upward trend; nevertheless, such trend has moderated with significant differences among countries. International oil prices have fallen considerably, due basically to supply factors. As expected, in November the Federal Reserve left the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged and reiterated its forecast of increasing it gradually. Forecasts for world economic growth for 2018 and 2019 have been revised slightly downwards due to the intensification of international trade disputes and to a further tightening of financial conditions, while considerable risks in the short and medium run have increased. In this environment, in recent weeks, international financial markets underwent episodes of volatility, and the prices of emerging economies' assets posted negative results, differentiated according to each country's macroeconomic fundamentals and idiosyncratic factors. Since the last monetary policy decision, the Mexican peso depreciated significantly. In addition to the aforementioned external factors, the peso exchange rate was also affected by the announcement about the intention of cancelling the New Mexico City International Airport project and, in general, by markets' concerns regarding both the incoming administration's policies and some legislative initiatives. This led several rating agencies to downgrade the country's sovereign risk outlook from stable to negative. In turn, sovereign risk premia and medium- and long-term interest rates in Mexico registered sizable increases, way above those observed in other emerging market economies, reflecting the large increase in the different risk premia investors demand for holding domestic assets. This environment entails significant medium and long term risks that could affect the country's macroeconomic conditions, its growth potential and the economy's price formation process. For this reason, it is particularly relevant that, in addition to following a prudent and robust monetary policy, measures to foster greater productivity and an environment of confidence and certainty for investors are adopted, public finances are consolidated sustainably, and both transparency and accountability of public policies are strengthened. The latest information suggests that during the third quarter of 2018, economic activity in Mexico expanded, after having contracted during the second quarter. Slack conditions in the economy are estimated to have tightened slightly with respect to the previous quarter, although they remain less tight than those observed at the beginning of the year. From a cyclical perspective, the balance of risks for growth continues biased to the downside and has deteriorated at the margin, due mainly to both the complex external environment faced by the Mexican economy and the abovementioned domestic uncertainty factors. 1 In October, inflation registered 4.90%, reflecting the increments in energy prices that have prevailed since June, mainly those of gasoline and LP gas. Such price increases stem from the dynamics of their international references and, in the case of gasolines, from the reduction in fiscal incentives associated with their domestic prices. This has contributed to keep non-core inflation high for a long period. Moreover, the referred shocks have affected core inflation due to their indirect effects on production costs. Other factors have also contributed to the persistence exhibited by core inflation. In particular, the core subindex has exhibited a high degree of resistance to decline, even increasing from 3.67% in September to 3.73% in October. In this context, expectations for headline inflation for the end of 2018 drawn from surveys have been revised from 4.50% to 4.61% during the same period, while those for the end of 2019 continue at around the same level. Expectations for core inflation for the end of 2018 increased from 3.53 to 3.59% during the same months and those for the end of 2019 remained practically unchanged. Expectations for headline inflation for the medium and long terms remain around 3.50%. On the other hand, information from market instruments suggests a considerable increase in inflationary risks in the medium- and long-terms. As already highlighted, inflation faces significant risks related to the possible adoption of policies that could structurally affect the economy's price formation process. The most relevant is that the peso exchange rate may continue to be subject to pressures stemming from higher external interest rates and other external and domestic factors. Should the economy require real exchange rate adjustments as well as higher medium- and long-term interest rates. Banco de Mexico will contribute to adjust the economy in an orderly manner, trying to avoid second-round effects on the economy's price formation process. On the other hand, inflation might be affected if pressures on energy prices persist or agricultural product prices increase; if there is an escalation of protectionist and compensatory measures worldwide; and, if there is a deterioration of public finances. Given the magnitude of the observed shocks and the level of inflation, there is also the risk of second-round effects affecting the price formation process. Additionally, if wage negotiations are not consistent with productivity gains, pressures on the economy could arise. Considering all of the above, the balance of risks to the forecasted trajectory of inflation has deteriorated and exhibits a significant upward bias, in an environment of high uncertainty. To guide its monetary policy actions. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board follows closely the development of inflation vis-Ã -vis its anticipated trajectory, taking into account the monetary policy stance adopted and the time frame in which monetary policy operates, as well as available information on all inflation determinants and on medium- and long-term inflation expectations, including the balance of risks for such factors. Monetary policy must also respond prudently if for any reason the uncertainty faced by the Mexican economy increases considerably. In this context, and considering that the balance of risks for inflation is biased upwards and that it has deteriorated significantly. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board has decided by majority to raise the target for the overnight interbank interest by 25 basis points to 8.00%. One member voted for increasing the rate by 50 basis points. Considering the challenges that have been faced to consolidate a low and stable inflation, as well as the risks that the economy's price formation process is subject to, the Governing Board will take the necessary actions, specifically, maintaining or possibly strengthening the current monetary policy stance, so that headline inflation converges to Banco de Mexico's target within monetary policy's period of influence. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board will maintain a prudent monetary policy stance and, under the current environment of uncertainty, will follow closely the potential pass-through of exchange rate fluctuations to prices, the monetary policy stance relative to that of the U.S. under an adverse external environment, and the conditions of slack in the Mexican economy. In the presence and possible persistence of factors that, by their nature, involve risks to both inflation and inflation expectations, monetary policy will be adjusted in a timely and robust manner to achieve the convergence of inflation to its 3% target and to strengthen the anchoring of medium- and long-term inflation expectations so that they attain such target."
Peru,2018-11-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR NOVEMBER 2018 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 2.75% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 2.75 percent. This decision takes into account the following factors: In October, the YoY rate of inflation and the indicators of trend inflation showed levels within the inflation target range; The expected YoY rate of inflation remained at 2.4 percent in October; Some indicators of economic activity show temporary signs of lower dynamism in the third quarter and economic activity remains below its potential level of growth, and Greater risk and increased financial volatility, both associated with recent commercial tensions and with uncertainty in financial markets, could affect global economic activity. The YoY inflation rate is projected to remain within the target range and around 2.0 percent. The Board considers that it is appropriate to maintain an expansionary policy stance while inflation expectations are anchored in a context in which the level of economic activity is below its potential level of growth. Recent indicators of inflation and activity reflect the following: Inflation in October showed a rate of 0.08 percent, as a result of which the YoY inflation rate rose from 1.3 percent in September to 1.8 percent in October 2018. Moreover, inflation without food and energy recorded a rate of 0.06 percent, as a result of which the YoY rate remained at 2.1 percent. Most indicators of business expectations remained on the optimistic side in October. Furthermore, indicators of economic activity showed a recovery in October. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 1.50 percent. Currency and security direct repos and rediscount operations: 3.30 percent for the first 10 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 10 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 3.30 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for December on its Meeting of December 13, 2018."
Hungary,2018-11-20,"At its meeting on 20 November 2018, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 21 November 2018:. In the Council's assessment, in parallel with the pick-up in domestic demand Hungarian economic output is close to its potential level. Growth of the Hungarian economy will pick up further in 2018, then, if the assumptions of the current projection hold, it will slow down gradually from 2019. The inflation target is still expected to be achieved in a sustainable manner from mid-2019. The Magyar Nemzeti Bank's (MNB) single anchor is inflation. Under the flexible inflation targeting regime, the Monetary Council takes account of all factors influencing inflation developments on the five to eight-quarter horizon of monetary policy. These may include developments in commodity prices, changes in the external inflation environment, labour market conditions, the position of the real economy, developments in the exchange rate and credit market conditions. By taking into account all these factors, the Bank is able to assess the likely magnitude and persistence of future price changes, which in turn determine the monetary policy response. In October 2018, inflation rose to 3.8 percent and core inflation to 2.6 percent. Primarily the sharp rise in volatile items, particularly fuel and unprocessed food prices, moreover the faster-than-expected pass-through of the increase in excise taxes on tobacco products were the main factors contributing to the pick-up in inflation during the autumn months. In October, the measures of underlying inflation rose, mainly reflecting an increase in tradables prices. Difference between the consumer price index and the measures of underlying inflation remained significant. Inflationary pressures from wages continued to be moderate. Oil prices have fallen since the previous interest rate decision. According to the European Central Bank's (ECB) projection, underlying inflation will continue to be moderate in the euro area in the coming years as well. Inflation is expected to decrease but remain slightly above 3 percent in the final two months of the year. Difference between the inflation rate and the measures of underlying inflation will narrow towards the end of the year. Inflation is expected to decrease in the coming months due to the fall in fuel prices, while the measures of underlying inflation are likely to rise. Inflation expectations remain anchored at low levels. Rising consumption according to the September projection leads to a gradual increase in underlying inflation. This will ensure that inflation meets the 3 percent target in a sustainable structure from mid-2019. According to preliminary data, the Hungarian economy grew strongly, by 4.8 percent in the third quarter of 2018 relative to a year earlier. The unemployment rate stayed close to its historically low level. Lending to the corporate and household sectors continued to expand in September; however, the proportion of long-term, fixed-rate lending to the corporate sector continues to be low. Looking ahead, economic growth is expected to continue across a broad range of sectors. The general strengthening of domestic demand will continue to play a central role in economic output developments. In the Council's assessment. GDP growth will pick up and stand at 4.4 percent in 2018, then, if the assumptions of the current projection hold, it will slow down gradually from 2019. Meanwhile, the country's current account balance is expected to remain in positive territory over the longer term as well. Sentiment in international financial markets has been volatile in the period since the Council's previous interest rate decision. News about international trade policies. Italy's government budget and the slowdown in global economic growth were the main factors influencing investors' appetite for risk. The current volatile international environment continues to suggest a more cautious approach. The Bank assesses these developments in light of their relevance to its primary objective, i.e. the sustainable achievement of the inflation target, focusing on their persistence. According to market expectations monetary conditions in the euro area remain loose. The ECB's decisions may have a significant influence on the Magyar Nemzeti Bank's monetary policy. The Bank's primary objective is to achieve the inflation target in a sustainable manner. For this reason, in the Council's assessment, maintaining the loose monetary conditions is necessary. Consistent with the practice of leading central banks, the MNB is also prepared for the gradual and cautious normalisation of monetary policy. As part of the instrument strategy presented in September, the Monetary Council will phase out the three-month deposit facility by the end of 2018. In the future, required reserves will be the main policy instrument. Looking forward, the Bank will adjust monetary conditions necessary to achieve the inflation target in a sustainable manner by creating an optimal combination of two of its instruments: the stock of swap instruments providing forint liquidity and the interest rate corridor. As part of the fine-tuning of the unconventional policy instruments affecting long-term yields, mortgage bond purchases in the secondary market ended, consistent with the Council's September decision. In addition, the mortgage bond purchase programme in the primary market will be completed and the monetary policy IRS instrument will be phased out by the end of 2018. Furthermore, the Monetary Council will launch the Funding for Growth Scheme Fix at the beginning of 2019. The MNB will sterilise the liquidity provided under this programme using a preferential deposit facility bearing interest at the central bank base rate. In order to maintain the loose monetary conditions, the Monetary Council held the base rate, the overnight collateralised lending rate and the one-week collateralised lending rate at 0.9 percent and the overnight deposit rate at -0.15 percent. In addition, in September the Council left the average amount of liquidity to be crowded-out for the fourth quarter of 2018 unchanged, at least at HUF 400-600 billion. On the next occasion, in December 2018, the Council will decide on the amount of liquidity to be crowded out and will take this into account in setting the stock of central bank swap instruments. The Council is prepared for the gradual and cautious normalisation of monetary policy, which will start depending on the outlook for inflation. The inflation target is still expected to be achieved in a sustainable manner from mid-2019. To ensure this, in the Council's assessment, maintaining the current level of the base rate and the loose monetary conditions is necessary."
Nigeria,2018-11-22,"CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO. 121 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING OF WEDNESDAY 21ST AND THURSDAY 22ND NOVEMBER, 2018 Background The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on the 21st and 22nd of November, 2018, amidst a resurgence of global inflationary pressures, increased fragilities in the global financial markets, weakening crude oil prices, continuous capital flow reversal and moderate currency depreciations, especially in the emerging markets as well as a strengthening US dollar and subdued global economic growth outlook. The Committee appraised recent developments in the global and domestic macroeconomic and financial environments, as well as the economic outlook for the first half of 2019. In attendance were eleven (11) members of the Committee. Global Economic Developments The Committee noted the contraction in global output, underpinned largely by escalating trade tensions resulting in widespread uncertainty and waning investor confidence. Consequently global growth in 2018 has been downgraded to 37 per cent from the earlier projection of 39 per cent. Growth softened in major advanced economies in the third quarter of 2018. In the Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs), growth remained divergent, reflecting a combination of country-specific factors. Thus growth in the advanced economies is expected to remain at 24 per cent in 2018, supported by strong output growth in the US projected at 29 1 per cent. The US. expansionary fiscal stance, strong wage growth and continued inflow of capital into US. dollar denominated assets, are expected to provide the impetus for growth. In the United Kingdom, growth remained weak, hampered by uncertainties around Brexit negotiations. Growth in the Euro Area, projected at 20 per cent, appears to be subdued by low domestic aggregate demand amidst relatively high unemployment and reduced global trade. In the Emerging Markets and Developing Economies, growth was revised downwards to 47 per cent from the earlier projection of 49 per cent, largely in anticipation of a slowdown in China as the country is confronted with an adverse external trade environment. Overall the downside risks to global economic activity remained: elevated financial fragilities and policy uncertainties, the gradual erosion of rule-based multilateral trading system, tighter financial conditions with latent disruptive portfolio adjustments, increased capital flow reversals with potentials for heightened exchange rate depreciation and some volatility, fiscal fragilities and increased debt burden, geo-political tensions and increasingly depressed aggregate demand in some countries. These factors will continue to shape developments for the rest of 2018 and into 2019. The MPC also noted that monetary policy in most advanced economies, particularly the US, continued on a path of normalisation in view of strong wage growth and declining unemployment. The Bank of England hiked its policy rate in August 2018, while the European Central Bank (ECB) has given guidance to terminate its asset purchase programme in December 2018. The Committee was concerned that these developments will in the medium term, accentuate capital flow reversals from emerging and developing economies, including Nigeria. Domestic Output Developments The Committee noted the positive outlook for output growth, evidenced by the Manufacturing and Non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers Indexes (PMI), which stood at 568 and 570 index points, respectively, in October 2 2018, indicating expansion for the 19th and 18th consecutive months. This was attributed to the stability in the foreign exchange market, implementation of the 2018 capital budget and the on-going intervention of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in the real sector of the economy. However the recent incidence of flooding across the country and the impact of herdsmen attack on farming communities could affect output growth for the rest of the year. Overall the Committee believes that, even though output recovery remains fragile, the effective implementation of the 2018 capital budget, relative improvements in power supply, progress with counter-insurgency in the North- East and sustained intervention by the CBN in the real sector, will improve the investment climate and reduce unemployment. Consequently the MPC reaffirmed its support for all initiatives designed to stimulate domestic output growth. Developments in Money and Prices The Committee noted that broad money (M2) grew by 652 per cent in October 2018 over its level at the end-December 2017; and annualised to a growth rate of 782 per cent, which was below the provisional benchmark of 1048 per cent for 2018. The growth in M2 was largely due to the significant growth in Net Foreign Assets (NFA) which grew by 2071 per cent in October 2018, annualised to 2485 per cent which is above the 2018 provisional growth benchmark of 1450 per cent. Credit to Government and Net Domestic Credit (NDC) expanded by 743 and 271 per cent, annualized to 892 and 326 per cent, respectively; but below the annual benchmark of 1310 and 1740 per cent, respectively. Credit to the private sector grossly underperformed as it grew by 194 per cent, annualised to 233 per cent, below the 2018 benchmark of 1240 per cent. The underperformance of the monetary aggregates was of concern to the MPC, which urged the CBN to ensure improved credit delivery to the small and medium scale industries, particularly to the unbanked urban and rural populations. The Committee noted the benign performance of inflation, as headline inflation (year-on-year) decreased to 1126 per cent in October 2018 from 3 1128 per cent in September 2018 after two consecutive months of marginal increases. The drop in headline inflation was driven by food inflation, which moderated to 1328 per cent in October from 1331 per cent in September 2018. Core inflation, however, inched up marginally to 99 per cent in October 2018 from 98 per cent in the previous month. On a month-on-month basis, headline and food inflation also moderated to 074 and 082 per cent in October from 084 and 10 per cent in September 2018, respectively, while core inflation increased from 064 per cent in September 2018 to 080 per cent in October 2018. The Committee noted that the moderation in inflation was largely seasonally driven and was therefore, unsustainable as prices were expected to pick towards the end of the year. However the MPC observed that the near-term upside risks to inflation remained; the disruption to agricultural production and distribution arising from flooding, insurgency in the North-East, herdsmen- farmer crisis, high cost of energy, anticipated spending in the run-up to Christmas festivities and campaign-related spending towards the upcoming 2019 general elections. Accordingly the Committee enjoined the appropriate authorities to continue to address these challenges and to sustain the implementation of the 2018 budget and the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan of the Federal Government to ameliorate the supply side constraints. Money market interest rates oscillated throughout the review period, reflecting fluctuations in banking system liquidity. Inter-bank call and Open Buy Back (OBB) rates, which stood at 1600 and 1708 per cent, respectively, on September 26, 2018, declined moderately to 1400 and 1631 per cent, respectively, on October 24, 2018. On average, interbank call and OBB rates rose from 868 and 764 per cent in September 2018 to 1418 and 1393 per cent, respectively, in October 2018, closing at 1000 and 972 per cent, respectively, on November 21, 2018. The developments in net liquidity position and flows which culminated in higher market rates reflected the impact of higher risk perception in the market, withdrawals from the banking 4 system for monthly statutory disbursements to states and local governments; OMO sales and foreign exchange interventions. The average naira exchange rate remained relatively stable and converging at both the Bureau-de-Change (BDC) and the Investors' and Exporters' (I&E) window segments of the foreign exchange market during the review period. The exchange rate at the I&E window opened at N36400/US$ and closed at N36390/US$ with a daily average of N36387/US$ between September 26 and November 16, 2018. At the BDC segment, the exchange rate opened at N36000/US$ and closed at N36185/US$, with a daily average of N36098/US$, over the same period. The relative stability in the foreign exchange market, the MPC noted, was attributable to the sustained policies of the Bank to increase the supply of foreign exchange from autonomous sources. Gross official reserves decreased from US$4260 billion at end-September, 2018 to US$4153 billion on 16th November, 2018. The Committee noted the bearish trend in the equities segment of the capital market during the review period. Similarly Market Capitalization (MC) decreased by 872 per cent from N1272 trillion to N1170 trillion during the same period. Relative to the end- December 2017, the indices decreased by 1929 and 1632 per cent, respectively. These developments largely reflect the sustained profit taking activities by portfolio investors as foreign yields become increasingly more attractive abroad. The MPC, however, believes that this trend will reverse in the medium term given the current efforts at further improving investor confidence and the relative stability in the Investors and Exporters (I&E) window of the foreign exchange market. The Overall Outlook and Risks Forecasts of key macroeconomic variables indicate a positive outlook for the economy in Q4 of 2018. The Committee expects that the effective implementation of the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP) and the 5 2018 budget, improvements in the security challenges, enhanced flow of credit to the real sector and stability in the foreign exchange market will redirect the economy on a path of inclusive and sustainable growth. Increased production in the oil and the non-oil sectors are also expected to drive output growth in the medium term. The Committee, however, acknowledged the downside risks to this outlook to include: reduced portfolio inflows, weak of fiscal buffers, low domestic credit, and sluggish aggregate demand. The inflation outlook suggests continued but moderate inflationary pressure to the end of 2018, based largely on increased consumer spending for the Christmas festivities, election-related expenditure and increased pace of implementation of the 2018 Federal government budget. Improvements in the security, increased harvests as well as a stable exchange rate are expected to moderate the rise in inflation. Overall the outlook for the economy remains positive with a growth projection of 175 per cent in 2018. Committee's Considerations The Committee assessed the macroeconomic environment in 2018 and noted the modest stability thus far achieved in domestic prices, output growth and the financial system. The Committee noted that the economy was on the right path but some key sectors continued to experience significant challenges. The MPC, however, expressed concern about the tepid growth expectations and growing uncertainty in the global financial markets arising from the poor reception of the Brexit deal by British politicians, continuing trade war between the US and her major trading partners, as well as the commencement of US sanctions on Iran. The Committee believed that although the domestic economy was recovering modestly from recession, however, the recovery was tepid and efforts should be stepped up to strengthen aggregate output and demand. In this regard, the Committee urged the CBN to deepen and broaden access 6 to finance to high employment elastic sectors with particular emphasis on small and medium scale enterprises. The Committee called on the CBN to extend the success recorded under the Anchor Borrowers Programme to other items including fish and palm oil, etc. by introducing more stringent measures to curb access to foreign exchange for products that can be produced within Nigeria. The MPC welcomed the moderation in inflation in October, reflecting declining food prices. The Committee believes that given the negative output gap, the proposed increase in the national minimum wage would stimulate output growth due to prolonged weak aggregate demand arising from salary arrears and contractor debt. Consequently its impact on the aggregate price level would be largely muted, given that the monetary aggregates have largely underperformed in fiscal 2018. In addition, the prevailing stability in the foreign exchange market would continue to moderate pressures on the domestic price level. The MPC noted the improvements in the financial stability indicators, including non-performing loans, capital adequacy and liquidity ratios of the Deposit Money Banks (DMBs). It urged the Bank to sustain its surveillance over the Banking industry by taking prompt corrective measures to further improve stability in the system. The Committee also called on the fiscal authorities to build significant buffers to strengthen the efficacy of monetary policy. Overall the MPC considered the options to loosen, hold or tighten. The Committee continues to hold the view that although loosening would encourage the flow of credit to the real sector, help in reduction of the aggregate cost of credit and spur business spending and investment, thereby reinforcing the CBN's support for output growth and economic recovery, it, however, believed that doing so will reverse more rapidly, the gains of price and exchange rate stability achieved so far given the liquidity impact that would entail. The ensuing liquidity will exert pressure on the exchange rate in the light of increased capital flow reversals arising from monetary policy normalisation by the US Fed. This would further depress the capital market. As for tightening. The MPC hold the view that, while tightening will strengthen the stability of the foreign exchange market because of its dampening effect on the demand for foreign exchange, it was however convinced that this would simultaneously dampen investment growth, widen the output gap, depress aggregate demand and weaken output growth. The MPC recognises the fact that it had held the policy rate and other policy parameters constant over the last several meetings. The Committee underscores that by holding its policy position constant, it has confidence in the various policies and administrative measures deployed by the Bank which have resulted in the moderation in domestic price levels and stability in the foreign exchange rate. Thus a hold position is an expression of confidence in the policy regime, given the gradual improvements in both output growth and price stability. On this premise, the downside risks to growth and upside risks to inflation appears contained. The Committee's Decision In light of the above, the MPC decided by a vote of all eleven (11) members present to HOLD. In summary, the MPC voted to: 1. Retain the MPR at 14 per cent; 2. Retain the asymmetric corridor of +200/-500 basis points around the MPR; 3. Retain the CRR at 225 per cent; and 4. Retain the Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent. Thank you. Godwin I Emefiele Governor.

South Africa,2018-11-22,"South African Reserve Bank PRESS STATEMENT EMBARGO DELIVERY 22 November 2018 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), the near-term inflation outlook has improved, however, the longer term risks to the inflation outlook remain elevated. The weaker exchange rate and the impact of higher oil prices have contributed to increasing inflation since March 2018. At the same time, domestic growth remains weak. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas was 5.1% in October (up from 4.9% in September). Goods price inflation was 5.1% (up from 4.8% in September), while services price inflation decreased slightly from 5.2% in September to 5.1% in October. The Bank's measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity was 4.2% in October. Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods slowed to 6.2% in September from 6.3% in August. MPC Statement November 22nd, 2018 Page 1. MPC Statement November 22nd, 2018 Page 1 The inflation forecast has improved marginally since the previous MPC. While remaining within the inflation target range throughout the forecast period, the SARB's model projects an increase in headline inflation, albeit slightly lower than the September projection. Headline inflation is now expected to average 4.7% in 2018 (down from 4.8%), before increasing to 5.5% in 2019 (down from 5.7%) and moderating to an unchanged 5.4% in 2020. Headline CPI inflation is now expected to peak at around 5.6%, in the third quarter of 2019. These inflation projections are based on an interest rate path generated by the SARB's Quarterly Projection Model (QPM). Following persistent increases in oil prices since February, the assumptions for Brent crude oil in the QPM were revised upwards by US$3 per barrel to US$73 for 2019 and 2020. Administered prices, including fuel, electricity and water tariffs, are expected to increase at rates above the upper end of the inflation target range. The inflation expectations of market analysts in the November Reuters Econometer survey are lower at 4.7% in 2018 (down from 4.8%), rising to 5.5% in 2019 (up from 5.3%) and remaining unchanged at 5.3% in 2020. Expectations implicit in the break- even inflation rates (i.e. the yield differential between conventional and inflation-linked government bonds) remain sensitive to exchange rate movements. While five-year break-even rates remains within the inflation target range, the longer-term break-even rates remain above 6%. The global economic outlook is expected to remain broadly favourable over the short term. However, medium term risks are tilted to the downside due to less synchronised global growth. This is amplified by elevated policy uncertainty emanating from MPC Statement November 22nd, 2018 Page 2. This is amplified by elevated policy uncertainty emanating from MPC Statement November 22nd, 2018 Page 2 escalating trade tensions, tightening global financial conditions and rising geo-political risks. The global inflation trajectory remains on a moderate upward path as key advanced economies continue to grow above their potential. Since the September MPC, the rand has appreciated by 3.8% against the US dollar, by 6.6% against the euro, and by 5.2% on a trade-weighted basis. The implied starting point for the rand is R14.50 against the US dollar, compared with R14.20 at the time of the previous meeting. At these levels, the QPM assesses the rand to still be undervalued. Tighter global financial conditions, financial market volatility and the change in investor sentiment towards emerging markets remain key external risks to the rand. Over the medium term, it is likely that the rand, along with other emerging market currencies, will remain volatile. However, the pace of monetary policy normalisation in the advanced economies continues to be gradual. Policy tightening by the US Fed is expected to follow a measured path in the absence of significant inflation or growth surprises, while the European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to start a rate hiking cycle in late-2019. This means that monetary policies in some advanced economies will likely be tightening throughout the forecast period. The domestic growth outlook remains challenging. Recent monthly data on economic performance in key sectors suggests a more moderate recovery in growth in the third quarter than expected in September. The SARB now forecasts growth in 2018 to average 0.6% (down from 0.7% in September). The forecast for 2019 and 2020 is unchanged at 1.9% and 2.0% respectively. At these growth rates, the negative output gap is wider than at the time of the previous MPC meeting. The output gap will narrow but will not close by the end of 2020, as previously expected. MPC Statement November 22nd, 2018 Page 3. MPC Statement November 22nd, 2018 Page 3 The SARB's composite leading business cycle indicator has been trending lower since February, reflecting the extent of weakness in the economy. The year-on-year decrease in September was the largest since July 2016 and mainly reflected a significant decline in the number of building plans approved and a reduction in job advertisement space. The RMB/BER Business Confidence Index remains significantly below the neutral level of 50 index points, broadly aligned with weakness in gross fixed capital formation. Efforts by the government to encourage private sector investment could support longer term growth. While the FNB/BER Consumer Confidence Index remains high, household consumption expenditure has been constrained by recent tax changes, weak employment growth as well as low growth in credit extension to households. Over the forecast period, consumption expenditure growth is expected to remain below 2% in 2018 and 2019, and to reach 2.3% in 2020, on the back of increases in real wages and household disposable income. The MPC assesses the risks to the growth forecast to be moderately on the downside. As previously highlighted the Committee remains of the view that current challenges facing the economy are primarily structural in nature and cannot be solved by monetary policy alone. Prudent macroeconomic policies are essential to ensuring that growth is sustainable and that the economy is more resilient to shocks. These should be complemented by implementation of credible structural policy initiatives that make a marked impact on the cost structure of the economy, potential output and employment. The MPC noted the rising inflation trajectory which, while remaining within the target range, continues to deviate from the mid-point of the target range. MPC Statement November 22nd, 2018 Page 4. MPC Statement November 22nd, 2018 Page 4 The MPC continues to assess the risks to the longer-term inflation outlook to be on the upside. These risks include tighter global financial conditions, a weaker exchange rate, higher wage growth, international oil prices and rising electricity and water tariffs. However, demand pressures are still not assessed to pose a significant risk to the inflation outlook. The approach of the MPC is to look through the first-round effects and focus on the possible second-round effects of supply side shocks. However, shocks of a persistent nature such as extended periods of currency depreciation, elevated oil prices and multi-year electricity price increases make it difficult to disentangle these first and second round effects. The MPC had to decide whether to act now or later. Given the relative stability in the underlying core inflation measure, delaying the adjustment could give the MPC room to re-assess these unfolding developments in subsequent meetings. However, delaying the adjustment could cause inflation expectations to become entrenched at higher levels and thus contribute to second round effects, which would require an even stronger monetary policy response in the future. Against this backdrop, the MPC has decided to increase the repurchase rate by 25 basis points to 6,75% per year, effective from 23 November 2018. Three members preferred an increase and three members preferred an unchanged stance. The Committee continues to assess the stance of monetary policy to be accommodative. Monetary policy actions will continue to focus on anchoring inflation expectations near the mid-point of the inflation target range in the interest of balanced and sustainable growth. As previously indicated, any future policy adjustments will be data dependent. MPC Statement November 22nd, 2018 Page 5. MPC Statement November 22nd, 2018 Page 5 The implied path of policy rates generated by the Quarterly Projection Model is for four rate hikes of 25 basis points, reaching 7.5% by the end of 2020. The forecasted endogenous interest rate path is built into our growth and inflation outlook. As emphasised previously, the implied path remains a broad policy guide which can and does change in either direction between meetings in response to new developments and changing risks.

Israel,2018-11-26,"After a continued rise in inflation since the beginning of 2018, the inflation rate is stabilizing slightly above the lower bound of the target range, and is expected to remain within the target in the coming months as well. One-year expectations and forecasts from the various sources hover around the level of one percent. Medium-term expectations remained entrenched within the target range. The rise in wagesin the economy and the expansionary fiscal policy will support the continued entrenchment of inflation within the target. The main risk to this is the possibility ofa sharp appreciation of the shekel. An analysis of thedata and of updated indicators of economic activity leads to the assessment that the economy is converging to its potential growth rate. In the second and third quarters, there was some slowdown in the economy's growth rate, butcurrent indicators of activity support the assessment that the economy is at full employment, and in particular, the tight labor market data indicate a high level of demand. The US economy remains robust, though the risks due to the worsening 'trade war' and the heightened political risk in Europe continue to weigh on momentum. The IMF revised its growth forecast downward for most countries and regions, and the moderation in world trade continues. Emerging economies are relatively stable. The gradual normalization process of monetary policy worldwide continues, but policy remains accommodative in most economies. In financial markets, there were marked declines in most equity indices. Since the previousinterest rate decision, the shekel weakened by 3.6 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate and by 3.2 percent vis-C 3A 0-vis the dollar. Home prices stabilized in recent months. The number of transactions and mortgage volume appear to be stabilizing, with a slight increase in mortgage interest rates. Even after an increase of the interest rate by 0.15 percentage points, monetary policy remains accommodative and will continue to support the attainment of policy targets. The Committee assesses that the rising path of the interest rate in the future will be gradual and cautious. The Bank of Israel continues to monitor developments in inflation, the real economy, the financial markets, and the global economy, and will act to attain the monetary policy targets in accordance with such developments. For the file of data accompanying this notice, click here. Ecxel file (Hebrew). Inflation is stabilizing slightly above the lower bound of the target range. After a continued rise in actual inflation since the beginning of 2018, the annual inflation rate has ranged between 1.2-1.4 percent in thepast five months, and the 'adjusted indices' are in a similar environment (Figure 2 in the attached data file). Inflation in tradable goods prices moderated, primarily as a result of a slowdown in the annual rate of increase in energy prices, despite the increase in oil prices until recently and the depreciation of the shekel. Inflation in prices of nontradable items, which serves as an approximation of the domestic component of inflation, resumed its rise (Figure 3). In the coming months as well, inflation is expected to remain slightly above the lower bound of the target, and 1-year expectations and forecasts from the various sources range around a level of one percent. Expectations for medium terms remained entrenched within the target range, though there has been a slight decline recently in longer-term expectations. In the intermeeting period, the shekel weakened by 3.6 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate (Figure 6). The wage increases in the economy and the expansionary fiscal policy will support the entrenchment of inflation within the target range. The main risk to this is the possibility of a sharp appreciation of the shekel. The steep decline in oil prices in recent weeks may offset the factors supporting inflation, but its impact on the 'adjusted indices' will be limited. Since the previous interest rate decision, 10-year government bond yields stabilized, after increasing in previous months. In the past month, there was a slight increase in the yield spreads between corporate bonds and comparable government bonds. Based on National Accounts data, there was some slowdown in the economy's growth rate (Figure 11) in the second and third quarters. The growth rate in the third quarter was 2.3 percent. Private consumption grew moderately, and investment continued to contract, despite the firming of residential construction investment after it had declined over several quarters. Services (excluding start-up companies) exports returned to growth, while weakness continued in goods (excluding diamonds) exports (Figure 12). However, an analysis of the data and of updated indicators of activity: and considering the impact of volatility in vehicle imports on GDP: indicates that the economy is apparently converging to its potential growth rate. The Composite State of the Economy Index (Figure 13), the Purchasing Managers Index and the Consumer Confidence Index (Figure 14), and the Business Tendency Survey of the Central Bureau of Statistics all support this assessment, as do labor market data. The unemployment rate remains very low, though the participation and employment rates appear to be moderating from the elevated levels they had reached. The ratio of job vacancies to total employee posts rose to a record level (Figure 17), and wages continue to increase (Figure 18), led by a relatively sharp rise in the business sector, encompassing a wide range of industries and all salary levels. Home prices have stabilized in recent months (Figure 9). The most recent data indicate that the number of transactions is apparently steadying, after some increase in the beginning of the year. New mortgage volume is stabilizing after increasing since 2017, and mortgage interest rates have increased slightly in recent months, against the background of the increasein government bond yields (Figure 10). The macro picture conveyed by the global economy continues to indicate declining momentum. The US economy remains robust, though the risks due to a worsening of the 'trade war' and heightened political risk in Europe continue to weigh on momentum. The IMF revised its growth forecast downward for mostcountries and regions (Figure 19), and the moderation in world trade continues (Figure 20). Global monetary policy remains accommodative, but the direction is gradually changing: while negative interest rates and below-target inflation continue in Europe and Japan, federal funds rate increases in the US are expected to continue and the central banks of several additional countries raised interest rates. Likewise, global quantitative easing wound down, and in the coming months quantitative contraction is expected to begin, in view of theFed contracting its balance sheet and the cessation of purchases by the ECB (Figure 24). In financial markets, there were marked declines in most equity indices (Figure 25), and bond spreads widened. In the US, as noted, the high growth continued, driven by private consumption and the improvement in manufacturing activity, while the fiscal expansion's impact is expected to dissipate in 2020. In Europe, growth weakened in the third quarter. Assessments are that it is not a change in trend, although leading indicators point to a loss ofmomentum. The tension between the Italian government and European authorities grew stronger, following the proposed budget that is expected to lead to an increase in the deficit in Italy. In Japan, growth was negative in the third quarter, apparently due to one-off factors, and improvement is expected in the next quarter. Emerging markets are relatively stable, but a possible worsening of the 'trade war' and the effects of the monetary contraction in advanced economies continue to weigh on continued growth. Growth in China continues to weaken. There was a turnaround in oil prices, which are declining sharply (Figure 22). The growth in supply is apparently the main factor, but there are also forecasts for a decline in global demand. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on December 10, 2018. The next decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Monday. January 7, 2019, following which the Governor will hold a press briefing."
Mongolia,2018-11-27,"MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Increasing the policy rate Number: 2018/04 Effective date: 27 November 2018 At the unscheduled meeting held on 27 November 2018, the Monetary Policy Committee decided to increase the Policy rate by 1.0 percentage point to 11 percent. As of October 2018, annual inflation measured by the consumer price index has reached 6.3 percent nationwide and 6.8 percent in Ulaanbaatar city. Although the price of commodities remained relatively high and economic growth reached 6.7 percent in the third quarter, exceeding previous expectations, uncertainties in the external sector remain elevated. Approval of next year's budget with a relatively high level of deficit, the US Federal Reserve's decisions to raise its federal funds rate, and the People's Republic of China's action to limit its coal imports, are adversely affecting the balance of payments and thus creating pressures on the exchange rate. Hence, considering the uncertainties in the external sector, with the intention to preserve economic recovery at a medium term sustainable path, the Monetary Policy Committee decided to increase the policy rate, during its unscheduled meeting. The decision is consistent with the Bank's mandate to keep inflation rate around the medium term target rate and is intended to increase yield for assets in togrog, to support credibility of the national currency, and to sustain macroeconomic stability in the medium term. The Bank of Mongolia decided to issue central bank bills with maturities of 28 weeks, starting from December 2018. Extracts of the meeting minutes will be released in two weeks on the Bank of Mongolia's website. MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE."
South Korea,2018-11-30,"Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points, from 1.50% to 1.75%, for the intermeeting period. This press release is the English version of the Bank of Korea's policy statement. In the case of any inconsistency, the original version in Korean will prevail. The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points, from 1.50% to 1.75%, for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Board considers that the global economy has maintained its trend of generally sound growth, despite signs of weakening somewhat during the 3rd quarter. The high volatility in the global financial markets has continued, with stock prices in major countries falling for example, but the financial unrest in some vulnerable emerging countries has eased slightly. Looking ahead the Board sees global economic growth and the global financial markets as likely to be affected by factors such as the movements toward spreading trade protectionism, the paces of monetary policy normalization in major countries, and the political uncertainties in the euro area. The Board judges that the domestic economy has sustained a rate of growth at its potential level generally, as consumption has continued to grow modestly and exports have maintained favorable movements, although the adjustments in facilities and construction investment have persisted. The sluggishness in employment conditions has lessened somewhat, with the amount of increase in the number of persons employed having picked up slightly. Going forward the Board expects domestic economic growth to be generally consistent with the path projected in October, and to sustain a rate that does not diverge significantly from its potential level. It anticipates that investment will slow but that the trend of steady increase in consumption will continue, and that exports will also sustain their favorable movements thanks to the buoyancy of the global economy. Consumer price inflation was at the 2% level, as the paces of increase in prices of agricultural and petroleum products accelerated. Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has been at around the 1% level, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has been in the mid-2% range. Looking ahead it is forecast that consumer price inflation will remain near the target level for some time, and then fall slightly and fluctuate in the mid- to upper-1% range. Core inflation will also gradually rise. In the domestic financial markets, the volatility of major price variables expanded and then in November diminished moderately. Stock prices fell considerably, in line mostly with drops in stock prices in major countries, before then rebounding on expectations of an easing of the US-China trade dispute. Long-term market interest rates have declined, and the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has fallen slightly. The amount of increase in household lending expanded in October, while the pace of increase in housing sales prices slowed due to the Korean government's measures to stabilize the housing market. Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As it is forecast that inflationary pressures on the demand side will not be high for the time being, and that the domestic economy will sustain a rate of growth that does not diverge significantly from its potential level, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance. In this process it will judge whether it is necessary to adjust its accommodative monetary policy stance further, while closely checking future economic growth and inflation trends. It will also carefully monitor conditions related to trade with major countries, any changes in the monetary policies of major countries, financial and economic conditions in emerging market economies, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks."
Pakistan,2018-11-30,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement November 30, 2018 The economic data released since the last Monetary Policy Committee meeting in September 2018 shows that the positive impact of recent stabilization measures has started to materialize gradually. Particularly the current account deficit is showing early signs of improvement. However the near term challenges to Pakistan's economy continue to persist with rising inflation, an elevated fiscal deficit and low foreign exchange reserves. These concerns are also captured in the results of recent consumer and business confidence surveys. Average headline CPI inflation during the first four months of FY19 has increased to. percent as compared to. percent in the corresponding period of FY18. This trend is even more pronounced for core inflation, which indicates growing inflationary pressures in the economy. disaggregated analysis reveals that this is due to both, demand and supply side factors. Considering these developments. SBP projects average headline CPI inflation for FY19 in the forecast range of.57. percent, above the annual target of. percent. Although the recent decline in international oil prices could potentially play positive role in slowing down the current inflation trajectory the risks currently remain tilted towards the downside. Taking lead from the recent large scale manufacturing data, economic activity is expected to witness notable moderation during FY19 reflecting short term cost of pursuing macroeconomic stability. The lagged impact of the 275 basis point increase in the policy rate since January 2018 and other policy measures is likely to contain domestic demand during the current fiscal year. Furthermore initial estimates for major crops, except wheat, are expected to fall short of levels achieved in the last year. The slowdown in commodity producing sectors is expected to limit the expansion in the services sector as well. In this backdrop. SBP projects real GDP growth for FY19 at slightly above. percent. On the external front, import growth decelerated to. percent during Jul-Oct FY19 from 26. percent recorded in the same period last year reflecting the impact of recent tightening measures. Even this growth in imports is mainly explained by an increase in the oil import bill because of higher international oil prices. Non-oil imports contracted by. percent in the first four months of FY19. This along with continued increase in exports and workers' remittances, narrowed the external current account deficit from US$5. billion in Jul-Oct FY18 to US$4. billion in Jul-Oct FY19; net improvement of. percent. Despite these positive developments. SBP's net liquid foreign exchange reserves remained under pressure falling to US$8. billion as of 23rd November 2018 from US$9. billion at the end of FY18. Going forward, there is an expectation of receiving higher foreign inflows from both private and official sources during the second half of FY19. Furthermore recent bilateral arrangements including the deferred oil payments facility would also be available to the market from January 2019 onwards. The projected decrease in the current account deficit, that could be further supported by the recent decline in international oil prices will instill confidence in the foreign exchange market. These developments would help reduce pressures on SBP's net liquid foreign exchange reserves. Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN In the first four and half months of FY19, statistics show that almost all liquidity in the banking system is generated through an increase in the Net Domestic Assets (NDA) as the Net Foreign Assets (NFA) continued to contract. Besides the increase in budgetary borrowings from SBP, relatively higher credit flows to the private sector have been the major contributors to an increase in NDA. Despite contractionary monetary conditions, an increase in working capital needs due to capacity additions in the last three years and recent substantial increases in input prices, are the main reasons behind relatively higher credit flows to the private sector. After considering all of these developments, the Monetary Policy Committee noted that: continued inflationary pressure (and rising inflationary expectations) needs to be checked; real interest rates remain low; although narrowing, the current account deficit is still high and the fiscal deficit remains elevated; and unfolding global developments, particularly the gradual but consistent normalization of monetary policy in the developed economies demands proactive domestic monetary management. In light of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation discussed above, the Monetary Policy Committee is of the view that further consolidation is required to ensure macroeconomic stability and therefore has decided to raise the SBP policy (target) rate by 150 bps to 10. percent effective from 3rd December 2018. On strategies to overcome the country's recurrent balance-of-payments challenges in the medium term. MPC opined that: with the exchange rate reflecting demand-supply gap in the foreign exchange market, the adoption of flexible inflation targeting framework will help anchor inflation expectations; improving productivity and competitiveness of exports will have to play prominent role to reduce the external trade deficit; and the fiscal policy will have to be proactive and play supportive role to generate conditions for sustainable growth path.

Chile,2018-12-04,"Tuesday, 4 December 2018 Monetary Policy Meeting  December 2018 In its monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 2.75%. The decision was adopted by the unanimous vote of its members. Externally, the data continues to confirm that global growth is moving to a stage of lower expansion than in previous years. Since the previous Meeting, less auspicious activity figures have been noted in the Eurozone and China, a downward adjustment in the prices of risky assets in developed markets and a market perception that the process of monetary normalization in the United States will be more limited next year. Also worth noting is the significant drop in the price of oil, which reduces some short- term inflationary pressures, in a context where the other commodity prices show no big changes. The Brexit is nearing definition, while the trade conflict between the US and China seem to have opened some formal room for negotiating. The Chilean peso and stock market continued to fluctuate significantly in recent weeks, while longer-term interest rates decreased in line with events in the developed markets. Risk indicators posted minor changes. The credit market continues to be characterized by low interest rates and higher growth in commercial and consumer loans. Third-quarter 2018 national accounts showed a slowdown in activity beyond expectations, caused mostly by mining- and manufacturing- specific factors. In the latter case, the calendar effect took a toll on activity in September, which was fully undone October according to sectoral indicators. On the expenditure side, the data continues to point to significant momentum from investment and somewhat slower from consumption, although October's sectoral retail data suggests a strengthening of the latter. The revision to remuneration indexes by the INE and the consideration of the effect of immigration on the behavior of employment confirm the vision of a labor market that evolves in line with the growth pace observed since mid-2017. For the period 2018-2020, the market outlook (EES) points to an annual GDP expansion of 4% this year and 3.5% in 2019 and 2020. October's inflation (0.4%) was in line with forecasts, so annual CPI inflation decreased to 2.9% and CPIEFE inflation remained at 2.1%. The prices that are more sensitive to the activity gap, such as non-regulated utility rates in the CPIEFE, continue to accelerate steadily. At shorter terms, private inflation expectations have fallen in line with the lower international prices of oil and fuels, while at two years they remain around 3%. The Board's decision considered that the analysis contained in the December Monetary Policy Report, and the data available at the statistical close, confirm that the evolution of macroeconomic conditions make it necessary to reduce the monetary stimulus, a process that will continue to be implemented gradually and cautiously. Key to this judgment is the evaluation of the size of capacity gaps compared to the magnitude of the monetary stimulus: while the former have narrowed and inflation has increased, monetary policy remains highly expansionary. With this, the Board reaffirms its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the two-year horizon. The minutes of this Monetary Policy Meeting will be published at 8:30 hours of Wednesday, 19 December 2018. The next Monetary Policy Meeting is scheduled to take place on Tuesday 29 and Wednesday 30 January 2019 and the statement thereof will be released this same day at 18:00 hours. _The Spanish original prevails."
Kazakhstan,2018-12-04,"PRESS - RELEASE – 44 The base rate remains unchanged at 9.25% December 4, 2018 Almaty The National Bank of Kazakhstan has decided to keep the base rate at 9.25% with the corridor of +/-1%. During October and November of this year, the inflation demonstrated a significant decline in relation to the preliminary estimates and was formed closer to the lower boundary of the target corridor of 5-7 %. Taking into consideration current balance of risks related to the internal and external factors, the National Bank confirms its estimates of dynamics of projected inflation for 2019 to be within the new corridor of 4-6% closer to its upper boundary; and its subsequent gradual decline in the first half of 2020 (the horizon of the forecast period). Further decisions on the base rate will be taken based on the necessity to react on the potential inflationary risks, as well as on the objective of achieving a medium-term inflation target of below 4% by the end of 2020. Annual inflation in October and November was formed at the level of 5.3%, which is significantly lower than September value (6.1%). The slowdown in price increase was mostly associated with a positive shock in several markets for consumer goods and services. In October there was a seasonal decline in prices for fruits and vegetables and gasoline, as well as the decline in tariffs on regulated services, compared to the September of this year. Overall inflationary background of the economy remains relatively high, which can be observed in an increase of the annual core inflation in October up to 6.3% in comparison to 6.2% in September. On the forecast horizon (the middle of 2020) the National Bank estimates inflation to maintain predominantly within 5.0-5.5% boundaries. Inflation expectations are estimated to be higher than the level of actual inflation. Nevertheless, based on the outcomes of November surveys the expectations are anticipated to fall below this October's 6.3%. The perceivable inflation continues to follow the long-term trend of deceleration. According to the results of the October surveys, the percentage of responders, who believed that â€œin the past 12 months the price of goods and services has increased with the faster rate than beforeâ€ went down to 40.5% (52.1% at the beginning of the year and 42.5% in September). The main risk of inflationary pressure from the external sector originates from the uncertainty related to the future oil prices, in November oil prices fell from $75 per barrel down to $60 per barrel. Another source of risk is a continuing tendency of growing inflation in the countries - main trading partners. Expanding domestic demand remains as an additional pro-inflationary factor due to this year's persisting growth of money income in real terms (by 3.4% from the beginning of the year), and the planned increase of the minimum wage in the year 2019. Domestic demand is reinforced by the accelerated growth of consumer loans, which amounted to 12.9% in annual terms. In a 10-month period, the volume of issued consumer loans increased by 25.4% or 581 billion tenge in comparison to the corresponding period of the previous year. Business activity continues to expand. Short-term economic indicator for January- October 2018 grew by 4.8%. An increase in the volume of production in mining and manufacturing industries reached 4.7% and 5.4%, accordingly, trade - 7.2%, transport and communication - 4.5% and 3.4%, and agriculture - 2.5%. The National Bank maintains monetary conditions at a neutral level. The current level of the base rate, keeping other things constant, ensures the formation of inflation within the corridor of 4-6% by the end of the year 2019. In addition, the current interest rate policy of the National Bank allows offsetting the pressure from the external factors on the domestic foreign exchange market. As a result, an efficient formation of the tenge exchange rate and its reduced influence on domestic prices is sustained. In order to improve the effectiveness of monetary policy, the National Bank sees the need for further improvement of the short-term predictability of the targeted TONIA rate within the target corridor, including the means of bringing the money market rates closer to the base rate. The next decision on the base rate will be announced on January 14, 2019, at 17:00 Astana time."
India,2018-12-05,"Fifth Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2018-19 Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) Reserve Bank of India On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation at its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 6.5 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains at 6.25 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 6.75 per cent. The decision of the MPC is consistent with the stance of calibrated tightening of monetary policy in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Assessment 2. Since the last MPC meeting in October 2018, global economic activity has shown increasing signs of weakness on rising trade tensions. Among advanced economies (AEs), economic activity appears to be slowing in the US in Q4:2018, after a buoyant Q3. The Euro area growth lost pace in Q3, impacted by weaker trade growth and new vehicle emission standards. The Japanese economy contracted in Q3 on subdued external and domestic demand. Economic activity also decelerated in major emerging market economies (EMEs) in Q3. In China, growth slowed down on weak domestic demand. The ongoing trade tensions and the possible cooling of the housing market pose major risks to growth in China. The Russian economy lost some traction, pulled down largely by a weak agriculture harvest, though the growth was buttressed by strong performance of the energy sector. The Brazilian economy seems to be recovering gradually from the economic disruption in the first half of the year. The South African economy expanded in Q3, after contracting in the previous two quarters, driven by agriculture and manufacturing. Crude oil prices have declined sharply, reflecting higher supplies and easing of geo- political tensions. Base metal prices have continued to decline on selling pressure following weak demand from major economies. Gold price has risen underpinned by safe haven demand triggered by political uncertainty in some geographies, though a strong dollar may stem the2 rise. The inflation scenario has remained broadly unchanged in the US and the Euro area. In many key EMEs, however, inflation has risen, though the recent retreat in energy prices, tightening of policy stances by central banks and stabilising of currencies may have a salutary impact, going forward. Global financial markets have been driven mainly by rising policy rates in the US, volatile crude oil prices and expectations of a slowdown compared with earlier projections. Among AEs, equity markets in the US witnessed a selloff on the weakening outlook for corporate earnings caused by rising borrowing costs, while the European stock markets declined on political uncertainties. The Japanese stock market also shed gains on global cues and the gradual strengthening of the yen. EM stock markets have corrected on shrinking global liquidity, weak economic data in some key EMEs, and lingering trade tensions. The 10-year yield in the US, which surged on robust economic data at the beginning of October, softened subsequently on the unchanged Fed stance. Among other AEs, bond yields in the Euro area and Japan softened on weak economic sentiment and idiosyncratic factors. In most EMEs, bond yields have softened in recent weeks on falling crude oil prices and steadying currencies. In currency markets, the US dollar, which was strengthening on a widening growth differential with its peers, eased in the second half of November. The euro has weakened on Brexit and budget concerns in Italy, while the yen appreciated on safe haven buying in November. EME currencies have been trading with an appreciating bias, supported by a sharp decline in crude oil prices and conservative domestic monetary policy stances. On the domestic front, gross domestic product (GDP) growth slowed down to 7.1 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) in Q2:2018-19, after four consecutive quarters of acceleration, weighed down by moderation in private consumption and a large drag from net exports. Private consumption slowed down possibly on account of moderation in rural demand, subdued growth in kharif output, depressed prices of agricultural commodities and sluggish growth in rural wages. However, growth in government final consumption expenditure (GFCE) strengthened, buoyed by higher spending by the central government. Gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) expanded by double-digits for the third consecutive quarter, driven mainly by the public sector's thrust on national highways and rural infrastructure, which was also reflected in robust growth in cement production and steel consumption. Growth of imports accelerated at a much faster pace than that of exports, resulting in net exports pulling down aggregate demand. On the supply side, growth of gross value added (GVA) at basic prices decelerated to 6.9 per cent in Q2, reflecting moderation in agricultural and industrial activities. Slowdown in agricultural GVA was largely the outcome of tepid growth in kharif production. Within industry, growth in manufacturing decelerated due to lower profitability of manufacturing firms, pulled down largely by a rise in input costs, while that in mining and quarrying turned negative, caused by a contraction in output of crude oil and natural gas. Growth in electricity, gas, water supply and other utility services strengthened. Services sector growth remained unchanged at the previous quarter's level. Of its constituents, growth in construction activity decelerated sequentially, but it was much higher on a y-o-y basis. Growth in public administration and defence services accelerated sharply. Looking beyond Q2, rabi sowing so far (up to end-November) has been 8.3 per cent lower as compared with the same period last year due mainly to lower soil moisture levels resulting from a deficient monsoon and a delayed kharif harvest across states. Precipitation during the north-east monsoon as on November 28 was 49 per cent below the long period average. Storage in major reservoirs, the main source of irrigation during the rabi season, was at 61 per cent of the full reservoir level as on November 29.3 9. Growth in the index of industrial production (IIP) slowed down to 4.5 per cent in September 2018. Capacity utilisation (CU), measured by the Reserve Bank's Order Books. Inventories and Capacity Utilisation Survey (OBICUS), increased from 73.8 per cent in Q1 to 76.1 per cent in Q2, which was higher than the long-term average of 74.9 per cent; seasonally adjusted CU also increased to 76.4 per cent. Available high frequency indicators suggest that industrial activity has been improving in Q3. The growth in core industries recovered in October on the back of double-digit expansion in coal, cement and electricity. The purchasing managers' index (PMI) for manufacturing touched an eleven-month high of 54.0 in November, supported by an expansion in output, and domestic and export orders. According to the assessment of the Reserve Bank's Industrial Outlook Survey (IOS), the overall business sentiment in Q3 remained stable, with sustained optimism about production and exports. High frequency indicators of service sector activity showed a mixed picture in September-October. Growth in tractors sales  an indicator of rural demand  turned negative in September. Growth in two-wheeler sales, another indicator of rural demand, rebounded in October, supported by a base effect. Growth in passenger vehicles sales  an indicator of urban demand  turned marginally positive in October, after three consecutive months of negative growth coincident with changes in mandatory long-term third-party insurance requirements and a sharp increase in fuel prices. Commercial vehicle sales growth remained robust in September-October, despite some deceleration. Railway freight traffic improved markedly in October to touch a five-year high growth. While domestic air passenger traffic sustained robust growth, international passenger traffic contracted. PMI for services registered a sharp uptick in November, driven by new business. The composite PMI output index touched a two-year high of 54.5 in November. Retail inflation, measured by y-o-y change in CPI, declined from 3.7 per cent in September to 3.3 per cent in October. A large fall in food prices pushed food group into deflation and more than offset the increase in inflation in items excluding food and fuel. Adjusting for the estimated impact of an increase in house rent allowance (HRA) for central government employees, headline inflation was 3.1 per cent in October. Within the food and beverages group, deflation in vegetables, pulses and sugar deepened in October. Among other items, there was a broad-based softening across food items, especially cereals, milk, fruits and prepared meals. Milk and milk products inflation softened caused by surplus supplies in the domestic market. Fruits inflation moderated, while prepared meals registered a price decline for the first time in the CPI series. Inflation, however, showed an uptick in meat and fish, and non-alcoholic beverages. Inflation in the fuel and light group remained elevated, driven by liquefied petroleum gas prices in October, tracking international petroleum product prices. Kerosene prices also edged up, reflecting the calibrated increase in their administered price. However, electricity prices softened in October. Inflation in rural fuel items such as firewood and chips and dung cake also moderated. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel accelerated to 6.1 per cent in October; adjusted for the estimated HRA impact, it was 5.9 per cent. Transport and communication registered a marked increase, pulled up by higher petroleum product prices, transportation fares and prices of automobiles. A broad-based increase was also observed in health, household goods and services, and personal care and effects. However, inflation moderated significantly in clothing and footwear, as also housing on waning of the HRA impact of central government employees.4 15. Inflation expectations of households, measured by the November 2018 round of the Reserve Bank's survey, softened by 40 basis points for the three-month ahead horizon over the last round reflecting decline in food and petroleum product prices, while they remained unchanged for the twelve-month ahead horizon. Producers' assessment for input prices inflation eased marginally in Q3 as reported by manufacturing firms polled by the Reserve Bank's IOS. Domestic farm and industrial input costs remained high. Rural wage growth remained muted in Q2, while staff cost growth in the manufacturing sector remained elevated. The weighted average call rate (WACR) traded below the policy repo rate on 14 out of 21 days in October, on all 18 days in November and both days in December (December 3 and 4). The WACR traded below the repo rate on an average by 5 basis points in October, 9 basis points in November and 16 basis points in December. There was large currency expansion in October and especially during the festive season in November. Currency in circulation, however, contracted in each of the last three weeks in November. Liquidity needs arising from the growth in currency and the Reserve Bank's forex operations were met through a mixture of tools based on an assessment of the evolving liquidity conditions. The Reserve Bank injected durable liquidity amounting to â‚¹360 billion in October and â‚¹500 billion in November through open market purchase operations, bringing total durable liquidity injection to â‚¹1.36 trillion for 2018-19. Liquidity injected under the LAF, on an average daily net basis, was â‚¹560 billion in October, â‚¹806 billion in November and â‚¹105 billion in December (up to December 4). India's merchandise exports rebounded in October 2018, after moderating in the previous month, driven mainly by petroleum products, engineering goods, chemicals, electronics, readymade garments, and gems and jewellery. Imports also grew at a faster pace in October relative to the previous month, contributed mainly by petroleum products and electronic goods. Consequently, the trade deficit widened in October 2018 sequentially as also in comparison with the level a year ago. Provisional data suggest a modest improvement in net exports of services in Q2:2018-19, which augurs well for the current account balance. On the financing side, net FDI flows moderated in April-September 2018. Portfolio flows turned positive in November on account of a sharp decline in oil prices, indications of a less hawkish stance by the US Fed and a softer US dollar. However, during the year, there were net portfolio outflows of US$ 14.8 billion (up to November 30). Non-resident deposits increased markedly in H1:2018-19 on a net basis over their level a year ago. India's foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 393.7 billion on November 30, 2018. Outlook 18. In the fourth bi-monthly resolution of October 2018. CPI inflation was projected at 4.0 per cent in Q2:2018-19, 3.9-4.5 per cent in H2 and 4.8 per cent in Q1:2019-20, with risks somewhat to the upside. Excluding the HRA impact. CPI inflation was projected at 3.7 per cent in Q2:2018-19, 3.8-4.5 per cent in H2 and 4.8 per cent in Q1:2019-20. The actual inflation outcome in Q2 at 3.9 per cent was marginally lower than the projection of 4.0 per cent. However, the October inflation print at 3.3 per cent turned out to be unexpectedly low. There have been several important developments since the October policy which will have a bearing on the inflation outlook. First, despite a significant scaling down of inflation projections in the October policy primarily due to moderation in food inflation, subsequent readings have continued to surprise on the downside with the food group slipping into deflation. At a disaggregated level, deflation in pulses, vegetables and sugar widened, while cereals inflation moderated sequentially. The broad-based weakening of food prices imparts downward bias to the headline inflation trajectory, going forward. Secondly, in contrast to the food group, there has been a broad-based increase in inflation in non-food groups. Thirdly, international crude oil prices have declined sharply since the last policy; the price of Indian5 crude basket collapsed to below US$ 60 a barrel by end-November after touching US$ 85 a barrel in early October. However, selling prices, as reported by firms polled in the Reserve Bank's latest IOS, are expected to edge up further in Q4 on the back of increased demand. Fourthly, global financial markets have continued to be volatile with EME currencies showing a somewhat appreciating bias in the last one month. Finally, the effect of the 7th Central Pay Commission's HRA increase has continued to wane along expected lines. Taking all these factors into consideration and assuming a normal monsoon in 2019, inflation is projected at 2.7-3.2 per cent in H2:2018-19 and 3.8-4.2 per cent in H1:2019-20, with risks tilted to the upside (Chart 1). The projected inflation path remains unchanged after adjusting for the HRA impact of central government employees as this impact dissipates completely from December 2018 onwards. Although recent food inflation prints have surprised on the downside and prices of petroleum products have softened considerably, it is important to monitor their evolution closely and allow heightened short-term uncertainties to be resolved by incoming data. Turning to growth projections, although Q2 growth was lower than that projected in the October policy. GDP growth in H1 has been broadly along the line in the April policy when for the year as a whole GDP growth was projected at 7.4 per cent. Going forward, lower rabi sowing may adversely affect agriculture and hence rural demand. Financial market volatility, slowing global demand and rising trade tensions pose negative risk to exports. However, on the positive side, the decline in crude oil prices is expected to boost India's growth prospects by improving corporate earnings and raising private consumption through higher disposable incomes. Increased capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector also portends well for new capacity additions. There has been significant acceleration in investment activity and high frequency indicators suggest that it is likely to be sustained. Credit offtake from the banking sector has continued to strengthen even as global financial conditions have tightened. FDI flows could also increase with the improving prospects of the external sector. The demand outlook as reported by firms polled in the Reserve Bank's IOS has improved in Q4. Based on an overall assessment. GDP growth for 2018-19 has been projected at 7.4 per cent (7.2-7.3 per cent in H2) as in the October policy, and for H1:2019-20 at 7.5 per cent, with risks somewhat to the downside (Chart 2).6 21. Even as inflation projections have been revised downwards significantly and some of the risks pointed out in the last resolution have been mitigated, especially of crude oil prices, several uncertainties still cloud the inflation outlook. First, inflation projections incorporate benign food prices based on the realised outcomes of food inflation in recent months. The prices of several food items are at unusually low levels and there is a risk of sudden reversal, especially of volatile perishable items. Secondly, available data suggest that the effect of revision in minimum support prices (MSPs) announced in July on prices has been subdued so far. However, uncertainty continues about the exact impact of MSP on inflation, going forward. Thirdly, the medium-term outlook for crude oil prices is still uncertain due to global demand conditions, geo-political tensions and decision of OPEC which could impinge on supplies. Fourthly, global financial markets continue to be volatile. Fifthly, though households' near-term inflation expectations have moderated in the latest round of the Reserve Bank's survey, one-year ahead expectations remain elevated and unchanged. Sixthly, fiscal slippages, if any, at the centre/state levels, will influence the inflation outlook, heighten market volatility and crowd out private investment. Finally, the staggered impact of HRA revision by State Governments may push up headline inflation. While the MPC will look through the statistical impact of HRA revisions, it will be watchful of any second-round effects on inflation. The MPC noted that the benign outlook for headline inflation is driven mainly by the unexpected softening of food inflation and collapse in oil prices in a relatively short period of time. Excluding food items, inflation has remained sticky and elevated, and the output gap remains virtually closed. The MPC also noted that even as escalating trade tensions, tightening of global financial conditions and slowing down of global demand pose some downside risks to the domestic economy, the decline in oil prices in recent weeks, if sustained, will provide tailwinds. The acceleration in investment activity also bodes well for the medium-term growth potential of the economy. The time is apposite to further strengthen domestic macroeconomic fundamentals. In this context, fiscal discipline is critical to create space for and crowd in private investment activity. Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate on hold and maintain the stance of calibrated tightening. While the decision on keeping the policy rate unchanged was unanimous. Dr.Ravindra H. Dholakia voted to change the stance to neutral. The MPC reiterates its commitment to achieving the medium-term target for headline inflation of 4 per cent on a durable basis. The minutes of the MPC's meeting will be published by December 19, 2018. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled from February 5 to 7, 2019. Jose J.

Poland,2018-12-05,"Warsaw, 5 December 2018 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 4-5 December 2018 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: â–ª reference rate at 1.50%; â–ª lombard rate at 2.50%; â–ª deposit rate at 0.50%; â–ª rediscount rate at 1.75%. Global economic conditions remain favourable, although incoming data suggest a weakening in some economies. In the euro area. GDP growth declined in 2018 Q3, and incoming data indicate a gradual economic slowdown. In the United States. GDP data for 2018 Q3 confirmed that economic conditions in this country are still very strong. In turn, in China activity growth is gradually slowing. Heightened uncertainty about the global economic outlook persists, which has an adverse effect on the prices of some assets in the international financial markets. At the same time, global oil prices have fallen sharply in the recent period. Inflation is still elevated in many countries due to the earlier increase in energy prices. At the same time, core inflation in the environment of the Polish economy, including the euro area, remains moderate. The European Central Bank keeps interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero. At the same time, the ECB continues to purchase financial assets, although it has announced the termination of the purchases by the end of the year. The Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged in November, after another interest rate hike in September. In Poland, preliminary GDP data for 2018 Q3 point to a strong economic conditions. GDP growth is still driven by rising  albeit at a slightly lower rate than in the previous quarters  consumption, that is fuelled by increasing employment and wages as well as very high consumer sentiment. In 2018 Q3, this was accompanied by a marked rise in investment. Amid relatively high growth of domestic demand and the weakening of economic conditions in Poland's external environment, net exports had a negative contribution to GDP growth. Notwithstanding relatively high economic growth and wages rising faster than in the previous year, annual consumer price growth has declined and remains moderate. At the same time, inflation net of food and energy prices continues to be low. In the Council's assessment, current information points to a relatively favourable outlook for economic conditions in Poland, although a gradual slowing in GDP growth is expected in the years ahead. In 2019 inflation might be increased by rising energy prices, i.e. factor beyond the control of monetary policy. The scale of energy price growth in 2019 1/2 will probably be limited by the fall in oil prices seen in recent months. In the medium term, in turn, the expected slowdown in economic growth will have a dampening effect on inflation. Consequently, in the monetary policy transmission horizon inflation will remain close to the target. The Council judges that the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on a sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability."
Brazil,2018-12-12,"The Copom unanimously decided to maintain the Selic rate at 6.50% p.a. The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario:. Recent data on economic activity continue to indicate gradual recovery of the Brazilian economy. The global outlook remains challenging for emerging economies. The main risks are associated with an increase in risk aversion in global financial markets, with normalization of interest rates in some advanced economies, and with uncertainty regarding global trade. The Committee judges that various measures of underlying inflation are running at appropriate or comfortable levels. This includes the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy. Inflation expectations for 2018, 2019 and 2020 collected by the Focus survey are around 3.7%, 4.1% and 4.0%, respectively. Expectations for 2021 are around 3.75%; and. The Copom's inflation projections in the scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the Focus survey stand around 3.7% for 2018, 3.9% for 2019, and 3.6% for 2020. This scenario assumes a path for the Selic rate that ends 2018 at 6.5% p.a., increases to 7.5% p.a. over the course of 2019, and reaches 8.0% p.a. by 2020. It also assumes a path for the exchange rate that ends 2018 at R$/US$ 3.78, and ends both 2019 and 2020 at R$/US$ 3.80. In the scenario with a constant interest rate, at 6.5% p.a., and a constant exchange rate, at R$/US$ 3.85*, the projections for 2018, 2019, and 2020 stand around 3.7%, 4.0%, and 4.0%, respectively. The Committee emphasizes that risks around its baseline scenario remain in both directions, but with larger weight on the last two risks. On the one hand, the high level of economic slack may lead to a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory. On the other hand, frustration of expectations regarding the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy may affect risk premia and increase the path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy. This risk intensifies in case the global outlook for emerging economies deteriorates. The Committee judges that risk has increased, whereas risk has moderated. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the wide array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to maintain the Selic rate at 6.50% p.a. The Committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation and the associated balance of risks, and is consistent with convergence of inflation to target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, which includes 2019 and, with a smaller weight, 2020. The Copom reiterates that economic conditions prescribe stimulative monetary policy, i.e., interest rates below the structural level. The Copom emphasizes that the evolution of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy is essential to maintain low inflation in the medium and long run, for the reduction of its structural interest rate, and for sustainable economic recovery. The Committee stresses that the perception of continuation of the reform agenda affects current expectations and macroeconomic projections. In the Copom's assessment, the evolution of the baseline scenario and of the balance of risks prescribes keeping the Selic rate at its current level. The Copom emphasizes that the next steps in the conduct of monetary policy will continue to depend on the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, and on inflation projections and expectations. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Ilan Goldfajn (Governor). Carlos Viana de Carvalho. Carolina de Assis Barros. Mauricio Costa de Moura. Otavio Ribeiro Damaso. Paulo Srgio Neves de Souza. Reinaldo Le Grazie. Sidnei Corr=AAa Marques, and Tiago Couto Berriel. *Value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average R$/US$ exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the Friday prior to the Copom meeting."
Georgia,2018-12-12,"The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on December 12, 2018 and decided to keep the refinancing rate unchanged at 7.00 percent. The annual inflation has decreased in the beginning of 2018 and, in line with forecasts, remains mostly below the target rate of 3%. In November the annual inflation stood at 1.9%. According to current forecast, other things equal the inflation will fluctuate around the target rate in the medium term. In July 2018 the NBG started the gradual easing of the monetary policy. As declared on the previous MPC meetings this normalization process will be slow, taking into account the possible transmission of regional risks on inflation. In spite of the decrease in the macroeconomic risks coming from the external sector, the inflation forecast is still affected by uncertainties. Hence the MPC decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at this stage. The speed of normalization will depend on how fast the output gap will close on one hand and how strongly the increased regional macroeconomic risks will be transmitted to Georgian economy  on the other. The positive trends in the external sector have been maintained. Goods export annual growth rate in the first ten months of 2018 was 25% whereas the tourism revenues have grown by 20% in the same period. The positive trend has continued in the growth of the remittances from abroad  16% annually. The credit growth is high as well, supporting the aggregate demand. In the recent month leading indicators have been pointing to the acceleration in economic growth. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all means and instruments at its disposal in order to ensure the price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on January 30, 2019."
Philippines,2018-12-12,"At its meeting on monetary policy today, the Monetary Board decided to keep the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) facility unchanged at 4.75 percent. The interest rates on the overnight lending and deposit facilities were likewise held steady. In deciding to maintain the BSP's monetary policy settings, the Monetary Board noted that the latest inflation forecasts show a lower path over the policy horizon, with inflation settling within the target band of 3.0 percent Â± 1.0 percentage point for 2019-2020. Recent headline inflation readings indicate signs of receding price pressures as constraints on food supply continue to ease with the implementation of various non-monetary measures. Inflation expectations have also steadied given the decline in international crude oil prices and the stabilization of the peso. Meanwhile, the risks to the inflation outlook have become more evenly balanced for 2019 and leans toward the downside for 2020 amid a more uncertain global economic environment, which could further mitigate upward pressures from commodity prices in the coming months. Given these considerations, the Monetary Board deemed it prudent for the time being to keep monetary policy settings steady and allow previous monetary responses to continue to work their way through the economy. The Monetary Board emphasizes that it remains vigilant against developments that could affect the outlook for inflation and financial stability. The BSP is prepared to take further policy action as appropriate to safeguard its price stability mandate."
Euroarea,2018-12-13,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup. Mr Centeno. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We continue to expect them to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, our net purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) will end in December 2018. At the same time, we are enhancing our forward guidance on reinvestment. Accordingly, we intend to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. While incoming information has been weaker than expected, reflecting softer external demand but also some country and sector-specific factors, the underlying strength of domestic demand continues to underpin the euro area expansion and gradually rising inflation pressures. This supports our confidence that the sustained convergence of inflation to our aim will proceed and will be maintained even after the end of our net asset purchases. At the same time, uncertainties related to geopolitical factors, the threat of protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility remain prominent. Significant monetary policy stimulus is still needed to support the further build-up of domestic price pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term. Our forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates, reinforced by the reinvestments of the sizeable stock of acquired assets, continues to provide the necessary degree of monetary accommodation for the sustained convergence of inflation to our aim. In any event, the Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation continues to move towards the Governing Council's inflation aim in a sustained manner. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro area real GDP increased by 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2018, following growth of 0.4% in the previous two quarters. The latest data and survey results have been weaker than expected, reflecting a diminishing contribution from external demand and some country and sector-specific factors. While some of these factors are likely to unwind, this may suggest some slower growth momentum ahead. At the same time, domestic demand, also backed by our accommodative monetary policy stance, continues to underpin the economic expansion in the euro area. The strength of the labour market, as reflected in ongoing employment gains and rising wages, still supports private consumption. Moreover, business investment is benefiting from domestic demand, favourable financing conditions and improving balance sheets. In addition, the expansion in global activity is still expected to continue, supporting euro area exports, although at a slower pace. This assessment is broadly reflected in the December 2018 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. Compared with the September 2018 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real GDP growth has been revised slightly down in 2018 and 2019. The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook can still be assessed as broadly balanced. However, the balance of risks is moving to the downside owing to the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors, the threat of protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation declined to 2.0% in November 2018, from 2.2% in October, reflecting mainly a decline in energy inflation. On the basis of current futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to decrease over the coming months. Measures of underlying inflation remain generally muted, but domestic cost pressures are continuing to strengthen and broaden amid high levels of capacity utilisation and tightening labour markets, which is pushing up wage growth. Looking ahead, underlying inflation is expected to increase over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the ongoing economic expansion and rising wage growth. This assessment is also broadly reflected in the December 2018 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation at 1.8% in 2018, 1.6% in 2019, 1.7% in 2020 and 1.8% in 2021. Compared with the September 2018 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for HICP inflation has been revised slightly up for 2018 and down for 2019. Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) growth stood at 3.9% in October 2018, after 3.6% in September. Apart from some volatility in monthly flows. M3 growth continues to be supported by bank credit creation. The narrow monetary aggregate M1 remained the main contributor to broad money growth. In line with the upward trend observed since the beginning of 2014, the growth of loans to the private sector continues to support the economic expansion. The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations stood at 3.9% in October 2018, after 4.3% in September, while the annual growth rate of loans to households remained unchanged at 3.2%. The pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014 continues to significantly support borrowing conditions for firms and households, access to financing  in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises  and credit flows across the euro area. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed that an ample degree of monetary accommodation is still necessary for the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute more decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential and reducing vulnerabilities. The implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up to increase resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost euro area productivity and growth potential. Regarding fiscal policies, the Governing Council reiterates the need for rebuilding fiscal buffers. This is particularly important in countries where government debt is high and for which full adherence to the Stability and Growth Pact is critical for safeguarding sound fiscal positions. Likewise, the transparent and consistent implementation of the EU's fiscal and economic governance framework over time and across countries remains essential to bolster the resilience of the euro area economy. Improving the functioning of Economic and Monetary Union remains a priority. The Governing Council welcomes the ongoing work and urges further specific and decisive steps to complete the banking union and the capital markets union. Further information on the technical parameters of the reinvestments will be released at 15:30 CET on the ECB's website."
Peru,2018-12-13,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR DECEMBER 2018 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 2.75% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 2.75 percent. This decision takes into account the following factors: In November, the YoY inflation rate and trend inflation indicators showed levels within the inflation target range; The expected YoY inflation rate was 2.48 percent in November; Economic activity indicators show higher dynamism in the fourth quarter, even though the output level remains below its potential, and Greater risk on global economic activity and increased financial volatility, both associated to recent commercial tensions and uncertainty in financial markets. The YoY inflation rate is projected to remain within the target range and around 2.0 percent. The Board considers that it is appropriate to maintain an expansionary policy stance while inflation expectations are anchored in a context in which the level of economic activity is below its potential. Recent indicators of inflation and activity reflect the following: Inflation in November showed a rate of 0.12 percent, as a result of which the YoY inflation rate rose from 1.8 percent in October to 2.2 percent in November 2018. Moreover, inflation excluding food and energy recorded a rate of 0.07 percent, as a result of which the YoY rate rose from 2.1 percent in October to 2.2 percent in November. Most indicators of business expectations have improved and remain on the optimistic side. Furthermore, indicators of economic activity continue recovering. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 1.50 percent in annual terms. Direct security and currency repos and rediscount operations: 3.30 percent for the first 10 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 10 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 3.30 percent. The Monetary Program for the following 12 months will be approved on the Board meetings to be held on the following dates: January 10 February 7 March 7 April 11 May 9 June 13 July 11 August 8 September 12 October 10 November 7 December 12 In 2019, the BCRP will publish its first Inflation Report on March 29."
Turkiye,2018-12-13,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the policy rate (one-week repo auction rate) constant at 24 percent. Recently released data show that rebalancing trend in the economy has become more noticeable. External demand maintains its strength while slowdown in economic activity continues, partly due to tighter financial conditions. While developments in import prices and domestic demand conditions have led to some improvement in the inflation outlook, risks on price stability continue to prevail. Accordingly, the Committee has decided to maintain the tight monetary policy stance until inflation outlook displays a significant improvement. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior, lagged impact of recent monetary policy decisions, contribution of fiscal policy to rebalancing process, and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Ukraine,2018-12-13,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to keep its key policy rate at 18.0% per annum. The current and forecast monetary conditions are sufficiently tight to bring inflation to its medium-term target of 5% in 2020. In November 2018, annual consumer price inflation came in at 10.0% and was close to the NBU's latest forecast published in the October 2018 Inflation Report. The acceleration of inflation as compared to previous months was anticipated and driven by several reasons. First, the underlying inflationary pressure remained high. Last month, core inflation increased slightly to reach 8.9% yoy, pushed up by the further growth in production costs, wages in particular, and the pressure from consumer demand. Second, administered prices were a major inflation factor, as natural gas prices for households grew in November. However, inflation is expected to decline and reach the 5.0% target at the end of 2020, as projected in the NBU's October Inflation Report. Tight monetary conditions will be the main factor behind the deceleration of inflation. In particular, interest rates on hryvnia household deposits continue to grow, as expected, in response to the previous key policy rate hikes. This makes saving more attractive and restrains consumer demand. At the same time, pro-inflation risks have weakened since the previous decision due to a number of new favorable factors  both internal and external. the record harvest of corn and sunflower, which will make these crops and related products cheaper (sunflower oil, feed, etc.)a drop in global energy prices that will gradually pass through to domestic pricesarrangements reached between the US and China to stop raising tariffs, which reduces the risk of global trade warsexpectations of a less aggressive interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve System next yearfavorable FX market conditions. These factors, together with a tight fiscal policy, increased the net supply of foreign currency on the interbank market, and a strengthening in the hryvnia exchange rate in November and December. The surfeit of foreign currency on the FX market enabled the NBU to further increase international reserves  since the beginning of Q4, the central bank has purchased over USD 700 million net.Important is also the significant progress achieved in continuing cooperation with the IMF under a new stand-by arrangement, as well as receiving related financing from other official lenders. This was a key assumption of the NBU's macroeconomic forecast. These factors have led to a reasonably fast improvement in the inflation expectations of households, which, however, continue to exceed the central bank's inflation target by a large margin. However, there are significant risks which, when materialized, could delay the NBU's meeting its inflation target:. robust consumer demand, fueled, among other things, by higher wages, putting further pressure on pricesa worsening of expectations, due to a new political cyclegeopolitical risks, such as an escalation of the Azov Sea conflict, which could cut export earningsthe expected slowdown in the global economy, including in the economies of Ukraine's main trading partners.When making its previous monetary policy decision in October, the NBU said that it could raise the key policy rate again if inflation pressures did not ease or even build up. In light of weakening pro-inflation risks, the NBU Board has decided to keep the key policy rate unchanged. Meanwhile, risks to inflation decreasing to its 5% target still remain high. If these risks materialize, the NBU may raise the key policy rate to a level required to bring inflation back to its target within a reasonable timeframe. The decision to keep the key policy rate at 18.0% has been approved by NBU Board Policy Rate Decision No. 834, dated 13 December 2018. A summary of the discussion by Monetary Policy Committee members that preceded this decision will be published on 26 December 2018. The next meeting of the NBU Board on monetary policy issues will be held on 31 January 2019 as scheduled."
Mongolia,2018-12-14,"MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Keeping the policy rate unchanged Number: 2018/05 Effective date: 14 December 2018 The Monetary Policy Committee meeting was held on 14 December 2018, and it was decided to keep the Policy rate unchanged at 11 percent. As of November, annual inflation has reached 8.1 percent nationwide. Due to supply related factors prices of meat, gasoline and solid fuel increased, thus made significant contributions to the annual inflation. In the following year, rising wages and expanding domestic demand are likely to increase demand pull effect on inflation. Gradual recovery in economic growth is expected to keep its momentum in the following year. Regardless of the ongoing uncertainty in the external environment, exchange rate of togrog has stabilized, supported by surplus in foreign trade balance and lower deficit in balance of payments in the first 11 months of the year. Considering factors underlying the inflation, their outlook and the sentiment in business environment, the Monetary Policy Committee decided to keep the policy rate unchanged this time. The decision is consistent with the Bank's mandate to keep inflation rate around the target rate and is intended to sustain macroeconomic stability in the medium term. Extracts of the meeting minutes will be released in two weeks on the Bank of Mongolia's website. MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE."
Russia,2018-12-14,"On 14 December 2018, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to raise the key rate by 0.25 pp to 7.75% per annum. The decision taken is proactive in nature and is aimed at limiting inflation risks that remain elevated, especially over the short-term horizon. There presists uncertainty over future external conditions, as well as over the reaction of prices and inflation expectations to the upcoming VAT rate increase. The increase in the key rate will help prevent firm inflation anchoring at the level significantly exceeding the Bank of Russia's target. Taking into account the decision taken, the Bank of Russia forecasts annual inflation to be 5-5.5% by the end of 2019 and its return to 4% in 2020. The Bank of Russia will consider the necessity of further increases in the key rate, taking into account inflation and economic dynamics against the forecast, as well as risks posed by external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. Inflation dynamics. At the end of 2018, inflation is expected to be close to 4%, which corresponds to the Bank of Russia's target. In November, the annual consumer price growth rose to 3.8% (3.9%, according to the estimates as of 10 December). This November's upward movement of inflation was largely driven by annual food price growth accelerating from 2.7% to 3.5%. This was supported by changes in the balance of supply and demand in certain food markets. Prices are further adjusting to the ruble exchange rate that has weakened since the beginning of the year. Consumer price growth is starting to be affected by the VAT increase scheduled to take effect from 1 January 2019. According to Bank of Russia estimates, most inflation indicators reflecting the most sustainable price movements are growing. The price expectations of businesses increased, triggered by the weakening of the ruble which took place since the beginning of the year and the forthcoming VAT rise. Household inflation expectations rose in November. Uncertainty persists over their subsequent movements. The situation in the domestic financial market remained stable in November and the first half of December and did not pose any additional inflation risks. The Bank of Russia's forecast assumes consumer price growth rate at 3.9-4.2% by the end of 2018. The VAT hike and the weakening of the ruble that took place in 2018 are expected to trigger a temporary acceleration in annual inflation, which will peak in the first six months of 2019 and run at 5.0-5.5% by the end of 2019. Quarterly year-on-year consumer price growth will draw close to 4% as early as the second half of 2019. Annual inflation will slow down to 4% in the first half of 2020 when the effects of the ruble's weakening and the VAT rise peter out. The increase in the key rate is proactive in nature and will help limit the risks of firm inflation anchoring at the level significantly exceeding the Bank of Russia's target. The forecast takes into account the Bank of Russia's decision to resume regular foreign currency purchases in the domestic market under the fiscal rule from 15 January 2019. Monetary conditions. A certain tightening in monetary conditions is still ongoing. OFZ yields remain markedly above this year's Q1 readings. A further rise in interest rates is progressing in the deposit and credit market. The increase in the key rate by the Bank of Russia will help maintain real interest rates on deposits in the positive territory, which will support the attractiveness of savings and balanced growth in consumption. Economic activity. Russian economic growth slowed down slightly, remaining close to its potential. In 2018 Q3, annual GDP growth slipped to 1.5%, consistent with the Bank of Russia's forecast, mostly due to the high base effect in agriculture. Industrial output continued its annual growth in October with sectoral trends remaining mixed. Consumer demand growth slowed down, as compared to previous months. Its expansion is largely based on the non-food sales. Investment activity continued to rise in the third quarter. The Bank of Russia keeps unchanged its 2018 annual GDP growth forecast of 1.5-2%. The Bank of Russia's view of the Russian economy's mid-term growth prospects has remained mainly unchanged. Due to the budget rule, the decrease in the 2019 average annual oil price from 63 to 55 US dollars per barrel in the baseline scenario will have little influence on macroeconomic fundamentals. In 2019, the forthcoming VAT increase might have a slight constraining effect on business activity (mostly in the beginning of the year). The newly attracted budgetary funds will be used to boost government spending, including spending on investments, as early as 2019. As a result, according to the Bank of Russia forecast. GDP growth in 2019 will range between 1.2% and 1.7%. The following years might see higher growth rates as the planned structural measures are implemented. Inflation risks. The balance of risks remains skewed towards pro-inflationary risks, especially over a short-term horizon. High uncertainty over future external conditions and their impact on financial asset prices still remains. In the fourth quarter, oil prices remain above 55 US dollars per barrel included in the baseline scenario assumptions for 2019-2021. However, the risks of supply exceeding demand in the oil market in 2019 have increased. Potential capital outflow from emerging markets coupled by geopolitical factors might enhance volatility in financial markets and affect exchange rate and inflation expectations. There presists uncertainty over the reaction of prices and inflation expectations to the upcoming VAT rate increase and to the influence of other proinflationary factors. The Bank of Russia leaves mostly unchanged its estimates of risks associated with wage movements, possible changes in consumer behaviour and budget expenditures. These risks remain moderate. The Bank of Russia will consider the necessity of further increases in the key rate, taking into account inflation and economic dynamics against the forecast, as well as risks posed by external conditions and the reaction of financial markets. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next key rate review meeting on 8 February 2018. The Board decision press release is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time.

Hungary,2018-12-18,"At its meeting on 18 December 2018, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 19 December 2018:. The Magyar Nemzeti Bank's (MNB) single anchor is inflation, its primary objective is to ensure that the consumer price index meets the 3 percent target in a sustainable manner. The volatility of inflation has increased significantly. Therefore, in assessing the outlook, the Monetary Council pays even more attention than usual to developments in the measures of underlying inflation capturing persistent trends. Core inflation excluding indirect tax effects has been rising, which signals the strengthening of persistent inflationary trends. The Hungarian economy has grown dynamically in 2018; however, if the assumptions of the current projection hold, economic growth is likely to slow gradually from 2019. Regarding long-term, sustainable economic growth, the improvement in competitiveness will be given increasing emphasis. During the autumn months of 2018, volatile items, sensitive to movements in global commodity prices, led to a greater-than-usual volatility of inflation. As a result, the consumer price index rose to 3.8 percent in October, then decreased significantly to 3.1 percent in November. The moderation in inflation was mainly due to a fall in fuel prices in November. However, underlying inflation capturing persistent trends continued to rise. In November, core inflation excluding indirect tax effects increased to 2.7 percent. Over the short term, the volatility of inflation remains elevated. After a temporary rise in the first quarter of 2019, the consumer price index is expected to fall below 3 percent. In assessing the sustainable achievement of the inflation target over the monetary policy horizon, the Monetary Council pays even more attention than usual to developments in the measures of underlying inflation capturing persistent inflationary trends. In parallel with strong domestic demand, core inflation excluding indirect tax effects is likely to rise above 3 percent in early 2019 and then stays close to 3 percent over the monetary policy horizon. Over the period ahead, incoming data will be key in the assessment of persistent inflationary trends. According to the detailed data release, the Hungarian economy grew dynamically, by 4.9 percent, in the third quarter of 2018 relative to a year earlier. Household consumption and investment continued to increase. Labour demand remained strong, and the unemployment rate was close to its historically low level. The country's balance of goods decreased, mainly reflecting robust domestic investment growth and a couple of one-off items. The surplus of the services balance grew significantly. The current account remained in remarkable surplus. Lending to the corporate and household sectors continued to expand in October; however, the proportion of long-term, fixed-rate lending to the corporate sector continued to be low. Economic growth is expected to continue across a broad range of sectors. Strong domestic demand will continue to play a central role in economic output developments in the coming years. The Hungarian economy has grown dynamically in 2018; however, if the assumptions of the current projection hold, economic growth will slow gradually from 2019. The country's current account balance is expected to remain in positive territory over the longer term as temporary factors fade and as the surplus of the services balance grows dynamically. The fundamentals of the Hungarian economy are strong, and convergence to developed economies has continued. Regarding long-term, sustainable growth, the improvement in competitiveness will be given increasing emphasis. Sentiment in international financial markets has been volatile in the period since the Council's previous interest rate decision. The main factors influencing investors' appetite for risk were expectations about the monetary policy of the world's leading central banks and uncertainties related to international trade policies, the debate of Italy's government budget and the Brexit agreement. Amid increased volatility, oil prices have fallen since the Council's previous interest rate decision. The current international environment continues to suggest a more cautious approach. The Monetary Council assesses these developments in light of their relevance to persistent inflationary trends. As regards the external environment, euro-area economic growth fell behind expectations in the third quarter of 2018. The persistence of these developments is uncertain. Headline inflation has been around the 2 percent target, while core inflation staying close to 1 percent persistently signals moderate underlying inflation. Therefore, market expectations about the timing of the first interest rate increase by the European Central Bank (ECB) have shifted to a later date. This suggests that monetary conditions in the euro area may remain loose for a longer period of time. In terms of the outlook for domestic inflation, the probability of core inflation excluding indirect tax effects capturing persistent trends rising above 3 percent has increased. However, loose monetary conditions in the euro area may remain for a longer period of time. The main factor among these, determining the MNB's monetary policy decisions, is developments in persistent domestic inflationary trends. The Monetary Council is prepared for the gradual and cautious normalisation of monetary policy, which will begin with the modification of unconventional instruments. Consistent with the instrument strategy adopted by the Council, looking ahead, the Bank will adjust monetary conditions by creating an optimal combination of two of its instruments: the stock of swap instruments providing forint liquidity and the interest rate corridor. As part of the fine-tuning of unconventional policy instruments affecting long-term yields, mortgage bond purchases will end, and the monetary policy IRS instrument will be phased out by the end of 2018. In addition, the Funding for Growth Scheme Fix will be launched with a total amount of HUF 1,000 billion in January 2019 to raise the proportion of long-term, fixed-rate lending. The MNB will sterilise the liquidity provided under this programme by a preferential deposit facility bearing interest at the central bank base rate. The Monetary Council left monetary conditions unchanged. In line with this, the Council held the base rate, the overnight collateralised lending rate and the one-week collateralised lending rate at 0.9 percent and the overnight deposit rate at -0.15 percent. In addition, the Council left the average amount of liquidity to be crowded-out for the first quarter of 2019 unchanged, at least at HUF 400-600 billion. On the next occasion, in March 2019, the Council will decide on the amount of liquidity to be crowded out and will take this into account in setting the stock of central bank swap instruments. The Monetary Council is prepared for the gradual and cautious normalisation of monetary policy, which will begin depending on the persistent inflationary developments. Core inflation excluding indirect tax effects is likely to continue to rise in the coming quarters, which the Council will assess in terms of the sustainable achievement of the inflation target. In the period ahead, therefore, incoming data will be of key relevance. The Monetary Council closely monitors incoming macroeconomic data and will decide to adjust monetary conditions depending on their outcome."
Thailand,2018-12-19,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 8/2018 Mr. Titanun Mallikamas. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 19 December 2018 as follows. The Committee voted 5 to 2 to raise the policy rate by 025 percentage point from 150 to 175 percent, effective immediately. Two members voted to maintain the policy rate at 150 percent. In deliberating their policy decision, the Committee assessed that the Thai economy continued to gain traction on the back of domestic demand while external demand slowed down. Headline and core inflation were projected to be broadly in line with the previous assessment. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative and conducive to economic growth. Financial stability remained sound overall, but it was deemed necessary to monitor risks that might lead to the build-up of vulnerabilities in the financial system in the future. The Committee viewed that the prolonged low policy rate had contributed to the economy expanding at the level consistent with its potential and the inflation target. Thus most members viewed that the need for accommodative monetary policy as in the previous period had reduced, and voted to raise the policy rate at this meeting in order to curb financial stability risks and to start building policy space. Most members viewed that the policy rate at 175 percent would remain conducive to economic growth. Two members viewed that risks and uncertainties on the external front heightened and could affect Thailand's economic growth in the period ahead, and thus saw the need to assess the clarity of impacts of external factors as well as sustainability of domestic growth momentum for some time. In addition, the implemented macroprudential measures had addressed certain risks in the financial stability to some extent. The Thai economy as a whole continued to gain traction, consistent with its potential, although merchandise exports were affected by the projected slowdown in the global economy as well as trade protectionism measures between the US and China. Meanwhile tourism exhibited slower growth especially due to the decline in the number of Chinese tourists but started to show signs of improvement. Domestic demand momentum continued to expand. Private consumption was expected to expand on the back of increasingly broad-based improvements in non-farm income as well as additional supports from government measures, while household income in the agricultural sector slightly declined. Nevertheless private consumption was restrained by elevated household debt. Private investment was projected to expand thanks to the relocation of production base to Thailand and public-private partnership projects for infrastructure investment. Public expenditure would grow at a slower pace than previously assessed due to delayed investment by some state-owned enterprises. The Committee would monitor risks associated with trade protectionism measures between the US and China that could affect momentum of economic growth in the period ahead. 2 The annual average of headline inflation projection was expected to be broadly unchanged. However downside risks remained due to fluctuations in energy and fresh food prices. Core inflation was projected to rise given the gradually rising demand-pull inflationary pressures. The Committee viewed that structural changes contributed to more persistent inflation than in the past. Such changes included the expansion of e-commerce, rising price competition, and technological development which reduced costs of production. Financial conditions over the previous period had been accommodative and conducive to economic growth with ample liquidity in the financial system. Real interest rates remained low, allowing financing by the private sector to continue expanding. Loans extended to businesses and consumer continued to grow. The Committee assessed that, although the policy rate increased by 025 percent, overall financial conditions would remain accommodative and conducive to economic growth. With regard to exchange rates, movements of the baht against the US dollar were broadly stabilized compared with those of regional currencies. Looking ahead, the baht would likely remain volatile, and thus the Committee would continue to closely monitor exchange rate developments as well as impacts on the economy. Financial stability remained sound overall but there remained a need to monitor risks arising from the prolonged low interest rate environment that might pose vulnerabilities to financial stability in the future, especially the search-for-yield behavior that might lead to underpricing of risks. The Committee viewed that the policy rate increase at this meeting would help curb accumulation of vulnerabilities in the financial system in conjunction with the macroprudential measures already implemented. Looking ahead, the Thai economy was projected to continue to gain traction despite the slowdown in external demand. The Committee viewed that accommodative monetary policy would remain appropriate in the period ahead, and thus would continue to closely monitor developments of economic growth, inflation, and financial stability, together with associated risks, in deliberating appropriate monetary policy in the period ahead."
United States,2018-12-19,"EST December 19, 2018 Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in November indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a strong rate. Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Household spending has continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment has moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remain near 2 percent. Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee judges that some further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term. The Committee judges that risks to the economic outlook are roughly balanced, but will continue to monitor global economic and financial developments and assess their implications for the economic outlook. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation (more) For release at 2 p.m. EST December 19, 2018 - 2 - expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Jerome H Powell. Chairman; John C Williams. Vice Chairman; Thomas I Barkin; Raphael W Bostic; Michelle W. Bowman; Lael Brainard; Richard H Clarida; Mary C Daly; Loretta J Mester; and Randal K Quarles."
Czech Republic,2018-12-20,"At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank decided to keep interest rates unchanged. The two-week repo rate thus remains at 1.75%, the discount rate at 0.75% and the Lombard rate at 2.75%. Five members voted in favour of this decision, and two members voted for increasing rates by 25 basis points.. This decision is underpinned by the current macroeconomic forecast and by an assessment of information obtained since the current forecast was prepared. According to the forecast, inflation will increase at the start of next year. In the subsequent period, however, the inflation pressures will ease owing to renewed appreciation of the koruna and a gradual slowdown in wage growth. Inflation will approach the Czech National Bank's 2% target from above over the monetary policy horizon, i.e. in late 2019 and early 2020. Consistent with this forecast is broad interest rate stability next year and then a continued rise in interest rates towards their long-run neutral level. At its meeting today, the Bank Board assessed the risks to the inflation forecast at the monetary policy horizon as being broadly balanced. The outlook for foreign variables has been revised downwards. The producer price forecast has been lowered substantially, especially for next year. The forecast for euro area consumer prices is slightly lower for next year, as is the outlook for foreign economic activity and interest rates. As a result of the observed fall in world prices, the market outlook for the Brent crude oil price is markedly lower over the next two years. The euro-dollar exchange rate has shifted towards a slightly weaker euro in 2019. Domestic inflation declined over the last three months, reaching the 2% target in November. It was lower than forecasted, mainly as a result of an unexpected fade-out of food price growth. Growth in administered prices and fuel prices was also somewhat lower than forecasted, whereas core inflation went up and was slightly above the forecast. The rate of growth of the Czech economy stayed at 2.4% in Q3, although the forecast had expected a slight acceleration. The deviation of economic growth from the forecast was due to a lower contribution of net exports, which was related to a marked pick-up in services imports. Household consumption was also slightly lower than predicted. Faster growth in total investment and government consumption acted in the opposite direction. Monthly indicators suggest continued solid economic growth at the close of this year. Strong growth in household income continues to be reflected in rising retail sales, except in the automotive segment. Industrial production growth has accelerated again in the last two months and the dynamics of construction output remain high. The labour market is creating strong inflationary pressures in line with the forecast. As expected, employment growth recorded a slowdown, albeit a rather more pronounced one than predicted. In line with the forecast, the unemployment rate did not decrease significantly further. Labour shortages coupled with still high labour demand led to a further increase in job vacancies. Growth in total wages remained high in Q3, slightly exceeding our expectations. Wage growth was slightly lower than forecasted in market sectors, but significantly above the forecast in non-market sectors. The koruna-euro exchange rate was almost 1% weaker than forecasted during Q4. It weakened temporarily to CZK 26 to the euro in November and then corrected just below that level. The risk of longer-lasting negative sentiment towards emerging markets persists. This could lead to the koruna being weaker than forecasted in early 2019 as well. To sum up the important facts about recent developments in the Czech economy. GDP and prices are rising at a slower pace than forecasted, whereas total wages are increasing somewhat faster. The unemployment rate is broadly in line with the forecast."
Mexico,2018-12-20,"Banco de Mexico's Governing Board decided to raise the target for the overnight interbank interest rate by 25 basis points to 8.25%. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the world economy seems to have grown at a rate lower than during the first half of the year and with differences among regions and countries. In the United States, although economic activity moderated its rate of growth, it continues to expand at rates above those of the Eurozone. Japan and the United Kingdom. In this environment, world inflation has eased albeit with significant differences among countries. As expected, in December, the Federal Reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate, although signaling that it expects the pace of normalization of its monetary policy stance to be more gradual than as previously announced. For the medium term, global economic activity is foreseen to expand at a moderate rate and will be subject to the risks of an escalation of trade disputes and of a tightening of global financial conditions, although the latter has declined recently. World economic activity could also be affected by oil price volatility and by several political and geopolitical factors. International financial markets have exhibited high volatility and the prices of emerging market assets have deteriorated somewhat, although in the last days they have exhibited some improvement. Since the last monetary policy decision, the prices of financial assets in Mexico continued to exhibit high volatility. In addition to the aforementioned external factors, the Mexican peso exchange rate continued to reflect the uncertainty regarding the policies of the new administration. Additionally, sovereign risk premia and interest rates for the medium and long terms in Mexico showed sizeable increases, which have partially reverted but still remain at high levels. In this regard, conditions in fixed-income markets must be such that they contribute to an orderly adjustment of the economy. Moreover, the current environment poses significant risks in the medium and long terms that could affect the country's macroeconomic conditions, its potential growth, and the economy's price formation process. In this regard, it is particularly important that, in addition to following a prudent and robust monetary policy, measures to foster an environment of confidence and certainty for investment and higher productivity are adopted, public finances are consolidated sustainably, and both transparency and accountability are strengthened. In this context, it is particularly relevant that the fiscal goals included in the Economic Package for 2019 presented to the lower house of Congress, which are based on a prudent macroeconomic scenario for the Mexican economy and have had a favorable impact on domestic financial markets, are attained. During the fourth quarter of 2018, economic activity is expected to have decelerated as compared to the rebound observed in the third quarter. Thus, slack conditions in the economy are estimated to have remained relatively less tight than at the beginning of the year. The balance of risks to growth continues biased to the downside and has deteriorated. Inflation fell from 4.90% in October to 4.72% in November, with both its core and non-core components declining. During such period, non-core inflation fell from 8.50 to 8.07%, reflecting lower increments in energy prices. These results were partially offset by higher increases in the prices of certain agricultural 1 goods, keeping non-core inflation at high levels. Likewise, the shocks that have affected non-core inflation have also influenced core inflation due to the indirect effects they have had on production costs. The latter, together with other structural factors, has contributed to the high degree of inertia to decline shown by this subindex. Thus, core inflation decreased from 3.73% in October to 3.63% in November. Headline inflation expectations for different terms have increased. In particular, those for the end of 2019 rose from 3.71% to 3.89% between October and December, while those for the end of 2020 increased from 3.50% to 3.79% during the same period. In turn, core inflation expectations for the end of 2019 were adjusted upwards from 3.45% to 3.50% during the same period, while those for the end of 2020 were revised from 3.33% to 3.37%, respectively. In turn, headline inflation expectations for the medium and long terms continue to be above the 3% target, at around 3.50%. As for information drawn from market instruments, medium- and long-term inflationary risk premia remain at high levels. Inflation faces risks of a structural nature that stem from the possible adoption of policies that could lead to deep changes in the economy's price formation process. Moreover, there are noteworthy risks within the forecast horizon such as that the peso exchange rate continues to be subject to pressures stemming from external and domestic factors. Should the economy require adjustments either to the real exchange rate or to medium- and long-term interest rates. Banco de Mexico will contribute to making such adjustments occur in an orderly manner, in an effort to prevent second-round effects on the economy's price formation process. Considering the magnitude of the recent minimum wage increases, in addition to their possible direct impact, there is the risk that these bring about wage revisions that exceed productivity gains and create cost pressures, affecting formal employment and prices. To sustainably raise the purchasing power of wages, the role of other public policies must be considered, in particular fostering competition in those sectors of goods and services with a high share in the consumption basket of those segments of the population with the lowest income. On the other hand, inflation could also be affected if new pressures on energy prices arise or if agricultural product prices increase, or if an escalation of protectionist and compensatory measures worldwide materializes or if the public finances deteriorate. Also, due to the observed shocks and the levels reached by inflation, there is the risk of second-round effects on the price formation process. Considering all of the above, the balance of risks for the forecasted trajectory of inflation has deteriorated and remains biased to the upside, in an environment of high uncertainty. To guide its monetary policy actions. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board follows closely the development of inflation vis-Ã -vis its forecasted trajectory, taking into account the monetary policy stance adopted and the time frame in which monetary policy operates, as well as available information on all inflation determinants and on medium- and long-term inflation expectations, including the balance of risks for such factors. Monetary policy must also respond prudently if for any reason the uncertainty faced by the Mexican economy increases significantly. In this context, considering the environment of high uncertainty, in which the balance of risks for inflation is biased to the upside and some of the risks that might affect it in both the short and long terms have materialized, and in view of the possibility that medium- and long-term inflation expectations may be affected. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board has decided unanimously to raise the target for the overnight interbank interest by 25 basis points to 8.25%. Considering the challenges to consolidate a low and stable inflation, as well as the risks that the economy's price formation process is subject to, the Governing Board will take the necessary actions, specifically, maintaining or, in its case, strengthening the monetary policy stance, so that the reference rate is kept at a level consistent with the convergence of headline inflation to Banco de Mexico's target within the period of influence of monetary policy. Banco de Mexico's Governing Board will maintain a prudent monetary policy stance and, under the current environment of uncertainty, will follow closely the potential pass-through of exchange rate fluctuations to prices, the monetary policy stance relative to that of the U.S. under an adverse external environment, and the conditions of slack in the Mexican economy. In the presence and possible persistence of factors that, by their nature, involve risks to both inflation and inflation expectations, 2 monetary policy will be adjusted in a timely and robust manner to achieve the convergence of inflation to its 3% target and to strengthen the anchoring of medium- and long-term inflation expectations so that they attain such target."
Colombia,2018-12-21,"The Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica, in its meeting today, decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 4.25%. For this decision, the Board mainly took into account the following aspects. In November, yearly inflation and the average of core inflation indicators fell, standing at 3.27% and 3.26%, respectively. Inflation expectations recorded slight changes and remain above 3.0%. To horizons greater than or equal to a year, analysts' expectations stand around 3.4%, and those embedded in public debt bonds close to 3.8%. The Fed increased its benchmark interest rate, and fewer increases are expected in 2019 vis--vis the previous quarter. The fall in oil prices and a lower global growth perspective have been reflected in upward pressures on the country's risk premia and exchange rate. In the third quarter, the dynamics of domestic demand turned out better than expected, mainly driven by investment in construction. The economic activity indicators for the fourth quarter suggest that output growth would be slightly higher than that in the third quarter. With this, the technical staff maintained the economic growth forecast for 2018 at 2.6%, and estimates that under-utilization of the country's productive capacity persists. For 2018, a slightly higher current account deficit as a share of GDP than in 2017 is projected. Based on this information, the Board considered the following factors for its decision. Weakness of the economic activity and uncertainty over its pace of recovery. Observed inflation, its expected convergence to the 3.0% target, and the risks associated with it. The effects on the Colombian economy arising from the changing external conditions. In this environment, upon assessing the economic situation and the risk balance, the Board deemed appropriate to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 4.25%. The Board will continue to carefully monitor the behavior of inflation and the forecasts for economic activity and inflation in the country, as well as the international context. Finally, the Board reiterates that monetary policy will depend on the availability of new information. The decision to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 4.25% was approved unanimously by the Board of Directors. Bogot."
Armenia,2018-12-25,"PRESS RELEASE 25.12.2018 In the December 25, 2018 meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) decided to leave the refinancing rate unchanged: at the level of 6.0%. There was 1.0% inflation in November of 2018 against that of 2.0% registered in the same month of the previous year, which was mainly due to a relatively low growth of prices of seasonal products. In this circumstance, the 12-month inflation rate has reduced to 1.8% at the end of the month. The core inflation rate has also slowed down to some extent. The Board of the CBA estimates that the inflation environment will remain low in the upcoming months and the 12-month inflation rate will be running slightly below the lower part of the confidence band. Global economic growth trends continued evolving in line with the forecasts, under which the central banks of leading countries further tightened their monetary policy conditions. This was concomitant with weakening of the inflation environment in the international markets of basic commodities, and the Board of the CBA considers that no inflationary pressures from the external sector are likely in the coming months. The Board notes that aggregate demand remained relatively weak over the second half of the year due to persisting contractionary stance of the fiscal policy and some weakening of private spending. On the other hand, the low inflation environment amid sluggish private consumption growth rates has contributed to maintaining the real purchasing power and anchoring the inflationary expectations in the country. In the situation described above, the Board of the CBA finds it appropriate to keep the refinancing rate at the current level which is estimated to be more expansionary, taking into account the interest rate rise in partner countries. At the same time, in view of the anticipated macroeconomic developments, to leave monetary conditions expansionary for a longer period of time will be needed for maintaining price stability in the medium run. As a result, the expectation is that inflation will still be running below the lower part of the confidence band and stabilizing around the 4% value at the end of forecast horizon. Risks to fulfillment of the inflation target at the end of forecast horizon are still assessed to be downward, due to external and internal factors. However, should there be risks to the inflation and economic growth outlook deviating from the prediction scenario, the CBA will adjust the monetary policy directions accordingly, while ensuring the price stability. Detailed information that underlies the decision on setting of the interest rate will be available in Press Release (Minutes on Interest Rate) to be published by January 16, 2019. Press Service of the Central Bank of Armenia."
Thailand,2018-12-26,"Outcome of the Joint Meeting between the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) and the Financial Institutions Policy Committee (FIPC) on 21 December 2018 The Bank of Thailand announced the outcome of the joint meeting between the MPC and the FIPC on 21 December 2018 to assess risks to Thailand's financial stability as follows. The committees concluded that Thailand's financial stability remained sound. Economic growth continued to gain traction, while banks and insurance companies maintained high capital buffers. Thailand's external stability remained solid given high international reserves, continued current account surplus, and low external debts. These factors helped cushion the spillover from recent bouts of volatility in global financial markets. However there remained some pockets of risks that could have notable implications on financial stability going forward, two of which were highlighted by the committees. First risks in the real estate sector were noted. Despite some signs of improvement in the housing loan market, there continued to be a need to monitor banks' lending standards, households' debt serviceability, a possible slowdown in foreign demand notably from China, and a surge in supply due to new mixed-use projects. Second the search- for-yield behavior, which could lead to underpricing of risks, continued to persist especially in savings cooperatives and large conglomerates. Fragilities remained in the housing loan market. Risks arising from intense competition in the housing loan market, which had led to lenient lending practices, were addressed to some degree by the new macroprudential measure on housing loans. But going forward, stakeholders' compliance to the new macroprudential measure and households' debt serviceability continued to warrant monitoring. Indeed latest data still showed that the loan-to-income (LTI) ratio continued on an upward trend, while the debt service ratio (DSR) of low-income mortgagors stayed elevated. On the other hand, there continued to be a need to monitor oversupply in the real estate market. Foreign demand, notably from China, had been gaining significance in the condominium market over the past few years. This exposed the Thai real estate market to a possible drag from foreign demand due to China's economic slowdown. For the supply side, office and retail space supply could pick up sharply due to new mixed-use projects especially from 2020 onwards. Based on these assessments, the committees would remain vigilant in monitoring competition in the housing loan market and oversupply conditions in the periods ahead. The search-for-yield behavior continued to persist, which could lead to underpricing of risks. Fixed income funds' investment abroad remained highly concentrated in a small number of destination countries and institutions. Although these countries and institutions possessed high credit ratings and foreign exchange risk was properly hedged, such concentration could make these fixed income funds sensitive to country and counterparty risks. The search-for-yield behavior via savings cooperatives continued to be present, as reflected in high growth of deposits and investments in securities. In addition, some large savings cooperatives raised additional funds via short-term borrowings to invest in securities, which could translate into additional liquidity and market risks. The committees viewed that the draft of the Cooperatives Act, which had been approved by the National Legislative Assembly, would serve as a good starting point in enhancing the supervision of cooperatives. But the committees saw that further improvements were urgently needed in the areas of risk management and governance. Such improvements would help strengthen the savings cooperatives system as a whole, and also ensure that savings cooperatives could operate in line with their underlying philosophy without posing risks to the financial system. Large conglomerates had been raising funds actively during the period of low interest rates, and some of them appeared to channel more investment to non-core businesses and abroad. Such developments could make it difficult to assess risks related to large conglomerates, which could lead to underpricing of risks. Moreover some conglomerates expanded their issuances of perpetual bonds to raise funds. The Office of the Securities and Exchange Commission has been monitoring this trend closely and emphasizing that complete information on associated risks must be provided to investors. In the committees' view, risks related to large conglomerates must be monitored regularly, given their interconnections with the financial system at large due to their complex structure and growing funding activity via loans and debt securities. In the periods ahead. Thailand's financial system could still face several risk factors. Chief among them are heightened volatility in global financial markets, uncertainties in G3 countries' economic and monetary policies, trade protectionism measures, as well as geopolitical risks. Close monitoring is warranted for some pockets of risks that might add vulnerabilities to the Thai financial system. These include: the impact on the real estate sector due to foreign demand slowdown and the surge in supply due to new mixed-use projects; the debt serviceability of households and SMEs in certain industries; and the search-for-yield behavior that could lead to underpricing of risks, especially in savings cooperatives and large conglomerates. The Bank of Thailand, the Office of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Office of Insurance Commission will continue to collaborate closely in assessing and monitoring risks to financial stability. The three regulators will also improve and enforce regulations to cope with emerging risks appropriately. These efforts are aimed at preventing the build-up of vulnerabilities that could potentially affect Thailand's overall financial stability."
Egypt,2018-12-27,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release December 27, 2018 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the main operation unchanged at 1675 percent, 1775 percent, and 1725 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 1725 percen.
