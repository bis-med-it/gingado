Romania,2017-01-06," Video: Press briefing, 6 January 2017 (Romanian only)  Board meeting minutes. In its meeting of 6 January 2017, the Board of the National Bank of Romania (NBR) decided the following:. The annual inflation rate declined in November 2016 to -0.7 percent, slightly below the forecasted level, after having reached -0.43 percent in October. This was mainly due to the slower dynamics of tobacco product prices and to the impact of the price cuts for compulsory third-party liability insurance policies. The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate1 followed a relatively similar path, coming in at 0.47 percent in November 2016. The average annual inflation rate remained stuck in November 2016 to the previous month's reading, namely -1.6 percent, while that based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices rose to -1.1 percent (from -1.2 percent in October 2016). Economic growth lost momentum in 2016 Q3, witnessing a stronger-than-expected slowdown. Annual GDP dynamics decelerated to 4.4 percent (against 6 percent in Q2), solely due to the slacker advance in domestic demand, on account of both components, i.e. consumption and investment. The negative contribution of net exports shrank significantly, given the much sharper decline in the growth rate of imports compared with that of exports of goods and services. On the supply side, services became again the fastest-growing sector, further making the largest contribution to GDP dynamics. During 2016 Q3, most economic sectors posted reductions in productivity gains in annual terms, whereas the annual dynamics of net average wage remained high, around the level recorded in the previous quarter. Real monetary conditions remained stimulative. Credit to the private sector saw its growth pick up slightly in October-November, largely on account of loans to non-financial corporations. The share of leu-denominated credit in total private sector loans continued to widen, reaching 56.9 percent at end-November 2016, as the dynamics of the leu-denominated component were further high, while the negative change of foreign currency-denominated loans was marginally smaller. These developments certify the improvement in monetary policy transmission, while also helping mitigate the risks to financial stability. The most recent assessments reconfirm the outlook for the annual inflation rate to re-enter positive territory in 2017 Q1 along with resuming an upward course, amid the fading out of the transitory effect of the standard VAT rate cut to 20 percent, excess demand and higher unit wage costs. However, the annual inflation rate is expected to stand lower than the level highlighted in the latest medium-term forecast. The risks to the inflation outlook stem from both domestic and external sources. The external environment is marked by risks related to the euro area economic growth, the challenges to the European banking system, the Brexit negotiations, as well as those concerning the developments in the prices of oil and other commodities. Based on currently available data and in the context of these uncertainties, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided to keep unchanged the monetary policy rate at 1.75 percent per annum, to further pursue adequate liquidity management in the banking system, and to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board decisions aim to ensure and preserve price stability over the medium term in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth. The consolidation of the economic picture calls for ensuring a balanced macroeconomic policy mix and progress in structural reforms. The NBR is closely monitoring domestic and external developments and stands ready to use all its available tools during this period of heightened uncertainty. According to the NBR Board decision, the account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR website on 13 January 2017, at 3:00 p.m. In line with the announced calendar, the next monetary policy meeting of the NBR Board is scheduled for 7 February 2017, when a new quarterly Inflation Report is to be examined. 1 Calculated by excluding from the consumer price index the following categories: administered prices, volatile prices, and tobacco and alcoholic beverage prices."
Kazakhstan,2017-01-09,"– 1 On base rate January 9, 2017 Almaty The National Bank of Kazakhstan has decided to keep the base rate unchanged at the level 12% with a corridor of +/-1 percentage points. Despite the fact that annual inflation in 2016 exceeded the target range, it is expected that the target range will be achieved within 1-2 months. Due to weakness of the factors contributing to its acceleration or volatility, some increase in business activity, uncertainty reduction in global markets and relative improvement in the terms of trade in recent months of 2016, the probability of further easing of monetary policy is increasing provided that the trend is confirmed by macroeconomic data. The decision on the base rate was made with the account of the following factors. Annual inflation for 2016 was 8.5%, which corresponds to the National Bank's estimates and the previous statements that at the end of 2016 the annual inflation would be close to the upper bound of the target range of 6-8%. According to current estimates of the National Bank, in January-February inflation rate will come into the target range. In the following months of 2017 inflation will not show a significant reduction, however, in the absence of negative shocks, will be within the target range. At the end of 2017 annual inflation is expected to be within the limits of 7.3-7.7%. According to recent survey, inflation expectations of households are being reduced. Expectations of respondents with respect of significant price growth in December 2016 were not justified, and respondents do not expect the acceleration of inflationary processes in the future. Fundamental factors indicate that there is a potential for further appreciation of tenge. In January-November 2016, the short-term economic indicator that reflects the development of economy's main sectors accounted for 100.5%, which corresponds to the trend of improvement in the business activity. Despite the positive trends, there is still the possibility of occurrence of external shocks which have potential risks for the economic development of the country. Among them are the presence of vulnerabilities in the world oil market and the pace of economic recovery in the main trading partners. The planned rise in budget expenditures on social payments may lead to strengthening of inflation pressure. Therefore, the National Bank considers necessary to keep the base rate unchanged. The next decision on the base rate will be announced on February 20, 2017 at 17:00 Astana time."
Brazil,2017-01-11,"The Copom released the following note to the public&#58. The Copom released the following note to the public:. ""204th Meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (=9CCopom=9D) of the Central Bank of Brazil Press Release*. The Copom unanimously decided to reduce the Selic rate to 13.00 percent per year, without bias. The following observations provide an update of the Copoms baseline scenario:. The set of indicators released since the last Copom meeting suggests weaker-than-expected economic activity. Available evidence indicates that the economic recovery should be delayed even further, and be more gradual than previously anticipated. The global outlook remains quite uncertain. Nevertheless, the end of the benign environment for emerging economies has had a limited impact so far. Recent inflation releases were more favorable than expected. There are signs that the more widespread disinflation process has reached IPCA components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy. IPCA inflation for 2016 ended at 6.3%, well below expectations held a few months ago, and within the tolerance limits set for the inflation target for last year. Inflation expectations for 2017 collected by the Focus survey fell to around 4.8%. Expectations collected by the same survey for 2018 and longer horizons remained anchored, around 4.5%. The Committees conditional inflation forecasts retreated relative to those in the latest Inflation Report, which were based on information available until December 9, 2016. Among other factors, changes in forecasts were influenced by inflation and economic activity data released since then. In the reference scenario, forecasts for 2017 and 2018 are around 4.0% and 3.4%, respectively. The market scenario for 2017 and 2018 shows inflation around 4.4% and 4.5%, respectively; and. The process of consideration and approval of fiscal reforms by the Congress has been positive so far. The Committee identifies the following risks to the baseline scenario for inflation:. On the one hand, the highly uncertain global outlook might make disinflation more difficult; the process of disinflation of some IPCA components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy requires continuous attention; the process of approval and implementation of the necessary reforms and adjustments in the economy is lengthy, and carries uncertainty. On the other hand, weaker economic activity and a high level of economic slack may produce disinflation at a faster pace than the one embedded in the Copoms conditional forecasts; short-run inflation behavior has been more favorable, which may signal lower inflation persistence; and the process of approval and implementation of the necessary reforms and adjustments in the economy may be faster than anticipated. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the current balance of risks, and the wide array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to reduce the Selic rate to 13.00 percent per year, without bias. The Committee judges that convergence of inflation to the 4.5% target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, which includes 2017 and, with a gradually increasing weight, 2018, is compatible with an intensification of the ongoing monetary easing process. The Copom entertained reducing the Selic rate to 13.25 percent per year and signaling a larger cut at the next meeting. However, in face of the environment with anchored inflation expectations, the Committee judges that the current scenario with more widespread disinflation and weaker-than-expected economic activity makes it already appropriate to frontload the monetary easing cycle, and allows the new pace of easing. The extension of the cycle and possible revisions of the pace of easing will continue to depend on inflation forecasts and expectations, and on the evolution of the aforementioned risk factors."
Poland,2017-01-11,"Warsaw, 11 January 2017 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 10-11 January 2017 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: ï‚§ reference rate at 1.50%; ï‚§ lombard rate at 2.50%; ï‚§ deposit rate at 0.50%; ï‚§ rediscount rate at 1.75%. Economic growth abroad remains moderate, with signs of recovery in global industry. In the euro area, economic growth has been stable, albeit diverse across its member states. In Germany, economic growth in 2016 Q4 probably accelerated, while in other large euro area economies it remained low. In the United States, expansion has continued, supported by improvement in the labour market reflected both in rising employment and wages. In China, there are signs of improvement in economic conditions, yet GDP growth is still lower than in previous years. Prices of energy commodities, including oil, have risen over recent months. In consequence, inflation has picked up in many economies, including in the euro area. The European Central Bank has been keeping the interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero. The ECB is also continuing its asset purchase programme. The Federal Reserve raised the interest rates in December 2016 and indicated their further rise in 2017. In Poland. GDP growth in 2016 Q4 was probably subdued. However, monthly data signal some improvement in economic activity over the recent past. Economic growth has been mainly driven by increasing consumer demand, supported by a rise in employment and wages, very good consumer sentiment and child benefit payments. At the same time. GDP growth was contained by a fall in investment, caused to a large extent by temporarily lower use of EU funds after the completion of the previous EU financial perspective. Annual growth in prices of consumer goods and services has been increasing  in line with flash estimate it was 0.8% y/y in December 2016. Growth in producer prices has also picked up. The increase in price growth has resulted mainly from energy commodity prices being higher than a year ago, i.e. factors beyond the direct impact of domestic monetary policy. At the same time, price growth has been contained by low inflationary pressure abroad and negative output gap in the domestic economy. In the Council's opinion, price growth will continue to increase in the coming months, yet it will remain moderate. Besides commodity prices being higher than a year 1/2 ago, price growth will be supported by an expected acceleration in economic growth amid a gradual increase in the investment growth rate and a stable rise in consumption. The Council confirms its assessment that  given the available data and forecasts  the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on the sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic balance."
South Korea,2017-01-13,"Base Rate unchanged at 1., 25% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Board considers that the trend of global economic recovery has expanded somewhat, led by the US and some emerging market economies. Global financial market volatility has diminished, as the trends of rising government bond rates in major countries have subsided and stock prices have risen. Looking ahead the Board judges that the global economic recovery will be affected by factors such as the directions of the new US government's economic policies, the pace of monetary policy normalization by the US Federal Reserve, and the movements toward spreading trade protectionism. In Korea, the slump in exports has eased but the Board judges the pace of domestic economic growth to have slowed somewhat, as the recovery in domestic demand activities has weakened. Employment conditions have been somewhat sluggish, with the number of persons employed having continued to decline in the manufacturing sector while its trend of increase in the service sector has slowed as well. The Board sees the domestic economy as likely to continue its trend of moderate growth going forward, and forecasts a rate of GDP growth for this year in the mid-2% range. The trend of recovery in domestic demand activities is expected to be limited, due to deteriorations in economic sentiment for example, but exports will likely improve thanks chiefly to the global economic recovery. Consumer price inflation has risen to the mid-1% level, in line with the easing of downward price pressures on the supply side. Core inflation (excluding food & energy product prices from the CPI) has been in the mid- to upper-1% range, while the rate of inflation expected by the general public has remained at the mid-2% level. Looking ahead the Board forecasts that consumer price inflation will gradually rise to near the 2% target level by around the middle of 2017, on the effects mainly of the increases in international oil prices, and that core inflation will maintain a level in the mid- to upper-1% range. In the domestic financial markets, the volatilities of both stock prices and long-term market interest rates have subsided somewhat as the global financial market has stabilized. The Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has continued its uptrend seen since October of last year, in line with the strengthening of the US dollar globally. The upward trends of housing sales prices have slowed, centering around Seoul and its surrounding areas. Household lending has continued its substantial increase, but the amount of increase in that by banks has shown signs of lessening recently. Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation approaches the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As the inflationary pressures on the demand side are not expected to be high, given the moderate pace of domestic economic growth, the Board will maintain its stance of monetary policy accommodation. In this process it will closely monitor the uncertainties in domestic and external conditions and their effects, the progress of monetary policy normalization by the US Federal Reserve, and the trend of increase in household debt."
Peru,2017-01-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JANUARY 2017 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 4.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 4.25 percent. This decision is consistent with an inflation forecast in which inflation converges to the target range by mid-2017 and takes into account the following factors: Expectations of inflation in 12 months remain within the target range and continue showing a declining path; The farming cycle has been negatively affected by the water deficit, its impact being expected to be transitory; The pace of growth of domestic economic activity has slowed down in the last quarter of 2016 in a context of lower public expenditure. However, economic activity is expected to grow at a rate close to its potential growth level in the following quarters as a result of increased investment and better terms of trade, and The global economy shows signals of recovery and lower volatility in international financial markets. The Board oversees new data on inflation and inflation determinants in the forecast horizon to evaluate the convenience of making additional adjustments in the monetary policy rate. Inflation in December showed a rate of 0.33 percent due to rises in the prices of some food products and electricity rates, which has led the year-to-year rate of inflation to decline from 3.35 percent in November to 3.23 percent in December. Inflation without food and energy recorded a rate of 0.38 percent, as a result of which the year-to-year rate decreased from 3.00 percent in November to 2.87 percent in December, level within the target range. The indicators of business expectations remain within the optimistic side. In line with this. GDP is expected to grow 4.0 percent in 2017. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 3.0 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 4.80 percent for the first 15 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 15 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.80 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for February on February 9, 2017."
Chile,2017-01-19,"Santiago. Chile. Thursday, 19 January 2017 Monetary Policy Meeting  January 2017 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to lower the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points, to 3.25%. Internationally, global financial conditions have improved and emerging economies' asset prices have risen. The prices of copper and oil, beyond ups and downs, have remained above those of mid-2016. Activity indicators confirm improvements in the developed world and a weakening in Latin America. At home, the CPI posted an unexpectedly low monthly variation, resulting in a 2.7% increase for the year. Inflation expectations at the end of the projection horizon are near target, although for the coming months they remain in the lower part of the tolerance range. Again, activity showed weak figures, this time concentrating in sectors other than natural resources. All in all, demand-side indicators continue to grow at a similar pace of previous quarters. The labor market continues along previous trends. Long-term interest rates returned to their pre-US-election levels. As was said in the last Monetary Policy Report, the Board estimates that, if the recent trends of the economic scenario persist, and so do their implications on the medium- term inflation outlook, it will be necessary to boost the monetary impulse. At the same time, it reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. The Spanish original prevails."
Euroarea,2017-01-19,"Ladies and gentlemen, first of all let me wish you a Happy New Year. The Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We continue to expect them to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases. Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, we confirm that we will continue to make purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) at the current monthly pace of â‚¬80 billion until the end of March 2017 and that, from April 2017, our net asset purchases are intended to continue at a monthly pace of â‚¬60 billion until the end of December 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. The net purchases will be made alongside reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP. The Governing Council today also decided on further details of how the Eurosystem will buy assets with yields below the interest rate on the deposit facility under its public sector purchase programme. These decisions will be published in a separate press release at 15.30 CET. The monetary policy decisions taken in December 2016 have succeeded in preserving the very favourable financing conditions that are necessary to secure a sustained convergence of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Borrowing conditions for firms and households continue to benefit from the pass-through of our measures. As expected, headline inflation has increased lately, largely owing to base effects in energy prices, but underlying inflation pressures remain subdued. The Governing Council will continue to look through changes in HICP inflation if judged to be transient and to have no implication for the medium-term outlook for price stability. A very substantial degree of monetary accommodation is needed for euro area inflation pressures to build up and support headline inflation in the medium term. If warranted to achieve its objective, the Governing Council will act by using all the instruments available within its mandate. In particular, if the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, we stand ready to increase our asset purchase programme in terms of size and/or duration. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro area real GDP increased by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2016, after recording a similar pace of growth in the second quarter. Incoming data, notably survey results, point to somewhat stronger growth in the last quarter of 2016. Looking ahead, we expect the economic expansion to firm further. The pass-through of our monetary policy measures is supporting domestic demand and facilitating the ongoing deleveraging process. The very favourable financing conditions and improvements in corporate profitability continue to promote the recovery in investment. Moreover, sustained employment gains, which are also benefiting from past structural reforms, provide support for private consumption via increases in households' real disposable income. At the same time, there are signs of a somewhat stronger global recovery. However, economic growth in the euro area is expected to be dampened by a sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms and remaining balance sheet adjustments in a number of sectors. The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain tilted to the downside and relate predominantly to global factors. According to Eurostat, euro area annual HICP inflation increased markedly from 0.6% in November 2016 to 1.1% in December. This reflected mainly a strong increase in annual energy inflation, while there are no signs yet of a convincing upward trend in underlying inflation. Looking ahead, on the basis of current oil futures prices, headline inflation is likely to pick up further in the near term, largely reflecting movements in the annual rate of change of energy prices. However, measures of underlying inflation are expected to rise more gradually over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the expected economic recovery and the corresponding gradual absorption of slack. Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) continues to expand at a robust pace, with its annual rate of growth increasing to 4.8% in November 2016, up from 4.4% in October. As in previous months, annual growth in M3 was mainly supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate M1 expanding at an annual rate of 8.7% in November, up from 8.0% in October. Loan dynamics followed the path of gradual recovery observed since the beginning of 2014. The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations was 2.2% in November 2016, after 2.1% in the previous month. The annual growth rate of loans to households was 1.9% in November, after 1.8% in October. Although developments in bank credit continue to reflect the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets, the monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014 are significantly supporting borrowing conditions for firms and households and thereby credit flows across the euro area. The euro area bank lending survey for the fourth quarter of 2016 indicates that credit standards for loans to enterprises are broadly stabilising, while loan demand has continued to expand at a robust pace across all loan categories. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed the need for a continued very substantial degree of monetary accommodation to secure a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% without undue delay. Monetary policy is focused on maintaining price stability over the medium term and its accommodative stance supports economic activity. In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute much more decisively, both at the national and at the European level. The implementation of structural reforms needs to be substantially stepped up to increase resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost investment, productivity and potential output growth in the euro area. In particular, reforms are needed to improve the business environment, including the provision of an adequate public infrastructure. In addition, the enhancement of current investment initiatives, progress on the capital markets union and reforms that will improve the resolution of non-performing loans, are a priority. Fiscal policies should also support the economic recovery, while remaining in compliance with the fiscal rules of the European Union. Full and consistent implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact over time and across countries remains crucial to ensure confidence in the fiscal framework. At the same time, it is essential that all countries intensify efforts towards achieving a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies. QUESTION: Mr Draghi, you indicated that the ECB stands ready to do more if the outlook deteriorates. Is the ECB also ready to do less if it continues to outperform?. I think last time you indicated this was a high-class problem. The second question is on the US President-elect. Donald Trump. He's made some comments this week about the dollar that led to a fall in the dollar. I wondered if you were worried about what this might mean in terms of a future currency war or perhaps about some of the other suggestions he's made about an increase in protectionism and how that might impact the eurozone. Draghi: Well, you asked me whether it's still a high-class problem and the answer is yes, it still is a high-class problem. The second point, really it's very early for us to comment on the to-be President Trump's statements. The only thing that I can recall as far as exchange rates are concerned is something that you heard me say many times. The exchange rates for us are not a target but they are important for price stability and growth. There is a very strong international consensus in the G20 and the G7 to refrain from competitive devaluations. So there is a whole protocol in the various statements by the G20 and the G7 that basically states how countries should behave with respect to exchange rates. QUESTION: Two questions for you. Mr Draghi, one on the inflation again. In case it overshoots your target, for how long would you let it overshoot?. Have you made up your mind for this in the Governing Council?. The second one on the Brexit front: in her last speech the British Prime Minister made it clear that there will be a hard Brexit. What does it mean for the ECB and for your outlook on inflation and growth?. Draghi: Now, the answer to the first question lies in what we define as our objective. We define our objective first of all in the medium term, over a medium-term horizon. Second, it has to be a durable convergence, so it cannot be transient. In other words, it has to stay there even when the extraordinary monetary policy support that we are providing today will not be there. I think these are the four features that always characterised our objective. On the second question. I simply say again it's too early to say. But also, whether it will have economic consequences will depend on the shape of the outcome and the length of time it will take."
Malaysia,2017-01-19,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.00 percent. The global economy continued to grow at a moderate pace. Economic activity in the major advanced economies has improved. In Asia, growth is supported by domestic demand amid some recovery in external demand. For 2017, the global economy is projected to expand at a slightly faster pace. The prospect of a shift towards progressive use of fiscal policy in the developed economies could lead to a more balanced policy environment that would support growth. Nevertheless, heightened uncertainty and downside risks to global growth remain, arising from risks of protectionism, geopolitical developments and commodity price volatility. These risks could also lead to episodes of increased financial market volatility. For Malaysia, latest indicators point to continued expansion in the fourth quarter of 2016. Going forward, private sector activity will remain the key driver of growth. Private consumption is expected to be sustained by continued wage and employment growth, with support from various policy measures to raise disposable income. Investment activity, although moderating, will be supported by on-going infrastructure development projects and capital spending in the manufacturing and services sectors. On the external front, the expected improvement in exports will provide some support to growth. Overall, the economy remains on track to expand as projected. Headline inflation averaged 2.1% in 2016 and is expected to average higher in 2017, amid the prospect of higher global oil prices. These cost factors are not expected to cause significant spillovers to the broader price trends, given the stable domestic demand conditions. Underlying inflation, as measured by the core inflation index, is therefore expected to remain stable. The ringgit, along with other emerging market currencies, has seen a reduction in volatility since the sharp adjustments experienced towards the end of 2016. The implementation of financial market development measures has provided stability to the domestic foreign exchange market. Uncertainties in the global economy, the policy environment and geopolitical developments may, however, result in bouts of volatility in the regional financial and foreign exchange markets. In this regard. Bank Negara Malaysia will continue to provide liquidity to ensure the orderly functioning of the financial markets. Banking system liquidity remains ample. Financial institutions continue to operate with strong capital and liquidity buffers and the growth of financing to the private sector is consistent with the pace of economic activity. At the current level of the OPR, the degree of monetary accommodativeness is consistent with the policy stance to ensure that the domestic economy continues on a steady growth path amid a stable core inflation, supported by sustained financial intermediation in the economy. While the risks of destabilising financial imbalances are contained, the MPC will monitor these risks to ensure the sustainability of the overall growth prospects. The MPC will continue to assess the balance of risks surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation. Bank Negara Malaysia 19 January 2017."
Israel,2017-01-23,"Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index for December was unchanged, in line withthe average of forecasters' projections. There was a seasonal increase in the clothing and footwear component (6.5 percent), and there were declines in the housing (0.1 percent) and food (0.5 percent) components. In 2016 as a whole, inflation was negative, at -0.2 percent. Prices of goods (food, fruit and vegetables, furniture, and clothing), and of transport and communication: inter alia due to the 'Open Skies' reform: were the main components contributing to the CPI decline in 2016. Other services (housing and dwelling maintenance, education, culture and entertainment) contributed to a moderation of the decline, as their prices increased. Energy prices were unchanged in 2016, and the effect of administrative price reductions reduced the CPI by 0.2 percent. Prices of components representing tradable goods in the CPI declined by 1.7 percent in 2016, andthe prices of components representing nontradable items increased by 0.6 percent. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: One-year inflation expectations remained essentially unchanged. The average of private forecasters' projections stayed at 0.6 percent, and inflation expectations derived from banks' internal interest rates increased slightly, to 0.4 percent. Inflation expectations derived from the capital market declined by 0.4 percentage points, to 0.2 percent, but the measurement of these expectations was apparently affected by seasonal factors. Second-year forward expectations also remained unchanged, at 0.8 percent. Medium-term expectations increased, with third-year forward expectations at 1.3 percent (compared with 1.1 percent prior to the previous monetary policy discussion), and 3-5 year forward expectations at 1.5 percent (compared with 1.4 percent). Longer-term forward expectations (5-10 years) were 2.3 percent (compared with 2.4 percent). Based on the makam curve, the Telbor curve and forecasters' assessments, there is a high probability of an increase in the Bank of Israel interest rate to 0.25 percent in about a year. Real economic activity: The picture of real economic activity remains positive. Second and third quarter growth data published by the Central Bureau of Statistics were revised upward, and the full year estimate of economic growth in 2016 is 3.8 percent, driven by private consumption, which increased by 6.1 percent,and fixed capital formation, which increased by 10.3 percent. According to the estimate, exports (excluding diamonds and startups) grew by just 1.4 percent, against the background of the continued slowdown in world trade and the real appreciation of the shekel. Several indicators support the assessment that the economy grew by a high rate in the fourth quarter as well. The net balance of the Companies Survey indicates high growth of business sector product. Manufacturing exports (excluding ships, aircraft, diamonds and electronic components, in current dollars), increased by 7 percent compared with the third quarter, and services exports increased by 13.7 percent between January and October, compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. The Composite State of the Economy Index increased in December by 0.45 percent, a relatively high monthly rate compared with that of recent years. The Index was affected by the sharp increase in consumer goods imports (an exceptional increase in vehicle purchases, which were brought forward to December) and by the increase in the Industrial Production Index and in the trade and services revenue indices. The Purchasing Managers Index, and the Consumer Confidence Indices compiled by the Central Bureau of Statistics and by Bank Hapoalim increased in December, with the latter at a six-year high. The labor market: The picture conveyed by the labor market remains very positive. The job vacancy rate stabilized at a high level: 3.7 percent in December (seasonally adjusted). Nominal wages increased in August-October by 1.0 percent, and real wages increased by 1.1 percent, compared to the preceding three months. In the past two years, the number of employed persons in the economy has increased at a stable rate of about 2.5 percent. In 2015, employment growth was led by public services, while in 2016, the business sector led the growth in employment. Health tax receipts for October-December were 5.1 percent higher (in nominal terms) than in the corresponding period in the previous year. Budget data: The overall deficit (excluding net credit) in government activity totaled NIS 22.1 billion in 2016, representing 1.8 percent of GDP. Total domestic expenditure (excluding credit) was similar to the amount planned in the budget. Tax revenues exceeded the forecast by NIS 5.8 billion, and net of legislative changes and one-off revenues, they increased by 5.8 percent in real terms relative to 2015. Expenditures by government ministries were 7.8 percent higher in nominal terms in 2016 than in 2015. The foreign exchange market: From the monetary policy discussion on December 25, 2016, through January 20, 2017, the shekel strengthened by 0.2 percent against the dollar, and depreciated by 0.3 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. Over the preceding 12 months, the shekel appreciated by 6.2 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. The capital and money markets: From the monetary policy discussion on December 25, 2016, through January 20, 2017, the Tel Aviv 25 Index declined by about 2.7 percent. The government bond market registered declines of up to 5 basis points in yields along the unindexed curve and of up to 12 basis points in the indexed curve. The makam curve traded at a yield slightly above the Bank of Israel interest rate. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, remained unchanged at about 69 basis points. The money supply: In 2016, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 17.3 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 8 percent. The credit market: The business sector (excluding banks, insurance companies and foreign companies) issued bonds totaling NIS 4.3 billion in December: mainly in the oil and gas industry (35 percent) the trade and services industry (33 percent) and the real estate and construction industry (24 percent): an amount greater than the monthly average over 2016, of NIS 3.7 billion. Business sector issuance totaled NIS 44.4 billion in 2016, led by the construction and real estate industry, which raised about NIS 18 billion during the year. Corporate bond spreads (excluding banks and insurance companies) declined in December, to an average of 2.82 percentage points. In December, a total of NIS 4.7 billion in new mortgages was taken out, and in 2016, new mortgages taken out totaled 10 percent less than in 2015. The average interest rate on mortgages continuedto increase in December on most tracks. On the CPI-indexed, variable-rate track, the rate increased by 0.21 percentage points. On the unindexed fixed-rate track, the interest rate increased by 0.17 percentage points, and on the unindexedvariable-rate track, it increased by 0.10 percentage points. On the CPI-indexed, fixed-rate track, the rate remained virtually unchanged. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (based on residential rents) declined by 0.1 percent in December, similar to the decline in November. In 2016, it increased by 1.4 percent, compared with annual increases of more than 2 percent in recent years. Home prices increased by 0.4 percent in October-November, following an increase of 0.9 percent in September-October. Over the 12 monthsending in November, home prices increased by 8.1 percent, compared with an increase of 8.6 percent in the 12 months ending in October. Data for October and November indicateda sharp decline in the number of transactions, but the figures were impacted by the Jewish holidays and by the strike at the Israel Tax Authority, so at this point it cannot be assessed that there was in fact a decline. The stock of new homes available for sale continued to increase, to about 31,100 (seasonally adjusted). The global economy: The global economy continues to grow at a moderate pace, with a slight improvement in the growth environment, particularly in the manufacturing sector. In parallel, political uncertainty increased. The IMF kept its global growth forecast unchanged: with a slight upward revision in the forecast for advanced economies and for China and a slight downward revision in the forecast for other emerging markets: including a recovery in world trade in the next two years. In the US, indications that the labor market is nearing full employment are increasing. The addition of new jobs moderated in recent months, and the unemployment rate is stabilizing at a low level, increasing from 4.6 to 4.7 percent in December. The annual rate of increase in the average wage increased from 2.5 percent to 2.9 percent. Private consumption continues to drive the economy, but there are also signs of recovery in industrial production, and improvement in the real estate market continues. Inflation is nearing the target, in view of the dissipation of the effect of the past year'sdeclines in energy prices. With that, the interest rate path expected in the markets moderated slightly, and as of now, two increases in the federal funds rate are expected in 2017. In Europe as well, positive momentum is apparent, particularly in Germany, where the economy grew by 1.9 percent in 2016. Unemployment in the eurozone remained at 9.8 percent, the lowest rate in the past seven years. Inflation increased sharply: to 1.1 percent: affected by the increase in oil prices, but core inflation remains lower. Political uncertainty remains high, in view of the elections expected to take place in a number of countries this year, and the challenges to the banking system are significant. Growth in the UK in 2016 was apparently not affected by the Brexit decision, but assessments are that growth will slow in the coming years. There were positive data in Japan, and activity is improving, but there are still no signs of a recovery of inflation. In China, the slowdown in growth as part of the structural change continues, but the accelerated increases in credit and in the outflow of capital are a source of concern. The other emerging markets benefited from an increase in commodity prices in the past year, but some of them are exposed to the effect of depreciation on external debt, and to a strengthening of the forces calling for limitations on world trade. The price of a barrel of Brent crude rangedaround $55 this month. There was a renewed increase, of about 6.3 percent, in the index of commodities excluding energy this month. The main considerations behind the decision. The decision to keep the interest rate for February 2017 unchanged at 0.1 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to return the inflation rate to within the price stability target range of 1-3 percent a year, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The Monetary Committee continues to assess that in view of the inflation environment, and of developments in the global economy, in the exchange rate, as well as in monetary policies of major central banks, monetary policy will remain accommodative for a considerable time. Following are the main considerations underlying the decision:. C 2B 7 The CPI for December was unchanged, in line with expectations. The inflation rate was negative in 2016, but is on an upward trend. The direct effect of administrative price reductions is dissipating, and energy prices remained unchanged, as measured over the preceding 12 months. The low rate of inflation reflects the effect of the appreciation, and possibly structural change and enhanced competition in the economy. Short-term inflation expectations are below the target, while longer term expectations derived from the capital market remain anchored near the midpoint of the target range. C 2B 7 The picture of real economic activity remains positive. The Composite State of the Economy Index increased by 0.45 percent in December, and the Net Balance in the fourth quarter Companies Survey indicates high growth of business sector product. Foreign trade data indicate a recovery of manufacturing exports, after a prolonged decline since 2014. The picture conveyed by the labor market remains very positive, and the increase in employment and wages was led by the business sector in the past year. C 2B 7 The global economy continues to grow at a moderate pace. The IMF revised its growth forecast for advanced economies and for China upward, and expects a recovery in world trade in the next two years. With that, political developments in some advanced economies are likely to weigh further on trade growth. In the US, the improvement in activity continued, inflation is nearing the target and market assessments are that the federal funds rate will be increased twice in 2017. Nonetheless, there is uncertainty regarding the expected economic policy. In Europe, the recovery is less entrenched, and accommodative monetary policy continues, with political uncertainty remaining high. C 2B 7 From the monetary policy discussion on December 25, 2016, through January 20, 2017, the shekel strengthened by 0.2 percent against the dollar, while it depreciated by 0.3 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. The shekel has appreciated by 6.2 percent over the past 12 months in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, against the background of a 6.7 percent appreciation vis-C 3A 0-vis the euro. The level of the effective exchange rate continues to weigh on the development of goods exports. C 2B 7 Home prices continue to rise rapidly, despite a high level of unsold new homes, a decline in monthly mortgage volume, and a continued increase in mortgage interest rates. The Monetary Committee is of the opinion that the risks to achieving the inflation target remain high, yet the increases in wages and in global inflation are expected to support the return of inflation to the target. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets. The Bank will use the tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and supportfor the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will continue to keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decision for February 2017 will be published on February 6, 2017. The next decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Monday. February 27, 2017."
Nigeria,2017-01-24,"CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO 111 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE RD TH MEETING OF 23 AND 24 JANUARY 2017 10. Background The Monetary Policy Committee held its first rd th statutory meeting of fiscal 2017 on 23 and 24 January, 2017 against the backdrop of increased uncertainty arising from political and economic developments around the world. Over the last few weeks the pillars of the old order - free trade, multilateralism and globalization have come under intense pressure, and seemingly giving way to an 1 era of enlightened national interest in the conduct of international economic relations. On the domestic front, the economy remains in recession and inflation pressures have yet to recede. Both external and domestic conditions have blended to significantly complicate the policy environment. In attendance at the meeting were all 10 members of the Committee. The Committee reviewed the global and domestic economic and financial environments in 2016 and the outlook for the short to medium term in 2017. External Developments The uncertainty in the external environment persisted owing to a 2 combination of recent political and economic developments. The key issues include: Brexit, the rising wave of populist and anti-globalization sentiments anchored by emerging bilateralism, divergent monetary policy stance of the advanced central banks and disorderly commodity price movements. With global output growth improving sluggishly, the outlook for 2017 remains unchanged owing to persisting uncertainties in commodity prices and 3 volatility in the financial markets as well as slowing demand in the advanced economies and the emerging markets. The MPC welcomed the modest increase in oil prices following the last OPEC decision to cut output and noted the increase in the policy rate of the US Federal Reserve Bank in December 2016 and the potential implications of that decision for international interest rates and capital flows. While noting the materiality of the output cut on oil prices, 4 the Committee cautioned that the effect could rapidly wane, given the likelihood of a supply glut from non-OPEC members, low level of global economic activity and weak growth. Emerging markets and developing economies, in particular, have continued to confront strong headwinds such as low commodity prices, rising inflation, currency instability, intractable low aggregate demand and subdued capital flows. Overall, the Committee noted that whereas improved commodity prices may provide modest tailwinds for resource- dependent economies in 2017, the medium-term outlook continues to be muffled by stagnation and uncertainty in the prospects for global trade, subdued investment and heightened policy uncertainty, especially in some major economies. Nevertheless the IMF estimates that these constraints would decline; paving way for mild 6 improvements in economic growth from 31 per cent in 2016 to 34 per cent in 2017. Global inflation commenced a moderate but steady rise on the backdrop of improvements in oil prices and currency depreciation in several emerging markets. However amongst the major advanced economies, only the US Fed 1 has commenced policy tightening while the Bank of Japan (BOJ), the Bank of 1 The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark Federal Fund rate by 25 basis points in December 2016, to a range of 050 to 075 per cent, and also provided indication of rate hikes in 2017 7 England and the European Central Bank, all retained their accommodative policy stance at their most recent meetings. Domestic Output Developments Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in November 2016 showed that the economy contracted further by 224 per cent in Q3 2016, having slipped into recession following another contraction in output in Q2, 2016. Although the overall contraction in 8 Q3 was greater than was observed in Q1 and Q2, the non-oil sector grew by 003 per cent in Q3, driven mainly by agriculture, which grew by 454 per cent. The Committee is of the view that the key undercurrents ie. scarcity of foreign exchange, low fiscal activity, high energy prices and the accumulation of salary arrears - cannot be directly ameliorated by monetary policy actions. The Committee hopes that the recent increase in oil prices would be complemented by 9 production gains to provide the needed tailwinds to sustainable economic activity. In that regard, the Committee commends the commitment of the fiscal authorities to step up efforts to fill the aggregate demand gap through a speedy resolution of the domestic indebtedness of the federal government to states and local contractors. The Committee believes that doing so will aid the effort towards economic recovery. 10 Developments in Money and Prices The committee noted that money supply (M2) grew by 1902 per cent in 2016, being 80 percentage points higher than its programmed limit. It underscored the necessity of keeping the economy adequately lubricated in the face of declining output. Growth in Net Domestic Credit (NDC) was 2479 per cent at end- December 2016, being 1794 per cent above its provisional benchmark for 2016. Likewise growth in net credit to 11 government, at 5884 per cent, surpassed its programmed target of 474 per cent. In effect, all the major monetary aggregates exceeded their programmed provisional benchmarks for fiscal 2016. Headline inflation (year-on-year) continued to rise, creeping up in December 2016 to 1855 per cent from 1848 per cent in November, and 1833 per cent in October, thus sustaining the upward momentum since January 2016. 12 The increase in headline inflation in December 2016 was driven by increase in the food component, which inched up from 1719 per cent in November to 1739 per cent in December. Core inflation, on the other hand, moderated slightly to 1805 per cent in December 2016 from 1824 per cent in November. The Committee observed the increases in the month-on-month inflation rate in November and December, in contrast to successive declines between June and 13 September 2016. It noted that the structural factors driving the sustained pressure on consumer prices, such as the high cost of power and energy, transport, production factors, as well as rising prices of imports are yet to abate. Nonetheless the Committee estimates that the current policy stance and other measures directed at improving food production would combine with base effect to usher- in some moderation in consumer prices in the short to medium term. 14 Money market interest rates fluctuated in tandem with the level of liquidity in the banking system. Thus average inter- bank call rate, which stood at 1534 per st cent on 21 November 2016, closed at 990 per cent on December 30, 2016. Between these periods, the interbank call rate averaged 1359 per cent. The average interbank call rate however, fell to 300 per cent on December 9, 2016, due to an increase in net banking sector liquidity to N49548 billion on December 15 8, 2016, following the payment of statutory revenue to states and local governments as well as maturity of CBN bills during the period. The Committee welcomed improvements in the equities segment of the capital market as the All-Share Index (ASI) rose by 284 per cent from 25,,49900 on November 21, 2016, to 26,,22354 on January 20, 2016. Similarly Market Capitalization (MC) increased by 25 per cent from N880 trillion to 902 trillion 16 during the same period. Relative to end- December 2016, the capital market indices, however, fell by 204 and 205 per cent, respectively, reflecting the challenges confronting the economy. Total foreign exchange inflows through the CBN increased significantly by 8245 per cent in December 2016 owing mainly to the increase in oil prices. Total outflows, however, spiked during the same period. The Committee noted that 17 the average naira exchange rate remained stable at the inter-bank segment of the foreign exchange market in the review period. Overall Outlook and Risks The medium term outlook based on available data and forecast of key economic variables indicate a more resilient economy in 2017. Growth is expected to turn positive in fiscal 2017, as prior policy lags converge and the 18 fiscal space becomes more accommodative. In addition, the agricultural sector is expected to play a bigger role in driving growth, given the expansion of the Anchor Borrower Program, as well as other developmental initiatives of the Government. Likewise the prospects for moderation of price developments appear to be strengthening on the heels of positive developments in the food sub-sector. 19 The Committee identified the downside risks to this outlook to include the possibility of a slower-than-expected rate of global economic activity, fluctuating oil prices and production shut-ins due to vandalism of oil installations. Summary of Considerations The Committee re-assessed the headwinds which confronted the economy in 2016 and the opportunities for recovery in 2017. In particular, the MPC 20 evaluated the implications of the rising wave of nationalistic ideologues across the West, the re-evaluation of trade agreements and the possibility of rapid monetary policy normalization in the United States, with adverse consequences for other countries, including Nigeria. The uncertainties underpinning the implementation of Brexit and the apparent retreat from globalisation and free trade were also important points of reflection. 21 In recognition of the seemingly inevitable structural shift in the global economy, the Committee reiterated the need to be more inward looking and hasten efforts towards economic diversification to support the domestic economy and improve life for the Nigerian people. Consequently members acknowledged the imperative of sectoral policies and greater coordination of monetary and fiscal policy. 2 Conscious of the prevailing market sentiments in favour of a rate cut, the Committee reasoned that most of its decisions in 2016 were informed by the need to address the delicate balance between price stability and growth. Noting that the pressures on consumer prices were yet to abate and even as the economy continued to be in recession despite the intervention support by the Central Bank, the Committee stressed 23 that it was not oblivious of the full ramifications of the economic challenges facing the country. The MPC was concerned that the current situation was not amenable to simplistic analyses and quick fixes such as have found expression and increased attention at different fora and the media. The domestic economic challenges which include a chronically import dependent consumption culture, lack of competitiveness of many sectors of the 24 economy and yawning infrastructural gap, have combined with an unfavorable external environment to complicate the macroeconomic policy environment. The Monetary Authority had on many occasions, and to the extent feasible, taken extra-ordinary steps to support other policies as well as compensate for aspects of structural gaps in the economy even at the expense of its core mandate. 25 The Committee specifically noted the positive contribution of agriculture to GDP in the third quarter, mostly attributable to the Bankâ€™s interventions in the sector. The Committee hopes that given the thrust of the 2017 budget and accompanying sectoral policies, output growth should resume in the short to medium term. The MPC, therefore, lends its voice to efforts for an early finalization of the 2017 Federal Budget by the authorities concerned, and the resolve to 26 pursue a non-oil driven economy, as these will go a long way in stimulating aggregate demand and restoring confidence in the economy. The Committee also urged the authorities to seriously consider using the Public Private Partnership (PPP) model in its infrastructure development programme as a means of cushioning any possible shocks to budgeted revenue. 27 The Committee further noted that Inflationary pressures would begin to subside as non-oil output recovers and the naira exchange rate stabilizes. Until then, it stressed, a rate cut would worsen the inflationary conditions and undermine the current outlook for stability in the foreign exchange market. The Committee also feels that doing so would further aggravate demand pressures while undermining existing income levels in the face of the already expansionary 28 monetary policy and increasing inflationary pressure which will make the economy unattractive for foreign and domestic investment. Given these limitations, the Committee was reluctant to lower the policy rate on this occasion but remained committed to doing so when the conditions permit. From a financial stability standpoint, the Committee noted the possible impact of the inclement macroeconomic 29 environment on banking sector resilience. The MPC urged the Management of the Bank to engage industry operators to discuss likely issues of asset quality, credit concentration and high foreign exchange exposures. Given the growth in money supply arising from unconventional monetary policy operations of the Bank and implications for price and exchange rate developments, the Committee is 30 committed to moderating growth in narrow money in the 2017 fiscal year in line with the Bankâ€™s monetary growth benchmarks. The Committeeâ€™s Decisions The Committee, in consideration of the headwinds in the domestic economy and the uncertainties in the global environment, decided by a unanimous vote to retain the MPR at 140 per cent alongside all other policy parameters. In summary, the MPC decided to: Retain the MPR at 14 per cent; 31 Retain the CRR at 225 per cent; Retain the Liquidity Ratio at 3000 per cent; and Retain the Asymmetric corridor at +200 and -500 basis points around the MPR Thank you for listening. Godwin I Emefiele Governor. Central Bank of Nigeria th 24 January, 2017 32."
Turkiye,2017-01-24,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term interest rates at the following levels:. a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate has been increased from 8.5 percent to 9.25 percent and borrowing rate has been kept at 7.25 percent. b) One-week repo rate has been kept at 8 percent,. c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent, and lending rate has been increased from 10 percent to 11 percent. Recently released data indicate a partial recovery in the economic activity. Demand from the European Union economies continues to contribute positively to exports, while domestic demand displays a weaker course. With the supportive measures and incentives provided recently, the recovery in the economic activity is expected to continue at a moderate pace. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly. Aggregate demand developments support disinflation. Yet, excessive fluctuations in exchange rates since the previous meeting have increased the upside risks regarding the inflation outlook. The significant rise in inflation is expected to continue in the short term due to lagged pass-through effects and the volatility in food prices. Accordingly, the Committee decided to strengthen the monetary tightening in order to contain the deterioration in the inflation outlook. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. Future monetary policy decisions will be conditional on the inflation outlook. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered. Moreover, necessary liquidity measures will be taken in case of unhealthy pricing behavior in the foreign exchange market that cannot be justified by economic fundamentals. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
South Africa,2017-01-24,"South African Reserve Bank PRESS STATEMENT 24 January 2017 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), the near-term inflation outlook has deteriorated, but the longer-term outlook is more or less unchanged. The expected inflation profile has been negatively affected by higher international oil prices and a persistence in elevated food price inflation despite improved rainfall in many of the drought-stricken regions. At the same time, the rand has displayed some resilience. While some of the key risks to the rand appear to have subsided for now, they could re-emerge at any stage. Global growth prospects are mixed amid policy uncertainty, primarily in the US and the UK. The domestic growth outlook remains challenging, although a modest improvement is expected over the forecast period. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 6,8 per cent in December, up from 6,6 per cent in November. The December outcome surprised on the upside relative to the Bank's forecast and the market consensus expectation of 6,5 per cent. The main sources of this surprise 1. The main sources of this surprise 1 included food prices, housing rentals, recreation and culture, and restaurants and hotels. Food price inflation remained elevated at 12,0 per cent in December, matching the recent high recorded in October 2016. The contribution of the category of food and non-alcoholic beverages to the overall inflation outcome has remained unchanged at 1,8 percentage points for the past 3 months. Goods price inflation measured 7,8 per cent in December, up from 7,7 per cent in November, while services price inflation increased from 5,6 per cent to 5,9 per cent. The Bank's measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity measured 5,9 per cent, up from 5,7 per cent. Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods measured 6,9 per cent in November, compared with 6,6 per cent in October. The main contributor to the November outcome was the category of food products, beverages and tobacco products which contributed 3,9 percentage points. The inflation forecast of the Bank has deteriorated since the previous meeting of the MPC. Headline inflation is now expected to only return to within the target range during the final quarter of 2017, and to average 6,2 per cent for the year, compared with 5,8 per cent in the previous forecast. The forecast for 2018 is more or less unchanged at an average of 5,5 per cent. The peak of the forecast remains at 6,6 per cent, which was recorded in the final quarter of 2016, and this level is now expected to persist in the first quarter of 2017. This deterioration is mainly due to changed assumptions regarding international oil prices, the domestic fuel prices and the outlook for food prices, which more than offset the more favourable exchange rate assumption. 2 By contrast, the forecast for core inflation is unchanged, averaging 5,5 per cent and 5,2 per cent in 2017 and 2018 respectively. Inflation expectations as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research during the fourth quarter of 2016 showed average inflation expectations for 2017 declining from 6,0 per cent in the third quarter to 5,8 per cent. The same outcome is expected for 2018, as well as for 5-year inflation expectations. Despite the slight moderation, expectations remain more or less anchored at the upper end of the target range, but with a narrower divergence between the different groups of respondents than is usually the case. The expectations of these groups ranged from 5,6 per cent to 6,0 per cent for 2017, and from 5,4 per cent to 6,0 per cent for 2018. The outcome may have been distorted by the marked decline of 0,6 percentage points for the trade union respondents. The median annual inflation expectations of market analysts as reflected in the Reuters Econometer survey are relatively unchanged at 5,8 per cent and 5,5 per cent for 2017 and 2018. Bond market expectations implicit in the break-even inflation rates declined across all maturities since the previous meeting, though remain above the target range. The global economic outlook remains uncertain, despite increased optimism regarding US growth following the US presidential elections. There is still a great deal of uncertainty regarding the policies of the new administration, particularly with respect to the size of the promised fiscal stimulus. While some of the initial optimism has since been tempered somewhat. US growth is expected to be relatively strong, but with some downside risks posed by a stronger dollar. Uncertainty also persists regarding the prospects for the UK economy, as the terms of the disengagement 3. Uncertainty also persists regarding the prospects for the UK economy, as the terms of the disengagement 3 from the EU are unlikely to be resolved for some time. The steady but slow growth recovery in the Eurozone is expected to continue, but upcoming elections in a number of countries could pose risks to the outlook, alongside ongoing concerns about the prospects for the Italian economy. The outlook for emerging markets is also unclear, given conflicting developments. Commodity prices, especially industrial commodities, have risen in recent months, but protectionist threats from the US, if carried through, could undermine world trade and have an adverse effect on emerging markets in particular. These countries are also highly dependent on Chinese growth, which is expected to remain above the 6 per cent level. However, given the credit-driven nature of recent Chinese growth, there are fears of an unsustainable credit bubble which could expose financial sector vulnerabilities, and undermine the growth outlook. There are tentative signs of global inflation edging up, as fears of deflation recede amid higher energy and food prices. As expected, the US Fed tightened monetary policy in December, and signalled further increases to come. However, the pace of increase is still expected to be relatively moderate amid a highly uncertain economic policy environment. Both the ECB and the Bank of Japan have maintained their highly accommodative policy stances. This divergence between the advanced economies is likely to persist for some time. The rand has displayed a degree of resilience since the previous meeting of the MPC, having traded in a relatively narrow range of between R14,22 and R13,46 against the US dollar. Since the previous meeting, the rand has appreciated by 5,6 per cent against the US dollar and by 4,2 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. The rand was positively impacted by the decisions of the ratings agencies not to 4. The rand was positively impacted by the decisions of the ratings agencies not to 4 downgrade the sovereign foreign credit rating to sub-investment grade, although this remains a risk in the coming months. The limited response of the rand exchange rate to the increase in the US policy rate in mid-December suggests that the move had been largely priced in. A gradual pace of tightening is expected in the US, with the rand vulnerable to any upside surprises in this respect. The rand has been positively affected by the improvement in the terms of trade, following the recent modest increase in commodity prices. Although the overall current account deficit is expected to narrow over the forecast period, it remains relatively wide. In line with the recent improved capital flows to emerging economy bond markets, non-residents have been net buyers of South African bonds since the beginning of the year, while equity net sales have continued. This follows persistent net sales of both bonds and equities during the last three months of 2016. The domestic growth outlook remains weak and more or less unchanged since the previous meeting of the MPC. The Bank expects growth to have averaged 0,4 per cent in 2016, although recent monthly data for the fourth quarter suggest that there may be a downside risk to this forecast. The forecast for 2017 has been revised down marginally to 1,1 per cent (from 1,2 per cent), and remains unchanged at 1,6 per cent for 2018. This improved outlook relative to 2016 is consistent with the recent upward trend in the composite leading indicator of the Bank. By contrast, the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index declined again in the fourth quarter, following a recovery in the previous quarter. Much of this decline was driven by the new vehicle sector. 5 The recent monthly data paint a bleak picture for the fourth quarter of 2016. Mining production, which had improved in the second and third quarters, contracted in both October and November. However, improved commodity prices are expected to help the sector in the coming months. The manufacturing sector recorded low but positive growth in November, following a month-to-month decline in October. The Barclays Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) declined further in December, and recorded its fifth consecutive month below the neutral 50 level. The low level of business confidence is reflected in the continued, but slower, contraction in real gross fixed capital formation. Gross fixed investment has contracted for four consecutive quarters, and has been particularly marked in the private sector. This has contributed to the persistent labour market weakness, with formal non-agricultural employment (excluding temporary election-related employment) remaining unchanged in the year to the third quarter of 2016. The official unemployment rate increased to 27,1 per cent, its highest level since the inception of the Quarterly Labour Force Survey in 2008. Wage growth appears to be responding to the weak labour market environment. Year-on-year nominal wage growth per worker moderated for a fifth consecutive quarter in the third quarter of 2016, down to 5,8 per cent. Following a small decline in labour productivity growth, nominal unit labour costs in the formal non-agricultural sector increased to 5,7 per cent. The slower nominal wage growth per worker is consistent with the lower wage settlement rates reported by Andrew Levy Employment Publications. Household consumption expenditure data paint a mixed picture. Growth in household consumption expenditure accelerated to 2,6 per cent in the third quarter 6. Growth in household consumption expenditure accelerated to 2,6 per cent in the third quarter 6 despite a further contraction in durable goods consumption. Real retail trade sales declined in October, but increased markedly in November on a month-to-month basis. By contrast wholesale trade sales contracted in both months. Domestic new vehicle sales remained subdued following further declines in the final quarter of last year. Notwithstanding some improvement, consumers remain under pressure and consumer confidence remains low, as indicated in the sharp contraction in the FNB/BER Consumer Confidence Index in the fourth quarter. Households remain highly indebted despite a further moderation in the debt ratio, and the subdued housing and equity markets have contributed to an absence of strong wealth effects. Slower wage growth along with stagnant employment growth and expected tax increases in the forthcoming budget are also likely to dampen consumption expenditure. A further constraint to consumption expenditure growth has been the weak credit extension to the private sector, which, at 4,5 per cent in November, was the lowest year-on-year growth since late 2010. While growth in credit extension to the household sector was particularly subdued, that to the corporate sector also moderated in the second half of 2016. The strongest decline was seen in mortgage credit extension for commercial property. Food price inflation is expected to decline following good rainfall in parts of the country. Spot prices for both maize and wheat have declined significantly, and a markedly higher maize crop is expected this year. However, the impact on prices at the consumer level are yet to be felt, with meat prices likely to lag other food price categories as farmers restock their herds. Although the Bank's inflation forecast 7. Although the Bank's inflation forecast 7 assumes that food price inflation has more or less peaked, the pace of moderation is expected to be slower than in the previous forecast. Food price inflation is now expected to average 7,0 per cent during 2017, compared with 6,5 per cent previously. Food price disinflation is expected to be constrained or delayed by higher fuel costs and a rising trend in global food prices. Brent crude oil prices increased by over 20 per cent to almost US$60 per barrel in response to the OPEC-brokered agreement to restrict production. Prices have since moderated to current levels of around US$55 per barrel. The sustainability of this agreement and its longer-term impact on prices is uncertain, given the possibility of offsetting developments. A number of oil producers were exempt from the agreement; there are incentives and scope for cartel members to exceed their quotas; and US shale producers have already increased production in response to higher prices. These factors are likely to constrain oil price increases. While the Bank's oil price assumption has been revised up, the trajectory is relatively flat. Despite the stronger rand exchange rate, the domestic price of 93 octane petrol increased by 50 cents per litre in January, and a further increase can be expected in February. The MPC has noted the marked deterioration in the inflation forecast since the previous meeting, as well as the extension of the expected breach of the upper level of the target range by a further two quarters. Inflation is now expected to return to within the target range in the final quarter of 2017. While this is a cause for concern, the main drivers of this deterioration are supply side shocks, in particular oil and food prices. The increase in the international oil price is not expected to be a start of a new oil price spiral. Various supply side factors are expected to constrain oil prices 8. Various supply side factors are expected to constrain oil prices 8 going forward in the absence of any major global political risks that would threaten production. While the food price forecast has been adversely affected by higher input costs, a steady decline in food price inflation is still expected. The more favourable rand exchange rate has been an important factor in offsetting some of the negative impacts of these developments. Despite a turbulent second half of 2016, both domestically and globally, the rand has been relatively resilient. Furthermore, the current level of the rand is stronger than that implicit in the forecast, and pass-through to inflation continues to be relatively muted. Nevertheless it remains vulnerable to both domestic and external shocks. As always, the approach of the Committee is to look through the first-round effects of exogenous shocks, but remain focused on the possible emergence of second-round effects which could require a policy response. At this stage, the longer-term trajectory over the relevant policy horizon is unchanged, as is the forecast for core inflation. In particular, the MPC will take note of possible changes in the longer-term inflation expectations, which had shown tentative signs of moderation in the fourth quarter of 2016. The MPC assesses the risks to the inflation outlook to be moderately on the upside. The domestic growth outlook has remained largely unchanged despite a possible weaker outcome in the fourth quarter of 2016. While some improvement is anticipated over the forecast period, growth is expected to remain below potential. The risks to the growth forecast are assessed to be broadly balanced. Growth prospects remain dependent on uncertain but tentatively improving global conditions, and their impact on commodity prices. Domestically, some improvement in agricultural production can be expected. However, a significant improvement in 9. However, a significant improvement in 9 growth prospects requires the implementation of structural reforms which could contribute to increased business and consumer confidence. In light of these developments and the assessment of the balance of risks, the MPC has unanimously decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 7,0 per cent per annum. The MPC remains focused on the medium- to longer-term inflation outlook, but the deterioration of the shorter-term outlook requires increased vigilance. Furthermore, the MPC remains concerned that the longer-term inflation trajectory continues to be uncomfortably close to the upper end of the target range. The Committee retains the view that we may be near the end of the hiking cycle. However, should second- round effects emerge that undermine the longer-term inflation outlook, there may be a reassessment of this view.

Georgia,2017-01-25,"25.01.2017 NBG Increases Its Policy Rate by 25 Basis Points to 6.75% The Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Georgia met on 25th of January, 2017 and decided to increase the refinancing rate by 25 basis points to 6.75 percent. The monetary policy decision is based on the macroeconomic forecast, according to which while demand side pressure on prices is weak, inflation is expected to be above its target rate for the most of the 2017. Nonetheless inflation is going to decline in 2018 and remain below the target. According to the forecast the temporary increase in inflation is a result of one-off events; the increase in excise taxes as well as exchange rate developments should be singled out in this regard. The latter dynamic in exchange rate was mainly driven by Turkish Lira depreciation in the second half of last year and the global strengthening of the US dollar. These new developments have pushed inflationary expectations up and in order to curb them the NBG, based on current forecast, deems necessary to gradually increase the policy rate to 7% over the next two quarters. At this stage policy rate has been raised by 25 basis points. After the elimination of the impact of the aforementioned one-off events the inflation will start declining and will stay close to the target in the medium term. Other things equal, as factors affecting inflation are exhausted the policy rate in the medium term will gradually return to its neutral rate. As a result of weak aggregate demand, the decrease in the imported inflation and the dissipation of the base effect the annual inflation is currently at a low level. The annual growth in consumer prices equaled 1.8% in December 2016. Positive tendencies have been observed in export developments. As a result of improved external demand growth rate of registered goods exports became positive in Q4 2016. However imports have increased as well, contributing to worsened net exports. Tourism revenues are also continuing to grow. Remittances have also increased compared to 2015. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all means and instruments at its disposal in order to ensure price stability in the country. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on March 7, 2017."
Ukraine,2017-01-26,"The NBU Board has decided to maintain its key policy rate at 14% per annum. It is intended to mitigate the inflation risks hampering the achievement of inflation targets in 2017-2018. Headline inflation considerably slowed down in 2016 to 12.4% from 43.3% in 2015, which was in line with the NBU forecast. Therefore, the NBU has met its inflation target set in the Monetary Policy Strategy for 2016-2020. In 2016, fast disinflation was prompted primarily by effect of fundamental factors. This was evidenced by acute drop in core inflation (to 5.8% pp) against the backdrop of prudent monetary and fiscal policies. Stronger role of the key policy rate and its cautious decrease throughout the year, as well as the Government's efforts aimed at keeping the fiscal deficit within the target range contributed to significant improvements in inflation expectations in the first three quarters of the year. Besides, the inflation pressure was easing owing to high supply of raw foods, while the prices were pushed up mainly by increase in utility tariffs and recovery in global oil prices, which made domestic fuel prices edge up. Further, the decline in inflation was facilitated by a moderate exchange rate volatility observed through most of the year owing to NBU measures aimed at smoothing excessive exchange rate fluctuations. However, despite favorable external and internal fundamental factors, in late December - early 2017, the depreciation pressure on the hryvnia gained in strength due to a number of situational factors. First, the foreign exchange market was impacted by a seasonal decline in business activity, in particular lower FX earnings from agricultural exports. Second, foreign currency supply was restricted due to high hryvnia liquidity held by exporters that received UAH 16 billion in VAT refunds in December 2016. Third, the FX demand rose following high budget expenditures in December. The NBU is committed to achieve inflation targets of 2017-2018. The NBU expects inflation within the announced target band (8% Â± 2 pp for 2017 and 6% Â± 2 pp for 2018). The disinflation trend will be ensured through prudent monetary and fiscal policy and much lower rates of administered tariff growth. At the same time, inflation forecast for 2017 is revised from 8.0% to 9.1% primarily due to the minimal wage rise up to UAH 3,200 effective from the beginning of the year. The decision of the Government to increase minimal wages will have an effect on inflation directly through bolstered consumer demand (mainly for foods) and higher production costs, and indirectly through inflation expectations of Ukrainians. Higher consumer demand and productions costs are projected to put additional pressure on the main inflation components in 2017, pushing core inflation up to 6.3%, and raw food inflation up to 7.0%. Apart from that, year-on-year inflation is expected to remain high in the first three quarters due to statistical base effect. It will return to one-digit figures only in Q4 2017. At the same time, the NBU does not consider reasonable to implement monetary policy instruments to reach inflation projections of 8.0% at the end of 2017 (central point of target range). It could lead to the undue volatility of market interest rates and inflation in the future and might slow down the economic growth that is currently at its recovery phase. The NBU did not change its 2018 inflation projections of 6%. The NBU has revised its 2017-2018 GDP growth projections. This will gradually bring the economy to its potential GDP level over the forecast horizon. This means that although aggregate demand continues to rein in inflation, its impact will gradually become weaker versus previous years (and the previous forecast). Stronger consumer demand driven by higher minimal wages is expected to foster economic growth in 2017. Exports are also projected to return to growth, due to terms of trade improving and last year's good harvest. A rise in export earnings will make it possible for export-oriented enterprises to increase their investments at a relatively high pace. However, with still low rates of potential economic growth and slow import substitution processes, imported goods will be largely used to meet higher domestic investment demand. Higher demand for imported goods was a key driver of the current account deficit widening to USD 3.4 billion in 2016 by our estimates. The impact of these factors is expected to continue in 2017-2018. Accordingly, the NBU revised the forecast for current account deficit to hover around USD 3.5 billion in these years. This deficit will be offset by financial account inflows, resulting mostly from investment and borrowing. As a result, the overall balance of payments is projected to record a surplus in 2017-2018. Along with surplus of consolidated balance of payments, the disbursement of planned tranches under the program of cooperation between Ukraine and the IMF will increase the international reserves by the end of 2017 to USD 21.3 billion. Further accumulation of reserves remains an important task for the NBU and the Government, given high volumes of external payments under public debt starting with 2019. Key risks for the baseline scenario imply the growth of geopolitical turbulence and its negative impact on the global economy and economy of Ukraine, as well as the risk of departure from the prudent fiscal policy, including raising social standards even more strikingly than the inflation targets justify it. Moreover, the NBU hopes that the Government will be interested in achieving the inflation targets since the yield of new long-term hryvnia bonds to be issued as a result of re-profiling the domestic bonds from the NBU portfolio will be linked to inflation. The furtherance of structural reforms necessary to preserve the macrofinancial stability, expansion of economy's potential, and continuation of the EFF program with the IMF are also important. In 2017, the NBU will proceed with the prudent monetary policy that will be aimed at decreasing the inflation to meet the inflation targets. Given the increased concentration of inflation and FX risks recently, the NBU Board adopted the decision to preserve the key policy rate at 14%. The decision to keep the key policy rate at 14% is approved by NBU Board Decision No. 49D On the Key Policy Rate, dated 26 January 2017. Ð new detailed macroeconomic forecast will be published in the Inflation Report on 2 February 2017. The next meeting of the NBU Board on monetary policy issues will be held on 2 March 2017 as scheduled."
Colombia,2017-01-27,"The Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica at today's meeting decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 7.5%. For this decision, the Board mainly took into account the following aspects. In December, yearly consumer inflation and the average of core inflation indicators decreased, reaching 5.75% and 5.60%, respectively. Analysts' inflation expectations to one and two years posted at 4.25% and 3.59%, respectively, and those embedded in public debt bonds to 2, 3, and 5 years increased, posting between 3.8% and 4.8%. The effects of the strong transitory supply shocks that diverted inflation from its target continue to fade. This is suggested by the slowdown in the food CPI, and to a lesser extent, by the recent behavior of the prices that were mostly impacted in the past by the strong nominal depreciation. The new figures of global economic activity for the end of 2016 indicate that the average growth of Colombia's trading partners would have been higher than estimated a quarter ago. With this, it is likely that the recovery of external demand in 2017 be slightly higher than forecast three months ago. International long-term interest rates increased, and the country's terms of trade continue to recover. In this context, the peso has appreciated versus the US dollar. Uncertainty about the international financial and trade conditions has increased since the last Board meeting, with a possible impact on global interest rates and the evolution of the US dollar. In Colombia, several of the indicators of economic activity and perception for the fourth quarter of 2016 suggest that the economy exhibited low dynamism, although somewhat better than in the third quarter. With this, the technical staff reduced the most likely growth figure for 2016 from 2.0% to 1.8%, within a range between 1.6% and 2.0%. In 2017, output growth would stand between 0.7% and 2.7%, with 2.0% as the most likely figure. The end-of-the-year figures for foreign trade suggest an adjustment of external balance greater than had been forecast. With this, the new projection for the current account deficit for 2016 stands at 4.5% of GDP, equivalent to US 12.6 billion. Considering the current level of core inflation indicators and inflation expectations, various calculations of the policy real interest rate are above their average since 2005. In all, the Colombian economy continues to adjust to the strong shocks recorded since 2014, and the current account deficit continues to adjust. Output dynamics has been weaker than had been forecast, and inflation continues to decline, although core inflation indicators and inflation expectations exceed the 3.0% target. The effects of several of the transitory supply shocks that have affected inflation and inflation expectations continue to reverse, and this trend is likely to continue. The tax reform adopted by the Congress favors the productive investment and enables the achievement of higher levels of income in the long term, in addition to consolidating the country's fiscal and external sustainability. In this context, by assessing the increase in inflation expectations, the higher global uncertainty, and the behavior of domestic demand, the Board deemed appropriate to maintain the benchmark interest rate unaltered, pending new information. The decision to maintain the benchmark interest rate unchanged was approved by four members of the Board. The remaining three Board Members voted for a 25 bp reduction of the benchmark interest rate.

Pakistan,2017-01-28,"STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Monetary Policy Statement January 28, 2017 The average inflation clocked in at. percent during the first half of the year, lower than the earlier projections due to smooth supply of perishable items, stable exchange rate, and government's absorption of the impact of higher international oil prices. The current trends suggest that the actual inflation would be lower than the target rate of percent in FY17. Growing CPEC-related imports, decline in exports, absence of Coalition Support Fund, and slowdown in remittances, pushed the current account deficit to USD. billion in the first half of FY17, from USD. billion in the same period last year. This higher deficit was financed by an increase in bilateral and multilateral funding along with pick up in investment flows. Overall surplus in the balance of payments stands at USD. billion in the first half of the current year. Going forward, with the aforementioned risks to the external sector, the need of financial inflows would grow further. sizeable net retirement of government borrowing to scheduled banks and an increase in bank deposits helped increase private sector credit. Benefiting from the historic low interest rates, private businesses are actively borrowing from the banking sector for upgrading and expanding their business processes. Private sector borrowed Rs 375 billion in first half of FY17 as compared to Rs 282. billion availed in the corresponding period of last year. Loans for fixed investments increased by Rs 134. billion in the first half of FY17 compared with an expansion of Rs 83. billion in the same period of last year. Demand for consumer financing, especially for auto loans, also gathered pace during the first half of the year. Healthy credit expansion, along with higher production of Kharif crops, visible improvements in energy supply, and upbeat business sentiments signal recuperating real economic activities. Large-scale Manufacturing grew by. percent during the first five months of the current fiscal year and further increase is expected on account of growing infrastructure spending and recent policy support for export oriented sectors. Based on an assessment of the above developments and after detailed deliberations, the Monetary Policy Committee has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at.75 percent. Page."
United States,2017-02-01,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace. Job gains remained solid and the unemployment rate stayed near its recent low. Household spending has continued to rise moderately while business fixed investment has remained soft. Measures of consumer and business sentiment have improved of late. Inflation increased in recent quarters but is still below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further, and inflation will rise to 2 percent over the medium term. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced. The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1/2 to 3/4 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Janet L Yellen. Chair; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Lael Brainard; Charles L Evans; Stanley Fischer; Patrick Harker; Robert S Kaplan; Neel Kashkari; Jerome H Powell; and Daniel K Tarullo. Implementation Note issued February 1, 2017."
Czech Republic,2017-02-02,"<At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank decided unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged at technical zero. The Bank Board decided to continue using the exchange rate as an additional instrument for easing the monetary conditions. It confirmed the CNB's commitment to intervene on the foreign exchange market if needed to weaken the koruna against the euro so that the exchange rate of the koruna is kept close to CZK 27 to the euro. In line with this, the CNB still stands ready to intervene automatically without any time or volume limits. The asymmetric nature of this exchange rate commitment is unchanged.. This decision is underpinned by a new macroeconomic forecast. The forecast assumes that the exchange rate will be used as a monetary policy instrument until mid-2017. At the close of 2016, inflation rose sharply and returned to the 2% target. According to the forecast, inflation will increase further into the upper half of the tolerance band around the target and return to the target from above at the monetary policy horizon. According to the new forecast, the conditions for sustainable fulfilment of the 2% inflation target in the future, i.e. also after the assumed return to the conventional monetary policy regime, will be met from around mid-2017 onwards. A need to maintain expansionary monetary conditions to the current extent persists. The Bank Board therefore states again that the Czech National Bank will not discontinue the use of the exchange rate as a monetary policy instrument before 2017 Q2. The Bank Board still considers it likely that the commitment will be discontinued around the middle of 2017. According to the assumptions of the new forecast, economic growth in the effective euro area will slow further at the start of this year but then gradually return towards 2%. The decline in industrial producer prices in the euro area will fade away in early 2017. These prices will then rise at a pace of just over 2% year on year. Consumer price inflation will go up as well, but it will not reach 2% before the end of 2018. The outlook for three-month EURIBOR market interest rates is negative over the entire forecast horizon, reflecting continued easy monetary policy of the European Central Bank. The ECB's policy is also reflected in a weakening of the euro against the US dollar. The outlook for the Brent crude oil price foresees stability close to the current level. The rise in domestic inflation at the end of last year was due mainly to a recovery in food price growth and an unwinding of the year-on-year fall in fuel prices. Core inflation, i.e. adjusted inflation excluding fuels, increased as well. Its evolution primarily reflected growth in the domestic economy and wages. In December, it was also affected by an increase in prices linked with the launch of the first phase of electronic sales registration. According to the forecast, inflation will increase further into the upper half of the tolerance band around the target. It will then return to the 2% target from above at the monetary policy horizon, i.e. in the first half of next year. Domestic costs will continue to rise apace, due mainly to rising wages. Coupled with renewed growth in industrial producer prices in the euro area, this will lead to a further increase in core inflation. Counteracting this will be a strengthening of the koruna expected by the forecast from mid-2017 onwards. Monetary policy-relevant inflation, i.e. inflation adjusted for the first-round effects of changes to indirect taxes, will differ only marginally from headline inflation. The growth of the Czech economy eased further in 2016 Q3. According to the assumptions of the forecast, it reached 2.4% in 2016 as a whole. The rate of growth will increase to almost 3% in the next two years. The economy will be supported by continued growth in external demand, a gradual renewal of growth in government investment and still easy monetary conditions. However, the monetary conditions will start to shift towards a neutral effect following the assumed discontinuation of the CNB's exchange rate commitment in mid-2017. The continued economic growth will lead to a further increase in wage growth. The unemployment rate will decrease only slightly. The forecast assumes that market interest rates will be flat at their current very low level and the exchange rate will be used as a monetary policy instrument until mid-2017. Consistent with the forecast is an increase in market interest rates thereafter. The appreciation of the exchange rate following the return to the conventional monetary policy regime is dampened in the forecast among other things by the fact that the weaker exchange rate of the koruna has been passing through to the price level and other nominal variables in the period since the exchange rate commitment was introduced. Nevertheless, a positive interest rate differential against the euro and the effect of the ECB's quantitative easing will manifest themselves. Renewed  although much slower than in the pre-crisis period  real convergence of the Czech economy to the advanced euro area countries will act in the same direction. According to the forecast, the koruna will thus appreciate against the euro in the second half of 2017. However, the forecast does not take into account that the appreciation of the koruna may be strongly dampened by hedging of exchange rate risk by exporters before the exit from the CNB's exchange rate commitment, as well as by the closing of koruna positions by financial investors. This market â€œoverboughtnessâ€ may even lead to depreciation of the koruna. Compared to the previous forecast, the inflation outlook for this year is higher. This is due to the surprisingly strong increase in inflation at the close of last year, the higher short-term inflation forecast and faster growth in nominal wages. At the monetary policy horizon, however, the new inflation outlook differs only slightly from the previous forecast. The forecast for the growth of the Czech economy in the near future has been revised downwards on account of a lower contribution of net exports. From the whole-year perspective, however, the economic growth forecast for this year and the next is only slightly lower. Following the assumed exit from the exchange rate commitment, interest rates will rise at a slower pace than according to the previous forecast."
Russia,2017-02-03,"On 3 February 2017, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to keep the key rate at 10.00% p.a. The Board of Directors points out that inflation performance has been in line with the forecast, inflation expectations are going down gradually, and the economy is recovering faster than previously expected. However, the slower growth of consumer prices is partially attributed to temporary factors. The purchases/sales of foreign currency in the FX market, which Russia's Finance Ministry intends to carry out under a transitional budget rule, will not bring considerable inflation risks given the Bank of Russia sticks to its moderately tight monetary policy. Inflation is to slow down to the 4% target by late 2017 and hold close to this level in the sequel. Given the internal and external developments, the Bank of Russia's capability to cut its key rate in the first half of 2017 has diminished. In its key rate decision-making the Bank of Russia was guided by the following assumptions. Inflation. Annual inflation continues to decline in line with the Bank of Russia's forecast. This is partially attributed to temporary factors â€” the ruble exchange rate and last year's heavy crop. December saw a further slowdown in growth of prices for staple goods and services, as well as lower monthly inflation (seasonally adjusted). Non-food inflation slowed down considerably. According to the estimates as of 30 January, annual consumer price growth was down from 5.4% in 2016 to 5.1%. Domestic demand continues to exert a disinflationary effect. Households are retaining their savings behaviour model, although their sentiment improved. Consumer lending bears no inflation risks. The Bank of Russia's forecast suggests that given today's decision and extension of moderately tight monetary policy, annual inflation is to slow down to the 4% target by late 2017 and hold close to this level in the sequel. Monetary conditions. In order to maintain the propensity to save and anchor sustainable inflation slowdown driven by demand-side restrictions, monetary conditions should remain moderately tight. They should also help bring inflation expectations of households and businesses further down. Positive real interest rates will be held at the level which will ensure demand for loans without increasing inflationary pressure and uphold incentives for saving. The Bank of Russia will manage banking sector liquidity with due account taken for the Finance Ministry's purchases/sales of foreign currency in the FX market and their effect on the money market rates will be almost immaterial. Economic activity. Economic recovery in 2016 was somewhat above the Bank of Russia's expectations, as the average annual oil price was close to the baseline scenario assumptions. The Bank of Russia estimates that quarterly GDP growth rates entered positive territory in the second half of 2016, with the positive trend set to hold into the first quarter of the current year. Growth in industrial production (partially driven by import substitution) is ongoing, and so is expansion of non-oil and gas exports in several categories; investment activity is gradually perking up. Unemployment remains steadily low. The labour market is adjusting to the new economic environment, with signs beginning to emerge that skilled labour shortages are finding their way in individual segments. At the same time, the current economic recovery processes still lack consistency across sectors and regions. Polling data reflect an improvement in business and consumer sentiment, which is, going forward, expected to shore up the economic revival processes. The Bank of Russia's estimates signal that the observed annual rise in real wages will foster gradual growth in consumer activity. It will come without additional proinflationary pressure amid a rise in supply of goods and services. Annual GDP is expected to show positive growth in 2017; however, the rates of economic growth will be low. It takes structural improvements and time for the positive trends to advance and become sustainable. Inflation risks. Risks remain that inflation will be above the target level of 4% in 2017; having said that, inflation risks are abating on a mid-term horizon. The inertia of inflation expectations and households' shrinking propensity to save may prevent inflation from consolidating on the path towards the target as the effect of temporary factors comes to an end. External political and economic uncertainty remains elevated, which may negatively affect expectations as regards exchange rate and inflation. Maintenance of moderately tight monetary conditions will constrain inflation risks, including the short-term ones, coming from the launch of the Finance Ministry-conducted purchase of foreign currency in the FX market. Having said that, the application of the transitional budget rule, accompanied with the Finance Ministry-conducted purchases/sales of foreign currency in the FX market will help lower the dependence of the Russian economy, particularly in terms of monetary conditions and inflation dynamics, on fluctuating oil prices. In the medium term, the application of the budget rule will help bring about macroeconomic stability and more predictable and steadier interest rates in the economy. Considering the change in the external and internal environment, the Bank of Russia's capability to downgrade its key rate in the course of the first half of 2017 has diminished. The next meeting of the Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia to review the key rate is scheduled for 24 March 2017. The Board's decision press release is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time.

Romania,2017-02-07," Video: Press conference, 9 February 2017 - Quarterly Inflation Report (Romanian only)  Video: Press briefing, 7 February 2017 (Romanian only)  Board meeting minutes. In its meeting of 7 February 2017, the Board of the National Bank of Romania (NBR) decided the following:. In December 2016, the annual CPI inflation rate rose to -0.54 percent from -0.67 percent in the previous month, below the forecasted level. This evolution was entirely ascribable to the return to positive territory of the annual dynamics of fuel prices, the impact of which was mitigated by that of the decline in the annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate1. In Q4 as a whole, the annual inflation rate saw a marginal increase (-0.57 percent in September), slightly below expectations. At end-2016, the annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate stood at 0.3 percent, compared to 0.6 percent in September. The average annual inflation rate continued to post less negative values, standing at -1.5 percent in December 2016 (from -1.7 percent in September) on the back of the diminishing statistical impact of applying the reduced VAT rate to all food items; similarly, the inflation rate based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices rose to -1.1 percent in December 2016 from -1.3 percent in September 2016. The stronger-than-expected deceleration in annual economic growth in 2016 Q3 was ascribable to the slacker advance in domestic demand on account of the slowdown in household consumption and gross fixed capital formation. In the context of a much sharper decline in the growth rate of imports compared to that of exports of goods and services, the negative contribution of net exports to real GDP growth shrank to almost zero. The latest statistical data reveal a further robust annual growth rate of the turnover volume of retail trade in the first months of 2016 Q4 and a faster annual rate of increase of industrial output, with construction posting, however, a steeper decline. Furthermore, the annual dynamics of unit wage costs in industry remained high. Real monetary conditions continued to be stimulative in January 2017. Average remuneration of new time deposits remained relatively steady in December 2016, while the average interest rate on new loans to the private sector fell to a new historical low. Credit to the private sector kept rising at a faster pace in December 2016, further on the back of non-financial corporations. The share of leu-denominated credit in total private sector loans continued to widen, reaching 57.2 percent. This certifies a better monetary policy transmission, while also helping mitigate the risks to financial stability. In today's meeting, the NBR Board examined and approved the February 2017 Inflation Report, which incorporates the most recent data and information available. The baseline scenario of the projection reconfirms the outlook for the annual inflation rate to revert to positive territory in 2017 Q1, amid the fading out of the impact of the standard VAT rate cut to 20 percent. The annual inflation rate is, however, projected to run at lower levels and its subsequent rise is relatively slower, due mainly to new disinflationary supply-side shocks that emerged from November 2016 to February 2017. They include the price cuts for compulsory motor third-party liability insurance policies and the scrapping of non-tax fees and charges, whose effects add to those coming from the standard VAT rate cut to 19 percent and the removal of the special excise duty on fuels as from 1 January 2017. The projected annual inflation rate retains its upward path. Specifically, it is seen re-entering the variation band of the flat target towards the end of 2017 and climbing into the upper half of this band at the beginning of 2018 to reach higher-than-previously-forecasted levels. The risks and uncertainties surrounding the inflation outlook stem from both domestic and external environment. Domestically, they originate mainly in the fiscal and income policy stance during 2017. In addition, uncertainties linger as to future adjustments in administered prices, but also to the developments in the general domestic environment. On the external front, still relevant are the risks related to euro area economic growth arising from political uncertainties associated with the elections scheduled for this year and Brexit talks, the divergence between monetary policy stances of the world's major central banks, and the issues facing the European banking system. In this context and based on currently available data, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided to keep unchanged the monetary policy rate at 1.75 percent per annum, to further pursue adequate liquidity management in the banking system, and to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board decisions aim to ensure and preserve price stability over the medium term in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth. The NBR Board reiterates that a balanced macroeconomic policy mix and progress in structural reforms are of the essence in preserving a stable macroeconomic framework and strengthening the capacity of the Romanian economy to withstand potentially adverse global developments. The NBR is closely monitoring domestic and external developments and stands ready to use all its available tools with a view to achieving its objectives. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be released to the public in a press conference on 9 February 2017. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR website on 14 February 2017, 3:00 p.m. The next monetary policy meeting of the NBR Board is scheduled for 5 April 2017. 1 Calculated by excluding from the consumer price index the following categories: administered prices, volatile prices, and tobacco and alcoholic beverage prices."
India,2017-02-08,"Sixth Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2016-17 Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). Reserve Bank of India On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation at its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 6.25 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains unchanged at 5.75 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 6.75 per cent. The decision of the MPC is consistent with a neutral stance of monetary policy in consonance with the objective of achieving consumer price index (CPI) inflation at 5 per cent by Q4 of 2016-17 and the medium-term target of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Assessment 2. Global growth is projected to pick up modestly in 2017, after slowing down in the year gone by. Advanced economies (AEs) are expected to build upon the slow gathering of momentum that started in the second half of 2016, led by the US and Japan. However, uncertainty surrounds the direction of US macroeconomic policies with potential global spillovers. Growth prospects for emerging market economies (EMEs) are also expected to improve moderately, with recessionary conditions ebbing in Russia and Brazil, and China stabilising on policy stimulus. Inflation is edging up on the back of rising energy prices and a mild firming up of demand. However, global trade remains subdued due to an increasing tendency towards protectionist policies and heightened political tensions. Furthermore, financial conditions are likely to tighten as central banks in AEs normalise exceptional accommodation in monetary policy. 12016-17 on January 6, placing India's real GVA growth at 7.0 per cent for the year, down from 7.8 per cent (first revised estimates released on January 31) a year ago. Agriculture and allied activities posted a strong pick-up, benefiting from the normal south-west monsoon, robust expansion in rabi acreage (higher by 5.7 per cent over the preceding year) and favourable base effects as well as the continuing resilience of allied activities. In contrast, the industrial sector experienced a sharp deceleration, mainly due to a slowdown in manufacturing and in mining and quarrying. Service sector activity also lost pace, concentrated in trade, hotels, transport and communication services, and construction, cushioned to some extent by public administration and defence. Industrial output measured by the index of industrial production (IIP) finally shrugged off the debilitating drag from insulated rubber cables from November and was also pushed up by a favourable base effect. In December, the output of core industries accelerated on a year- on-year as well as on a sequentially seasonally adjusted basis. The drivers of the upturn were steel production and petroleum refinery throughput, the former, inter alia, supported by import tariff safeguards and the latter buoyed by external demand. The acceleration in coal production and thermal electricity generation since November after three consecutive months of contraction augur well for the outlook for power. Reflecting these developments, the manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) returned to expansion mode in January on the back of growth of new orders and output, and the future output index has risen strongly. On the other hand, the 76th round of the Reserve Bank's industrial outlook survey suggests that financing conditions facing the manufacturing sector have worsened in Q3 of 2016-17 and are expected to remain tight in Q4. This is corroborated by the sharp slowdown in bank credit to industry and continuing sluggishness in the investment climate in some sectors. High frequency indicators point to subdued activity in the services sector, particularly automobile sales across all segments, domestic air cargo, railway freight traffic, and cement production. Nevertheless, some areas stand out as bright spots, having weathered the transient effects of demonetisation  steel consumption; port traffic; international air freight; foreign tourist arrivals; tractor sales; and, cellular telephone subscribers. The services PMI for January 2017 remained in retrenchment, but the fall in output was the least in the current phase of three consecutive months of contraction. The average daily net absorption under the LAF was 1.6 trillion in December, 2.0 trillion in January and 3.7 trillion in February (up to February 7) while under the MSS, it was 3.8 trillion, 5.0 trillion and 2.9 trillion, respectively. Money market rates remained aligned with the policy repo rate albeit with a soft bias, with the weighted average call money rate (WACR) averaging 18 basis points below the policy rate during December and January. Turning to the external sector, export growth remained in the positive zone for the fourth month in succession in December. Imports other than petroleum oil and lubricants (POL) came out of the spike in November and moderated in December. In contrast, there was an increase of over 10 per cent in POL imports, in part reflecting the rise in international crude oil prices. Overall, the trade deficit shrank both sequentially and on a year-on-year basis, being lower for the period April-December by US$ 23.5 billion than its level a year ago. On the whole, the current account deficit is likely to remain muted and below 1 per cent of GDP in 2016-17. While the buoyancy in net foreign direct investment was sustained, there have been portfolio outflows beginning October on uncertainty relating to the direction of US macroeconomic policies and expectations of faster normalisation of US monetary policy in the year ahead. Foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 363.1 billion on February 3, 2017. Outlook 11. In the fifth bi-monthly statement of December, headline inflation was projected at 5 per cent in Q4 of 2016-17 with risks lower than before but still tilted to the upside. The decline in headline CPI inflation in November and December has been larger than expected, but almost exclusively on the back of deflation in vegetables and pulses. While the seasonal ebb in 34 of 2016-17 is likely to be below 5 per cent. Favourable base effects and lagged effects of demand compression may mute headline inflation in Q1 of 2017-18. Thereafter, it is expected to pick up momentum, especially as growth picks up and the output gap narrows. Moreover, base effects will reverse and turn adverse during Q3 and Q4 of 2017-18. Accordingly, inflation is projected in the range of 4.0 to 4.5 per cent in the first half of the financial year and in the range of 4.5 to 5.0 per cent in the second half with risks evenly balanced around this projected path (Chart 1). In this context, it is important to note three significant upside risks that impart some uncertainty to the baseline inflation path  the hardening profile of international crude prices; volatility in the exchange rate on account of global financial market developments, which could impart upside pressures to domestic inflation; and the fuller effects of the house rent allowances under the 7th Central Pay Commission (CPC) award which have not been factored in the baseline inflation path. The focus of the Union budget on growth revival without compromising on fiscal prudence should bode well for limiting upside risks to inflation. GVA growth for 2016-17 is projected at 6.9 per cent with risks evenly balanced around it. Growth is expected to recover sharply in 2017-18 on account of several factors. First, discretionary consumer demand held back by demonetisation is expected to bounce back beginning in the closing months of 2016-17. Second, economic activity in cash-intensive sectors such as retail trade, hotels and restaurants, and transportation, as well as in the unorganised sector, is expected to be rapidly restored. Third, demonetisation-induced ease in bank funding conditions has led to a sharp improvement in transmission of past policy rate reductions into marginal cost-based lending rates (MCLRs), and in turn, to lending rates for healthy borrowers, which should spur a pick-up in both consumption and investment demand. Fourth, the emphasis in the Union Budget for 2017-18 on stepping up capital expenditure, and boosting the rural economy and affordable housing should contribute to growth. Accordingly. GVA growth for 2017-18 is projected at 7.4 per cent, with risks evenly balanced (Chart 2). The Reserve Bank has conducted market liquidity operations consistent with the liquidity management framework put in place in April 2016, progressively moving the system level ex ante liquidity conditions to close to neutrality. This stance will continue. Surplus liquidity should decline with progressive remonetisation. Nonetheless, the currently abundant liquidity with banks is likely to persist into the early months of 2017-18. The Reserve Bank is committed to ensuring efficient and appropriate liquidity management with all the instruments at its command to ensure close alignment of the WACR with the policy rate, improved transmission of policy impulses to lending rates, and adequate flow of credit to productive sectors of the economy. The Committee believes that the environment for timely transmission of policy rates to banks lending rates will be considerably improved if the banking sector's non- performing assets (NPAs) are resolved more quickly and efficiently; recapitalisation of the banking sector is hastened; and, the formula for adjustments in the interest rates on small savings schemes to changes in yields on government securities of corresponding maturity is fully implemented.1 1 Since the introduction of the formula in April 2016, interest rates on small savings are about 65-100 basis points higher, depending on tenor, compared to what they should be if the formula is followed. If the spread between small savings rates and bond yields remains wide, the diversion of deposits to small savings would impede a full transmission to bank lending rates. Jose J.

Philippines,2017-02-08,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) facility at 3.0 percent. The corresponding interest rates on the overnight lending and deposit facilities were also kept steady. The reserve requirement ratios were likewise left unchanged. The Monetary Board's decision is based on its assessment of inflation dynamics and the risks to the inflation outlook over the policy horizon. While inflation has risen due to the recent increases in food and oil prices, latest baseline forecasts continue to indicate that the future inflation path will remain within the target range of 3.0 percent Â± 1 percentage point for 2017-2018. Inflation expectations are also aligned with the inflation target over the policy horizon. The Monetary Board further noted that the balance of risks surrounding the inflation outlook continues to be weighted toward the upside, given possible adjustments in electricity rates as well as the initial impact of the government's broad fiscal reform program. Meanwhile, uncertainty over global growth prospects continues to pose a key downside risk to the inflation outlook. The Monetary Board stressed that while the global economic environment has become more challenging due to expected shifts in macroeconomic policies in advanced economies, including the ongoing normalization of monetary policy in the US, domestic economic activity is expected to stay firm, supported by buoyant household consumption and private investment, increased fiscal spending, and ample credit and liquidity. With these considerations, the Monetary Board believes that prevailing monetary policy settings remain appropriate. Going forward, the BSP will continue to monitor and assess evolving economic developments and will calibrate its policy tools as appropriate to ensure sustained price and financial stability."
Poland,2017-02-08,"Warsaw, 8 February 2017 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 7-8 February 2017 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: ï‚§ reference rate at 1.50%; ï‚§ lombard rate at 2.50%; ï‚§ deposit rate at 0.50%; ï‚§ rediscount rate at 1.75%. Economic growth abroad remains moderate, but forecasts for the global economy have recently been revised up. In the euro area, a gradual recovery continues, amid stronger industrial confidence. In the United States, economic conditions are supported by improving labour market, reflected both in rising employment and wages. In China. GDP growth slightly picked up in 2016 Q4, following a few years of slowdown. In Russia, recession is gradually receding. Global commodity prices are significantly higher than a year ago, which results in rising inflation in many economies. However, in many of them, including the euro area, demand pressure is still low, containing the rise in inflation and keeping the core inflation rates at a moderate level. The European Central Bank keeps interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero. The ECB also continues its asset purchase programme. The Federal Reserve indicates further rise in interest rates in 2017. In Poland, preliminary data on GDP in 2016 indicate that in 2016 Q4 the annual economic growth rate was close to that recorded a quarter earlier. Economic growth was mainly driven by increasing consumer demand, supported by a rise in employment and wages, very good consumer sentiment and child benefit payments. Net exports and rise in inventories also added to GDP growth. At the same time, fall in investment narrowed. Lower pace of investment decline probably resulted from higher use of EU funds under the new EU financial perspective. In recent months, like in many countries the annual growth in prices of consumer goods and services picked up. The price growth results from higher global commodity prices, i.e. factors beyond the direct impact of domestic monetary policy. At the same time, inflationary pressure is contained by moderate growth in unit labour costs and the negative output gap in the domestic economy. In the Council's opinion, following a rise in inflation in the first months of the year, price growth will stabilize in the coming quarters. Annual inflation will be increased owing to the effects of higher global commodity prices. Bearing in mind the external and most probably temporary nature of factors behind the increase in price growth as well as 1/2 low domestic demand pressure, the Council judges that the risk of inflation persistently running above the target in the medium term is low. The Council confirms its assessment that  given the available data and forecasts  the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on the sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic balance."
Thailand,2017-02-08,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 1/2017 Mr. Jaturong Jantarangs. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 8 February 2017 as follows. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 150 percent. In deliberating their policy decision, the Committee assessed that the Thai economy would recover at a faster pace compared with the previous assessment despite facing uncertainties especially on the external front. Inflation would continue to be on an upward trajectory. Meanwhile overall financial conditions remained accommodative and conducive to the economic recovery although bond yields increased somewhat. Hence the Committee decided to keep the policy rate on hold at this meeting. The Thai economy was projected to expand at a faster pace on the back of a more broad-based recovery in merchandise exports and a faster-than-expected recovery in tourism. At the same time, public expenditure remained an important growth driver, while private consumption and private investment continued to recover at a gradual pace. Nevertheless the improved growth outlook was still subject to various risk factors that warranted close monitoring going forward. These included the implications of the US economic and foreign trade policies, financial stability concerns in China, political developments in Europe, and problems faced by the European banking sector. Headline inflation returned to the target band last December and continued trending upward. Core inflation steadied around the previous assessment which reflected low demand-pull inflationary pressure. Meanwhile the public's medium-term inflation expectations remained close to the target. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative and conducive to the economic recovery with ample liquidity in the financial system and low real interest rates. Nevertheless bond yields increased somewhat due to both domestic and external factors. With regard to the exchange rate movements over the recent period, uncertainties stemming from external developments led to some appreciation of the baht against major trading partners' currencies, which might not be as beneficial to the ongoing economic recovery as it could under the Committee's assessment. The Committee viewed that financial stability remained sound with sufficient cushion against economic and financial volatilities on both domestic and external fronts. However there remained pockets of risks that warranted close monitoring such as the deterioration in loan quality of some business sectors, defaults of unrated bonds issued by certain companies, and the search-for-yield behavior in the prolonged low interest rate environment which might lead to the underpricing of risks. 2 Under the Committee's assessment, the Thai economy started to gain more traction, but uncertainties remained at large, particularly those pertaining to the fragile global economic recovery and to the economic and monetary policy directions of major advanced economies. Meanwhile demand-pull inflationary pressure remained low. Thus the Committee viewed that monetary policy should remain accommodative, and would stand ready to utilize an appropriate mix of available policy tools in order to ensure that monetary conditions are conducive to the economic recovery, while ensuring financial stability."
Armenia,2017-02-14,"PRESS RELEASE 14.02.2017 On the February 14, 2017 meeting the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia decided to lower the refinancing rate by 0.25 percentage point to 6.0%. Inflation in January 2017 was 2.6% against 2.2% recorded in the same month last year. The 12â€month deflation reduced, making up 0.6%. Trends in the external sector generally persisted  the global economy continues to grow slowly, while international commodity markets further face some inflationary developments. In the upcoming months, the Board estimates, significant inflationary effects from the external sector are not anticipated. The Board notes that economic growth estimates for 2016 have decreased, largely due to the influence of supply factors. At the same time, domestic demand is gradually recovering due mostly to expansionary monetary and fiscal policies implemented during 2015â€2016. It should be noted that the path to achieving the inflation target will be somewhat slower compared to the previous prediction due to lower expected prices on certain nonâ€food products and reduction in natural gas and electricity tariffs since January and February, respectively. Given these factors, as well as the Government's contractionary fiscal policy in 2017 relative to the previous year, the Board believes that easing the monetary conditions this time again is appropriate and possible. The Board remains of the opinion that the policy implemented to date has created enough stimuli for neutralizing the deflationary environment in 2017 and fulfilling the inflation target in the forecast horizon, while future possibilities of conventional monetary policy remain limited. However, adhering to the objective of ensuring price stability, the Central Bank of Armenia will, if necessary, respond adequately by using its toolkit, in order to fulfill the inflation target in the medium term. More information on the setting of interest rate will be available in the Inflation Report (Monetary Policy Program. Q1, 2017) to be published on February 24, 2017.

Chile,2017-02-14,"Santiago. Chile. Tuesday, 14 February 2017 Monetary Policy Meeting  February 2017 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 3.25%. Internationally, global financial conditions continued to improve and emerging economies' asset prices have risen further, as the good performance of some economies in the region stands out. The price of copper rose, owing partly to supply- side factors. Oil has remained around the prices of a month ago. Global activity indicators continue to point to a recovery, especially in the developed world. Still, significant risks remain. At home, annual inflation was 2.8%, consistent with forecasts in the last Monetary Policy Report. Inflation expectations at the end of the projection horizon are near target, although for the coming months they remain in the lower part of the tolerance range. Activity and demand indicators remain weak, while the labor market continues to show previous trends. Long-term interest rates fell and the peso appreciated. The Board estimates that, in the most likely scenario, it will be necessary to boost the monetary impulse over the short term. At the same time, it reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. The Spanish original prevails."
Peru,2017-02-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR FEBRUARY 2017 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 4.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 4.25 percent. This decision is consistent with an inflation forecast in which inflation converges to the target range during 2017 and takes into account the following factors: Expectations of inflation in 12 months' time remain within the target range and continue showing a declining path; The prices of some food products are being affected by climate alterations, their impact being expected to be temporary; The pace of growth of domestic economic activity has slowed down in the last quarter of 2016 in a context of lower public expenditure. Economic activity is expected to grow at a rate close to its potential growth level in the following quarters as a result of increased investment and better terms of trade, and The global economy shows signals of recovery, although there is greater uncertainty regarding developed countries' policies. The Board oversees new data on inflation and inflation determinants in the forecast horizon to evaluate the convenience of making additional adjustments in the monetary policy rate. Inflation in January showed a rate of 0.24 percent due to rises in the prices of some food products, which has led the year-to-year rate of inflation to decline from 3.23 percent in December to 3.10 percent in January. Inflation without food and energy recorded a rate of 0.04 percent, as a result of which the year-to-year rate increased from 2.87 percent in December to 2.98 percent in January, level within the target range. Indicators of business expectations showed more moderate levels in January, but remain within the optimistic side. In line with this. GDP is expected to grow between 3.8 and 4.0 percent in 2017. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 3.0 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 4.80 percent for the first 15 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 15 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.80 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for March on March 9, 2017."
Egypt,2017-02-16,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release February 16, 2017 In its meeting held on February 16, 2017, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) main operation unchanged at 1475 percent, 1575 percent, and 1525 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 1525 percen. Annual headline inflation rose to 2814 percent in January 2017 due to exceptional monthly increases averaging 401 percent between November 2016 and January 2017 that were strongly impacted by the economic reform measure. The higher monthly inflation in January (407 percent) compared to December (313 percent) is estimated to be partly driven by relatively higher regular monthly dynamics as well as the introduction of higher custom tariffs in the end of 201. Between November 2016 and January 2017, inflation has been mainly driven by tradable items, while the contribution of non-tradable items started to decline in December, confirming cost-push factors to be the main inflation drive. Core items experienced the largest increases, particularly food, while the joint contribution of retail and services has been narrowing in relative term. In the meantime, non-core food prices (volatile food) and regulated prices also rose somewhat in Januar. Given the increases in core items, annual core inflation rose to 3086 percent in January 2017 due to average monthly inflation of 489 percent between November 2016 and January 201. Annual real GDP growth declined to 34 percent in 2016/17 Q1 after averaging 43 percent between 2014/15 and 2015/1. The drop was mainly driven by consumption, while the contribution of gross fixed investment held steady as the increase in private investment offset the decline in public investmen. Furthermore the negative contribution of net exports narrowed, mainly due to the recovery of exports which registered its first positive contribution to real GDP growth since 2014/15 Q2, while the negative contribution of imports lessene. Labor market data show that the unemployment rate narrowed to 124 percent in 2016/17 Q2, continuing its downward trend after peaking at 134 percent in 2013/14 Q. Developments in the external environment show that there has been some firming of international commodity prices, while low global inflation and subdued global growth, albeit recovering, maintain weak pressures on domestic price. From the monetary perspective, annual broad money growth has been strongly affected by the revaluation effects of its foreign currency component. Excluding revaluation effects, higher broad money growth during November and December came mainly due to the recovery of net foreign assets, evident by the CBE's international reserve accumulatio. In the meantime the growth of reserve money is expected to be impacted by the phasing out of monetary financing of the fiscal defici. Looking ahead, annual inflation is expected to drop after transitory cost-push effects subside and monthly inflation rates decline, supported by preemptive monetary policy actions, term absorption of excess liquidity, as well as favorable base effect. Consistent with the inflation outlook, the targeted disinflation path, and given the balance of risks, the MPC judges that the key CBE rates are currently appropriat. The MPC reiterates its price stability mandate and will continue to closely monitor all economic and monetary developments, and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter.

Kazakhstan,2017-02-20,"Press-Release – 7 On the base rate February 20, 2017 Almaty The National Bank of Kazakhstan has decided to reduce the base rate to 11% with a corridor of +/- 1%. In January 2017 the annual inflation rate has reached the target band of 6-8%. The decrease in inflationary expectations, the stability and the predictability of the situation on the domestic FX and money markets, the recovery of the business activity, and also the favorable external economic conditions caused the easing of the monetary conditions. The new level of the base rate reflects the long-run balance between the price stability and the financial stability; therefore, the potential of the further easing of the monetary policy is limited. The decision on the base rate was made with the account of the following factors. The annual inflation rate has slowed down in January 2017 to 7.9%, which completely matches the forecasts of the National Bank. The acceleration of the price growth in the specific commodity markets and in the paid services will not have a significant impact on the dynamics of the overall level of inflation and will be offset by the moderate price tendency in the markets of other consumer goods and services. According to the survey taken in January on the inflationary expectations of the population, the observed tendency of improved expectations of respondents regarding the future level of inflation indicates the mitigation of their pro-inflation behavior. Quantitative assessment of the inflationary expectations shows that the expectations of the population are formed within the target band and fixed on the levels (6.6% in January) that are lower than the actual inflation Furthermore, the share of the respondents, who expect the high level of inflation, has decreased to the lowest value since the middle of the last year. So, in case of the absence of the adverse shocks, the inflation will persistently remain within the target band throughout the entire year of 2017, and also during the first half of 2018. Devaluation expectations not only of the population, but also of the professional market participants, have been decreasing, which is reflected in the survey outcome and the hedging cost of exchange rate risks. The deposit market data show the ongoing process of de-dollarization of the bank deposits and the continuing tendency of depositors' preferences towards national currency. According to the preliminary data, the share of the foreign currency deposits has decreased to 53% by the end of January 2017. The signs of the economic recovery are getting more defined. Short-term economic indicator, which reflects the development of economy's main sectors, is in the recovery zone and has reached 103.8% in January 2017. In 2017 the real GDP growth is estimated to be above the level of 2%. In spite of the positive signals of the business activity recovery and the stability of the domestic money and FX markets, the possibility of the external and internal shocks occurrence, which have the potential risks for the further economic development and, primarily, for the inflation processes, still exists. Among those the following risks should be noted: external risks associated with high dependence on the quotations in the world commodity and financial markets, the speed of the economic recovery of the countries  trade partners; and also the revision of budget expenditures upwards. Next decisions on the base rate will depend on the further dynamics of the fundamental factors of the domestic demand and the stability of the financial sector. The next decision on the base rate will be announced on April 10, 2017 at 17:00 Astana time. For more detailed information please contact: +7 (727) 2704 585 e-mail: press@nationalbank.kz."
Brazil,2017-02-22,"The Copom released the following note to the public&#58. The Copom released the following note to the public:. ""205th Meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (=9CCopom=9D) of the Central Bank of Brazil Press Release*. The Copom unanimously decided to reduce the Selic rate to 12.25 percent per year, without bias. The following observations provide an update of the Copoms baseline scenario:. The set of indicators of economic activity released since the last Copom meeting shows some mixed signals, which are, however, consistent with stabilization of the economy in the short run. Available evidence suggests a gradual recovery of economic activity during the course of 2017. The global outlook remains quite uncertain. Nevertheless, stronger global economic activity and its positive impact on commodity prices have so far mitigated the effects on the Brazilian economy of revisions of economic policy in some large economies. Inflation developments remain favorable. The disinflation process is more widespread, and includes IPCA components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy. Food price disinflation resumed, which constitutes a favorable supply shock. Inflation expectations for 2017 collected by the Focus survey fell to around 4.4%. Expectations for 2018 and longer horizons remained around 4.5%; and. The Copom's inflation forecasts in the market scenario retreated to around 4.2% for 2017, and remained around 4.5% for 2018. This scenario assumes a path for the policy interest rate that ends 2017 and 2018 at 9.5% and 9%, respectively. The Committee emphasizes that its baseline scenario involves risks in both directions: the highly uncertain global outlook might make disinflation more difficult; the favorable food-price shock might produce second-round effects and, thus, contribute to additional reductions of inflation expectations and inflation in other economic sectors; and the recovery of economic activity might be more (or less) gradual and delayed than currently anticipated. The Committee highlights the importance of approval and implementation of the necessary reforms notably those of fiscal nature and of adjustments in the Brazilian economy for the sustainability of disinflation and for the reduction of its structural interest rate. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the current balance of risks, and a wide array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to reduce the Selic rate to 12.25 percent per year, without bias. The Committee judges that convergence of inflation to the 4.5% target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, which includes 2017 and, with a gradually increasing weight, 2018, is compatible with the ongoing monetary easing process. The Copom judges that the extension of the monetary easing cycle will depend on estimates of the structural interest rate of the Brazilian economy, which the Committee will continue to reassess over time. The Copom emphasizes that a possible acceleration of the pace of monetary easing will depend not only on the estimated extension of the cycle, but also on the evolution of economic activity, on the other risk factors, and on inflation forecasts and expectations. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Ilan Goldfajn (Governor). Anthero de Moraes Meirelles. Carlos Viana de Carvalho. Isaac Sidney Menezes Ferreira. Luiz Edson Feltrim. Otavio Ribeiro Damaso. Reinaldo Le Grazie. Sidnei Corr=AAa Marques, and Tiago Couto Berriel.""."
South Korea,2017-02-23,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period. (English translation prepared by the Bank of Korea staff) The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Board considers that the global economic recovery has continued to expand. The global financial markets have shown generally stable movements, as the trend of rising stock prices has continued and stock price volatility has diminished as well. Looking ahead the Board sees the global economic recovery as likely to be affected by factors such as the directions of the new US government's economic policies, the pace of monetary policy normalization by the US Federal Reserve, the movements toward spreading trade protectionism, and the political uncertainties in the euro area. The Board judges that the domestic economy has continued its trend of moderate growth, as exports have improved although the recovery in domestic demand activities has been weak due to a slump in consumption. Employment conditions have been sluggish, with the extent of decline in the number of persons employed having widened in the manufacturing sector and the trend of increase in persons employed in the service sector having slowed as well. The Board sees the domestic economy as likely to continue its trend of moderate growth going forward, and expects growth to be generally in accord with the path projected in January. Compared to the January forecasts the Board judges that consumption will likely fall somewhat below the level projected, due to a continuing deterioration in economic sentiment for example, but that exports and facilities investment will improve more than forecast thanks chiefly to the global economic recovery. Consumer price inflation has risen to the 2% target level, in line mainly with increases in the prices of petroleum and agricultural, livestock and fisheries products. Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has remained in the mid- to upper-1% range, while the rate of inflation expected by the general public has risen to the upper-2% level. Looking ahead the Board expects that consumer price inflation will for the time being fluctuate at a level close to 2%, but for the year as a whole not diverge greatly from the January projection (1.8%) as the prices of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products recover their trends of stability. Core inflation will maintain a level in the mid- to upper-1% range. In the domestic financial markets, the volatilities of both stock prices and long-term market interest rates have subsided as the stability in the global financial markets has continued. The Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has fallen to a large extent, owing mainly to a shift to US dollar weakening in line with the new US government's policies related to the exchange rate. The extent of growth in bank household lending has continued to lessen, but the substantial increase in household lending by non-banks has been sustained. Housing sales prices in both Seoul and its surrounding areas and the rest of the country have remained generally steady. Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As the inflationary pressures on the demand side are not expected to be high given the moderate pace of domestic economic growth, the Board will maintain its stance of monetary policy accommodation. In this process it will closely monitor the uncertainties in domestic and external conditions and their effects, the progress of monetary policy normalization by the US Federal Reserve, and the trend of increase in household debt."
Colombia,2017-02-24,"The Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica at today's meeting decided to reduce the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp to 7.25%. For this decision, the Board mainly took into account the following aspects. In January, annual consumer inflation decreased for sixth consecutive month, reaching 5.47%. The average of core inflation indicators remained stable at 5.61%. Analysts' inflation expectations to December 2017 increased, and continue above the range of 2.0% to 4.0%; those to two years and those embedded in public debt bonds to 2, 3, and 5 years remained stable, posting between 3.7% and 4.8%. The effects of the strong transitory supply shocks that diverted inflation from its target continue to fade. For example, the slowdown of the food CPI in January suggests this. External demand growth is expected to be higher in 2017 than in 2016. The long-term international interest rates remain at levels higher than those recorded in 2016 and the Colombia's terms of trade are still recovering. In this environment, the peso has appreciated vis--vis the US dollar. In Colombia, economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2016 was 1.6%, slightly better than in the third quarter; for the whole year it stood at 2.0%. The consumer confidence indicator for January 2017 recorded a sharp fall. Should this be reflected on household spending, the growth forecast for 2017 could be reduced (2.0% within a range between 0.7% and 2.7%). Considering the current level of core inflation indicators and inflation expectations, various calculations of the real policy interest rate are above its average since 2005. Based on this information, the Board considered the following factors in its decision. The weakness of economic activity and the risk of an excessive deceleration. Uncertainty about the speed of convergence of inflation to its target. The current level of the real policy interest rate is contractionary. In this environment, the Board considered that the path of policy interest rates compatible with an adequate balance of the aforementioned risks includes a 25 bp reduction. The new information on inflation, economic activity, and the international context will determine the pace of policy normalization. The decision to reduce the benchmark interest rate was approved by four members of the Board. The remaining two Board Members voted in favor of keeping the benchmark interest rate at 7.5%. Bogot."
Israel,2017-02-27,"Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index for January declined by 0.2 percent, in line with the average of forecasters' projections. There were seasonal declines this month in the clothing and footwear component (9.2 percent), in the housing component (0.5 percent), and in the fruit and vegetables component (0.1 percent). In contrast, there were increases in the food (0.5 percent) and dwelling maintenance (1.2 percent) components. The CPI was also affected this month by institutional changes: a decline of 6.2 percent in vehicle insurance rates, which reduced the CPI by 0.15 percent, and a 3.5 percent increase in electricity rates, which added 0.08 percent to the CPI. Prices of components representing tradable goods in the CPI declined by 1.4 percent over the past 12 months, while the prices of components representing nontradable items increased by 0.8 percent. The annual inflation rate continues to increase, although at a slow pace, with inflation in the past 12 months totaling 0.1 percent: the first positive figure since August 2014, supported mainly by the change in the trend of energy prices. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: One-year inflation expectations declined and medium-term and long-term expectations remained virtually unchanged. Inflation expectations derived from the capital market declined by 0.1 percentage points, to about 0.1 percent, and inflation expectations derived from the banks' internal interest rates declined slightly, to 0.3 percent. The average of private forecasters' projections remained 0.6 percent. Second-year forward expectations remained unchanged at 0.7 percent. Third-year forward expectations increased slightly, to 1.4 percent (compared with 1.3 percent prior to the previous monetary policy discussion), and 3-5 year forward expectations remained at 1.5 percent. Longer-term forward expectations (5-10 years) remained anchored slightly above the center of the target range, at 2.3 percent. Based on the makam curve, the Telbor curve and forecasters' assessments, there is a high probability that the Bank of Israel will increase the interest rate to 0.25 percent within about a year. Real economic activity: The improvement in real economic activity continued. The first estimate of National Accounts data for the fourth quarter (seasonally adjusted in annual terms) indicates that GDP increased by 6.2 percent and business sector product increased by 7.8 percent: higher rates than in the previous quarters of the year. The particularly high growth rate is derived from an atypical increase in consumption of vehicles that reflects purchases being brought forward in advance of the revision of the green taxation formula in January 2017. Net of this atypical figure, fourth quarter growth was only slightly higher than the basic growth rate of previous years. The composition of uses in the fourth quarter was different than in the previous one in that there was strong growth of exports alongside a slowdown in private and public consumption. Exports (excluding diamonds and startups) grew by 8.0 percent,due to recovery in manufacturing exports against the background of improved world trade in goods, alongside the continued trend of expansion in services exports. In contrast, private consumption excluding durable goods increased by just 0.9 percent. The Composite State of the Economy Index increased in January by 0.2 percent, supporting the assessment that the extraordinary growth rate will not continue in the first quarter of 2017. The Purchasing Managers Index, and the Consumer Confidence Indices compiled by the Central Bureau of Statistics and by Bank Hapoalim, declined slightly in January, but are at high levels. The Purchasing Managers Index has for the past few months been above 50 points, indicating expansion of economic activity. The labor market: The picture conveyed by the labor market remains very positive. The Labor Force Survey for January 2017 indicated that employed is entrenched at a high rate. There was a slight decline in the unemployment rate among the prime working ages (25-64) to 3.7 percent, compared with 3.8 percent, the employment rate remained unchanged at 77.1 percent, and there was a slight decline in the participation rate (80.0 percent compared with 80.1 percent). The job vacancy rate stabilized at a high level: 3.8 percent in January (seasonally adjusted). Nominal wages increased in September-November by 0.9 percent, and real wages increased by 1.1 percent, compared with the preceding three months (seasonally adjusted). The increase in the employment rate in 2016 was also reflected in the relatively rapid increase in business sector wages. Since the beginning of 2016, wagesper employee post increased by 2.7 percent in nominal terms, while wages in the public services sector increased by just 1.2 percent. The increase in nominal wages in the economy as a whole was 2.2 percent, similar to the pace in 2015. Budget data: The domestic surplus (excluding net credit) in government activity was NIS 4.7 billion in January 2017. The surplus was about NIS 0.6 billion lower than the seasonal path consistent with attaining the deficit target for 2017. Tax revenues in January were NIS 28.5 billion. NIS 0.5 billion higher than the seasonal path consistent with estimated tax revenue, and NIS 3.8 percent higher in real terms than in January of 2016 (net of extraordinary activities and legislative changes). The foreign exchange market: From the monetary policy discussion on January 22, 2017, through February 24, 2017, the shekel strengthened by 3.0 percent against the dollar, and strengthened by 2.1 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. Over the preceding 12 months, the shekel appreciated by 7.4 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. The capital and money markets: From the monetary policy discussion on January 22, 2017, through February 23, 2017, the Tel Aviv 35 Index increased by about 1.6 percent. In the government bond market there were declines of up to 8 basis points in yields along the unindexed curve and ofup to 23 basis points in the CPI-indexed curve. The makam curve traded at a yield slightly above the Bank of Israel interest rate. Israel's sovereign risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, declined slightly, to about 65 basis points. The money supply: In the 12 months ending in January, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 10.8 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 3.7 percent. The credit market: The business sector (excluding banks, insurance companies and foreign companies) issued bonds totaling NIS 5.5 billion in January: primarily in the real estate and construction industry (54 percent) and the trade and services industry (31 percent): an amount greater than the monthly average over 2016, of approximately NIS 3.7 billion. Corporate bond spreads (excluding banks and insurance companies) declined in January, to 2.7 percentage points, on average, (compared with 2.82 in December). In January, which is usually characterized by relatively low new mortgage volume, a total of NIS 4.4 billion in new mortgages was taken out: a decline of 7 percent compared withthe same month in the previous year. The average interest rate on mortgages declined slightly in January on most tracks, after a continued increase over the previous year and a half. On the CPI-indexed, variable-rate track, the interest rate declined by 0.02 percentage points, on the unindexed fixed-rate track,the interest rate declined by 0.05 percentage points, and on the unindexed variable-rate track, the interest rate declined by 0.03 percentage points. On the CPI-indexed, fixed-rate track, the rate increased by 0.04 percentage points. The housing market: According to the initial estimate of the Index of Home Prices, there was a sharp decline of 1.2 percent in prices in November: December. This is the first decline since August 2015 and the largest decline in about a decade. As a result, the annual rate of increase in home prices also slowed, with home prices increasing by 5.9 percent in the 12 months ending in December. The housing component of the CPI (based on residential rents) declined by 0.5 percent in January, following a 0.1 percent decline in December, and the annual rate of increase is now 1.5 percent, compared with 2.5 percent in January of the previous year. The volume of activity in the housing market, as reflected in the number of total new home transactions, continued to moderate. In the second half of 2016, there were just 7,300 transactions per month on average, compared with an average of 8,300 in the first half of the year, while the proportion of transactions carried out by investors remained low, at about 20 percent. The moderation in the total number of transactions is also occurring among those upgrading their homes, who are not subject to considerations of tax changes or waiting for the Buyer's Price program. The global economy: The major advanced economies continue to grow at a moderate pace, with continued improvement in emerging economies. Political uncertainty is increasing, but the positive momentum in the financial markets continues. In the US, it appears that the labor market is nearing full employment. In January, a further 225,000 jobs were added, and the unemployment rate stabilized at a low level of 4.8 percent. With that, the annual growth rateof average salary declined to 2.5 percent (compared with 2.8 percent in the previous month), and it seems that there may still be room for improvement in the labor market as the participation rate is likely to continue to increase and there is a relatively high rate of under-employment. Private consumption continues to drive the economy, but the recovery in industrial production also continues, and the real estate market continues to improve. The inflation rate increased sharply in January, to 2.5 percent, and the core indices are close to the Fed's target. The federal funds target rate was left unchanged, but statements by senior Fed officials were accompanied by hawkish messages. The interest rate path expected by the markets increased slightly, and as of now, it indicates that two interest rate increases are expected in 2017. In Europe as well, positive momentum is apparent, mainly in Germany and Spain, but significant political risks remain. Unemployment in the eurozone continued to decline in December, to 9.6 percent, the lowest rate in the past 7 years. Inflation increased sharply: to 1.8 percent: affected by the increase in oil prices, but core inflation remains low at 0.9 percent. Political uncertainty remains high in view of the elections expected in a number of countries this year, and due to increasing tension concerning an approximately 7 billion euro debt repayment by Greecedue in July. The UK economy grew by 2 percent in 2016, and unemployment continued to decline, but according to assessments, economic growth will slow in the coming years against the background of the Brexit. In contrast, there is concern of an increase in inflation, and the Bank of England therefore stated that the next change in policy could be either contractionary or accommodative. In Japan, the economy grew by 1 percent in 2016: a low figure by international comparison, but higher than assessments of potential growth, and there are still no signs of a recovery of inflation. In China, the economy grew by 6.7 percent in the fourth quarter, with purchasing managers indices indicating continued expansion of economic activity, inter alia against the background of the continued growth of credit. In the other emerging markets, the trend of growth continues (mainly in Brazil and Russia), supported by the stabilization of commodity prices and increased demand in China, but the increasing interest rate path and expected trade policy in the US expose these markets to risks. The price of a barrel of Brent crude ranged around $56 this month. The index of commodities excluding energy continued to increase this month, by about 2 percent. The main considerations behind the decision. The decision to keep the interest rate unchanged at 0.1 percent is consistent with the Bankof Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to return the inflation rate to within the price stability target range of 1-3 percent a year, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The Monetary Committee continues to assess that in view of the inflation environment, and of developments in the global economy, in the exchange rate, as well as in monetary policies of major central banks, monetary policy will remain accommodative for a considerable time. Following are the main considerations underlying the decision:. C 2B 7 The CPI for January declined by 0.2 percent, in line with expectations. The trend of moderate increase in annual inflation continues, impacted primarily by a change in the trend of energy prices and by the dissipating of the direct effect of administrative price reductions, and the year over year inflation rate is 0.1 percent. Short-term inflation expectations are below the target, but forward expectations for medium terms, from the third year onward, are within the target range, and longer term expectations are anchored near the midpoint of the target range. C 2B 7 Real economic activity continues to improve. According to the initial estimate. GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2016 was particularly high, impacted by an atypical increase in vehicle imports. Net of this increase, it may be assessed that the growth rate was slightly above 3 percent, with a change in the composition of uses: the growth rate of private current consumption moderated markedly, while there was strong growth of exports. The picture conveyed by the labor market remains very positive. C 2B 7 In the global economy, moderate growth continues in major advanced economies, with a continued trend of improvement in emerging markets. Positive momentum continues in financial markets, although the uncertainty regarding political developments continues to be a source of risk to continued growth. Inflation in most markets is approaching its target, but in Europe and Japan very accommodative monetary policy continues. Market assessments are that the federal funds rate will be increased twice in 2017. C 2B 7 From the monetary policy discussion on January 22, 2017, through February 24, 2017, the shekel strengthened by 3.0 percent against the dollar, and it appreciated by 2.1 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. The shekel has appreciated by 7.4 percent over the past 12 months in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. The level of the effective exchange rate continues to weigh on the development of goods exports. C 2B 7 There was a sharp decline in home prices in the most recent data, in parallel with a decline in the number of transactions. These figures are consistent with the decline in monthly mortgage volume, the increase in mortgage interest rates, and efforts to increase supply. However, it is too early to assess, based on a single figure, if the trend in home prices is changing. The Monetary Committee is of the opinion that the risks to achieving the inflation target remain high, yet the increases in wages and in global inflation are expected to support the return of inflation to the target. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets. The Bank will use the tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and supportfor the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will continue to keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on March 13, 2017. The next decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Thursday. April 6, 2017, and a press briefing with the Governor will follow that announcement."
Malaysia,2017-03-02,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.00 percent. Economic activity in the advanced and emerging economies has continued to improve. Global trade is also showing a recovery. In this environment, the Asian economies are benefiting from stronger external demand amid sustained domestic activity. For 2017, the global economy is projected to expand at a slightly faster pace. Nevertheless, there remain risks to global growth arising from threats such as protectionism, geopolitical developments, heightened volatility of financial markets and negative developments in the prices of key commodities. Despite the challenging global and domestic environment, the Malaysian economy expanded by 4.2% in 2016. Growth was underpinned by private sector activity, with additional support from the turnaround in net exports. The growth momentum is expected to be sustained in 2017. With the growth of domestic demand being sustained, the more positive contribution from the external sector will lead to a better performance of the Malaysian economy. Headline inflation is projected to be higher in 2017, reflecting primarily the pass-through impact of the increase in global oil prices on domestic retail fuel prices. Headline inflation would remain relatively high in the first half of the year before moderating thereafter. However, the projected trajectory of domestic headline inflation will be dependent on the future trend in global oil prices which remains highly uncertain. The cost-driven inflation is not expected to have a significant impact on the broader price trends given the stable domestic demand conditions. Core inflation is expected to increase modestly. The ringgit, along with other emerging market currencies, has continued to stabilise. The implementation of financial market development measures has had a positive impact on the domestic financial markets. Banking system liquidity remains sufficient. Financial institutions continue to operate with strong capital and liquidity buffers and the growth of financing to the private sector is consistent with the pace of economic activity. At the current level of the OPR, the stance of monetary policy is accommodative and supportive of economic activity. The MPC will continue to assess the balance of risks surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation. Bank Negara Malaysia 02 March 2017."
Ukraine,2017-03-02,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to maintain its key policy rate at 14% per annum. This decision was prompted by the need to mitigate risks for the achievement of inflation targets in 2017-2018. In January 2017, inflation accelerated to 12.6% yoy, which was in line with the NBU forecast published in the Inflation Report (January 2017). The slight acceleration of annual inflation was driven by higher production costs, in particular labor costs, rising global commodity prices, including oil and food prices, and the weakening of the hryvnia in late 2016 and early January 2017. It is expected that inflation will accelerate further in annual terms in February 2017, primarily due to base effects. Higher global prices for key Ukrainian export commodities along with a gradual rise in FX proceeds from exports helped stabilize the situation in the FX market in the second half of February. Furthermore, in contrast to January, when the NBU mostly sold foreign currency to smooth excessive exchange rate fluctuations, in February the situation reversed. As a result, the NBU has remained a net buyer of foreign currency since the beginning of the year. Ukraine's economy keeps recovering, driven inter alia by favorable external environment and high investment demand. This was evidenced by a further rise of the Index of Key Sectors Output (IKSO). In its turn, a pick-up in economic activity continued to spur labor demand. In January, real wages rose by 21.4% yoy, underpinned by strong labor demand and an increase in the minimum wage. As expected, the growth of real wages could renew demand-pull pressures on prices. The NBU considers that the inflation targets for 2017 and 2018 (8%+/-2 ppts and 6%+/-2 ppts, respectively) remain within reach. Annual inflation is projected to remain high in the first three quarters due to statistical base effect. It will return to single-digit level only in Q4 2017. The projected demand-pull pressure on prices will be contained by the NBU's prudent monetary policy. However, the risks to further inflation developments have increased since the previous monetary policy meeting, prompting the NBU to continue a pause in its monetary policy easing cycle. First of all, the major risks include intensification in hostilities and a transport blockade in the east of Ukraine. If lasted for a prolonged period, these developments will lead to the ultimate disruption of production and supply chains and, thus, to a reduction in steel and coke output, as well as mining and electricity production. Implicitly, this poses risks to the inflation forecast through a negative impact on the balance of payment. A possible contraction in metallurgical exports and higher coal imports could adversely affect the current account balance. Consequently, this will have negative implications for the interbank FX market. Moreover, as a side effect of these developments, inflation expectations may worsen. Given the aforementioned risks and the need to achieve the inflation targets, the NBU Board decided to retain its policy rate unchanged at 14%. Further key policy rate path will depend on the materialization of the aforementioned risks to price stability and the development of inflation expectations. The decision to keep the key policy rate at 14% is approved by NBU Board Decision No. 110D On the Key Policy Rate as of 2 March 2017. The next NBU Board meeting on monetary policy issues will be held on 13 April 2017 as scheduled."
Georgia,2017-03-07,"07.03.2017 NBG Keeps Its Policy Rate Unchanged at 6.75% The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on March 7, 2017 and decided to keep the refinancing rate unchanged at 6.75 percent. According to the current forecast, in line with what has been stated before, the CPI inflation in 2017 is expected to temporarily increase due to one-time factors and remain above the target value. This year the consumer prices will mainly be affected by supply side factors, such as the increase in certain commodity prices on world markets, the increase in the excise tax, and the appreciation of USD in the previous period. At the same time both core and domestic goods and services inflation remain at low levels. Once the effect of one-time factors affecting CPI inflation is exhausted, it will decrease and is expected to go below its target in 2018. According to the recent information there are factors affecting the inflation forecast in both directions. On one hand the actual inflation is higher than the forecast, which could exert additional pressure on inflation expectations. On another hand due to the improvement in the external sector indicators the pressure on the GEL exchange rate has decreased, potentially reducing inflation expectations. Despite the fact that the National Bank of Georgia still considers appropriate to increase the policy rate to 7% in the first half of the year, at this stage, until the trends become more certain, the Monetary Policy Committee decided to abstain from the change in the policy rate. According to preliminary estimates the economic growth in January was high, however the output gap remains negative. Thus the domestic demand is still weak. At the same time its growth is supported by the present rates of credit growth. The trends in the external sector are positive as well. Due to the increase in external demand in the beginning of 2017 the goods export is growing, and so is the income from tourism. Also, compared to the previous year, the remittances have significantly increased, although this indicator is still below its 2014 level. The growth in imports is notable as well. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all means and instruments at its disposal in order to ensure the price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on May 2, 2017."
Poland,2017-03-08,"Warsaw, 8 March 2017 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 7-8 March 2017 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: ï‚§ reference rate at 1.50%; ï‚§ lombard rate at 2.50%; ï‚§ deposit rate at 0.50%; ï‚§ rediscount rate at 1.75%. Global economic growth remains moderate, with signs of economic recovery strengthening in many economies. In the euro area, economic growth is stable, accompanied by favourable sentiment in industry. In the United States, economic conditions are supported by improving labour market, reflected both in rising employment and wages. In China. GDP growth picked up slightly in 2016 Q4, while Russia has probably recovered from recession. Over past few months, inflation has risen considerably in many countries, mainly on the back of an increase in global commodity prices, which has recently come to a halt. At the same time, low demand pressure in many economies, including in the euro area, contains the rise in inflation and keeps core inflation at a moderate level. The European Central Bank keeps interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero. The ECB also continues its asset purchase programme. The Federal Reserve indicates a further rise in interest rates this year. In Poland, economic growth in 2016 Q4 was slightly higher than a quarter earlier. Economic growth was mainly driven by increasing consumer demand, supported by a rise in employment and wages, very good consumer sentiment and child benefit payments. At the same time, the fall in investment narrowed due to higher absorption of EU funds. Recent economic data, including industrial output, retail sales and labour market point to ongoing recovery. The annual growth in prices of consumer goods and services in Poland has picked up considerably over recent months, mainly due to higher global commodity prices, i.e. factors beyond the direct impact of domestic monetary policy. Core inflation remains close to zero, which points to still low demand pressure. Despite growing employment and wages, growth in unit labour costs remains moderate. In the Council's opinion, following a considerable rise in the first months of the year, inflation will stabilise at a moderate level. The stabilisation of price growth in the coming quarters will result on the one hand from fading effects of the past increase in global commodity prices and on the other hand from only a gradual increase in domestic inflationary pressure stemming from improving domestic economic conditions. In 1/2 consequence, the risk of inflation running persistently above the target in the medium term is limited. Such an assessment is supported by the results of the March projection of inflation and GDP prepared by the Economic Institute under the assumption of unchanged NBP interest rates. In line with the March projection based on the NECMOD model  taking into account data available until 20 February 2017  there is a 50-percent probability that the annual price growth will be in the range of 1.6  2.5 % in 2017 (against 0.5  2.0% in the November projection), 0.9  2.9% in 2018 (as compared to 0.3  2.6%) and 1.2  3.5% in 2019. The annual GDP growth  according to this projection  will be with a 50- percent probability in the range of 3.4  4.0% in 2017 (against 2.6  4.5 % in the November projection), 2.4  4.5% in 2018 (as compared to 2.2  4.4%) and 2.3  4.4% in 2019. The Council confirms its assessment that  given the available data and forecasts  the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on the sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic balance. The Council adopted Inflation Report  March 2017."
Euroarea,2017-03-09,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We continue to expect them to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases. Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, we confirm that we will continue to make purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) at the current monthly pace of â‚¬80 billion until the end of this month and that, from April 2017, our net asset purchases are intended to continue at a monthly pace of â‚¬60 billion until the end of December 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. The net purchases will be made alongside reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP. Our monetary policy measures have continued to preserve the very favourable financing conditions that are necessary to secure a sustained convergence of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Their ongoing pass-through to the borrowing conditions for firms and households benefits credit creation and supports the steadily firming recovery of the euro area economy. Sentiment indicators suggest that the cyclical recovery may be gaining momentum. Headline inflation has again increased, largely on account of rising energy and food price inflation. However, underlying inflation pressures continue to remain subdued. The Governing Council will continue to look through changes in HICP inflation if judged to be transient and to have no implication for the medium-term outlook for price stability. A very substantial degree of monetary accommodation is still needed for underlying inflation pressures to build up and support headline inflation in the medium term. If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, we stand ready to increase our asset purchase programme in terms of size and/or duration. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro area real GDP increased by 0.4%, quarter on quarter, in the fourth quarter of 2016, following a similar pace of growth in the third quarter. Incoming data, notably survey results, increase our confidence that the ongoing economic expansion will continue to firm and broaden. The pass-through of our monetary policy measures is supporting domestic demand and facilitates the ongoing deleveraging process. The recovery in investment continues to be promoted by very favourable financing conditions and improvements in corporate profitability. Moreover, rising employment, which is also benefiting from past structural reforms, is having a positive impact on households' real disposable income, thereby providing support for private consumption. Also, there are signs of a somewhat stronger global recovery and increasing global trade. However, economic growth in the euro area is expected to be dampened by a sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms and remaining balance sheet adjustment needs in a number of sectors. This assessment is broadly reflected in the March 2017 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real GDP increasing by 1.8% in 2017, by 1.7% in 2018 and by 1.6% in 2019. Compared with the December 2016 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real GDP growth has been revised upwards slightly in 2017 and 2018. The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook have become less pronounced, but remain tilted to the downside and relate predominantly to global factors. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation increased further to 2.0% in February, up from 1.8% in January 2017 and 1.1% in December 2016. This reflected mainly a strong increase in annual energy and unprocessed food price inflation, with no signs yet of a convincing upward trend in underlying inflation. Headline inflation is likely to remain at levels close to 2% in the coming months, largely reflecting movements in the annual rate of change of energy prices. Measures of underlying inflation, however, have remained low and are expected to rise only gradually over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the expected continuing economic recovery and the corresponding gradual absorption of slack. This pattern is also reflected in the March 2017 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation at 1.7% in 2017, 1.6% in 2018 and 1.7% in 2019. By comparison with the December 2016 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for headline HICP inflation has been revised upwards significantly for 2017 and slightly for 2018, while remaining unchanged for 2019. The staff projections are conditional on the full implementation of all our monetary policy measures. Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) continues to expand at a robust pace, with an annual rate of growth of 4.9% in January 2017, after 5.0% in December 2016. As in previous months, annual growth in M3 was mainly supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate M1 expanding at an annual rate of 8.4% in January 2017, after 8.8% in December 2016. Loan dynamics followed the path of gradual recovery observed since the beginning of 2014. The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations was 2.3% in January 2017, as in the previous month. The annual growth rate of loans to households was 2.2% in January 2017, after 2.0% in December 2016. Although developments in bank credit continue to reflect the lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets, the monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014 are significantly supporting borrowing conditions for firms and households and thereby credit flows across the euro area. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed the need for a continued very substantial degree of monetary accommodation to secure a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% without undue delay. In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute much more decisively to strengthening economic growth. The implementation of structural reforms needs to be substantially stepped up to increase resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost potential output growth. Against the background of overall limited implementation of country-specific recommendations in 2016, greater reform effort is necessary in all euro area countries in 2017. Regarding fiscal policies, all countries should intensify efforts towards achieving a more growth-friendly composition of public finances. A full and consistent implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact and of the macroeconomic imbalances procedure over time and across countries remains crucial to ensure confidence in the EU's governance framework."
Peru,2017-03-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR MARCH 2017 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 4.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 4.25 percent. This decision is consistent with an inflation forecast in which inflation converges to the target range during 2017 and takes into account the following factors: Expectations of inflation in 12 months remain within the target range and continue showing a declining path; Climate alterations have been affecting the price of some foodstuffs, but this is expected to have a temporary impact; The pace of growth of domestic economic activity has slowed down in a context of lower public expenditure. However, economic activity is expected to grow at a rate close to its potential growth level in the following quarters as a result of increased investment and better terms of trade, and The global economy shows signals of recovery, but there is uncertainty about developed countries' policies. The Board oversees new data on inflation and inflation determinants to assess the convenience of making additional adjustments in the monetary policy rate. Inflation in February recorded a rate of 0.32 percent due to rises in the prices of some food products as a result of climate factors, which has led the year-to-year rate of inflation to increase from 3.10 percent in January to 3.25 percent in February. Inflation without food and energy showed a rate of 0.14 percent, as a result of which the year-to-year rate decreased from 2.98 percent in January to 2.56 percent in February, within the target range. The indicators of business expectations have declined in February, but remain within the optimistic side. In line with this. GDP is expected to grow between 3.5 and 3.8 percent in 2017. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 3.0 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 4.80 percent for the first 15 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 15 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.80 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for April on its meeting of April 6, 2017."
United States,2017-03-15,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in February indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace. Job gains remained solid and the unemployment rate was little changed in recent months. Household spending has continued to rise moderately while business fixed investment appears to have firmed somewhat. Inflation has increased in recent quarters, moving close to the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective; excluding energy and food prices, inflation was little changed and continued to run somewhat below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further, and inflation will stabilize around 2 percent over the medium term. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced. The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 3/4 to 1 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Janet L Yellen. Chair; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Lael Brainard; Charles L Evans; Stanley Fischer; Patrick Harker; Robert S Kaplan; Jerome H Powell; and Daniel K Tarullo. Voting against the action was Neel Kashkari, who preferred at this meeting to maintain the existing target range for the federal funds rate. Implementation Note issued March 15, 2017."
Chile,2017-03-16,"Santiago. Chile. Thursday, 16 March 2017 Monetary Policy Meeting  March 2017 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to lower the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points, to 3%. Internationally, global financial conditions have remained favorable. In the developed world, indicators continue to point to a scenario of stronger growth and higher inflation. In this context, expectations of a monetary policy normalization have strenghtened, especially in the US. Commodity prices decreased, most notably oil. Overall, important risks persist. On the domestic front, annual inflation was 2.7%, in line with forecasts in December's Monetary Policy Report.Inflation expectations at the end of the projection horizon are near the target, although for the coming months they are in the lower part of the tolerance range. Activity and demand indicators remain weak. In the labor market, salaried employment deteriorated further, although the unemployment rate remained stable. The Board estimates that, if the recent trends of the economic scenario persist, and so do their implications on the medium-term inflation outlook, it could be necessary to increase the monetary impulse. At the same time, it reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. The Spanish original prevails."
Turkiye,2017-03-16,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term interest rates at the following levels:. a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate has been kept at 9.25 percent and borrowing rate has been kept at 7.25 percent. b) One-week repo rate has been kept at 8 percent,. c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent, and lending rate has been increased from 11 percent to 11.75 percent. Recently released data indicate a gradual recovery in the economic activity. Demand from the European Union economies continues to contribute positively to exports, while domestic demand displays a weaker course. With the supportive measures and incentives provided recently, the recovery in the economic activity is expected to continue at a moderate pace. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly. Cost push pressures and the volatility in food prices in recent months have led to a sharp increase in inflation. The significant rise in inflation is expected to continue in the short term due to lagged pass-through and the base effect in food prices. Accordingly, the Committee decided to strengthen the monetary tightening in order to contain the deterioration in the inflation outlook. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. Tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained until inflation outlook displays a significant improvement. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Nigeria,2017-03-21,"CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO 112 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING OF 20TH AND 21ST MARCH 2017 10. Background The Monetary Policy Committee met on the 20th and 21st of March, 2017, against the backdrop of persistent uncertainty in the global economy, stemming from economic and socio-political developments around the world. On the domestic front, while the Q4 2016 GDP figure was better than the last two consecutive quarters, the economy remained in recession with inflationary pressures continuing unabated. These adverse external and domestic conditions continued to complicate the policy environment. In attendance at the meeting were 10 members of the Committee. The Committee assessed the global and domestic economic and financial environments in Q1 2017 as well as the outlook for the medium-term. External Developments The global economy witnessed greater momentum in Q4 2016, facilitated by gains in both developed, emerging markets and developing economies which propelled global GDP growth to 27 per cent year-on-year in Q4, 2016, a 02 percentage point improvement over Q3 2016. In spite of this improvement, the external environment continued to be plagued by political, economic and financial market uncertainties, with the defining issues being: Brexit, growing protectionist and anti-globalization sentiments, divergent monetary policies of the advanced economies' central banks and volatile commodity price movements. The protectionist stance of the new US. administration could impact negatively on global trade and economic recovery. The MPC noted the slip in oil prices against the backdrop of fears of a supply glut, fuelled by increased activities in US Shale oil production, which threatens to undermine the rebalancing effects of the last OPEC decision to cut output. The Committee also noted the increase in the target range of the US Fed funds rate at the last meeting of the FOMC and the potential spillover effects on global capital flows and interest rates, especially given the still tepid global economic activity and weak demand. Challenges in the emerging markets and developing economies persist, as they struggle with strong headwinds from low commodity prices, rising inflation, currency volatility, receding real income and capital reversals. Overall the Committee noted the dampening effects of economic stagnation and uncertainty on global trade and 3 investment. In spite of these constraints, however, the IMF estimates that the global economy would witness a slight improvement in growth from 31 per cent in 2016 to 34 per cent in 2017. Global inflation continued its moderate but steady rise against the backdrop of improved oil prices and depreciated currencies in several emerging markets. Amongst the major advanced economies, the US Fed maintained its tightening stance, with a further upward adjustment1 in March 2017. Meanwhile the Bank of Japan (BOJ). Bank of England and the European Central Bank, maintained the soft policy stance at their most recent meetings. The Federal Reserve again raised its benchmark Federal Fund rate by 25 basis points in March 2017, to a range of 075 to 100 per cent, having raised rates by the same margin in December, 2016, and also provided indication of further rate hikes in 2017 4 Domestic Output Developments Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in February 2017 showed that the economy contracted marginally by 130 per cent in Q4 2016, effectively remaining in recession since Q2 2016. Overall in 2016, the economy contracted by 151 per cent, with the contraction in Q4 being the least since Q2 2016. The non-oil sector grew by 033 per cent in Q4, largely reflecting the slowdown in the agricultural sector, which decelerated to 4. 03 per cent in Q4 2016 from the 454 per cent recorded in Q3 2016. The Committee remains of the conviction that fiscal policy remained the most potent panacea to most of the key negative undercurrents ie. stunted economic activity, heightened unemployment and high inflation. In spite of the recent moderate recovery in oil prices, the Committee approached developments in commodity 5 prices cautiously. It noted that the era of high oil prices was over, thus making diversification away from oil more imperative today than ever. Developments in Money and Prices The committee noted that money supply (M2) contracted by 573 per cent in February 2017, annualized at -3438 per cent in contrast to the provisional growth benchmark of 1029 per cent for 2017. Similarly Net Domestic Credit (NDC) contracted by 141 per cent in February, 2017, annualized to 846 per cent, being significantly below the 1793 per cent provisional growth benchmark for 2017. Likewise net credit to government contracted at an annualized rate of 4974 per cent, representing 8286 per cent below its programmed target of 3312 per cent. In effect, all the major monetary aggregates contracted by end-February 6 and underperformed their programmed provisional benchmarks for fiscal 2017. Headline inflation (year-on-year), however, declined for the first time in 15 months, dropping by 094 percentage point to 1778 per cent in February, from the 1872 per cent recorded in January 2017, and 1855 per cent in December, 2016 seemingly reversing the monthly upward momentum recorded since January, 2016. The moderation in headline inflation in February, 2017 reflected base effect as well as decline in the core component, which fell by 190 percentage points from 1790 per cent in January to 160 per cent in February, 2017. The food index, however, rose to 1853 per cent in February, a 071 percentage point increase over the 1787 per cent recorded in January, 2017. The Committee, similarly, observed a continuous upward trend in the month-on-month inflation rate in February, 7 having slightly moderated between December 2016 and January, 2017. It noted the sustenance of the structural factors mounting pressures on consumer prices, such as the high cost of power and energy, transport and production factors, as well as rising prices of imports. Nonetheless the Committee remains optimistic that the adopted policy stance and other ancillary measures directed at improving the agricultural and other relevant sectors of the economy would combine to restart growth and drive down prices in the short to medium-term. Money market interest rates moved in tandem with the level of liquidity in the banking system. Rates were relatively stable during the review period, the interbank call rates opened at 625 per cent on January 25, 2017 and closed at 1314 per cent on February 28, 2017. However the average inter-bank call rate rose to 10000 and 13384 per cent on 8 January 21 and January 23, 2017, respectively, following the withdrawal of liquidity from the banking system through the sale of foreign exchange worth N13700 billion on February 21, 2017. The Committee noted the decline in the equities segment of the capital market as the All-Share Index (ASI) fell by 307 per cent from 26,,03624 on January 31, 2017, to 25,,23801 on March 10, 2017. Similarly Market Capitalization (MC) decreased by 268 per cent from N897 to N873 trillion during the same period. Relative to end-December 2016, the capital market indices, fell by 312 and 303 per cent, respectively, reflecting the challenges still confronting the economy. Total foreign exchange inflows through the CBN decreased by 887 per cent in February, 2017 compared with the 9 previous month, as foreign exchange market receipts were significantly lower. Total outflows, also declined by 732 per cent during the same period. The Committee noted that the average naira exchange rate remained stable at the inter- bank segment of the foreign exchange market in the review period. Overall Outlook and Risks Available data and forecasts of key economic variables as well as the newly released Federal Government's Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP), indicate prospects of output recovery in 2017. The Committee expects that the implementation of this plan, the new foreign exchange policy as well as the current effort by the Federal Government to restore peace in the Niger Delta region would help revive economic growth and stabilize prices. 10 The Committee identified the downside risks to this outlook to include the possibility of a slower-than-expected rate of global economic activity, tight monetary policy stance by the US. Fed resulting in strengthening US dollar, and low oil prices. The Considerations of the Committee The Committee re-evaluated the implications for Nigeria of the continuing global uncertainties as reflected in the unfolding protectionist posture of the United States and some European countries; sustenance of the OPEC-Russian agreement to cut oil production beyond July 2017; sluggish global recovery and the strengthening US. dollar. The Committee also evaluated other challenges confronting the domestic economy and the opportunities for achieving price stability, conducive to growth in 2017. In 11 particular, the Committee noted the persisting inflationary pressures; continuing output contraction; high unemployment rate; elevated demand pressure in the foreign exchange market; low credit to the real sector and weakening financial system indicators, amongst others. Nonetheless members welcomed the improved implementation of the foreign exchange policy that resulted in naira's recent appreciation. Similarly the Committee expressed satisfaction on the release of the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan, and urged its speedy implementation with clear timelines and deliverables. On the strength of these developments, the Committee felt inclined to maintain a hold on all policy parameters. Nevertheless the Committee noted the arguments for tightening policy which remained strong and persuasive. These include: the real policy rate which remains negative, 12 upper reference band for inflation remains substantially breached and elevated demand pressure in the foreign exchange market. The reality of sustained pressures on prices (consumer prices and the naira exchange rate) cannot be ignored, given the Bank's primary mandate of price stability. It noted that the moderation in inflation in February was due to base effect as other parameters, particularly; month-on-month CPI continued to rise. However tightening at this time would portray the Bank as being insensitive to growth. Also the deposit money banks may easily reprice their assets which would undermine financial stability. Besides the Committee noted the need to create binding restrictions on growth in narrow money and structural liquidity and the imperative of macroeconomic stability to achieving price stability conducive to growth. 13 The Committee also considered the arguments for loosening the stance of monetary policy, noting its desirability in stimulating aggregate demand if credit increased with lower rates of interest. It noted the arguments that loose monetary policy was capable of delivering cheaper credit, making it more attractive for Nigerians to acquire assets, thus increasing wealth and stimulating aggregate spending and confidence by economic agents, which would eventually lead to lower Non-performing loans in the system. However the counterfactual arguments against loosening was anchored on the upward trending month-on-month inflation and its impact on the exchange rate. Loosening would thus worsen the already negative real interest rate, widen the interest rate spread and reverse the positive outlook for the current account position. 14 On outlook for financial stability, the Committee noted that the banking sector was becoming less resilient as a result of the adverse macroeconomic environment. Nevertheless the MPC reiterated its resolve to continue to pursue financial system stability. To this end, the Committee enjoined the Management of the Bank to work with DMBs to promptly address rising NPLs, declining asset quality, credit concentration and high foreign exchange exposures. The Committee also noted the benefits of loosening at this time which will be in line with the needs of fiscal policy to restart growth. The MPC, however, noted that loosening would exacerbate inflationary pressures, worsen the exchange rate and further pull the real interest rate into negative territory. Since interest rates are sticky downwards, 15 loosening may not necessarily transmit into lower retail lending rates. The Committee noted the consecutive positive contribution of agriculture to GDP in Q4 2016, a development partly traceable to the Bank's interventions in the sector. The Committee remains optimistic that, if properly implemented, the newly released Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP) coupled with innovative, growth-stimulating sectoral policies would help fast track economic recovery. The Committee's Decisions The Committee, in consideration of the headwinds in the domestic economy and the uncertainties in the global environment, decided by 9 out of 10 members to retain the MPR at 140 per cent alongside all other policy parameters. One member voted to raise the MPR. In summary, the MPC decided to: Retain the MPR at 14 per cent; Retain the CRR at 225 per cent; 16 Retain the Liquidity Ratio at 3000 per cent; and Retain the Asymmetric corridor at +200 and -500 basis points around the MPR Thank you for listening. Godwin I Emefiele Governor. Central Bank of Nigeria 21st March, 2017 17."
Philippines,2017-03-22,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) facility at 3.0 percent. The corresponding interest rates on the overnight lending and deposit facilities were also kept steady. The reserve requirement ratios were likewise left unchanged. The Monetary Board's decision is based on its assessment that the outlook for inflation remains manageable, consistent with favorable growth prospects. While the average headline inflation for the first two months of 2017 has risen due to the recent increases in food and oil prices as well as base effects, latest baseline forecasts are slightly lower than previous forecasts and within the target range of 3.0 percent Â± 1 percentage point for 2017-2018. Inflation expectations also remain anchored to the inflation target over the policy horizon. The Monetary Board also observed that the balance of risks surrounding the inflation outlook remains tilted toward the upside, given the transitory impact of the proposed tax reform program as well as possible adjustments in transportation fares and electricity rates. Meanwhile, lingering uncertainty over the prospects of the global economy, due in part to possible shifts in macroeconomic policies in advanced economies, continues to pose a key downside risk to the inflation outlook. The Monetary Board also noted the beneficial effects on inflation of the removal of quantitative restrictions on rice importation. The Board emphasized that domestic economic activity is projected to stay firm, supported by buoyant household consumption and private investment, increased government spending, and ample credit and liquidity. With these considerations, the Monetary Board believes that prevailing monetary policy settings remain appropriate. Looking ahead, the BSP will continue to monitor evolving economic conditions to ensure price and financial stability conducive to sustainable economic growth."
Colombia,2017-03-24,"The Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica, at today's meeting, decided to reduce the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp to 7.0%. For this decision, the Board mainly took into account the following aspects. In February, consumer annual inflation decreased for the seventh month in a row, reaching 5.18%. The average of core inflation indicators remained stable at 5.58%. Analysts' inflation expectations to December 2017 and 2018 decreased, posting at 4.49% and 3.6%, respectively. Those embedded in public debt bonds also lowered, and are close to 3.0% for the end of 2018. The effects of the strong transitory supply shocks that diverted inflation from its target continue to fade. This is suggested by the slowdown of the CPI in February, for example. Annual CPI variation excluding food and regulated items increased, possibly due to the effect of the increase in indirect taxes. Also, by the indexation mechanisms that deepened in recent years simultaneously with the increase in inflation. In Colombia, recent indicators of economic activity such as retail, industrial production, and consumer confidence suggest weakening of the economy in the first quarter of the year. Should this trend be accentuated, the technical staff=C2=B4s growth forecast for 2017 could be reduced (2.0% within a range between 0.7% and 2.7%). Considering the current levels of core inflation indicators and inflation expectations, various calculations of the real policy interest rate are above their average since 2005. Based on this information, the Board considered the following factors for its decision. Higher international uncertainty, weakness of the economic activity, and the risk of an excessive deceleration. Recent indicators point at a greater risk of increases in the excess capacity of the economy, although uncertainty on its size is pronounced. The uncertainty regarding the pace of convergence of inflation to its 3.0% target. The reduction in inflation was higher than expected by the Bank's technical staff and by the market average. However, indexation mechanisms and the increase in the persistence of inflation may slow its convergence to 3.0%. The current level of the real policy interest rate is contractionary. In this environment, the Board considered that a 25 bp reduction is consistent with the risks balance, and also with the objective of reaching the inflation target of 3.0% in 2018. Additional reductions will consider the risk balance between a slow convergence of inflation to its 3.0% target and an excessive slowdown of economic activity. The decision to reduce the benchmark interest rate was approved by four members of the Board. One Board Member voted to keep the benchmark interest rate stable, while another one voted in favor of reducing it by 50 basis points."
Russia,2017-03-24,"On 24 March 2017, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to reduce the key rate from 10.00 to 9.75% p.a. The Board of Directors notes that inflation slowdown overshoots the forecast, inflation expectations continue to decline and economic activity recovers. Inflation risks have slightly dropped but remain elevated. In these circumstances, given the moderately tight monetary policy, the 4% inflation target will be achieved by the end of 2017 and will be maintained at this level further. While assessing evolving inflation dynamics and economic developments against the forecast, the Bank of Russia admits the possibility of cutting the key rate gradually in coming Q2-Q3. In making its key rate decision, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors has proceeded from the following factors. Inflation dynamics. Inflation declines ahead of the forecast. Over the first twenty days in March, annual consumer price growth dropped to an estimated 4.3%, from 5.0% in January 2017. February saw a continued slowdown in price growth across all key groups of goods and services, and a reduction in seasonally adjusted monthly inflation. Inflation slowdown was broadly facilitated by the ruble appreciation amid higher than expected oil prices, persistent interest in investment in Russian assets among external investors, and a drop in the sovereign risk premium. Bumper harvests of 2015-2016 resulted in high stocks of agricultural products, leading to a material slowdown in food inflation and falling vegetable and fruit prices. Disinflationary drag from domestic demand persists. Households broadly tend to demonstrate savings behaviour patterns. There are signs of revival in consumption and wages are growing both in nominal and real terms. Consumer lending dynamics does not pose any risks for inflation. Noticeable inflation deceleration will be conducive to a further reduction in inflation expectations among households and businesses. Given the decision taken and persistent moderately tight monetary policy, the Bank of Russia forecasts that the annual consumer price growth will reduce to 4% by the end of 2017 and will remain within this target range in 2018-2019. Monetary conditions. In order to maintain the propensity to save and anchor sustainable inflation slowdown driven by demand-side restrictions, monetary conditions should remain moderately tight. Positive real interest rates will be held at the level which will ensure demand for loans without increasing inflationary pressure and will uphold incentives for saving. A gradual decline in nominal interest rates and the easing of non-price bank lending conditions will remain. Given banks' conservative policy stance, these trends will mostly influence high-quality borrowers. The Finance Ministry's purchases of foreign currency in the FX market did not have any substantial impact on the ruble exchange rate dynamics as the driving factors of its appreciation remained dominant. Short-term inflation risks related to these operations did not materialise. Economic activity. The pace of economic recovery is higher than expected. Estimates show that quarterly GDP has been going up since 2016 Q2 and the trend is set to continue. January â€” February 2017 saw an ongoing annual industrial production growth (adjusted for calendar factors) and a gradual rebound in investment activity. Fixed capital investment is expected to advance in Q1. Unemployment remains persistently low. The labour market is adapting to the new economic conditions with occasional signs of labour shortages in certain segments. Recovery is becoming more even across the regions. Polling data reflects an improvement in business and household sentiment, conducive to favourable economic dynamics. According to the Bank of Russia estimates, the observed annual rise in real wages fosters gradual growth in consumer activity without posing an additional proinflationary pressure amid increased supply of goods and services. The Bank of Russia takes into consideration the oil market uncertainty and keeps pursuing a conservative approach to the forecast, which assumes an oil price reduction to $40 per barrel by the end of 2017 and its further staying near this level. GDP is expected to grow by 1-1.5% in 2017 and by 1-2% in 2018-2019 considering the current dynamics of recovery processes and higher economy resilience to fluctuations in external economic environment. It takes structural changes and time for positive trends to evolve and take root. Inflation risks. The risks that inflation will miss the 4% target by the end of 2017 have slightly abated. Nevertheless, there are still risks that inflation may fail to anchor at the target level in the medium run. These risks are implied by the inertia of inflation expectations, as well as a possible rapid decline in households' propensity to save. Volatility in the global commodity and financial markets may weigh negatively on expectations with regard to exchange rate and inflation. The said risks may also materialise over the mid-term horizon. Moderately tight monetary policy will allow to limit their effects and maintain consumer price growth rates close to 4%. While assessing evolving inflation dynamics and economic developments against the forecast, the Bank of Russia admits the possibility of cutting the key rate gradually in coming Q2-Q3. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next rate review meeting on 28 April 2017. The press release on the Bank of Russia Board decision is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time.

Pakistan,2017-03-25,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement March 25, 2017 The inflation expectations in the current fiscal year continue to remain well anchored. This has been largely due to the near-absence of any major supply side pressures. However rising real incomes in low interest rate environment since FY14 are indicating signs of pick up in domestic demand, which is broadly reflected in the core inflation measures. Going forward, improving consumer confidence, as depicted by IBA-SBP Consumer Confidence Survey of March 2017, indicates further increase in consumer demand. Hence barring any major cost shocks, domestic demand will define the underlying trend of headline inflation in FY18. The real economic activity continues to gather pace at the back of better agricultural output, increase in key Large-scale Manufacturing sectors, and healthy uptick in the credit to private sector. This expansion is helped by range of factors including low cost of inputs, upbeat economic sentiments, improved energy supplies, and CPEC related investments. As result. GDP growth is expected to further improve in FY17. Also prudent monetary policy stance has translated well into low and stable market interest rates, which incentivized private sector to borrow from commercial banks to finance their businesses and investment activities. Accordingly private sector credit increased by Rs 349 billion during Jul-Feb FY17 as compared to Rs 267 billion in the same period last year. Encouragingly fixed investment category led the rise in private sector businesses loans by posting Rs 159 billion uptick during this period, compared to Rs 102 billion last year. Similarly consumer financing continued the uptrend in the first eight months of the current fiscal year. Improved interbank liquidity conditions also spurred the growth in private sector credit. This was led by both net government retirement to commercial banks and decent increase in bank deposits compared to the withdrawals seen last year. Furthermore interbank liquidity was managed well with calibrated open market operations that kept the weighted average overnight repo rate close to the policy rate. The expansion in economic activity has also translated into significant increase in imports, which along with lack of any sustained improvement in exports and small decline in remittances has pushed the current account deficit to US$. billion during Jul-Feb FY17. While net financial flows remained higher, these were not sufficient to finance the current account deficit. However accounting for positive impact of the recent policy measures to augment exports and check non-essential imports, the current account deficit may be contained in the coming months. Also continuation of the financial inflows. CPEC related imports, and any major fluctuation in the global oil price will determine the overall position of the external sector in FY18. Keeping these factors in perspective, the Monetary Policy Committee of SBP has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at.75 percent. Page."
Armenia,2017-03-28,"PRESS RELEASE 28.03.2017 On a March 28, 2017 meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia decided to leave the refinancing rate unchanged, at the 6.0% level. Deflation in February of 2017 was 0.9% against that of 1.4% recorded in the same month of the previous year, in which case the 12â€month inflation rate amounted to â€0.2%. The 12â€month inflation rate, as expected, will continue to recover and stabilize around the target in the forecast horizon. Trends in the external sector generally persisted  the global economy continues to grow slowly, while international commodity markets face even a further expanding inflationary environment against the forecast. There are still some inflationary risks associated with how soon the US Federal Reserve System will be raising the interest rate as well as the capital outflows to the USA from developing and other developed countries. In the upcoming months significant inflationary effects from the external sector are not anticipated, however. The Board notes that economic activity in Januaryâ€February of 2017 considerably exceeded the expectations, largely due to higher growth registered in industry, services and trade sectors. At the same time, domestic demand is gradually recovering primarily thanks to expansionary effect from implementing monetary and fiscal policies during 2015â€2016. In such circumstances where the refinancing rate has reduced 12 times for a total 4.5 percentage points in the last two years, the effect of which will continue to be transmitted to the economy during 2017, the Central Bank Board currently considers it appropriate to leave monetary conditions unchanged, while expecting acceleration in the recovery of economic activity and inflation rate. Should there emerge risks to economic developments in both external and domestic environment and to the inflation deviating from the projected value, the Central Bank would react by adjusting its monetary policy directions accordingly, while fulfilling the inflation target in the medium run. More information on the setting of interest rate will be available in Press Release (Minutes on Interest Rate) to be published by April 7, 2017. Press Service of the Central Bank of Armenia."
Israel,2017-03-28,"Beginning with the upcoming interest rate decision, the structure of the notices will be changed. The new structure will be shorter, and will present the economic situation as seen by the Monetary Committee during the discussion held to reach its decision on the interest rate. The beginning of the notice will present a few short sentences summarizing the state of the economy, and will be followed by a broader review of the economy. The verbal details of the changes in the economic variables since the last decision ('background conditions') will be replaced by a separate file that will be published together with the notice, which will contain graphs and tables that will include the main data presented to the Monetary Committee by the various departments in the Bank during the discussion in the broad forum prior to the decision. This structure is consistent with the lower frequency of interest rate decisions, and gives greater weight to analysis of the fundamental trends. The summary of the Committee's discussions that is published two weeks after the decision will include only a report on the discussion held by the Committee in the narrow forum in order to reach the decision. Bank of Israel Governor Dr.Karnit Flug said, 'We are constantly examining how to improve the communication of monetary policy to the public and how to make it clearer and more transparent. As part of this effort, we began holding quarterly press briefings two years ago regarding monetary policy. The change in the structure of the notice is another step intended to help the public better understand the Monetary Committee's considerations in making its decisions.'."
Thailand,2017-03-29,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 2/2017 Mr. Jaturong Jantarangs. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 29 March 2017 as follows. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 150 percent. In deliberating their policy decision, the Committee assessed that Thailand's growth outlook improved and that the economy would expand at a faster pace than the previous assessment. Meanwhile headline inflation was expected to gradually rise. Nonetheless the Thai economy still faced many risks, particularly on the external front. Hence the Committee decided to keep the policy rate on hold at this meeting in order to maintain accommodative financial conditions which would facilitate the continuation of economic growth. The overall growth outlook improved on the back of a clearer recovery in merchandise exports. Meanwhile tourism continued to recover, and public expenditure remained an important growth driver. Private consumption and investment, however, continued to recover at a gradual pace. Additionally the improved growth outlook was still subject to risks that warranted close monitoring. These included the outturns of the US economic and foreign trade policies, financial stability concerns in China, political developments in Europe, and problems faced by the European banking sector. Headline inflation was expected to gradually rise, although demand-pull inflationary pressures remained low. Meanwhile the public's medium-term inflation expectations remained close to the target. Nevertheless headline inflation might fluctuate in the near- term due to base effects, and would face increased downside risks from developments in global oil prices. Core inflation slowed down recently, in part due to the increase in excise tax last year, but was expected to gradually increase. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative and conducive to economic growth with ample liquidity in the financial system and low real interest rates. However the baht appreciated somewhat against major trading partners' currencies over the recent period which might not be as beneficial to the economy as it could. Under the Committee's view, exchange rates might experience higher volatility in the period ahead due to uncertainties on the external front. The Committee viewed that financial stability remained sound with sufficient cushion against economic and financial volatilities on both domestic and external fronts. However there remained pockets of risks that warranted close monitoring such as the deterioration in loan quality of some business sectors, and the search-for-yield behavior in the prolonged low interest rate environment which might lead to the underpricing of risks. Looking ahead, the Thai economic recovery continued to gain traction but considerable uncertainties remained, particularly those pertaining to the global economic recovery and to the economic and monetary policy directions of major advanced economies. Meanwhile demand-pull inflationary pressures remained low. Thus the Committee viewed that monetary policy should remain accommodative, and would stand ready to utilize an appropriate mix of available policy tools in order to ensure that monetary conditions are conducive to the continuation of economic growth, while ensuring financial stability."
Czech Republic,2017-03-30,"<At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank decided unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged at technical zero. The Bank Board decided to continue using the exchange rate as an additional instrument for easing the monetary conditions. It confirmed the CNB's commitment to intervene on the foreign exchange market if needed to weaken the koruna against the euro so that the exchange rate of the koruna is kept close to CZK 27 to the euro. In line with this, the CNB still stands ready to intervene automatically without any time or volume limits. The asymmetric nature of this exchange rate commitment is unchanged.. At its meeting today, the Bank Board assessed the newly available information obtained since the current CNB forecast was prepared. With the end of the â€œhard commitmentâ€ approaching, it assessed the new information from the perspective of sustainable fulfilment of the 2% inflation target in the future. Sustainable fulfilment of the target following the return to the conventional monetary policy regime is crucial for the timing of the exit from the exchange rate commitment. In the first two months of this year, inflation increased into the upper half of the tolerance band around the target. The last time it reached similar levels was more than four years ago. The subsequent long period of very subdued inflation ended only recently. A short-term increase in inflation above the 2% target but within the tolerance band had been predicted by the CNB back when the exchange rate commitment was introduced in late 2013. The current forecast predicted that inflation would rise above the target this year. However, this occurred slightly earlier and for the time being to a greater extent than expected. This was due primarily to a sharp increase in some traditionally volatile food prices, although, this increase may be partly short-lived. A faster-than-expected rise in core inflation affected the deviation from the forecast in the same direction. Core inflation has been reflecting continued growth in the domestic economy and wages for some time now. It has recently also been affected by renewed growth in euro area producer prices and by the one-off price impacts of the introduction of electronic sales registration in accommodation and food services. The unwinding of  mostly foreign  anti-inflationary effects is also visible in other price categories. Industrial producer prices rose by more than 3% year on year in February following a long period of decline. The decline in agricultural producer prices moderated to just under 1% in February. Prices of construction work and market services are still increasing gradually. The growth of the Czech economy at the close of last year was somewhat lower than expected. The deviation was due chiefly to an unexpectedly sharp decrease in fixed investment. By contrast, the positive contribution of net exports was stronger than forecasted. In line with the forecast, household consumption continued to rise at a robust pace. It thus remained the strongest and most stable driver of the economy. The latest indicators signal continued solid economic growth in the first quarter of this year. Industrial production and retail sales are both rising at a rate of about 4%. Conversely, construction output returned to a slight year-on-year decline early this year. Confidence in the domestic economy edged down from its previous high levels in February and March. Annual growth in the average wage in the economy in 2016 Q4 was lower than forecasted. This reflected a marked slowdown in wage growth in the business sector, which was one percentage point lower than forecasted. According to the calculations of the Czech Statistical Office, however, the median wage increased by 6% year on year in 2016 Q4, i.e. much more strongly than the average wage. This suggests that wages of lower-income employees, who traditionally have an above-average propensity to consume, are increasing more quickly. Economic activity in the Czech Republic's main trading partner countries is also continuing to rise. In line with the assumptions of the current forecast, however, its growth rate has slowed somewhat recently. At the same time, industrial producer prices in the euro area have returned to growth, rising more sharply than expected by the current forecast. The growth outlook for these prices for the whole of this year is increasing as well. Consumer price inflation in the euro area has also risen sharply towards 2% in recent months. As a result, the current outlook for 3M EURIBOR market rates next year has shifted slightly upwards. At its March monetary policy meeting, the European Central Bank left interest rates unchanged and made no adjustments to the parameters of its asset purchase programme. The Brent crude oil price fell close to USD 50 a barrel, i.e. to a three-month low. The current forecast is based on the assumption that the Brent crude oil price will be around USD 57 a barrel in both 2017 and 2018. The market outlooks for the euro-dollar exchange rate are shifting towards a slightly stronger euro. This is a slight anti-inflationary risk as regards koruna prices of oil. To sum up the important facts about recent developments in the Czech economy, inflation was slightly above the forecast and unemployment slightly below it at the start of this year. Conversely, the growth rates of GDP and the average wage at the end of last year were slightly lower than forecasted."
Egypt,2017-03-30,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release March 30, 2017 In its meeting held on March 30, 2017, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) main operation unchanged at 1475 percent, 1575 percent, and 1525 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 1525 percen. Monthly headline inflation dropped to 263 percent in February 2017, after averaging 401 percent between November 2016 and January 2017, reflecting fading cost-push inflationary pressure. Inflation has been mainly driven by tradable items, led by core food items which registered in February the lowest contribution since October 2016, while the contribution of non-tradable items dropped since December 201. Accordingly monthly core inflation dropped to 261 percent in February 2017 after averaging 489 percent between November 2016 and January 201. Nevertheless given elevated monthly inflation rates, annual headline and core inflation registered 3025 percent and 3310 percent in February 2017, respectivel. Meanwhile annual real GDP growth recorded 38 percent in 2016/17 Q2 following the 34 percent recorded in Q1. This coincided with the narrowing of the unemployment rate to 124 percent in 2016/17 Q2 from 126 percent in Q1, resuming its downward trend after peaking at 134 percent in 2013/14 Q. However annual real GDP growth weakened compared to the 45 percent registered during the first half of 2015/1. Developments in the external environment show that there has been some firming of international commodity prices, while low global inflation and subdued global growth continue to maintain weak pressures on domestic prices, albeit recovering and beginning to set the stage for monetary policy normalizatio. From the monetary perspective, annual broad money growth has been strongly affected by revaluation effects of its foreign currency component. Excluding revaluation effects, higher broad money growth between November 2016 and February 2017 came mainly due to the recovery of net foreign assets, evident by the CBE's international reserve accumulatio. Furthermore money growth will continue to be impacted by the phasing out of the CBE's monetary financing of the fiscal defici. In the meantime, the longer-term absorption of excess liquidity continued to tighten liquidity condition. Looking ahead, annual inflation is expected to drop after transitory cost-push effects diminish and monthly inflation rates moderate, supported by the previous preemptive policy rate hikes, longer-term absorption of excess liquidity, as well as by favorable base effect. Consistent with the inflation outlook and the targeted disinflation path, the MPC judges that the key CBE rates are currently appropriat. The MPC reiterates its price stability mandate and will continue to closely monitor all economic and monetary developments as well as the balance of risks, and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter.

South Africa,2017-03-30,"South African Reserve Bank PRESS STATEMENT EMBARGO DELIVERY 30 March 2017 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) the inflation outlook has improved. This was mainly due to the further appreciation of the rand exchange rate following the benign market reaction to the US Fed monetary policy tightening, as well as the significant narrowing of the domestic current account deficit. A more positive growth outlook in the advanced economies has also contributed to a more favourable environment for emerging markets generally. However, the recent heightened domestic political uncertainty has reversed some of these exchange rate gains, and the risk of further rand weakening overshadows the inflation outlook. Domestic growth prospects remain constrained, although the low point of the cycle is probably behind us. Demand pressures are expected to remain weak amid low business and consumer confidence. 1 The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas moderated to 6.3% in February, from 6.6% in January, in line with the market consensus expectation. Food price inflation, which measured 10.0%, moderated for the second consecutive month following its recent peak of 12.0% in December. The contribution of the category of food and non-alcoholic beverages to the overall inflation outcome declined from 1.9 percentage points in January to 1.7 percentage points in February. The Bank's measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity, measured 5.2%, down from 5.5%. This follows a recent peak of 5.9% in December 2016. Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods measured 5.6% in February compared with 5.9% in January. The category of food products, beverages and tobacco products decelerated for the sixth consecutive month to 8.4%, following its recent peak of 13.4% in August last year. The inflation forecast of the Bank has improved, reversing most of the deterioration seen at the previous meeting of the MPC. Headline inflation is now expected to return to within the target range during the second quarter of 2017 compared with the fourth quarter previously, and to remain within the range for the rest of the forecast period. CPI inflation is expected to average 5.9% for the year, compared with 6.2% in the previous forecast, while the forecast for 2018 has moderated from an average of 5.5% to 5.4%. The forecast period has been extended to 2019, with an expected average of 5.5% for the year. This improvement is mainly due to a more appreciated exchange rate assumption. Despite the recent depreciation, the current level of the rand is still consistent with the exchange rate assumption in the forecast. Although the international oil price 2. Although the international oil price 2 assumption remains unchanged, the exchange rate is expected to lead to lower petrol price inflation, and is reflected in a downward revision to the assumption for administered prices. This favourable trend is partially offset by a slower pace of disinflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages, driven by an expected acceleration in poultry prices in particular. Food price inflation is now expected to average 7.4% and 5.2% in 2017 and 2018, compared with 7.0% and 5.0% previously. The forecast for core inflation is marginally lower than before at an average of 5.4% in 2017, and unchanged at 5.2% in 2018. An average core inflation of 5.3% is expected in 2019. Inflation expectations as measured by the Bureau for Economic Research show a deterioration over the near-term in particular. The average expectation for 2017 has increased from 5.8% to 6.2%, with the largest upward revisions coming from businesses and labour respondents. The average expectation for 2018 increased marginally from 5.8% to 5.9%, while the expected inflation for 2019 is 6.0%. By contrast, average inflation expectations over five years declined by 0.1 percentage point to 5.7%. Median inflation expectations of economic analysts as reflected in the Reuters Econometer survey conducted in March, are more or less unchanged since January. Inflation is expected to average 5.8% in 2017, and 5.5% and 5.4% in the coming two years, roughly in line with the Bank's forecast. Inflation expectations implicit in the break-even inflation rates (the yield differential between conventional bonds and inflation linked bonds) had declined since the previous meeting, but have since spiked following the recent depreciation of the rand, and remain above the 6.0% level for longer-dated maturities. 3 The global economy shows continued signs of a broad-based improvement. The growth outlook in the US remains favourable with business confidence indices at high levels. However, there is growing uncertainty about the timing and size of the expected fiscal stimulus. Tax reform may take longer than anticipated following the recent failure to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Growth prospects in Japan and Europe are also more promising, with the PMI reaching a six-year high in the euro area, led by the services sectors in France and Germany. The extent to which the sustainability of this improvement is dependent on the highly accommodative monetary policy stance is still unclear. The outlook for emerging markets is also more positive, in part driven by the recovery in the advanced economies, and stronger demand in China. Firmer commodity prices have also helped, but an oversupply of some commodities could limit these gains. Global inflation provides a mixed picture with the recent decline in international oil prices threatening to reverse the broad-based increases in headline inflation in the advanced economies. Some inflation normalisation is evident in the US and the euro area, but Japan is showing less momentum in price and wage growth. Inflation in the UK is expected to overshoot the target for some time, as the economy adjusts to a weaker currency. Similarly, inflation experiences in a number of emerging economies have reflected divergent currency movements. The US Fed raised its policy rate in March in response to the stronger inflation trend and improved growth outlook. While this action was widely expected, the gradual nature of the expected interest rate cycle implicit in the forward guidance surprised the markets. Policy rates are expected to remain at low levels for some time in most 4. Policy rates are expected to remain at low levels for some time in most 4 of the advanced economies until more favourable inflation and growth dynamics are more firmly entrenched. For the past few months the rand exchange rate had been relatively resilient, along with a number of other emerging market currencies. While most measures of emerging market risk have narrowed over recent months, those for South Africa have widened again over the past few days. The rand has depreciated significantly in response to increased domestic political uncertainty and the exchange rate has re- emerged as an upside risk to the inflation outlook. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand has appreciated by 3.9% against the US dollar, by 4.0% against the euro and by 3.4% on a trade-weighted basis. The prospect of US monetary policy tightening had been seen as a risk to the exchange rate. However, the rand and other peer currencies strengthened in response to the Fed actions in March, indicative of revised market expectations of a more moderate tightening cycle than that priced in. The rand has also been underpinned by favourable terms of trade trends. Furthermore, the improving trend of the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments has reduced the perceived vulnerability of the rand to possible capital flow reversals. However, while significant adjustment of the current account has occurred, the deficit is not expected to remain at the level seen in the fourth quarter of last year. The domestic growth outlook remains weak following the negative growth recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016. The 2016 annual GDP growth of 0.3% is likely to have been the low point of the growth cycle, and a mild recovery is expected over the forecast period. The Bank's forecast for GDP growth has been revised up by 0.1 5. The Bank's forecast for GDP growth has been revised up by 0.1 5 percentage points in both 2017 and 2018, to 1.2% and 1.7%, with growth of 2.0% forecast for 2019. While growth is still expected to be below estimated potential output growth of around 1.4% in the near term, the output gap is expected to narrow to some extent in the later part of the forecast period. The more favourable growth outlook is consistent with the Bank's leading indicator of economic activity which has increased for six consecutive months. The main drivers of growth are expected to be net exports and positive, albeit weak, household consumption expenditure growth. Some impetus is expected to come from fixed capital formation in the outer period of the forecast. At a sectoral level, the agricultural sector is expected to return to positive growth following good rains in a number of regions and improved maize crop estimates. A modest recovery in the manufacturing sector is expected following two consecutive months of the Absa PMI being above the neutral 50 point level, while the mining sector is forecast to respond to more favourable commodity prices. Low growth in gross fixed capital formation remains a downside risk to growth in the short term. In 2016 gross fixed capital formation contracted for the first time since 2010, with the ratio of fixed capital formation to GDP declining from 20.4% in 2015 to 19.6% in 2016. Private sector investment remains particularly weak, having contracted for five successive quarters. This is reflected in the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index which increased marginally in the first quarter of 2017, but at 40 index points remains well below the neutral level of 50. The BER Manufacturing survey shows a sharp decline in expected capital investment over the next 12 months, with the political climate cited as the main reason. 6 The constrained growth outlook does not bode well for employment creation in the economy. According to the Quarterly Labour Force Survey, in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, employment increased by 0.3% while the number of unemployed grew by 11.3%. This resulted in an increase in the unemployment rate by 2.0 percentage points to 26.5%. Consumption expenditure by households, which grew by 0.8% in 2016 remains subdued amid low consumer confidence. While growth of 2.2% was recorded in both of the final two quarters of the 2016, negative retail and wholesale trade sales growth in December and January underscore the likely persistence of this weakness. New vehicle sales continued to decline in February, although exports increased significantly. These trends are expected to persist as the impact of a higher tax burden, low employment growth and weak wealth effects take their toll on consumption expenditure. In addition, credit extension by banks to the private sector continues to grow at low rates, particularly to households amid a further decline in the household debt to disposable income ratio. Expenditure will be supported to some extent by positive but moderate real income growth. Fiscal policy as outlined in the recent budget remains committed to a steady pace of deficit reduction over the next three years. Lower tax revenues relative to budget â€“ partly a consequence of slower economic growth â€“ have resulted in a shortfall to be filled by a combination of lower expenditure growth, increased fuel levies and other excise duties, and a number of tax changes. These include limited compensation for fiscal drag and a higher marginal tax bracket for high-income earners. The tax 7 increases are expected to act as a drag on household consumption expenditure, particularly for middle and upper income earners. International oil prices have declined following increased oil inventories and weak compliance with the OPEC-brokered deal to restrict output, and an increase in shale gas production in the US. Although Brent crude oil prices increased by about 10% in the wake of this agreement, these gains have been largely reversed, with oil prices back in the region of US$50 per barrel for the past three weeks. The impact on the domestic petrol price will be evident in April when a reduction is expected, despite the 39 cent increase in the Road Accident Fund and fuel levies provided for in the February budget. Since the previous MPC meeting the inflation outlook has improved. However, the risk to the inflation forecast has been affected by the reaction of the of the exchange rate to the current elevated levels of political uncertainty. At current levels of around R13.00 against the US dollar, the exchange rate is still moderately stronger than the level implied in the exchange rate assumption in the forecast. However, the rand is likely to react further to unfolding developments until a greater degree of certainty and confidence is restored. The possibility of significant overshooting of the exchange rate in the short run also cannot be ruled out. As always, the MPC will attempt to â€œlook throughâ€ short term fluctuations and focus on longer term trends in its policy settings. 8 The MPC remains concerned about the elevated level of inflation expectations. While the near-term reversal was not unexpected, given the deterioration of the short-term inflation outlook in January, the longer term expectations remain anchored uncomfortably at the upper end of the target range. Not all the inflation risk factors are on the upside. The deterioration in the forecast at the previous meeting was due in part to a higher international oil price assumption. This assumption has not been adjusted to reflect the recent market developments. There is a downside risk to this assumption, given the possibility of these more moderate trends persisting. A further downside risk comes from electricity price increases, which could turn out to be lower than the 8.0% currently in the forecast from mid-2017. The final price determination by the energy regulator is yet to be announced. Overall, the MPC assesses the risk to the inflation outlook to be moderately on the upside, mainly due to the high degree of exchange rate uncertainty. The MPC sees no evidence of significant demand pressures impacting on inflation. The growth outlook remains disappointing, and the MPC is concerned that increased political uncertainty could impact negatively on private sector investment and household consumption expenditure, and further undermine employment growth. The risks to the growth outlook are therefore assessed to be on the downside. In light of these developments the MPC has decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 7.0% per annum. Five members preferred an unchanged stance and one member preferred a 25 basis point reduction. 9 The MPC is of the view that we may have reached the end of the tightening cycle. However the Committee would like to see a more sustained improvement in the inflation outlook before reducing rates. This assessment may however change if the inflation outlook and the risks to the outlook deteriorate.

Poland,2017-04-05,"Warsaw, 5 April 2017 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 4-5 April 2017 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: ï‚§ reference rate at 1.50%; ï‚§ lombard rate at 2.50%; ï‚§ deposit rate at 0.50%; ï‚§ rediscount rate at 1.75%. Global economic growth remains moderate, with signs of recovery strengthening in many economies. In the euro area. GDP growth is stable, accompanied by favourable sentiment in the economy. In the United States, economic conditions are supported by improving labour market and a rebound in investment, although recent data point to some deceleration of growth in 2017 Q1. In China, economic activity growth has stabilised, while in Russia economic conditions remain weak. In March, global commodity prices fell, yet remained higher than a year before. As a result, in many countries the annual price growth rates are significantly higher than in 2016, but their rise has come to a halt. At the same time, in many economies, including the euro area, core inflation is still moderate amid low demand pressure. The European Central Bank keeps interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero. The ECB also continues its asset purchase programme, albeit at a slower pace since April. The Federal Reserve has increased its interest rates, indicating further monetary policy tightening in the future. In Poland, recent data on production still point to improving economic conditions in 2017 Q1. Growth in economic activity is driven mainly by increasing consumer demand, supported by a rise in employment and wages, very good consumer sentiment and child benefit payments. This is confirmed by robust growth in retail sales. The annual growth in prices of consumer goods and services, after a significant rise at the beginning of the year, declined somewhat in March. Core inflation remains low, which points to still weak demand pressure. Despite growing employment and wages, growth in unit labour costs remains moderate. In the Council's opinion, inflation will stabilise at a moderate level over the following quarters. The stabilisation of price growth in the coming quarters will result from fading effects of the past increase in global commodity prices, with only a gradual rise in domestic inflationary pressure stemming from improving domestic economic conditions. In consequence, the risk of inflation running persistently above the target in the medium term is limited. 1/2 The Council confirms its assessment that, given the available data and forecasts, the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on the sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic balance."
Romania,2017-04-05," Video: Press briefing, 5 April 2017 (Romanian only)  Board meeting minutes. In its meeting of 5 April 2017, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided the following:. The annual inflation rate returned to positive territory in January 2017, reaching 0.1 percent, from -0.54 percent in December 2016, and advanced to 0.2 percent in February, thus matching the projected level. In line with expectations, the annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate1 rose to 0.9 percent in February, compared with 0.3 percent at the end of 2016. Against this backdrop, the average 12-month CPI inflation further posted less negative rates, climbing to -1.1 percent in February, from -1.5 percent in December 2016; calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, the annual average moved up to -0.7 percent, against -1.1 percent in the final month of 2016. Economic growth accelerated at a faster-than-expected pace in 2016 Q4, with real GDP rising at an annual rate of 4.7 percent, against 4.3 percent in the previous quarter. The pick-up in GDP dynamics was widely ascribed to the contribution of net exports, amid the slightly brisker growth of exports and the slightly slower increase in imports of goods and services, while domestic demand played a secondary part. On the supply side, the services sector strengthened its dominant position in terms of GDP formation. In 2016 as a whole. GDP growth hit an eight-year high of 4.8 percent. The current account deficit widened to 2.3 percent of GDP, against 1.2 percent a year earlier, mainly on the back of a worsening in the trade balance and the balance on primary income. For the beginning of 2017, available statistical data show a further high growth rate of turnover volume in trade and a swifter increase in industrial production, together with an ongoing contraction of activity in the construction sector. Unit wage costs industry-wide edged higher, with wage growth still well above labour productivity growth, despite a slight recovery in the latter at the end of 2016 and the start of 2017. Real monetary conditions remained stimulative in 2017 Q1. The annual growth of credit to the private sector continued in February, largely on account of the advance in new loans to non-financial corporations. The share of leu-denominated credit in total private sector loans widened to 57.7 percent (from a low of 34.6 percent in May 2012), amid further divergent developments in the two components (up 13.9 percent for lei and down 11.5 percent for foreign currency in February). This certifies the improvement in monetary policy transmission, while also helping mitigate risks to financial stability. The most recent assessments reconfirm the outlook for the annual inflation rate to stick to a slightly upward path in the following months, while remaining significantly below the lower bound of the variation band of the flat target. This is in line with the annual inflation rate trajectory shown by the latest medium-term forecast, published in the February 2017 Inflation Report. The uncertainties and risks surrounding the inflation outlook stem from both domestic and external sources. Domestically, they arise primarily from the evolution of fiscal and income policies in 2017, as well as from the uncertainties regarding the future adjustments in administered prices  especially those related to the energy market deregulation , whose developments may differ from the initial assessments. Looking at the external environment, risks stem mainly from the uncertainty surrounding economic growth and inflation developments in the euro area, regionally and globally, as well as from the fluctuations in international oil prices. Against this background and based on currently available data, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided to keep unchanged the monetary policy rate at 1.75 percent per annum, to further pursue adequate liquidity management in the banking system, and to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board decisions aim to ensure and preserve price stability over the medium term in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth. The NBR Board reiterates that a balanced macroeconomic policy mix and progress in structural reforms are of the essence in preserving a stable macroeconomic framework and strengthening the capacity of the Romanian economy to withstand potentially adverse global developments. The NBR is closely monitoring domestic and external developments and stands ready to use all its available tools. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR website on 12 April 2017, at 3:00 p.m. In line with the announced calendar, the next monetary policy meeting of the NBR Board is scheduled for 5 May 2017, when a new quarterly Inflation Report is to be examined. 1 Calculated by excluding from the consumer price index the following categories: administered prices, volatile prices, and tobacco and alcoholic beverage prices."
Czech Republic,2017-04-06,"<At its extraordinary monetary policy meeting today, the CNB Bank Board decided to end the CNB's exchange rate commitment. The Bank Board did not discuss interest rate settings today. Interest rates thus remain unchanged at technical zero.. On the basis of a thorough assessment of the available macroeconomic data, analyses and forecasting scenarios, the Bank Board stated that the conditions for sustainable fulfilment of the 2% inflation target in the future had been met. In this situation, continuation of the exchange rate commitment is no longer necessary from the perspective of fulfilment of the CNB's primary objective of price stability. The overall macroeconomic picture shows that the domestic economy has been fostering rising costs and, in turn, rising prices for some time now. With anti-inflationary effects from abroad simultaneously unwinding, this means that there is no longer a need to maintain expansionary monetary conditions to the current extent. The exit from the exchange rate commitment is the first step towards a gradual moderation of the expansionary nature of the monetary conditions."
Israel,2017-04-06,"The trend of moderate increase in annual inflation continues, affected primarily by the change in the trend in energy prices. However, the shekel's appreciation is expected to defer the return of inflation to the target, and has also led to a decline in short-term inflation expectations. Medium term (forward) inflation expectations are anchored within the target range, and longer-term expectations are around the midpoint of the target range. Based on indicators of real economic activity, it may be assessed that net of the atypical effect of vehicle imports, the economy continued to grow in the first quarter of 2017 by a rate similar to that in recent quarters. The labor market continues to convey avery positive picture and is near full employment. The state of real economic activity worldwide is mostly positive, though there is continued uncertainty regarding political processes and their economic ramifications. In the US, the federal funds target rate was increased, and two more increasesare expected this year; in Europe, accommodative policy continues. There are signs of the housing marketcooling off, but it is too early to conclude that the trend of increases has halted. For the Research Department Staff Forecast. April 2017. For the complete file of data accompanying this notice. Excel sheet- data. The Monetary Committee intends to maintain the accommodative policy as long as necessary in order to entrench the inflation environment within the target range. The Bank of Israel continues to monitor developments in inflation, the real economy, financial markets, and the global economy, and will act to attain the monetary policy targets in accordance with such developments. In the past year, the annual inflation rate has been increasing moderately, and over the 12 months ending in February the inflation rate was 0.4 percent (Figure 1 in the data file). This is the highest rate of inflation since July 2014, but inflation remains below the target range. The increase in inflation was supported by the accommodative monetary policy, the increase in energy prices in the past year, the rise in inflation worldwide, and the wage increases in the economy. However, enhanced competition in the economy is delaying the return of inflation to the target, and in recent months, there was also the impact of the sharp appreciation of the shekel. The appreciation led to a relatively sharp decline in short-term inflation expectations (Figure 3). There was some decline in medium-term and long-term expectations as well, but medium-term forward inflation expectations are anchored within the target range, and longer term expectations are around the midpoint of the target (Figure 4). In the housing market, the decline in the rate of new mortgages granted continues, againstthe background of the increase in mortgage interest rates, and the decline in the number of transactions continues as well. Data on building starts indicate that supply continues to expand. However, despite the previous two observations pointing to some stability in home prices, it is too early to conclude thatthe upward trend has halted. Based on indicators of real economic activity in the first quarter, it may be assessed that net of the effect of volatility in vehicle imports, the economy continued to grow by a rate similar to that of recent months. This is seen in the initial findings of the Companies Survey (Figure 10), from the Purchasing Managers Index indicating expansion for several months, and from the Composite State of the Economy Index. Foreign trade data have been relatively volatile since the beginning of the year, against the background of fluctuations in vehicle imports and pharmaceutical exports. The development of exports in recent months indicates that the virtual standstill in goods exports has continued while services exports continue to grow. The improvement in world trade is expected to support exports, but the rapid appreciation of the shekel is expected to weigh on them. Labor market indicators continue to portray its strength (Figure 13): employment is increasing, with a continued rise in wages, and the number of job vacancies is elevated. The state of global economic activity portrayed by recent indicators is mostly positive, though there is continued uncertainty regarding political processes and their economic ramifications. Growth forecasts for some advanced economies were revised slightly upward, there was improvement in the rate of world trade growth (Figure 16), and sentiment indices remain elevated. In the US, positive data were published regarding the labor market, personal consumption, the industrial sector, and the real estate industry, and core inflation indices are around the target. The Federal Reserve raised the federal funds target rate, and is expected to raise it twice more over the course of the year. In Europe as well, data were positive with regard to employment, manufacturing, salesand expectations of future activity. However, core inflation remains relativelylow and accommodative monetary policy continues. Purchasing managers indices inemerging markets pointed to optimism regarding the development of economic activity, though growth forecasts for some were reduced. Data on economic activity published in China indicated stable growth. Energy prices declined in the past month against the background of increased supply, but the decline did not offset the upward trend of the past year. Based on the Research Department's updated macroeconomic forecast. GDP is expected to grow by 2.8 percent in 2017 (although the growth rate net of the effect of fluctuations in vehicle imports is expected to be higher) and by 3.3 percent in 2018. Inflation is expected to be 0.7 percent in the coming year (ending in the first quarter of 2018), and to converge to within the target range in the second quarter of 2018. The monetary interest rate is expected to remain at its current level of 0.1 percent throughout the coming year and to increase gradually from the second quarter of 2018. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on April 20, 2017. Thenext decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Monday. May 29, 2017. .

India,2017-04-06,"First Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2017-18 Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) Reserve Bank of India On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation at its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 6.25 per cent. Consequent upon the narrowing of the LAF corridor as elaborated in the accompanying Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies, the reverse repo rate under the LAF is at 6.0 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate are at 6.50 per cent. The decision of the MPC is consistent with a neutral stance of monetary policy in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Assessment 2. Since the MPC met in February 2017, indicators of global growth suggest signs of stronger activity in most advanced economies (AEs) and easing of recessionary conditions in commodity exporting large emerging market economies (EMEs). In the US, high frequency data indicate that the labour market, industrial production and retail sales are catalysing a recovery in Q1 of 2017 from a relatively subdued performance in the preceding quarter. Nonetheless, risks to higher growth have arisen from non-realisation or under- achievement of macroeconomic policies. In the Euro area, the manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose to a six-year high in March amidst improving consumer confidence and steadily strengthening employment conditions. In the Japanese economy, nascent signs of revival are evident in the form of falling unemployment, improving business sentiment on fixed investment, and rising exports helped by the depreciation of the yen; however, deflation risks linger.2 3. For EMEs, the outlook is gradually improving, with indications that the slowdown characterising 2016 could be bottoming out. In China, supportive macroeconomic policies, surging credit growth and a booming property market have held up the momentum of growth albeit amidst concerns about financial stability and capital outflows. In Brazil, hardening commodity prices are providing tailwinds to reforms undertaken by the authorities to pull the economy out of recession, although financial fragilities remain a risk. Russia is benefiting from the firming up of crude prices and it is widely expected that growth will return to positive territory in 2017. Inflation is edging up in AEs to or above target levels on the back of slowly diminishing slack, tighter labour markets and rising commodity prices. Among EMEs. Turkey and South Africa remain outliers in an otherwise generalised softening of inflation pressures. Global trade volumes are finally showing signs of improvement amidst shifts in terms of trade, with exports rising strongly in several EMEs as well as in some AEs whose currencies have depreciated. International financial markets have been impacted by policy announcements in major AEs, geo-political events and country-specific factors. Equity markets in AEs were driven up by reflation trade, stronger incoming data and currency movements. Equity markets in EMEs had a mixed performance, reflecting domestic factors amidst a cautious return of investor appetite and capital flows. In the second half of March, dovish guidance on US monetary policy lifted equities across jurisdictions, especially in Asia, as the reach for EME assets resumed strongly, although doubts about the realisation of US policies. Brexit and softer crude prices tempered sentiments. Bond markets have mirrored the uncertainty surrounding the commitment to fiscal stimulus in the US and yields traded sideways in AEs, while they generally eased across EMEs. In the currency markets, the US dollar's bull run lost steam by mid-March. EME currencies initially rose on optimism on the global outlook, but some of them have weakened in recent days with the fall in commodity prices. Crude prices touched a three-month low in March on rising shale output and US inventories. Food prices have been firming up globally, driven by cereals. On the domestic front, the Central Statistics Office (CSO) released its second advance estimates for 2016-17 on February 28, placing India's real GVA growth at 6.7 per cent for the year, down from 7 per cent in the first advance estimates released on January 6. Agriculture expanded robustly year- on-year after two consecutive years of sub-one per cent growth. In the industrial sector, there was a significant loss of momentum across all categories, barring electricity generation. The services sector also slowed, pulled down by trade, hotels, transport and communication as well as financial, real estate and professional services. Public administration, defence and other services cushioned this slowdown. To some extent, government expenditure made up for weakness in private consumption and capital formation. Several indicators are pointing to a modest improvement in the macroeconomic outlook. Foodgrains production has touched an all-time high3 of 272 million tonnes, with record production of rice, wheat and pulses. The record production of wheat should boost procurement operations and economise on imports, which had recently surged. Rice stocks, which had depleted to close to the minimum buffer norm, have picked up with kharif procurement. The bumper production of pulses has helped in building up to the intended buffer stock (i.e., 20 lakh tonnes) and this will keep the price of pulses under check  the domestic price of pulses has already fallen below the minimum support price (MSP). Industrial output, measured by the index of industrial production (IIP), recovered in January from a contraction in the previous month, helped by a broad-based turnaround in manufacturing as well as mining and quarrying. Capital goods production improved appreciably, although this largely reflected the waning of unfavourable base effects. Consumer non-durables continued, however, to contract for the second successive month in spite of supportive base effects. Thus, investment and rural consumption demand remain muted. The output of core industries moderated in February due to slowdown in production of all the components except coal. The manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) remained in expansion mode in February and rose to a five month high in March on the back of growth of new orders and output. The future output index also rose strongly on forecasts of pick-up in demand and the launch of new product lines. The 77th round of the Reserve Bank's industrial outlook survey indicates that overall business sentiment is expected to improve in Q1 of 2017-18 on the back of a sharp pick up in both domestic and external demand. Coincident indicators such as exports and non-oil non-gold imports are indicative of a brighter outlook for industry, although the sizable under-utilisation of capacity in several industries could operate as a drag on investment. Activity in the services sector appears to be improving as the constraining effects of demonetisation wear off. On the one hand, rural demand remains depressed as reflected in lower sales of two- and three- wheelers and fertiliser. On the other hand, high frequency indicators relating to railway traffic, telephone subscribers, foreign tourist arrivals, passenger car and commercial vehicles are regaining pace, thereby positioning the services sector on a rising trajectory. After three consecutive months of contraction, the services PMI for February and March emerged into the expansion zone on improvement in new business. After moderating continuously over the last six months to a historic low, retail inflation measured by year-on-year changes in the consumer price index (CPI) turned up in February to 3.7 per cent. While food prices bottomed out at the preceding month's level, base effects pushed up inflation in this category. Prices of sugar, fruits, meat, fish, milk and processed foods increased, generating a sizable jump in the momentum in the food group. In the fuel group, inflation increased as the continuous hardening of international prices lifted domestic prices of liquefied petroleum gas during December 2016  February 2017. Kerosene prices have also been increasing since July with the programmed reduction of the subsidy. Adapting to the movements in these salient prices, both three months ahead and a year ahead households'4 inflation expectations, which had dipped in the December round of the Reserve Bank's survey, reversed in the latest round. Moreover, the survey reveals hardening of price expectations across product groups. The 77th round of the Reserve Bank's industrial outlook survey indicates that pricing power is returning to corporates as profit margins get squeezed by input costs. Excluding food and fuel, inflation moderated in February by 20 basis points to 4.8 per cent, essentially on transient and item-specific factors. In February, favourable base effects were at work in the clothing and bedding sub-group as well as in personal care and effects, the latter also influenced by the disinflation in gold prices. The volatility in crude oil prices and its lagged pass-through are impacting the trajectory of CPI inflation excluding food and fuel. Much of the impact of the fall of US $4.5 per barrel in international prices of crude since early February would feed into the CPI print in April as its cumulative pass-through occurred with a lag in the first week of this month. Importantly, inflation excluding food and fuel has exhibited persistence and has been significantly above headline inflation since September 2016. With progressive remonetisation, the surplus liquidity in the banking system declined from a peak of 7,956 billion on January 4, 2017 to an average of 6,014 billion in February and further down to 4,806 billion in March. Currency in circulation expanded steadily during this period. Its impact on the liquidity overhang was, however, partly offset by a significant decline in cash balances of the Government up to mid-March which released liquidity into the system. Thereafter, the build-up of Government cash balances on account of advance tax payments and balance sheet adjustment by banks reduced surplus liquidity to 3,141 billion by end-March. Issuances of cash management bills (CMBs) under the market stabilisation scheme (MSS) ceased in mid-January and existing issues matured, with the consequent release of liquidity being absorbed primarily through variable rate reverse repo auctions of varying tenors. Accordingly, the average net absorption by the Reserve Bank increased from 2,002 billion in January to 4,483 billion in March. The weighted average call money rate (WACR) remained within the LAF corridor. The maturing of CMBs and reduced issuance of Treasury bills leading up to end-March has also contributed to Treasury bill rates being substantially below the policy rate. Merchandise exports rose strongly in February 2017 from a subdued profile in the preceding months. Growth impulses were broad-based, with major contributors being engineering goods, petroleum products, iron ore, rice and chemicals. The surge in imports in January and February 2017 largely reflected the effect of the hardening of commodity prices such as crude oil and coal. Non-oil non-gold imports continued to grow at a modest pace, though capital goods imports remained sluggish. With imports outpacing exports, the trade deficit widened in January and February from its level a year ago, though it was lower on a cumulative basis for the period April-February 2016-17. Balance of payments data for Q3 indicate that the current account deficit for the first three quarters of the financial year narrowed to 0.7 per cent of GDP, half of its level a year ago. For the year as a whole, the current account5 deficit is likely to remain muted at less than 1 per cent of GDP. Foreign direct investment (FDI) has dominated net capital inflows during April-December, with manufacturing, communication and financial services being the preferred sectors. Turbulence in global financial markets set off a bout of global risk aversion and flight to safe haven that caused net outflows of foreign portfolio investment (FPI) during November 2016 to January 2017. The tide reversed with the pricing in of the Fed's normalisation path and improvement in global growth prospects. FPI flows turned positive in February and welled up into a surge in March, especially in debt markets relative to equity markets (which had been the dominant recipient until February). This reversal appears to have been driven by stable domestic inflation, better than expected domestic growth, encouraging corporate earnings, clarity on FPI taxation, pro-reform budget proposals and state election results. The level of foreign exchange reserves was US$ 369.9 billion on March 31, 2017. Outlook 15. Since the February bi-monthly monetary policy statement, inflation has been quiescent. Headline CPI inflation is set to undershoot the target of 5.0 per cent for Q4 of 2016-17 in view of the sub-4 per cent readings for January and February. For 2017-18, inflation is projected to average 4.5 per cent in the first half of the year and 5 per cent in the second half (Chart 1). Risks are evenly balanced around the inflation trajectory at the current juncture. There are upside risks to the baseline projection. The main one stems from the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the south west monsoon in view of the rising probability of an El NiÃ±o event around July- August, and its implications for food inflation. Proactive supply management will play a critical role in staving off pressures on headline inflation. A prominent risk could emanate from managing the implementation of the allowances recommended by the 7th CPC. In case the increase in house rent allowance as recommended by the 7th CPC is awarded, it will push up the baseline trajectory by an estimated 100-150 basis points over a period of 12- 18 months, with this initial statistical impact on the CPI followed up by second- order effects. Another upside risk arises from the one-off effects of the GST. The general government deficit, which is high by international comparison, poses yet another risk for the path of inflation, which is likely to be exacerbated by farm loan waivers. Recent global developments entail a reflation risk which may lift commodity prices further and pass through into domestic inflation. Moreover, geopolitical risks may induce global financial market volatility with attendant spillovers. On the downside, international crude prices have been easing recently and their pass-through to domestic prices of petroleum products should alleviate pressure on headline inflation. Also, stepped-up procurement operations in the wake of the record production of foodgrains will rebuild buffer stocks and mitigate food price stress, if it materialises. GVA growth is projected to strengthen to 7.4 per cent in 2017-18 from 6.7 per cent in 2016-17, with risks evenly balanced (Chart 2).6 18. Several favourable domestic factors are expected to drive this acceleration. First, the pace of remonetisation will continue to trigger a rebound in discretionary consumer spending. Activity in cash-intensive retail trade, hotels and restaurants, transportation and unorganised segments has largely been restored. Second, significant improvement in transmission of past policy rate reductions into banks' lending rates post demonetisation should help encourage both consumption and investment demand of healthy corporations. Third, various proposals in the Union Budget should stimulate capital expenditure, rural demand, and social and physical infrastructure all of which would invigorate economic activity. Fourth, the imminent materialisation of structural reforms in the form of the roll-out of the GST, the institution of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, and the abolition of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board will boost investor confidence and bring in efficiency gains. Fifth, the upsurge in initial public offerings in the primary capital market augurs well for investment and growth. The global environment is improving, with global output and trade projected by multilateral agencies to gather momentum in 2017. Accordingly, external demand should support domestic growth. Downside risks to the projected growth path stem from the outturn of the south west monsoon; ebbing consumer optimism on the outlook for income, the general economic situation and employment as polled in the March 2017 round of the Reserve Bank's consumer confidence survey; and, commodity prices, other than crude, hardening further. Overall, the MPC's considered judgement call to wait out the unravelling of the transitory effects of demonetisation has been broadly borne out. While these effects are still playing out, they are distinctly on the wane and should fade away by the Q4 of 2016-17. While inflation has ticked up in its latest reading, its path through 2017-18 appears uneven and challenged by upside risks and unfavourable base effects towards the second half of the year. Moreover, underlying inflation pressures persist, especially in prices of services. Input cost pressures are gradually bringing back pricing power to7 enterprises as demand conditions improve. The MPC remains committed to bringing headline inflation closer to 4.0 per cent on a durable basis and in a calibrated manner. Accordingly, inflation developments have to be closely and continuously monitored, with food price pressures kept in check so that inflation expectations can be re-anchored. At the same time, the output gap is gradually closing. Consequently, aggregate demand pressures could build up, with implications for the inflation trajectory. Against this backdrop, the MPC decided to keep the policy rate unchanged in this review while persevering with a neutral stance. The future course of monetary policy will largely depend on incoming data on how macroeconomic conditions are evolving. Banks have reduced lending rates, although further scope for a more complete transmission of policy impulses remains, including for small savings/administered rates1. It is in this context that greater clarity about liquidity management is being provided, even as surplus liquidity is being steadily drained out. Along with rebalancing liquidity conditions, it will be the Reserve Bank's endeavour to put the resolution of banks' stressed assets on a firm footing and create congenial conditions for bank credit to revive and flow to productive sectors of the economy. Six members voted in favour of the monetary policy decision. The minutes of the MPC's meeting will be published by April 20, 2017. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled on June 6 and 7, 2017. Jose J. Kattoor Press Release: 2016-2017/2689 Chief General Manager 1 Since the introduction of the formula in April 2016, interest rates on small savings are about 61-95 basis points higher, depending on tenor, compared to what they should be if the formula is followed. If the spread between small savings rates and bond yields remains wide, the diversion of deposits to small savings would impede a full transmission to bank lending rates."
Brazil,2017-04-12,"The Copom unanimously decided to reduce the Selic rate by one percentage point, to 11.25 percent per year, without bias. The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario:. The set of indicators of economic activity released since the last Copom meeting remains consistent with stabilization of the economy in the short run. Available evidence suggests a gradual recovery of economic activity during the course of 2017. The global outlook remains quite uncertain. Nevertheless, developments have so far mitigated the effects on the Brazilian economy of possible changes in economic policy in some large economies, notably in the United States. There is uncertainty regarding the sustainability of global economic growth and the stability of current commodity price levels. Inflation developments remain favorable. The disinflation process is more widespread, and disinflation of IPCA components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy has consolidated. Food price disinflation constitutes a favorable supply shock. Inflation expectations for 2017 collected by the Focus survey are around 4.1%. Expectations for 2018 remain around 4.5%, and expectations for 2019 and longer horizons are slightly below that level; and. The Copom's inflation forecasts for 2017 and 2018 in the scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the Focus survey are around 4.1% and 4.5%, respectively. This scenario assumes a path for the policy interest rate that ends 2017 at 8.5% and remains at that level until the end of 2018. The Committee emphasizes that its baseline scenario involves risks in both directions: the highly uncertain global outlook might make disinflation more difficult; the approval and implementation of reforms notably those of fiscal nature and of adjustments in the Brazilian economy are important for the sustainability of disinflation and for the reduction of its structural interest rate; the favorable food-price shock might produce second-round effects and, thus, contribute to additional reductions of inflation expectations and inflation in other economic sectors; and the recovery of economic activity might be more (or less) gradual and delayed than currently anticipated. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and a wide array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to reduce the Selic rate by one percentage point, to 11.25 percent per year, without bias. This moderate intensification of the pace of monetary easing, relative to the pace set in the January and February Copom meetings, is, at this time, appropriate. The Committee judges that convergence of inflation to the 4.5% target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, which includes 2017 and, with a gradually increasing weight, 2018, is compatible with the ongoing monetary easing process. The Copom judges that the extension of the monetary easing cycle will depend not only on estimates of the structural interest rate of the Brazilian economy, which the Committee will continue to reassess over time, but also on the evolution of economic activity, on the other aforementioned risk factors, and on inflation forecasts and expectations. The Copom emphasizes that the pace of monetary easing will depend on the estimated extension of the cycle and on the degree of frontloading. In turn, the latter will depend on the evolution of economic activity, on the other aforementioned risk factors, and on inflation forecasts and expectations. The Committee considers the current pace of easing to be appropriate; however, the current economic context calls for monitoring the developments of the determinants of the degree of frontloading of the cycle. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Ilan Goldfajn (Governor). Anthero de Moraes Meirelles. Carlos Viana de Carvalho. Isaac Sidney Menezes Ferreira. Luiz Edson Feltrim. Otavio Ribeiro Damaso. Reinaldo Le Grazie. Sidnei Corr=AAa Marques, and Tiago Couto Berriel."
Chile,2017-04-13,"Santiago. Chile. Thursday, 13 April 2017 Monetary Policy Meeting  April 2017 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to lower the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points, to 2.75%. Internationally, global financial conditions remain favorable and various indicators point to a scenario of stronger growth and higher inflation in the developed world. Commodity prices showed mixed fluctuations, where the higher oil price stood out. Overall, important risks persist. On the domestic front, inflation and activity performed in line with forecasts in the March Monetary Policy Report. Annual inflation remained at 2.7% and expectations at the end of the projection horizon are near the target. Indicators on economic activity and domestic demand remain weak. In particular, the labor market has deteriorated somewhat more than foreseen. To ensure the convergence of inflation to the policy target, the Board will assess the need for some additional increase in the monetary impulse, which will hinge on the medium-term inflation outlook. As always, it reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. The Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2017-04-13,"Base Rate unchanged at 1., 25% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Board considers that the global economic recovery has continued to expand. The global financial markets have shown generally stable movements, with the trend of rising stock prices continuing for example. Looking ahead the Board sees the global economic recovery as likely to be affected by factors such as the directions of the new US government's economic policies, the pace of monetary policy normalization by the US Federal Reserve, the movements toward spreading trade protectionism, and the political uncertainties in the euro area. The Board judges that the trend of domestic economic growth has expanded somewhat, as exports and investment have improved although consumption has remained low. The sluggishness in employment conditions has eased, with the extent of decline in the number of persons employed in the manufacturing sector having lessened and the trend of increase in persons employed in the service sector expanded. The Board sees the domestic economy as likely to continue its trend of moderate growth going forward, and forecasts a rate of GDP growth for this year slightly above the January projection (2., 5%). Exports will sustain their trend of improvement, thanks chiefly to the global economic recovery, and domestic demand activities will also recover moderately as the deterioration in economic agents\x80\x99 sentiment eases. However, the paces of improvement in exports and domestic demand activities are expected to be limited, owing to changes in conditions related to trade with major countries and to the weak improvement in households\x80\x99 real purchasing power. Consumer price inflation has continued at the 2% target level, in line mainly with increases in the prices of petroleum and agricultural, livestock and fisheries products. Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has remained in the mid- to upper-1% range, while the rate of inflation expected by the general public has fallen to the mid-2% level. Looking ahead the Board expects that consumer price inflation will for the time being fluctuate at the 2% level, and for the year as a whole slightly exceed the January projection (1., 8%). Core inflation will maintain a level in the mid- to upper-1% range. In the domestic financial markets, the volatilities of both stock prices and long-term market interest rates have shown low levels, in reflection for example of stable movements in the global financial markets. After having fallen the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has rebounded, due mainly to a shift to US dollar strengthening and to geopolitical risks. The extent of growth in bank household lending has continued to lessen, but the substantial increase in household lending by non-banks has been sustained. Housing sales prices in Seoul and its surrounding areas have risen slightly, and those in the rest of the country have held steady. Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As the inflationary pressures on the demand side are not expected to be high given the moderate pace of domestic economic growth, the Board will maintain its stance of monetary policy accommodation. In this process it will closely monitor conditions related to trade with major countries, geopolitical risks, the progress of monetary policy normalization by the US Federal Reserve, and the trend of increase in household debt."
Ukraine,2017-04-13,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to cut the key policy rate to 13%, effective 14 April 2017. The resumed cycle of the monetary policy easing is in accord with the pursuit of inflation targets set for 2017-2019 and will help propel the economic growth in Ukraine. In March 2017, headline inflation was recorded at 15.1% yoy. Price growth has accelerated primarily due to base effects and higher production costs. Actual acceleration of headline inflation was as expected, although at a lower trajectory than projected in the NBU's Inflation Report in January 2017. The NBU then projected inflation in March to accelerate to 16.4%. The fundamental factors that determine inflation have remained under control. Prudent fiscal and monetary policies against a backdrop of improved inflation expectations restrained acceleration of core inflation (in March 2017, 6.3% in annual terms). Demand-pull pressure on prices has remained moderate, as evidenced by the anemic growth in retail goods turnover in the first months of the year. The revival of economic activity and the improvement in business outlook of enterprises contributed favorably to the recovery of labor demand. However, unemployment remains at a high level due to labor market mismatches. The situation in the FX market has helped weaken pressure on prices. The external price environment for Ukrainian exporters has become more favorable since early 2017 due to recovery in prices for steel, iron ore, and grains, with an export potential being further bolstered by record high grain and oil crop yields. Appreciation of the hryvnia since mid-January was underpinned by solid export revenues. Inflation is projected to decrease to target levels in 2017  2019. The NBU inflation forecast for 2017 remains at a level of 9.1% and 6.0% in 2018. Headline inflation is projected to decrease to 5.0% in 2019. Throughout Q2 and Q3 of 2017 inflation in annual terms is forecasted to remain in the double-digit range and volatile. It is attributed to the base effects, namely the administered price dynamics in 2016. Inflation will only return to a one-digit range in Q4 2017. No significant deviations of core inflation from the current level (6.5%) are projected by the end of the year. Recovery of consumer demand and second-round effects from the higher food price inflation will be the inflation driving factors. Prices for unprocessed foods will rise at a faster pace in the following months driven by a number of factors. First, global food prices are projected to move on an upward trajectory. Second, opening of the new markets will result in a lower supply of certain types of domestically produced foods in Ukraine. In addition to supply factors, there is also an effect of demand factors. Consumer demand is expected to recover gradually due to a fast-growing nominal household income. The halt on transferring cargo across the line of contact in the eastern Ukraine will have no significant impact on the headline inflation. In 2017  2019, prudent monetary and fiscal policies supporting controlled rise in consumer demand and moderate FX rate volatility will be the key drivers of the disinflation process. Growing investments in agriculture will improve its performance that is still lagging behind leading countries. This will curb the food price inflation in the mid-term. The NBU has revised its 2017  2018 GDP growth projections. Economic growth is projected to slow to 1.9% in 2017. This downward revision resulted from expectations that the hold on trade in eastern Ukraine and the loss of the production facilities located in the rebel-controlled areas will decrease the output of some industries. These are the metallurgical and mining industries, coke production, and the electrical industry. This negative influence will be partly offset by a more favorable external environment. Real GDP growth is forecasted to increase to 3.2% in 2018 and 4.0% in 2019. The economy will be driven by reasonably high growth in consumer and investment demand. This demand will stimulate growth in imports of goods and services. However, it will be partly offset by a gradual increase in the country's export potential in 2018 and 2019. The balance of payments projections have been revised in response to the blocade on trade and a revision of the terms of trade. The projections for a 2017 current account deficit have been increased from USD 3.5 billion to USD 4.3 billion or 4.4% of GDP. The trade blocade is expected to decrease the export potential of the metallurgical industry, while increasing the need for imported raw materials. However, this will be partly offset by a rise in global commodity prices. The 2018-2019 current account deficit, although remaining unchanged in nominal terms (USD 4.3 billion), will gradually narrow to 4.1% of GDP in 2018 and 3.7% of GDP in 2019. This will be attributed to a rise in the economy's export potential, due to investment picking up. The 2017-2019 current account deficit will be counterbalanced by net financial account inflows. In particular, in 2017, debt inflows to the private sector will resume, while households' demand for foreign currency cash will continue to fall. In 2018, an improved business climate and faster economic growth are projected to increase debt inflows and foreign direct investment in the private sector. Surplus of the overall balance of payments, together with the planned tranches received under the IMF EFF and other related financing programs, will enable the NBU to accumulate further the international reserves. At the same time, replenishment of reserves through FX purchases in the interbank market will be less intensive than expected earlier due to the negative effects of the blocade with certain areas of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts on the external trades. Therefore, the international reserves are estimated as USD 21.1 billion as of the end of 2017 and USD 26.2 billion as of the end of 2018. The major risk for the above scenario can be a failure by the private sector and the Government to efficiently minimize losses from the seized transfer of cargo across the contact line in the ATO area. Apart from that, we still face a high risk of escalation of the military conflict in eastern Ukraine. A negative impact may be experienced due to departure from the prudent fiscal policy, including raising social standards even more strikingly than the inflation targets justify it. The furtherance of structural reforms necessary to preserve the macrofinancial stability, especially of those specified as Ukraine's commitments under the EFF program with the IMF, is also important. Overall, according to the NBU Board, the inflation forecast and the balance between risks is appropriate for for further monetary policy easing. Therefore, the NBU Board has decided to cut the key policy rate to 13%. Further monetary policy easing depends on mitigation of risks to price stability on the forecast horizon. The decision to cut the key policy rate to 13% is approved by NBU Board Decision On the Key Policy Rate No. 232-Ñ€Ñˆ, dated 13 April 2017. Ð new detailed macroeconomic forecast will be published in the Inflation Report on 20 April 2017. The next meeting of the NBU Board on monetary policy issues will be as scheduled."
Peru,2017-04-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR APRIL 2017 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 4.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 4.25 percent. This decision is consistent with an inflation forecast in which inflation converges to the target range during 2017 and takes into account the following factors: The faster pace of inflation observed recently is transitory and is associated with the supply shocks caused by the effects of El NiÃ±o; Expectations of inflation in 12 months are temporarily close to the upper band of the inflation target range; The pace of growth of domestic economic activity has continued to slow down in the first quarter of 2017, showing a pace of growth below its potential growth level. Economic activity is expected to gradually show greater dynamism in the following quarters as a result of increased government spending and higher export prices, and The global economy shows signals of recovery, although there is still uncertainty about developed countries' policies. The Board oversees new data on inflation and inflation determinants, giving particularly close attention to data about the reversal observed in terms of supply shocks, to ease the monetary policy stance in the short term. Inflation in March showed an extraordinary high rate (1.3 percent) due to rises in the prices of some foodstuffs that were affected by the severe rains associated with El NiÃ±o. As a result, the year-to-year rate of inflation rose from 3.25 percent in February to 3.97 percent in March. Inflation without food and energy showed a rate of 0.84 percent, as a result of which the year-to-year rate increased from 2.56 percent in February to 2.72 percent in March, within the target range. It should be pointed out that, historically, inflation has been affected by supply shocks that have increased it transitorily and reversed thereafter, which is also what is happening today. The indicators of business expectations declined in March. In line with this. GDP is expected to grow between 3.0 and 3.5 percent in 2017. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 3.0 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 4.80 percent for the first 15 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 15 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.80 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for May on its meeting of May 11, 2017."
Turkiye,2017-04-26,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term interest rates at the following levels:. a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate has been kept at 9.25 percent and borrowing rate has been kept at 7.25 percent. b) One-week repo rate has been kept at 8 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent, while lending rate has been increased from 11.75 percent to 12.25 percent. Recently released data indicate a gradual recovery in the economic activity. Domestic demand conditions display a moderate improvement and demand from the European Union economies continues to contribute positively to exports. With the supportive measures and incentives provided recently, the economic activity is expected to gain further pace in the forthcoming period. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly. Cost push pressures and the volatility in food prices in recent months have led to a sharp increase in inflation. Although the recent improvement in the risk appetite contains some of the upside pressures from cost factors, current elevated levels of inflation pose risks on the pricing behavior. Accordingly, the Committee decided to strengthen the monetary tightening in order to contain the deterioration in the inflation outlook. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. Tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained until inflation outlook displays a significant improvement. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Euroarea,2017-04-27,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Vice-President. Mr Dombrovskis. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We continue to expect them to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases. Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, we confirm that our net asset purchases, at the new monthly pace of â‚¬60 billion, are intended to run until the end of December 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. The net purchases will be made alongside reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme. Our monetary policy measures have continued to preserve the very favourable financing conditions that are necessary to secure a sustained convergence of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Incoming data since our meeting in early March confirm that the cyclical recovery of the euro area economy is becoming increasingly solid and that downside risks have further diminished. At the same time, underlying inflation pressures continue to remain subdued and have yet to show a convincing upward trend. Moreover, the ongoing volatility in headline inflation underlines the need to look through transient developments in HICP inflation, which have no implication for the medium-term outlook for price stability. A very substantial degree of monetary accommodation is still needed for underlying inflation pressures to build up and support headline inflation in the medium term. If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, we stand ready to increase our asset purchase programme in terms of size and/or duration. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro area real GDP increased by 0.5%, quarter on quarter, in the fourth quarter of 2016, following a growth rate of 0.4% in the third quarter. Incoming data, notably survey results, bolster our confidence that the ongoing economic expansion will continue to firm and broaden. The pass-through of our monetary policy measures is supporting domestic demand and facilitates the ongoing deleveraging process. The recovery in investment continues to benefit from very favourable financing conditions and improvements in corporate profitability. Employment gains, which are also benefiting from past labour market reforms, are supporting real disposable income and private consumption. Moreover, the signs of a stronger global recovery and increasing global trade suggest that foreign demand should increasingly add to the overall resilience of the economic expansion in the euro area. However, economic growth continues to be dampened by a sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms, in particular in product markets, and by remaining balance sheet adjustment needs in a number of sectors. The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook, while moving towards a more balanced configuration, are still tilted to the downside and relate predominantly to global factors. Headline inflation has been recovering from the very low levels seen in 2016, largely owing to higher energy price increases. After reaching 2.0% in February 2017, euro area annual HICP inflation stood at 1.5% in March. This reflected mainly lower energy and unprocessed food price inflation, but also a decline in services price inflation. Looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to increase in April and thereafter to hover around current levels until the end of this year. However, as unutilised resources are still weighing on domestic wage and price formation, measures of underlying inflation remain low and are expected to rise only gradually over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the expected continuing economic recovery and the corresponding gradual absorption of slack. Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) continues to expand at a robust pace, with an annual rate of growth of 4.7% in February 2017, after 4.8% in January. As in previous months, annual growth in M3 was mainly supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate M1 expanding at an annual rate of 8.4% in February 2017, unchanged from the previous month. The recovery in loan growth to the private sector observed since the beginning of 2014 is proceeding. The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations declined to 2.0% in February 2017, from 2.3% in the previous month, while the annual growth rate of loans to households remained broadly stable at 2.3% in February. At the same time, the euro area bank lending survey for the first quarter of 2017 indicates that net loan demand has increased and bank lending conditions have further eased across all loan categories. The pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014 continues to significantly support borrowing conditions for firms and households and credit flows across the euro area. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed the need for a continued very substantial degree of monetary accommodation to secure a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% without undue delay. In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute much more decisively to strengthening economic growth. The implementation of structural reforms needs to be substantially stepped up to increase resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost productivity and potential output growth. Regarding fiscal policies, all countries should intensify efforts towards achieving a more growth-friendly composition of public finances. A full and consistent implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact and of the macroeconomic imbalances procedure over time and across countries remains crucial to enhance the resilience of the euro area economy."
Colombia,2017-04-28,"The Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica, at today's meeting, decided to reduce the benchmark interest rate by 50 bp to 6.5%. For this decision, the Board mainly took into account the following aspects. In March, annual inflation lowered to 4.69%. The average of core inflation indicators remained stable at 5.55%. Analysts' inflation expectations to December 2017 and 2018 lowered, and posted at 4.4% and 3.5%, respectively. Those derived from the monthly surveys also lowered, but registered above 4.0% to one and two years. Those embedded in public debt bonds also reduced, and are close to 3.0% to the end of 2018. The effects of the strong transitory supply shocks that diverted inflation from its target continue to fade. For example, this is suggested by the slowdown of the food CPI in March. Annual variation of the CPI excluding food and regulated items increased, possibly due to the temporary effect of the increase of indirect taxes and to the increasing indexation, which has reflected mainly on a larger annual variation of non-tradable prices of goods and services. Growth of external demand is expected to be somewhat greater than the one registered in 2016. However, so far this year, uncertainty about the behavior of this variable has increased, as well as of the prices of commodities and capital flows. In Colombia, recent indicators of economic activity such as retail sales, industrial production, and consumer confidence suggest that the economy weakened in the first quarter of the year, more than had been expected. With all this, the technical staff reduced its economic growth forecast for 2017 from 2.0% to 1.8%, within a range between 0.8% and 2.6%. Considering the current level of core inflation indicators and inflation expectations, various calculations of the real policy interest rate are above its average since 2005. Based on this information, the Board considered the following aspects:p>. The increasing weakness of the economic activity, and the risk of an excessive slowdown. Recent indicators suggest a greater risk of increases in the excess capacity of the economy, although uncertainty regarding their size is strong. Uncertainty regarding the pace of convergence of inflation to its 3.0% target. The reduction of inflation was in line with the expectations of the technical staff, but their reduction was explained largely by the behavior of food prices. The indexation mechanisms and the increase in the persistence of inflation were reflected in the increase of the annual variation of non-tradable prices, and could delay convergence of inflation to its 3.0% target. Contrary to this, a greater slowdown reduces inflation forecasts in the policy horizon. The current level of the real policy interest rate is contractionary. With the reduction of inflation expectations, the current level of the benchmark interest rate would be even more contractionary. In this context, the Board of Directors considered that a 50 bp reduction is in line with the risk balance and is consistent with the objective of reaching a 3.0% inflation target in 2018. Additional reductions will depend on the balance of risks, between a slow convergence of inflation to 3.0% and an excessive slowdown on the economy. The decision to reduce the benchmark interest rate by 50 bp was approved by four members of the Board. The remaining two Board Members voted for a 25 bp reduction."
Russia,2017-04-28,"On 28 April 2017, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to reduce the key rate to 9.25% per annum. The Board notes that inflation is moving towards the target, inflation expectations are still declining and economic activity is recovering. At the same time, inflation risks remain in place. Given the moderately tight monetary policy, the 4% inflation target will be achieved before the end of 2017 and will be maintained close to this level in 2018-2019. In making its decision on the key rate, moving forward, the Bank of Russia will assess the probability of the baseline scenario implementation (where oil prices drop to $40 per barrel) and the scenario with rising oil prices, alongside with assessing inflation and the economy dynamics relative to the forecast. The Bank of Russia's assessment of the overall potential of the key rate reduction before the end of 2017 is unchanged. In making its key rate decision, the Bank of Russia was guided by the following assumptions. Inflation dynamics. Annual inflation has moved close to the target level. Annual consumer price growth is down to 4.3% from 4.6% in February. According to the estimates as of 24 April, annual inflation stands at 4.2-4.3%. March saw a slowdown in price growth across all core groups of goods and services. Inflation slowdown was broadly facilitated by the ruble appreciation amid relatively higher oil prices, persistent interest in investment in Russian assets among external investors, and a drop in the sovereign risk premium. Seasonally adjusted monthly inflation data in February and March held at a low level. These months saw food inflation unusually low for this period, supported by the high level of supply including bumper harvests of 2015-2016. This impact is likely to run its course in the second quarter, which is attested by weekly price growth data for April that suggests that prices on fruit and vegetables accelerated. Even so, inflation is estimated to remain on the path of downward movement towards the 4% target before the end of 2017. As inflation showed a substantial slowdown in 2017 Q1, inflation expectations of both households and businesses were down considerably. However, this trend may grind to a halt temporarily as food inflation is expected to post a seasonal increase, considering that inflation expectations are sensitive to the dynamics of this inflation. Domestic demand continues to exert a disinflationary effect. Households broadly tend to demonstrate savings behaviour patterns. There are signs of nascent recovery in consumer activity. Consumer expenditures are expected to restore gradually as real disposable incomes continue to show weak growth. Consumer lending bears no inflation risks. Monetary conditions. In order to maintain the propensity to save and anchor sustainable inflation slowdown driven by demand-side restrictions, monetary conditions should remain moderately tight. Positive real interest rates are held at the level which ensures demand for loans without increasing inflationary pressure and upholds incentives for saving. A gradual decline in nominal interest rates and the easing of non-price bank lending conditions will remain. Given banks' conservative policy stance, these trends will mostly influence high-quality borrowers. Economic activity. The Bank of Russia estimates that the economy continued to recover in the first quarter and expects fixed capital investments to increase. Industrial production is maintaining positive dynamics and unemployment is showing a downward trend. The labour market is adjusting to the new economic environment, with signs beginning to emerge that labour shortages are finding their way in individual segments. Recovery is becoming more even across regions. Polling data reflects an improvement in business and household sentiments, supporting favourable economic dynamics. According to the Bank of Russia estimates, the observed annual rise in real wages will foster gradual growth in consumer activity without posing additional proinflationary pressure amid increased supply of goods and services. Given the current recovery dynamics and the economy's growing resilience to the fluctuations in the external economic climate, the Bank of Russia expects that the GDP will grow in 2017-2019 even if the conservative oil price scenario materialises. Inflation risks. Possible volatility of global commodity and financial markets caused, among other things, by negotiations between oil exporting countries to extend agreements on limiting oil production may become the key source of inflation risks in the near future. It may result in a temporary hike in volatility of capital flows and the exchange rate undermining exchange rate and inflation expectations. That said, inflation risks will be lower in the scenario with rising oil prices. Legislative consolidation of a budget rule will also mitigate medium-term inflation risks. Besides, medium-term inflation risks are that anchoring of inflation and inflation expectations at the target level may take a long time. This is caused by the inertia of inflation expectations and a possible shift in households' behaviour pattern due to a decline in propensity to save. In making its decision on the key rate, the Bank of Russia will assess the probability of the baseline scenario implementation (where oil prices drop to $40 per barrel) and the scenario with rising oil prices, alongside with assessing inflation and the economy dynamics relative to the forecast. The Bank of Russia's assessment of the overall potential of the key rate reduction before the end of 2017 is unchanged. Given the decision taken and moderately tight monetary policy sustained, the Bank of Russia forecasts that the annual consumer price growth will reduce to 4% before the end of 2017 and will remain within this target level in 2018-2019. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next rate review meeting on 16 June 2017. The press release on the Bank of Russia Board's decision is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time. Refinancing rate values prior to 01.01.2016. The reference to the Press Service is mandatory if you intend to use this material."
Georgia,2017-05-02,"2.05.2017 The National Bank of Georgia increases the policy rate by 25 basis points to 7.0 percent The Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Georgia met on May 2, 2017 and made the decision to increase the refinancing rate by 25 basis points to 7.0 percent. The decision is based on the macroeconomic forecast, according to which, due to the supply side pressures, the inflation is expected to be above its target rate during 2017. Nevertheless, once the effect of one-time factors affecting CPI inflation is exhausted, the inflation rate is expected to decline at its target level in 2018. Moreover, by increasing the policy rate, the National Bank of Georgia intends to control the inflation expectations. Other things equal this year, a further increase in the policy rate is not expected. With the elimination of the impact of the aforementioned one-time factors, the inflation will start declining and will stay close to the target in the medium term; the policy rate in the medium term is expected to gradually decrease to its neutral level. This year, the factors affecting the demand side of the consumer prices are still weak, although the economic activity has improved. According to preliminary estimates, economic growth in the first quarter is 5.0 percent. Following the economic recovery of the main trading partners, the external demand has surged, significantly increasing the revenues from tourism and exports. Moreover, compared to the previous year, the volume of remittances has grown. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all available instruments at its disposal to ensure the price stability. The new monetary policy rate will be effective from 4th of May, 2017. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on June 14th, 2017."
United States,2017-05-03,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen even as growth in economic activity slowed. Job gains were solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate declined. Household spending rose only modestly, but the fundamentals underpinning the continued growth of consumption remained solid. Business fixed investment firmed. Inflation measured on a 12-month basis recently has been running close to the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective. Excluding energy and food, consumer prices declined in March and inflation continued to run somewhat below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee views the slowing in growth during the first quarter as likely to be transitory and continues to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further, and inflation will stabilize around 2 percent over the medium term. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced. The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 3/4 to 1 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Janet L Yellen. Chair; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Lael Brainard; Charles L Evans; Stanley Fischer; Patrick Harker; Robert S Kaplan; Neel Kashkari; and Jerome H Powell. Implementation Note issued May 3, 2017."
Czech Republic,2017-05-04,"<At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank decided unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged. The exit from the exchange rate commitment was the first step towards a gradual return of the overall monetary conditions to normal. Subsequent interest rate increases will be conditional on the evolution of all key macroeconomic variables, including the exchange rate of the koruna. The CNB still stands ready to use its instruments to mitigate potential excessive exchange rate fluctuations if needed.. According to the new macroeconomic forecast, inflation will stay in the upper half of the tolerance band around the 2% target this year and return to the target early next year. At the monetary policy horizon, inflation will be very close to the target. Consistent with the forecast is an increase in domestic market interest rates in 2017 Q3 and later also in 2018. According to the assumptions of the new forecast, economic growth in the effective euro area will gradually increase towards 2%. At the start of this year, inflation in the euro area reflected, among other factors, strong year-on-year growth in prices of oil and other commodities. After this factor abates, the current high growth in industrial producer prices will also decrease. Consumer price inflation in effective terms should be flat at roughly the current level this year and accelerate towards 2% next year. The outlook for 3M EURIBOR market interest rates reflects the continued easy monetary policy of the European Central Bank and is negative over the entire forecast horizon. The euro-dollar exchange rate is expected to remain broadly stable. Likewise, the outlook for the Brent crude oil price foresees stability close to the current level. According to the forecast, domestic inflation will stay in the upper half of the tolerance band for the rest of this year. It will decline towards the 2% target at the start of next year and will be very close to it over the monetary policy horizon, i.e. in 2018 Q2 and Q3. In addition to core inflation, rapid growth in food and fuel prices is contributing to the higher inflation this year. The expected decline in inflation in early 2018 will be due to an unwinding of one-off factors observed in late 2016 and early 2017. It will be supported by a recovery in labour productivity growth, which will reduce the currently peaking cost pressures from the domestic economy. A renewed anti-inflationary effect of import prices connected with the forecasted appreciation of the koruna will act in the same direction. The growth of the Czech economy will rise to almost 3% this year. The domestic economy will maintain a similar pace next year. Growth in economic activity will be driven mainly by robust growth in household consumption and a gradual recovery in investment. The economy will benefit from further growth in external demand. The continued domestic economic growth will manifest itself in rising tightness in the labour market. This will result in a further acceleration in wage growth. The forecast assumes that interest rates will remain at the current level in Q2 following the exit from the exchange rate commitment in April. Thereafter, an increase in domestic market interest rates in 2017 Q3 and later also in 2018 is consistent with the forecast. The rate increase will be strongly dampened until around mid-2018 by the European Central Bank's currently ongoing quantitative easing. According to the forecast, the koruna will appreciate due, among other factors, to continued real convergence of the Czech economy to the euro area countries. According to the forecast, appreciation will also be fostered by a positive interest rate differential vis-Ã -vis the euro area and this year's asset purchases by the European Central Bank. However, the exchange rate forecast does not take into account that the appreciation may also be strongly dampened in the coming quarters by market â€œoverboughtnessâ€. Compared to the previous forecast, the inflation outlook is slightly lower over the monetary policy horizon. This is despite currently stronger inflation pressures, which will, however, weaken in the quarters ahead. The effect of import prices will be more anti-inflationary than in the previous forecast, reflecting the slightly earlier exit from the exchange rate commitment compared to the assumptions of the previous forecast. This is also reflected in the path of market interest rates, which has shifted towards slower growth in rates. The GDP growth forecast is little changed."
Romania,2017-05-05," Video: Press conference, 15 May 2017 - Quarterly Inflation Report (Romanian only) Video: Press briefing, 5 May 2017 (Romanian only) Board meeting minutes. In its meeting of 5 May 2017, the Board of the National Bank of Romania (NBR) decided the following:. The annual inflation rate remained relatively steady in March 2017, standing at 0.18 percent, against 0.2 percent in the prior month, in line with the NBR projection. Behind this stood the slowdown in the annual dynamics of fuel prices, which offset the effects of the faster increase in volatile food prices and of the higher adjusted CORE2 inflation rate1, whose annual rate crept up to 1.04 percent, from 0.91 percent in February. Average 12-month CPI inflation further posted less negative values, coming in at 0.9 percent in March, from -1.1 percent in February; calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, the annual average rose to -0.5 percent, against -0.7 percent in February 2017. The upward path in both indicators owes largely to the gradual drop-out from their calculation of the annual changes affected by the VAT rate cut applied in June 2015. Economic growth accelerated at a faster-than-expected pace in 2016 Q4, with revised data showing that real GDP expanded by 4.8 percent year on year. The pick-up in GDP dynamics was widely ascribed to the contribution of net exports, following the positive differential between the annual growth rates of exports and imports of goods and services. In 2016 as a whole, the 4.8 percent advance in GDP was driven by private consumption, the growth of which hit a nine-year high of 7.3 percent, amid the easing of fiscal and income policies and an improvement in employment. Conversely, the contribution of gross fixed capital formation to GDP growth turned negative. For 2017, the most recent statistical data (January-February) show a further high annual growth rate of turnover volume in trade and services, a swifter increase in industrial production, as well as a protracted contraction of activity in construction. Given that labour productivity dynamics advanced not as fast as wage growth, the annual pace of increase of unit wage costs industry-wide gathered momentum against the final quarter of last year. The current account balance swung into surplus in the first two months of 2017, amid the good performance of the balance on primary income, even though the deficit on trade in goods widened from the same year-ago period. Real monetary conditions remained stimulative. Credit to the private sector grew at a faster annual pace in March (3.1 percent from 2.1 percent in February). These developments pave the way for a halt in the downward trajectory of private credit-to-GDP ratio this year, also on the back of a reduction in non-performing loan sales. The faster credit growth was largely underpinned by the leu-denominated component, whose annual dynamics accelerated to 14.1 percent. Behind this stood primarily new loans to non-financial corporations and consumer credit. Against this background, the share of leu-denominated credit in total private sector loans widened to a post-January 1997 high of 58.2 percent from 34.6 percent in May 2012. This ensures an improved monetary policy transmission, while also helping mitigate risks to financial stability. In today's meeting, the NBR Board examined and approved the May 2017 Inflation Report, which incorporates the most recent data and information available. The current scenario of the projection points to the annual inflation rate picking up throughout the forecast interval, but following a slightly lower path than in the previous Report. The risks and uncertainties surrounding the inflation outlook stem from both domestic and external environment. Domestically, they originate mainly in the fiscal and income policy stance, also amid the recent legislative initiatives regarding wages and taxes. On the external front, still relevant are the uncertainties and risks related to euro area and global economic growth, arising primarily from the elections scheduled in Europe, the Brexit talks, as well as from the economic policies of the US Administration. In this context and based on currently available data, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided to keep unchanged the monetary policy rate at 1.75 percent per annum and to further pursue adequate liquidity management in the banking system. Given the contraction in foreign currency credit, the consolidation of forex reserves (EUR 35.96 billion at end-April 2017) above the adequate level, and their improved composition, the NBR Board decided to cut the minimum reserve requirement ratio on foreign exchange-denominated liabilities of credit institutions to 8 percent from 10 percent starting with the 24 May - 23 June 2017 maintenance period. The measure aims to continue the harmonisation of the minimum reserve requirements mechanism with the relevant standards and practices of the European Central Bank and the major central banks across the European Union. The minimum reserve requirement ratio on leu-denominated liabilities remains unchanged at 8 percent. The NBR Board decisions aim to ensure and preserve price stability over the medium term in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth. The NBR Board reiterates that a balanced macroeconomic policy mix and progress in structural reforms are of the essence in preserving a stable macroeconomic framework and strengthening the capacity of the Romanian economy to withstand potential adverse global developments. The NBR is closely monitoring domestic and external developments and stands ready to use all its available tools with a view to achieving its objectives. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be released to the public in a press conference on 15 May 2017. Hence, the account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision will be posted on the NBR website also on 15 May, at 3:00 p.m. In line with the announced calendar, the next monetary policy meeting of the NBR Board is scheduled for 3 July 2017. 1 Calculated by excluding from the consumer price index the following categories: administered prices, volatile prices, and tobacco and alcoholic beverage prices."
Philippines,2017-05-10,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) facility at 3.0 percent. The corresponding interest rates on the overnight lending and deposit facilities were also kept steady. The reserve requirement ratios were likewise left unchanged. The Monetary Board's decision is based on its assessment of manageable inflation. Latest baseline forecasts continue to be within the target range of 3.0 percent Â± 1 percentage point for 2017-2018. Market expectations likewise remain anchored to the inflation target over the policy horizon. At the same time, the Monetary Board observed that inflation has remained elevated due largely to the recent increases in food prices and underlying inflation pressures. The Monetary Board also noted that the balance of risks surrounding the inflation outlook continues to be tilted toward the upside, given the transitory impact of the proposed tax reform program as well as possible further adjustments in transportation fares and electricity rates. Meanwhile, prospects for the global economy have improved, but risks remain tilted to the downside. The Monetary Board emphasized that even amid external headwinds, the outlook for domestic economic activity remains intact owing to buoyant household consumption and private investment, increased government spending, ample liquidity, and sustained credit growth. Going forward, the BSP will remain vigilant against any risks to the inflation outlook and will adjust its policy settings as needed to ensure that future inflation remains consistent with the medium-term target while being supportive of sustainable economic growth."
Peru,2017-05-11,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR MAY 2017 BCRP LOWERED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE TO 4.0% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to lower the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.00 percent. This level of the benchmark rate is compatible with an inflation forecast in which inflation converges to the target range during 2017 and remains within the target range in 2018. This forecast takes into account the following factors: The reversal of the supply shocks that affected inflation in the first quarter, confirming the trend projected in the previous month; Expectations of inflation in 12 months are temporarily close to the upper band of the inflation target range; The pace of growth of domestic economic activity has continued to slow down in recent months, the output showing a pace of growth below its potential growth level. Economic activity is expected to recover in the following quarters as a result of increased government spending and higher export prices, and The world economy continues to show a gradual recovery, although there is still some uncertainty about developed countries' policies. The Board oversees new data on inflation and inflation determinants to assess the convenience of making additional changes in the monetary policy stance if deemed necessary. Inflation in April recorded a rate of -0.26 percent due to the significant reversal of increases in the prices of some foodstuffs, as a result of which the year-to-year rate of inflation fell from 3.97 percent in March to 3.69 percent in April. Inflation without food and energy showed a rate of 0.09 percent, as a result of which the year-to-year rate increased from 2.72 percent in March to 2.79 percent in April, within the target range. The indicators of business expectations have recovered in April, which would be reflecting the transitory nature of the economic slowdown observed in the first quarter of the year. In 2017 GDP is expected to grow between 2.5 and 3.2 percent. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 2.75 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 4.55 percent for the first 15 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 15 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.55 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for June on its meeting of June 8, 2017."
Malaysia,2017-05-12,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.00 percent. The global economy continues to expand. Industrial activity and global trade have picked up. Growth is also becoming more synchronised across the advanced and emerging economies. Indicators suggest that the outlook for the global economy will continue to improve. In the advanced economies, the revival in investment is expected to provide additional impetus to economic activity. In the emerging economies, growth is projected to be supported by sustained domestic activity and stronger external demand. Nevertheless, there remain risks to global growth arising from threats such as protectionism, geopolitical developments, and commodity price volatility. These risks could also reignite financial market volatility. For Malaysia, the growth momentum since the second half of 2016 is expected to strengthen in the first quarter of 2017, and to be sustained for the rest of the year. Growth will be mainly driven by domestic demand amid continued wage and employment growth, and the implementation of new and on-going investment projects. On the external front, given the improvement in global growth, exports are expected to perform more strongly and contribute positively to Malaysia's economic performance. Headline inflation increased to 4.3% in the first quarter of the year, in line with the MPC's expectations. The increase in inflation reflected mainly the pass-through impact of higher global oil prices and temporary supply disruptions that led to higher food prices. The higher headline inflation is expected to moderate in the second half of the year. However, the trend of domestic headline inflation will be dependent on future global oil prices which remain highly uncertain. The cost-push inflation is not expected to have a significant impact on the broader price trends given the stable domestic demand conditions. Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation, is expected to increase only modestly. The ringgit has continued to stabilise. Banking system liquidity remains sufficient. Financial institutions continue to operate with strong capital and liquidity buffers and the growth of financing to the private sector is consistent with the pace of economic activity. At the current level of the OPR, the stance of monetary policy is accommodative and supportive of economic activity. The MPC will continue to assess the balance of risks surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation. Bank Negara Malaysia 12 May 2017."
Armenia,2017-05-16,"PRESS RELEASE 16.05.2017 On a May 16, 2017 meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia decided to leave the refinancing rate unchanged, at the 6.0% level. There was 1.0% inflation in April of 2017 compared with 0.3% deflation recorded in the same month of the previous year, which has been mainly attributable to higher levels of prices of agricultural products. In this circumstance, the 12â€month inflation rate has expanded and entered a positive territory; it amounted to 1.2% at the end of April, exceeding the Central Bank forecasts. The Board estimates that in the forecast horizon the inflation will continue to recover, stabilizing around the target. In the external environment, the global economic growth outlook is improving and inflationary patterns in international commodity markets are persisting. However, the Board of the Central Bank expects only moderate inflationary effects from the external sector in the forthcoming months. The Board notes that growth of economic activity in the first quarter of 2017 was strong enough, largely due to high growth registered in industry, rendered services and trade sectors. At the same time, the expansionary monetary policy implemented in recent years continues contributing to the recovery of domestic demand. As a result, it is expected that inflation will be within the confidence band already in 2017 and will stabilize around the target in the forecast horizon. Also, inflationary risks are estimated to be largely balanced at this point, in which case the Board considers it appropriate to leave the monetary conditions unchanged. However, should there emerge risks to the inflation deviating from its recovery path, the Central Bank would react by adjusting its monetary policy directions accordingly, while fulfilling the inflation target in the medium run. Detailed information on setting of the interest rate will be available in Inflation Report (Monetary Policy Program Q2, 2017), to be published by May 26, 2017. Press Service of the Central Bank of Armenia."
Poland,2017-05-17,"Warsaw, 17 May 2017 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 16-17 May 2017 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: ï‚§ reference rate at 1.50%; ï‚§ lombard rate at 2.50%; ï‚§ deposit rate at 0.50% ï‚§ rediscount rate at 1.75%. Global economic conditions are showing further signs of improvement, particularly in industry and international trade. In the euro area, data point to ongoing recovery. In the United States. GDP growth declined in 2017 Q1, most probably due to temporary factors. In China, economic growth was higher than in the previous quarter, yet current data do not indicate a sustained acceleration in growth. In many countries, the annual inflation rates are markedly higher than in 2016, reflecting mainly an earlier increase in commodity prices. However, energy commodity prices, mostly oil, have fallen recently. The European Central Bank keeps interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero. The ECB also continues its asset purchase programme. At the same time, the Federal Reserve indicates further monetary policy tightening. In Poland, incoming data point to a pick-up in GDP growth in 2017 Q1. Economic growth is still driven primarily by increasing consumer demand, supported by rising employment and wages, good consumer sentiment and disbursement of benefits. This is accompanied by improving conditions in industry and construction, which may point to a gradual recovery in investment demand. The annual growth in prices of consumer goods and services, following a significant rise at the beginning of the year, has stabilised at a moderate level. At the same time, core inflation, though gradually increasing, remains low, which points to still limited demand pressure. Despite growing employment and wages, growth in unit labour costs remains moderate. In the Council's opinion, in the following quarters inflation will remain moderate amid fading effects of the past increase in global commodity prices, with only a gradual rise in domestic inflationary pressure stemming from improving domestic economic conditions. In consequence, the risk of inflation running persistently above the target in the medium term is limited. The Council confirms its assessment that, given the available data and forecasts, the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on the sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic balance."
Chile,2017-05-18,"Santiago. Chile. Thursday, 18 May 2017 Monetary Policy Meeting  May 2017 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to lower the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points, to 2.5%. Internationally, despite a recent increase in volatility, financial conditions have remained favorable and incoming figures continue to lend support to a scenario of stronger growth in the developed world. Commodity prices again showed mixed fluctuations, with a drop in the copper price. Overall, important risks persist. On the domestic front, annual inflation remained at 2.7% and expectations at the end of the projection horizon are near the target. The activity and demand outlook depicted in the first-quarter National Accounts were in line with the March Monetary Policy Report, showing the negative impact of mining and construction. Private consumption is stable, reflecting the performance of the labor market. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. The Spanish original prevails."
Pakistan,2017-05-20,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement May 20, 2017 Real GDP growth in FY17 is provisionally estimated at. percent representing 10 year high. Specifically the revival of domestic demand has been instrumental in the current upturn. The major thrust has come from the ongoing public and private investment particularly in infrastructure and power sector. Furthermore consumer spending has also expanded with stable inflationary environment and banks' renewed interest in consumer financing. On the supply side, recovery in major crops from last year, better energy supplies, and broad based increase in Large-scale Manufacturing have facilitated this expansion. With further improvement in economic activity along with pass through of the recovering global oil prices to domestic motor fuel cost, headline CPI inflation has also edged up in recent months. Going forward in FY18, current trends of rising income, surge in imports, and accelerating credit to private sector are expected to increase the CPI inflation; however, it is likely to remain within the target. The upbeat economic sentiments and low interest rates have encouraged the private sector to undertake capacity expansions. Private sector credit posted net expansion of Rs 503 billion during Jul-Apr FY17, which is significantly higher than the uptick of Rs 3 billion in the corresponding period of last year. This was led by an increase in both the working capital and fixed investment loans; whereas, consumer financing also maintained the uptrend seen in the past few months. Notably the credit flow to private businesses remained broad-based with major impetus from textile garments, chemicals, sugar, construction, and power sectors. In tandem with the expansion in the economic activity, private sector credit uptake is expected to continue in FY18. The supply of credit remained at ease because of the healthy growth in bank deposits and government's reliance on central bank financing along with net retirement to commercial banks. Also calibrated open market operations by the SBP to manage residual liquidity demand played its part, besides keeping the overnight repo rate generally close to the policy rate. Reflecting these developments, money supply (M2) grew by 13. percent (YoY) in Apr FY17as compared to 13. percent (YoY) during the same month last year. The expansion in economic activity has led to concomitant surge in import payments during Jul- Apr FY17. On the other hand, exports have posted only marginal recovery; whereas, workers' remittances also slowed down this year mainly owing to the changing labor market dynamics in the GCC region. All these factors led to sharp widening of the current account deficit during Jul-Apr FY17, compared to the same period last year. As the financial inflows did not entirely cover the current account imbalance, the overall balance of payments turned into deficit from surplus in the same period last year. Going forward, official inflows are expected to provide support to foreign exchange reserves. sustained increase in other private inflows foreign direct investments and export earnings in particular is required to fully finance the surge in imports. In this regard, accompanied with expected improvements in global demand, the current composition of imports, mainly machinery, bodes well for the future economic activities. Furthermore the current growth momentum led by CPEC related investments is likely to boost foreign direct investment inflows. Keeping these factors in view, the Monetary Policy Committee of SBP has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at.75 percent. Page."
Egypt,2017-05-21,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release May 21, 2017 In its meeting held on May 21, 2017, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) main operation by 200 basis points to 1675 percent, 1775 percent, and 1725 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also raised by 200 basis points to 1725 percen. Headline inflation registered 169 percent (m/m) in April 2017, recording its third consecutive decline due to fading cost-push pressures after averaging 401 percent (m/m) between November 2016 and January 201. Meanwhile annual headline inflation registered 3146 percen. Monthly inflation during April was mainly driven by volatile and core food items, while non-food items remained broadly unchange. Accordingly core inflation which excludes volatile food items grew by 110 percent (m/m) in April, recording a slight increase after decelerating in February and March from the average 489 percent (m/m) registered between November 2016 and January 201. Nevertheless as monthly core inflation was lower than the respective month of the previous year, the annual rate declined for the second consecutive month to record 3206 percen. While the previous tightening of policy rates and the consistent reduction of short-term excess liquidity have so far successfully managed to contain underlying inflation excluding supply-shocks, as evident in the inflation developments above, the balance of risks surrounding the inflation outlook has tilted more strongly to the upside with recent economic and monetary data releases pointing to strengthening demand-side pressure. Furthermore the MPC envisages risks related to inflation expectations resulting from elevated annual inflation levels despite the continued moderation of monthly rate. Consequently the MPC decided that tightening monetary conditions are warranted in commitment to its price-stability mandat. Information received since the MPC met in March show continued improvement of economic activity and a reduction of unemploymen. Annual real GDP grew by 39 percent in 2016/17 Q3, strengthening from the 38 and 34 percent recorded in the preceding quarters as well as from the 36 percent recorded in 2015/16 Q3. This coincided with the narrowing of the unemployment rate to 120 percent in 2016/17 Q3 from 124 and 126 percent in the preceding quarter. From the monetary perspective, annual broad money growth has been strongly affected by revaluation effects of its foreign currency component. However annual broad money growth has also increased excluding revaluation effects due to the recovery of net foreign assets, evident by the CBE's international reserve accumulation, as well as higher loans to the private sector in domestic currenc. Developments in the external environment show that there has been some firming of international commodity prices primarily due to higher oil prices while food price increases were relatively tam. Meanwhile global inflation and economic growth continue to maintain weak pressures on domestic prices, despite their recent recover. To further anchor inflation expectations, the MPC decided to increase transparency regarding the targeted disinflation path in its regular statements as well as in the quarterly series of the monetary policy report introduced in March 201. In accommodation of first-round effects of supply-shocks, the elevated annual headline inflation rate will be temporarily tolerated before it is targeted to decline to 13% (+/- 3%) by 2018 Q4 and to single-digits thereafte. The MPC believes that this target path is appropriate to minimize undesirable macroeconomic volatilit. Achieving low and stable inflation over the medium-term supports real incomes and sustains achieved competitiveness gains, which represents a challenge according to Egypt's economic histor. Monetary policy tools are utilized to anchor inflation expectations, contain demand-side pressures and second-round effects resulting from supply shocks that may lead to deviations from inflation targets, as well as to achieve reserve money targets that were designed to be consistent with the inflation target. The MPC believes that such a flexible monetary targeting framework is appropriate under the liberalized exchange rate regim. Against this background, the MPC judges that hiking the CBE's key policy rates is consistent with the targeted disinflation path, and reiterates that the objective of its tighter stance is not to offset effects of supply-shocks, rather to contain underlying inflation excluding supply shocks that is affected by inflation expectations and the build-up of demand-side pressure. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic and monetary developments as well as the balance of risks, and will not hesitate to adjust its stance to offset anticipated upside or downside deviations from the inflation targe.

Nigeria,2017-05-23,"CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO 113 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING OF 22nd AND 23rd May 2017 Background The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on the 22nd and 23rd of May, 2017, against the backdrop of slowly improving global growth prospects even as international cooperation continues to be threatened by anti-globalization sentiments in major advanced economies. On the domestic front, the economy has shown greater resilience in the intervening period since the last meeting of the Committee, anchored on more focused macroeconomic policies and improvements in oil prices. While the general economic outlook seems cautiously optimistic for the remainder of fiscal 2017, emerging indicators suggest that economic policy must remain circumspect. In attendance were 8 out of 12 members of the Committee. The MPC assessed the global and domestic economic and 1 financial environments in the first five months of 2017 and the outlook for the rest of the year. External Developments The global economy continued to gather momentum in Q1, 2017, aided by gradual recovery in the emerging markets on the back of a pick-up in global demand and higher commodity prices, coupled with fairly robust domestic demand in the advanced economies. Accordingly global output growth in Q1 2017 is estimated to expand by 28 per cent annualized. In spite of the fairly optimistic global economic outlook, uncertainty surrounding the direction of macroeconomic policy in the advanced economies continues to cloud the prospects of sustained recovery. Global inflation appears to be upward trending on the back of improved commodity prices and depreciated currencies in several emerging markets. Domestic Output Developments Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that the economy contracted marginally by 052 per cent in Q1 2017, a much more positive development since Q1 2016. The data also shows that about eighteen (18) economic activities recorded positive growth in Q1 2017; indicating that the economy was firmly on the path of recovery. The key growth activities were led by quarrying (5254%), metal ores (4079%), road transportation (1235%), water supply and sewage (1263%), fishing (549%), crop production (35%), oil refining 9301%), motion pictures (295%), telecommunication (289%), forestry (259%), amongst others. The Committee noted the positive effects of improved foreign exchange management on the performance of the manufacturing sector and other economic activities. The non-oil sector grew by 072 per cent in Q1 2017, largely reflecting the growth recorded in agriculture and solid minerals, and recovery in manufacturing, construction and services sectors. The Committee urged the fiscal authorities to expeditiously commence the implementation of the recently approved 2017 budget, especially, the capital expenditure portion, in order to sustain the momentum of recovery, engender employment and restore confidence in the Nigerian economy. Developments in Money and Prices The committee noted that money supply (M2) contracted by 848 per cent in April 2017, annualized to a contraction of 2544 per cent in contrast to the provisional growth benchmark of 1029 per cent for 2017. Net Domestic Credit (NDC) grew by 140 per cent in April, 2017, annualized to 421 per cent, which is significantly below the 1793 per cent provisional growth benchmark for 2017. However net credit to government grew by 2408 per cent over end-December 2016, representing an annualized growth of 720 per cent. The Committee was concerned that credit to government continued to outpace the programmed target of 3312 per cent for fiscal 2017, while credit to the private sector declined considerably far below the programmed target of 1488 per cent. Headline inflation (year-on-year) moderated for the third consecutive month, falling to 1724 per cent in April, from 1726 per cent in March, 1778 per cent in February and 1872 per cent in January 2017, effectively reversing the monthly upward momentum since January, 2016. The food index component, however, rose to 1930 per cent in April, 4 from 1844 per cent in March and 1853 per cent in February, 2017. The moderation in headline inflation in April, 2017 thus reflected the decline in the core component to 1480 per cent in April from 1540, 1601, and 1787 per cent, respectively in March. February and January, 2017. Similarly month-on-month inflation moderated to 160 per cent in April from 172 per cent in March, 2017. The Committee attributed these developments in part to the effects of the recent gains in the naira exchange rate, brought about by the Bank's interventions in the foreign exchange market and the resulting downward price adjustments on imported items and their derivatives. Against this background, the Committee emphasized the need to sustain and deepen the Bank's foreign exchange management policies and measures in order to reap the benefits of the pass-through to consumer prices. The MPC recognized the continued influence of structural factors such as high energy and transportation costs, production bottlenecks on prices and hoped that the ongoing reforms by the Government would address some of these constraints. Money market interest rates moved in tandem with the level of liquidity in the banking system. Rates were relatively stable during the review period. The interbank call rate opened at 1140 per cent on March 22, 2017 and closed at 3894 per cent on May 18. The movement in net liquidity position was influenced by sales at the Open Market Operations, foreign exchange interventions, the payment of statutory revenues to States and Local Governments as well as maturing CBN Bills. The MPC noted the bullish trend in the equities segment of the capital market as the All-Share Index (ASI) rose by 1020 per cent from 25,,51634 on March 31, 2017, to 28,,11338 on May 19, 2017. Similarly Market Capitalization (MC) increased by 1010 per cent from N883 to N972 trillion during the same period. Relative to end-December 2016, the capital market indices rose by 460 and 510 per cent, respectively, reflecting growing investor confidence following improvements in foreign exchange supplies reflected in the over US$1 billion injected through the investor window and exchange rate management. Total foreign exchange inflows through the CBN increased by 6 6977 per cent in April, 2017 compared with the previous month. Total outflows, however, rose, but less significantly, at 2935 per cent during the same period. Consequently the Committee observed that the average naira exchange rate remained stable at the inter-bank segment of the foreign exchange market in the review period. Overall Outlook and Risks Available data and various forecasts of key economic variables as well as assessment of government initiatives, including the recently released Federal Government Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP), all point to prospects of recovery in 2017. The Committee expects that the timely implementation of this plan, judicious execution of the approved 2017 Budget and sustenance of the new foreign exchange implementation regime supported by the restoration of security in different parts of the country, especially, in the Niger Delta region, would help accelerate growth and restore confidence in the economy. The MPC however, identified the downside risks to this outlook to include the possibility of low oil prices due to renewed investments in shale oil exploration and production, 7 continuing monetary policy normalization by the US. Fed which may result in strengthening of the US dollar, and consequent capital reversal from Nigeria and other emerging market economies. Also the MPC believes that the inflation outlook does not appear benign as the limit of the base effect driving the current moderation in prices may have been reached. The Considerations of the Committee Notwithstanding the improved outlook for the economy, the Committee weighed the implications of continuing global uncertainties arising from the dwindling commitment to global cooperation, the strengthening of the US. dollar, and the unsteady commodity prices. The Committee similarly evaluated other challenges confronting the domestic economy and the opportunities for achieving economic growth and price stability in 2017. The MPC was of the view that whereas the downward trend in inflation in April 2017 is a welcomed development; the rate was still significantly above the policy reference band. The MPC is particularly pleased with the gradual retreat in inflation, the relative stability in the Naira exchange rate across all segments of the foreign exchange market and the improved prospects of foreign investment inflow. The Committee also welcomes the passage of the 2017 Budget and called on the relevant authorities to ensure its judicious implementation, especially, the capital budget in line with the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan. It however, noted the associated risks to banking system liquidity of the envisaged fiscal injections during the remainder of the year. Against this risk, the Committee contemplated the prospects of further tightening of monetary policy should the need arise. The MPC however, noted that further tightening would widen the income gap, depress aggregate consumption and adversely affect credit to the real sector of the economy. Nevertheless against the backdrop of the rather unclear outlook around key economic activities (food production especially) and some optimism about current deceleration in inflation as well as relative stability in the naira exchange rate, the MPC was reluctant to alter the current policy 9 configuration in any fundamental manner. This is intended to allow the existing policies to fully achieve their intended goals and objectives. On the other hand, the Committee noted that the cost of capital in the economy remains high and not helpful to growth. The MPC was however, concerned that loosening would exacerbate inflationary pressures and worsen the gains so far achieved in the exchange rate of the naira. It was also convinced that loosening would further increase the negative real interest rate as the gap between the nominal interest rate and inflation widens. On the financial stability outlook, the Committee noted that in spite of the banking sector's resilience, the weak macroeconomic environment has continued to exert pressure on the banking system. The MPC urged the CBN to intensify its surveillance, in order to address emerging vulnerabilities. The Committee also called on the DMBs to step up credit to the private sector to support economic recovery and convey a positive feedback to the financial system. The Committee's Decisions In consideration of the challenges weighing down the domestic economy and the uncertainties in the global environment, the Committee decided by a unanimous vote of the 8 members in attendance to retain the MPR at 140 per cent alongside all other policy parameters. One member was absent at the meeting. In summary, the MPC decided to: Retain the MPR at 14 per cent; Retain the CRR at 225 per cent; Retain the Liquidity Ratio at 3000 per cent; and Retain the Asymmetric corridor at +200 and -500 basis points around the MPR Thank you for listening.

Thailand,2017-05-24,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 3/2017 Mr. Jaturong Jantarangs. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 24 May 2017 as follows. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 150 percent. In deliberating their policy decision, the Committee assessed that the Thai economy's growth outlook improved further despite facing risks especially on the external front. Headline inflation softened and might fall below the target in some periods mainly due to supply side factors. Nevertheless it was projected to rise during the latter half of the year. Meanwhile overall financing conditions remained accommodative and conducive to economic growth. Hence the Committee decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at this meeting. Further improvement in the growth outlook was attributed to the continued recovery in merchandise exports as Thailand's trading partner economies gained momentum. In addition, private consumption picked up somewhat supported by improved farm income and consumer confidence. Tourism continued to recover as expected, and public expenditure remained an important growth driver. Meanwhile private investment was projected to slowly recover. However the improved growth outlook was still subjected to risks that warranted close monitoring. These included US economic and foreign trade policies. China's economic structural reforms, and geopolitical risks. Headline inflation turned out softer than expected on account of lower fresh food prices due to this year's higher agricultural output and last year's base effects following the drought. Meanwhile demand-pull inflationary pressure remained low. Nevertheless headline inflation was expected to gradually rise in the latter half of the year, and the public's medium-term inflation expectations remained close to the midpoint of the target. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative and conducive to economic growth with ample liquidity in the financial system and low real interest rates. Meanwhile business financing through both credit and capital markets continued to expand. With regard to exchange rates, movements in the baht over the recent period were in line with regional currencies. The Committee viewed that financial stability remained sound with sufficient cushion against economic and financial volatilities on both domestic and external fronts. However there remained pockets of risks that warranted close monitoring such as the deterioration in debt serviceability of small-and-medium sized enterprises (SMEs) which in part reflected competitiveness issues. Moreover the search-for-yield behavior in the prolonged low interest rate environment continued to warrant monitoring as it could lead to underpricing of risks. Looking ahead, the Thai economy's growth outlook improved further despite uncertainties on the external front. Meanwhile demand-pull inflationary pressures remained low. Thus the Committee viewed that monetary policy should remain accommodative, and would stand ready to utilize available policy tools to sustain economic growth while also ensuring financial stability."
South Korea,2017-05-25,"Base Rate unchanged at 1., 25% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Board considers that the global economic recovery has continued to expand. The global financial markets have shown generally stable movements, with for example the trend of rising stock prices continuing. Looking ahead the Board sees the global economic recovery as likely to be affected by factors such as the directions of the US government's economic policies, the pace of monetary policy normalization by the US Federal Reserve, the movements toward spreading trade protectionism, and political uncertainties in major countries. The Board judges that the trend of domestic economic growth has expanded, as exports and investment have improved although the pace of increase in consumption has remained weak. On the employment front, the number of persons employed has continued to rise significantly year-on-year, although the unemployment rate has also risen as job search activities have increased. Going forward, domestic economic growth is expected to be slightly above the path projected in April. The Board judges that consumption will likely continue its modest trend of growth, but that the trends of improvement in exports and investment should expand compared to the April forecasts. Consumer price inflation has continued at the 2% target level, in line mainly with increases in the prices of petroleum and agricultural, livestock and fisheries products. Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has fallen slightly to the mid-1% range, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has remained at the mid-2% level. Looking ahead the Board expects that consumer price inflation will for the time being fluctuate at around the 2% level, and for the year as a whole not diverge greatly from the April projection (1., 9%). Core inflation appears likely to show a level in the mid- to upper- 1% range. In the domestic financial markets the trend of stability has continued, with stock prices rising and the volatility of long-term market interest rates showing a low level, in reflection of global financial market movements. After having risen, owing in part to the emergence of geopolitical risks, the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has fallen as political uncertainties domestically and abroad have eased. Household lending has sustained its high rate of increase exceeding past years\x80\x99 levels, although the amount of increase has shown signs of lessening, centering around banks. Housing sales prices have exhibited slight upward movements, centering around Seoul and its surrounding areas. Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As the inflationary pressures on the demand side are not expected to be high although the trend of domestic economic growth is likely to expand somewhat, the Board will maintain its stance of monetary policy accommodation. In this process it will closely monitor the progress of monetary policy normalization by the US Federal Reserve, conditions related to trade with major countries, the directions of the new government's economic policies, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks."
Ukraine,2017-05-25,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to cut the key policy rate to 12.5%, effective 26 May 2017. The decision to ease monetary policy is consistent with the pursuit of inflation targets set for 2017-2018 and will help propel the economic growth in Ukraine. As expected, headline inflation slowed to 12.2% yoy in April 2017. The slowdown was primarily due to the waning base effect (natural gas tariffs surged in April 2016, which affected this year's comparison base). In April, actual inflation came in slightly below the projected path of annual headline inflation published by the NBU in the Inflation Report (April 2017), envisaging a slowdown in the annual CPI to 9.1% by the end of 2017. The shortfall can be attributed to weaker-than-expected underlying inflation pressures. Thus, in April, the hryvnia continued to appreciate against U.S. dollar, underpinned by substantial FX revenues from agricultural exports. Also. Ukraine continued to enjoy significant FX revenues from metallurgical exports despite the negative effect of the halted freight traffic across the contact line in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts and the seizure of enterprises in the non-government controlled areas of Ukraine. Meanwhile, households continued to actively sell foreign currency in the cash FX market, with banks' net FX purchases having reached USD 982 million since the start of the year. This allowed banks to maintain the foreign exchange supply in the interbank FX market. In its turn, the NBU, remaining committed to a flexible exchange regime, did not counteract a gradual appreciation of the hryvnia but has been purchasing an excess supply of foreign currency in the interbank market to replenish international reserves. Overall, the NBU's net FX purchases have reached over USD 1 billion since the beginning of the year. The stable situation in the FX market brought about an improvement in inflation expectations. As a result, core inflation remained flat at 6.3% in April, while the NBU had projected it to accelerate slightly. According to the preliminary estimates of the NBU, inflation in annual terms accelerated in May, which was in line with inflation forecast, published in April. This acceleration was primarily driven by a rise in raw food prices and an increase in administered prices and tariffs. In the meantime, consumer demand is gradually gaining momentum, which was also incorporated in the macroeconomic forecast approved at the previous NBU Board meeting on monetary policy. Thus, real wages kept increasing, including due to an increase in the minimum wage from the beginning of the year. As a result, retail trade turnover continues to recover, having increased by 6.1% yoy in April. Overall, economic growth indicators are close to the NBU projections. The slower pace of GDP growth compared to the end of 2016 can be attributed to the halted freight traffic across the contact line in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts and the seizure of enterprises in the non-government controlled areas of Ukraine. These developments brought about a decline in industrial production and adversely affected the wholesale trade and freight transportation performance. The NBU considers that the inflation targets for 2017 and 2018 (8%+/-2 pp and 6%+/-2 pp, respectively) remain within reach. According to the inflation projections published in the Inflation Report last month, inflation is expected to slow to 9.1% by the end of 2017 and to 6.0% by the end of 2018. Slower regulated price inflation and tight monetary and fiscal policies will be the major driving force behind the disinflation. Meanwhile, a gradual recovery in consumer demand and potential supply-side shocks in global food commodity markets will pressure inflation upwards. A weakening of US dollar in global markets that can potentially push up import prices for goods, also adds to inflationary pressures. As before, the NBU expects that the halted freight traffic across the contact line in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts will have no significant impact on the headline inflation. A major risk for the achievement of inflation targets for 2017-2018 arises from a departure from the prudent fiscal policy. In particular, there is a risk that the government will raise social standards and wages to a level higher than that consistent with the meeting of inflation targets. The NBU considers the implementation of a pension reform to be a vital step to ensure sustainable public finances and hence price stability in a long-term perspective. However, over the short-term, a hike in pension payments can push consumer demand up. Consequently, the NBU may be required to adjust its policy to level off short-term repercussions of such an increase on price dynamics. A further progress in structural reforms, especially those specified as Ukraine's commitments under the EFF program with the IMF, is necessary to preserve the macrofinancial stability. Bearing in mind the inflation forecast and the balance of risks pertaining its implementation, the NBU Board has decided to cut its key policy rate to 12.5%. Looking ahead, the NBU may continue easing the monitory policy, provided the mentioned risks will be diminishing in a sustainable manner. The speed and the size of a further key policy rate cut will be conditioned on the assessment of mid-term risks associated with the achievement of inflation targets in 2017, and, more importantly, in 2018. In contrast to 2016 when the key policy rate was cut by 8 p.p., the rate is expected to decrease less markedly in 2017, at the beginning of which the rate was 14% per annum. At this, the easing of monetary policy, when proceeded, can take different forms - both by reducing key policy rate and relaxing administrative restrictions in the FX market. The key policy rate cut to 12.5% has been approved by NBU Board Decision No. 318-D On the Key Policy Rate of 25 May 2017. The next meeting of the NBU Board on monetary policy issues will be held on 6 July 2017 as scheduled."
South Africa,2017-05-25,"South African Reserve Bank PRESS STATEMENT EMBARGO DELIVERY 25 May 2017 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Headline inflation has now returned to within the target range as expected, with outcomes in March and April surprising on the downside. While the inflation outlook has improved over the near term, the longer-term forecast trajectory is unchanged and uncomfortably close to the upper end of the target range. The rand exchange rate and domestic bond yields benefited from increased global capital inflows to emerging markets which largely offset the impact of the sovereign credit ratings downgrade. With further ratings decisions imminent, risks remain for a further depreciation against the backdrop of continued global and domestic political uncertainty. 1 Domestic economic growth prospects have deteriorated, as the impact of the ratings downgrade is expected to weigh on domestic investment and consumer sentiment over the forecast period. The output gap is estimated to have widened, and consumer demand has weakened. However, the trajectory of the growth forecast is still positive, and the growth rate for this year is expected to exceed that recorded in 2016. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas moderated to 6.1% and 5.3% in March and April. Food price inflation was the main contributor to the downside surprise in April when it measured 6.6%. The contribution of the category of food and non-alcoholic beverages to the overall inflation outcome declined from 1.5 percentage points in March to 1.1 percentage points. The Bank's measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity, measured 4.8%, down from 4.9%. Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods also surprised on the downside at 4.6% in April compared with 5.2% in March. The further moderation in food prices was also reflected in the PPI with the category of food products, beverages and tobacco products decelerating for the sixth consecutive month to 6.4%. The inflation forecast of the Bank has improved over the near term, but is unchanged in the outer quarters. In line with the previous forecast, headline consumer price inflation is expected to remain within the range for the rest of the forecast period. Inflation is expected to average 5.7% this year compared with 5.9% previously, while the forecast for 2018 has moderated by 0.1 percentage point to 5.3%. The forecast average for 2019 is unchanged at 5.5%. 2 The improvement is driven by downward revisions to international oil price and domestic electricity tariff assumptions. In the latter case, a tariff increase of 4.0% with effect from July 2017 is assumed, down from 8.0%. These revisions have been offset to some extent by a less appreciated exchange rate assumption, and a slower decline in food price inflation. A continued moderation of food prices is expected over the medium term given the favourable agricultural outlook and significant upward revisions to the maize crop estimates. Food price inflation is expected to average 7.7% and 5.4% in 2017 and 2018, compared with 7.4% and 5.2% previously, and unchanged at 5.5% in 2019. The forecast for core inflation in 2017 is 0.4 percentage points lower at 5.0%, partly due to the lower starting point of 0.2 percentage points following the sizeable downside surprise in March. The forecast for 2018 declined by 0.1 percentage point to 5.1%, and is unchanged at 5.3% in 2019. Market-based inflation expectations are largely unchanged since the previous meeting of the MPC, with the median forecasts in the latest Reuters Econometer survey similar to those of the Bank. The median expectation for 2017 declined marginally to 5.7%, and is unchanged at 5.5% and 5.4% for the next two years. Expectations implicit in the break-even inflation rates in the bond market have also moderated since the previous meeting. Break-even inflation rates for shorter-dated maturities are below 6% but higher than this level for longer-dated maturities. 3 The global growth outlook continues to show signs of sustained recovery amid rising world trade volumes. Nevertheless, the trend growth rate is expected to be lower than that experienced before the global financial crisis. The current recovery is characterised by downward revisions to potential output growth in numerous countries, and generally low levels of productivity and wage growth. Despite a weak first quarter. US growth is expected to average above 2.0% this year, although further policy uncertainty could undermine investor and consumer confidence. Growth rates in the euro area and Japan are expected to be sustained at around 2016 levels, supported by accommodative monetary policies. The outlook for emerging markets is also generally positive. Concerns about Chinese growth have dissipated somewhat following policy intervention, but high leverage in the financial sector remains a risk. While Russia has emerged from recession, the expected recovery in Brazil may be undermined by current political uncertainty. The outlook for commodity producers may be tempered by recent weaker commodity price trends, particularly those of iron ore and coal. Global inflation remains relatively benign although country experiences differ. Inflation is below target in most of the advanced economies, apart from the UK, and the risk of deflation is low except in Japan. Where high inflation rates are being experienced in a number of emerging markets, these are generally driven by exchange rate shocks rather than underlying global price pressures. 4 Monetary policies are also likely to remain divergent. The US Fed is expected to maintain its moderate pace of tightening, dependent to some degree on the size and nature of possible fiscal reforms. Policy rates are expected to remain low in most other advanced economies, but a reduction in quantitative easing is possible in the near future in the euro area. In general, emerging market economies have displayed a loosening bias, particularly in those countries where previous policy tightening had resulted in improved inflation prospects. The high yield differentials of emerging markets have persisted, sustaining capital flows to these economies. At the time of the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand was trading at around R13.00 against the US dollar. It then depreciated following the domestic cabinet reshuffle and the consequent sovereign credit ratings downgrades by two ratings agencies. Having reached a weak point of almost R14.00 against the US dollar in April, the rand subsequently recovered some of these losses in line with improved sentiment towards emerging markets in general. Some of these gains were reversed by spill-over effects of recent political uncertainty in Brazil. Since the previous meeting the rand has appreciated by 0.4% against the US dollar and depreciated by 1.6% on a trade-weighted basis. At current levels the rand is still more appreciated relative to rates prevailing at this time last year. Despite the recent weakening, the rand has been supported by a more favourable current account outlook, following a significant narrowing of the deficit in the final quarter of last year. A further positive trade balance was recorded in the first quarter of this year, but a moderately wider current account deficit is expected over the forecast period, due in part to a recent deterioration in the terms of trade. 5 Non-residents remained net buyers of domestic government bonds in April and May to date, to the value of R23.2 billion, despite the recent ratings downgrades. This may change should further downgrades occur, particularly with respect to domestic currency ratings. The rand therefore remains vulnerable to this prospect, as well as to changes in global risk sentiment towards emerging markets. The domestic growth outlook has deteriorated amid weak business and consumer confidence. The Bank's forecast for GDP growth has been revised down for the entire forecast period, by 0.2 percentage points for 2017 and 2018, and by 0.3 percentage points in 2019. Annual growth rates of 1.0%, 1.5% and 1.7% for the forecast years are now expected. This downward revision is due in part to the expected impact of the sovereign credit ratings downgrade on domestic private sector gross fixed capital formation in particular. The downgrade is also likely to weigh on public sector investment through higher funding costs and more difficult access to funding. At the sectoral level, a strong near-term improvement is expected in the agricultural sector, and mining output has also rebounded. By contrast, the manufacturing sector outlook remains constrained, with a third consecutive quarterly contraction expected in the first quarter of this year. In line with this, the latest ABSA Purchasing Managers Index showed a sharp decline. Growth in the trade sector also appears to have moderated somewhat. 6 A slower but positive pace of household consumption expenditure growth is forecast for this year. Real retail and wholesale trade sales contracted in the first quarter of this year. While domestic sales of passenger motor vehicles improved, the outlook for the sector remains subdued. Factors such as low consumer confidence, higher tax burdens, the absence of significant wealth effects and stagnant employment growth have contributed to these weaker consumption trends. In addition to these factors, credit extension to the household sector in particular remains weak, and is reflected in further household deleveraging. Although credit extension to the corporate sector is still relatively robust, the downward growth trend has persisted. There may, however, be some relief to consumers from moderating inflation, while increases in real disposable income over the forecast period are also expected to provide some support to consumption, but to a lesser extent than previously. Nominal salary and wage increases have continued to show signs of moderation, but are still at levels that contribute to the persistence of inflation at higher levels. While continued moderation of nominal unit labour costs are expected over most of the forecast period, the trajectory has been revised slightly upwards largely due to the weaker economic growth projections. International oil prices have firmed since the previous meeting, having declined to levels below US$50 per barrel at one stage. The recovery was a response to indications that the OPEC agreement to curtail output would be extended for a further six months. However, the fragility of this agreement, and the increase in shale 7. However, the fragility of this agreement, and the increase in shale 7 production in the US is expected to cap increases going forward. The international oil price assumption has been revised down by US$2 per barrel for each forecast year, but the moderate upward trend has been maintained. Domestic petrol prices increased by around 50 cents per litre in May, due to the weaker exchange rate and higher international product prices. The current over-recovery on the petrol price indicates that a reduction of around 20 cents per litre is likely in June, mainly due to international price movements. The short-term inflation outlook has improved further since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee. Headline inflation in April was lower than expected, largely related to the pace of food disinflation. The MPC notes, however, that there have been broad-based downside surprises in core inflation as well. The current forecast does not incorporate the most recent outcomes, and further downside surprises in the coming months could impact of the starting point of the forecast and lower the entire trajectory. However, in the absence of such revisions, the MPC remains concerned about the persistence of the longer-term forecast trend at elevated levels within the target. This gives very little headroom to absorb the impact of possible adverse shocks. The rand remains a key upside risk to the forecast. The rand has, however, been surprisingly resilient in the face of recent domestic developments. This is partly due to offsetting factors, particularly positive sentiment towards emerging markets and the improved current account balance. The current level of the exchange rate, at below R13.00 against the dollar, is slightly stronger than at the time of the last 8. The current level of the exchange rate, at below R13.00 against the dollar, is slightly stronger than at the time of the last 8 meeting and stronger than that implicit in the starting point for the real exchange rate assumption. The outlook for the rand, and therefore the risks to the inflation outlook, will be highly sensitive to unfolding domestic political uncertainty, as well as decisions by the credit ratings agencies. The rand could weaken significantly in the event of a worst-case ratings downgrade scenario that could result in South African government bonds falling out of the global bond indices. A downside risk may come from electricity tariffs. The increases from July may be lower than the 4.0% now assumed, given the 1.8% guideline for municipalities published by Nersa. However, there is a great deal of uncertainty with regard to this assumption for next year, when a new application from Eskom is likely. Currently an 8.0% increase is assumed from July next year. The MPC assesses the risks to the inflation outlook to be more or less balanced. Domestic demand pressures remain subdued, and, given the continued negative consumer and business sentiment, the risks to the growth outlook are assessed to be on the downside. In light of these developments the MPC has decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 7.0% per annum. Five members preferred an unchanged stance while one member preferred a 25 basis point reduction. 9 The MPC remains of the view that the current level of the repo rate is appropriate for now and that we are likely at the end of the tightening cycle. A reduction in rates would be possible should inflation continue to surprise on the downside and the forecast over the policy horizon be sustainably within the target range. However, in the current environment of high levels of uncertainty, the risks to the outlook could easily deteriorate, and derail the current favourable assessment.

Colombia,2017-05-26,"Pgina relacionada. Minutes of the Meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica on Friday. May 26, 2017. The Board of Directors of. (BDR) at today=C2=B4s meeting decided to cut the policy interest rate by 25 bp to a level of 6.25%. For this decision, the Board considered the following. In April, the YOY inflation was 4.66% and the average of the core inflation indicators was 5.52%, both figures similar to the March numbers. Market analyst=C2=B4s inflation expectations for December 2017 and 2018 are 4.45% and 3.57%, respectively. Those implicit in the public debt market registered minor changes and for 2018 are slightly above 3.0%. The effects of the strong temporary supply shocks that deviated inflation from its target continue to fade, as shown, for instance, by the deceleration in food CPI. The average of the core inflation indicators continued falling slowly, impacted by the indexation of prices and wages and by the increase in indirect taxes. Growth of our major trade partners is expected to be somewhat stronger than the one registered in 2016. However, so far this year, uncertainty on the evolution of external demand and commodity prices has increased. In Colombia, economic growth for the first quarter of 2017 was low (1.1%), and somewhat below the forecast of the technical staff of BdR (1.3%). Economic activity indicators so far would suggest a slow dynamics for the second quarter. With this information in hand, the Board weighed the following elements in its decision. An incremental weakness in economic activity and the risk of a deceleration beyond that compatible with the reduction in income that resulted from the oil price shock. Recent figures suggest a larger risk of an increase in excess capacity, though its size is still largely unknown. Uncertainty on the speed of convergence of inflation to its 3.0% target. Inflation remained unchanged and close to the expectations of the technical staff of BdR. Indexation mechanisms and the increase in the persistence of inflation remain present in the evolution of core inflation indicators, and could extend the period of convergence of inflation to its 3.0% target. The current level of the real ex ante policy interest rate is contractionary. In this environment, there was consensus among the Board on the convenience of continuing to reduce the policy interest rate. The decision of cutting this rate by 25 bp was approved by 4 of the Board members. The remaining 3 voted for a 50 bp cut."
Israel,2017-05-29,"C 2B 7 NationalAccounts data for the first quarter (net of the volatility in vehicle imports) and indicatorsof second quarter activity show that the economy continues to grow at a solid pace, with a decline in private consumption's contribution to growth and an increase in the contribution of exports and investment. The labor market continues to convey a very positive picture and is near full employment. C 2B 7 Global activity and world trade continue to improve gradually, and according to forecasts, the improvement is expected to continue. The political risk in Europe declined significantly. The interest rate in the US is expected to be increased in June, while in Europe and Japan the accommodative policy continues. C 2B 7 In recentweeks, the shekel weakened against the euro and strengthened against the dollar. The effective exchange rate remains stable at an appreciated level. C 2B 7Housing market indicators continue to point to a cooling of the market, and stability in home prices is apparent over the past few months. The Monetary Committee intends to maintain the accommodative policy as long as necessaryin order to entrench the inflation environment within the target range. The Bank of Israel continues to monitor developments in inflation, the real economy,the financial markets, and the global economy, and will act to attain the monetary policy targets in accordance with such developments. Inflation in the 12 months ending in April was 0.7 percent. The annual inflation rate and one-year inflation expectations increased in recent months, though they are still lower than the target range (Figures 1 and 4 in the data file). The increase in nominal wages and strong economic activity, particularly as a result of domestic demand, are reflected in increases in the prices of nontradableitems, while inflation in tradable goods remains negative (Figure 3), due to a large extent to the continued appreciation of the shekel, and despite energy prices and global inflation acting to increase it. Since March, there has been an increase apparent in inflation expectations for all terms, against the background of an increase in actual inflation and continued accommodative monetary policy. The increasing competition in the economy, as well as additional policy measures announced by the government (reducing purchase tax and customs on various products and lowering the cost of afterschool care),may continue to slow the return of inflation to the target range. The volatility in vehicle purchases had an atypical effect on National Accounts data in the fourth quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017. However, net of this effect, the economy has been growing strongly for approximately a year and a half, and the pace may even be higher than the long-term growth potential. In the first quarter, the improvement in growth of exports continued, against the background of the expansion of world trade. Private consumption, which drove growth in 2016, continues to grow (net of vehicle purchases) but at rates that arenot exceptional. Excluding the data on goods exports, the initial indicators ofsecond quarter economic activity, such as data on tax revenues and the Composite State of the Economy Index, suggest that the strong growth is continuing in the quarter. Labor market indicators continue to point to its robustness: the unemployment rate is at an historic low, the employment rate is at a record high, and in the past year the improvement in these indicators was sharper among those with lower levels of schooling (Figure 13). The pace of wage increases has accelerated (Figure 14), and the number of work hours per employee has increased. For the past few months, housing market data have indicated moderation in demand for homes, reflected in a decline in transaction volume among all types of purchasers, a declinein the pace of new home sales, and continued decline in the flow of new mortgages taken out. There are a number of factors to which this moderation in demandmay be attributed, including various policy measures adopted by the government and the increase in mortgage interest rates since mid-2015. In recent months, interest rates on mortgages have stabilized (Figure 8). The moderation in demand alongside the continued increase in supply have led to the apparent stability in home prices. Global economic activity and world trade continue to improve gradually (Figure 17). The IMF and investment houses forecast that the improvement will continue, and sentiment indices are high. The weakness in first quarter growth in the US derives partially from transitory and seasonal factors, and most of the data indicate improvement in the second quarter. Despite some moderation in inflation, assessments are that the Federal Reserve will raise the federal funds rate at its next meeting. The new administration's economic policy remains a source of uncertainty. In Europe, the results of France's presidential elections markedly lowered the risk to the continued existence of the eurozone, and the economy continued to improve. Growth in the past two quarters was relatively high, the unemployment rate continues to decline, but inflation is still below targetand the ECB is continuing its accommodative policy. In Japan as well, growth data are relatively strong, but inflation remains low and accommodative policy continues. In emerging markets, in general, the positive trend continues. The modest moderation in China is mainly a result of policy measures intended to tighten financial conditions. Energy prices were volatile, while the index of prices of commodities excluding energy was relatively stable. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on June 12, 2017. Thenext decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Monday. July 10, 2017, following which the Governor will hold a press briefing. For the complete file of data accompanying this notice,click here."
Brazil,2017-05-31,"The Copom unanimously decided to reduce the Selic rate by one percentage point, to 10.25 percent per year, without bias. The following observations provide an update of the Copoms baseline scenario:. The set of indicators of economic activity released since the last Copom meeting remains consistent with stabilization of the Brazilian economy in the short run and a gradual recovery during the course of the year. If sustained over a long period, high levels of uncertainty regarding the evolution of reforms and adjustments in the economy can have detrimental effects on economic activity. Stronger global economic activity has so far mitigated the effects on the Brazilian economy of possible changes of economic policy in central economies. Inflation developments remain favorable. Disinflation is widespread and includes IPCA components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy. It is necessary to monitor possible impacts of higher uncertainty on the prospective path of inflation. Inflation expectations for 2017 collected by the Focus survey fell to around 4.0%. Expectations for 2018 are around 4.4%, and expectations for 2019 and longer horizons are around 4.25%; and. The Committee views the heightened uncertainty regarding the speed of the process of reforms and adjustments in the Brazilian economy as the main risk factor. This arises from both a higher probability of scenarios that may hinder this process, and the difficulty in assessing the effects of these scenarios on the determinants of inflation. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the wide array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to reduce the Selic rate by one percentage point, to 10.25 percent per year, without bias. The Committee judges that convergence of inflation to the 4.5% target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, which includes 2017 and, to a greater extent, 2018, is compatible with the monetary easing process. The Copom emphasizes that the extension of the monetary easing cycle will depend, among other factors, on estimates of the structural interest rate of the Brazilian economy. The Committee judges that the recent increase in the uncertainty regarding the evolution of reforms and adjustments in the economy hampers a more timely reduction of estimates of the structural interest rate, and makes them more uncertain. The Committee will continue to reassess these estimates over time. In light of the basic scenario and current balance of risks, the Copom judges that a moderate reduction of the pace of monetary easing relative to the pace adopted today is likely to be appropriate at its next meeting. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Ilan Goldfajn (Governor). Anthero de Moraes Meirelles. Carlos Viana de Carvalho. Isaac Sidney Menezes Ferreira. Luiz Edson Feltrim. Otavio Ribeiro Damaso. Reinaldo Le Grazie. Sidnei Corr=AAa Marques, and Tiago Couto Berriel."
Kazakhstan,2017-06-05,"Press-Release – 16 The base rate reduced to 10.5% June 5, 2017 Almaty The National Bank of Republic of Kazakhstan has decided to reduce the base rate to 10.5% with a corridor of +/-1%. The annual inflation sustainably remains within the target range, the inflation expectations of households stay moderate, and the signs of recovery of the economic activity are being observed. Considering the arising monetary conditions and in the absence of the shocks, the inflation will remain within the target range in 2017 and 2018. The risks of the inflationary pressure in case of very fast recovery of economy and aggregate demand are not considered as significant. In case of the realization of the basic scenario of economic development (the oil price  50 US dollars per barrel), and also in the absence of the negative shocks and should the actual inflation is in the line with the forecasted parameters, the possibility of the further cut of the base rate within the 12-month horizon is not ruled out. The NBK will maintain the real base rate on the level which is associated with the long-run potential rate of the economic growth. However, the assessment of the less favorable to the economy of Kazakhstan scenario suggests more conservative approach with respect to the base rate. The decision on the base rate was made with the account of the following factors. The annual inflation rate on the level of 7.5% in May 2017, was within the target range and completely corresponds to the estimates of the National Bank. The shock of supply for certain types of food products which was observed over the past few months, in particular for vegetables and meat, is partially offset by the decline in the FAO index for the third consecutive month, without causing significant changes in food inflation. The expected seasonal growth in the domestic supply of food products, according to estimates, will contribute to a further slowdown in annual inflation till the end of the third quarter of 2017. Herewith, due to the low base of the 4th quarter of 2016, a slight short-term increase in annual inflation may be possible by the end of this year. The National Bank does not consider necessary to tighten monetary conditions in response to a deliberately limited increase in inflation associated with an increase in costs on the supply side and not directly dependent on lending conditions from the demand side. Households' expectations on future level of inflation remain practically unchanged, individual fluctuations are not significant and do not affect the overall trend. The quantitative assessment of the expected inflation for the year ahead (6.1%) was fixed below the level of the actual inflation, which indicates its gradual convergence to the target range set for 2018. Due to the stable expectations of the population and professional participants of the FX market on preservation the tenge exchange rate at the current level, currency preferences of depositors continue to change. In May, according to preliminary data, the excess of the share of tenge deposits over the foreign currency deposits that was achieved in March 2017 is preserved. Business activity in the economy demonstrates significant revival, without exerting pro- inflationary pressure. Short-term economic indicator for the basic sectors of the economy is in the growth zone. It has reached the maximum value for the last 3 years - 107.1% in April 2017. The results of the households' survey on the economic prospects confirm the observed trend and indicate the presence of positive expectations of economic agents. A gradual recovery of growth in the consumer demand is observed. In January-March, real incomes of the population grew by 2.4%, which is mainly explained by an increase in budget expenditures for social payments. External conditions supported the growth of the Kazakhstan's economy. In May world oil prices were in the range of 48-54 US dollars per barrel showing a slight increase for most of the month. Monetary conditions after the base rate cut are eased from moderately tight to neutral. In addition to the undervalued (weak) real exchange rate of the tenge, which supports price competitiveness of Kazakhstan's producers, the real interest rate is decreasing (i.e., the nominal rate adjusted for the targeted inflation rate - 6-8% for 2017 and 5-7% for 2018), which will encourage the demand for credit resources of banks. However, despite the excess liquidity, the limited bank capital is a more significant factor that restraining the supply of credit, than the cost of funding. The next decision on the base rate will be announced on July 5, 2017 at 17:00 Astana time. For more detailed information please contact: +7 (727) 2704 585 e-mail: press@nationalbank.kz."
India,2017-06-07,"Second Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2017-18 Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). Reserve Bank of India On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation at its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 6.25 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains at 6.0 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 6.50 per cent. The decision of the MPC is consistent with a neutral stance of monetary policy in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Assessment 2. Since the April 2017 meeting of the MPC, global economic activity has expanded at a modest pace, supported by firming growth in major advanced economies (AEs) and in some emerging market economies (EMEs) as well. In the US, a tightening labour market is generating wage gains. Alongside, industrial production has steadily improved in recent months and retail sales remain robust, although home sales ebbed in April. Political risks remain high, however. In the Euro area, the recovery has been underpinned by consistently falling unemployment, rising retail sales and a brighter outlook for manufacturing reflected in purchasing managers' and business surveys. In Japan, exports supported by a depreciated yen and industrial activity are driving an acceleration in growth. Wages and inflation, however, are depressed and holding back domestic demand. Among EMEs, the Chinese economy is stabilising, especially in manufacturing, but financial risks in the form of the credit-fuelled debt overhang could impinge on the outlook. Brazil appears to be emerging out of recession, although growth dynamics remain fragile due to worsening labour market conditions and political turmoil. In Russia, the strengthening global environment is supporting the recovery with 12 of 2017, buoyed by strengthening global demand as reflected in rising international air freight and container throughput. Crude prices fell to a five-month low in early May on higher output from Canada and the US, and remain soft, undermining the OPEC's recent efforts to tighten the market by trimming supply. Among non-fuel commodity prices, metal prices have been retreating on expectations of weak demand from China. Bullion prices remain range-bound, while food prices eased in April but rose in May. These developments suggest that the inflation outlook is still relatively benign for AEs and EMEs alike. International financial markets have been lifted by improving global growth prospects, broadly accommodative monetary policy stances of systemic central banks and generally positive incoming data. Increasingly, financial markets have shown resilience to geo-political events and have swiftly priced them in. This has been reflected in the reinvigoration of the reach for returns. Country-specific factors have modulated investor sentiment. Equity markets in most AEs have gained in Q2, surpassing past peaks in the US; boosted by corporate profits in Japan; and supported by easing political tensions and upbeat data in the case of the Euro area. In EMEs, equities have turned in a mixed performance, with high valuations across Asia, but weaker in Latin America on softer commodity prices. Bond yields in major AEs have been largely range-bound. In EMEs, yields have hardened in the few countries facing inflation pressures and political uncertainties, but for commodity exporters, there has been some recent decline. In the currency markets, the US dollar has weakened in May after dovish guidance by the Fed and unexpected political events. Since mid-May, the yen has shed its depreciating bias and appears to have gained safe haven appeal. EME currencies, which had depreciated on the strength of the US dollar, have steadied more recently on renewal of capital flows and risk-on investor appetite. On May 31, 2017 India's Central Statistics Office (CSO) released quarterly estimates of national income accounts for Q4 of 2016-17, provisional estimates for 2016-17 and revisions for the preceding five years. The growth of real gross value added (GVA) for 2016-17 has been pegged at 6.6 per cent, 0.1 percentage point lower than the second advance estimates released in February 2017. Underlying the revision is a downward adjustment in services sector growth in Q4 for the constituents of construction, financial and professional services, and real estate. Estimates of agriculture and allied activities have been upgraded to incorporate the all-time high production of foodgrains and horticulture in the year. GVA in industry has also been placed higher in the provisional estimates relative to the earlier reading to reflect the impact of new indices of industrial production (IIP) and wholesale prices (WPI) rebased to 2011-12. The new data reveal that a slowdown in activity in both industry and services set in as early as Q1 of 2016-17 and became pronounced in Q4. Moreover, the deceleration of activity coursing through the year has had underlying drivers that have been in operation since Q2. Components of aggregate demand reflect a contraction in gross fixed investment in Q4, reversing the turnaround evident in the second half of the year in the advance estimates. This is also reflected in the contraction in the production 23 million tonnes. The MoA also set out its second advance estimates of fruits and vegetables on May 30, which was also a historical record. Benefiting from the bumper harvest, rabi procurement during Q1 of 2017-18 so far has been significantly higher than a year ago, replenishing food stocks and taking them to 61.9 million tonnes in May 2017, three times the buffer norm. On June 6, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) re-affirmed its forecast of a normal and well-distributed south-west (June-September) monsoon, which augurs well for the agricultural outlook. The new series on the IIP released by the CSO on May 12 improves the coverage of industrial activity, realigns weights and reclassifies sub-sectors to better capture the underlying structural dynamics of the sector, and smoothens the impact of lumpy items on the index. As a result, industrial production expanded by 5.0 per cent during 2016-17 based on the new series (as against 0.7 per cent in the old series). Turning to the current financial year, the output of eight core industries decelerated sharply in April on account of contraction in coal, crude oil and cement due to structural constraints and low demand. Furthermore, electricity generation decelerated due to depressed demand pricing out relatively expensive thermal output. By contrast, the production of steel and fertiliser picked up, the former driven up by exports and the latter by expectations of a normal monsoon. The business expectations index generated by the Reserve Bank's April round of the Industrial Outlook Survey reflects optimism in the manufacturing sector in Q2 of 2017-18, driven by expectations of rising rural demand, exports and profit margins. On the other hand, the manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) moderated sequentially in May as employment contracted and new orders, both domestic and exports, slowed down. The index, however, remained in the expansion zone and the future output index accelerated for the third month in succession. High frequency real indicators of activity in the services sector point to a mixed performance in April. In the transportation sub-sector, freight carriage by air and rail gathered momentum, and passenger car sales accelerated on the back of sustained strength of urban demand. Sales of commercial vehicles and three-wheelers contracted, however, reflecting in part the effects of new emission norms and technology changes. Two-wheeler sales remained depressed, indicative of still subdued rural demand. In the communication sub-sector, there was a strong growth in the subscriber base of voice and data services. The sustained growth of foreign tourist arrivals and air passenger traffic, both domestic and international, supported activity in the hotels, restaurants and the hospitality sub-sector. Both steel consumption and cement production were, however, sluggish, pointing to continuing weakness in construction activity. The services PMI for May rose to its highest reading since November 2016, with an expansion in new business reflecting improving underlying demand conditions, alongside optimism on employment. The delayed and cumulative downward adjustment of domestic petrol and diesel prices in April to the softening of international crude prices in preceding months was among the factors at work. Inflation in respect of services embedded in transport and communication, education, recreation and health also moderated. The industrial outlook survey and the PMIs for manufacturing and services indicate that pricing power remains weak. Even as surplus liquidity in the banking system post-demonetisation was drained by the ramping up of new currency in circulation by 1.5 trillion in April and May, massive spending by the Government re-injected liquidity into the system, raising the daily average overall surplus liquidity in the banking system to 4.2 trillion in April and 3.5 trillion in May. Unwinding of the excess reserves that banks used to dress up balance sheets for end-March also resulted in an accretion of 0.8 trillion to the surplus liquidity. Absorption operations undertaken by the Reserve Bank in the context of these developments and the consequent downward pressure on money market rates consisted of 1 trillion impounded through issuance of treasury bills (TBs) of tenors ranging from 312 days to 329 days under the market stabilisation scheme (MSS), auctions of cash management bills (CMBs) of 0.7 trillion triggered by the decline in cash balances of the Government, and variable rate reverse repo auctions of different tenors which took in the remaining surplus liquidity averaging 3.8 trillion in April and 3.4 trillion in May. With the narrowing of the the LAF corridor from +/- 50 bps to +/- 25 bps in April 2017, these operations ensured that the weighted average call money rate (WACR) â€“ the operating target of monetary policyâ€“ broadly traded within the corridor. The spread between the WACR and the policy repo rate narrowed from 29-32 basis points (bps) in March-April to 21 bps in May. 45 per cent in the first half of the year and 3.5-4.5 per cent in the second half (Chart 1). Risks are evenly balanced, although the spatial and temporal distribution of the monsoon and the government staying the course in effective food management will play a critical role in the evolution of risks. The risk of fiscal slippages, which, by and large, can entail inflationary spillovers, has risen with the announcements of large farm loan waivers. At the current juncture, global political and financial risks materialising into imported inflation and the disbursement of allowances under the 7th central pay commission's award are upside risks. The date of implementation of the latter is still not announced and as such, it is not factored into the baseline projections. The implementation of the GST is not expected to have a material impact on overall inflation. 56-17, the projection of real GVA growth for 2017-18 has accordingly been revised 10 bps downwards from the April 2017 projection to 7.3 per cent, with risks evenly balanced (Chart 2). The continuing remonetisation should enable a pick-up in discretionary consumer spending, especially in cash-intensive segments of the economy. Furthermore, the reductions in banks' lending rates post-demonetisation should support both consumption and investment demand of households and stress-free corporates. Moreover. Government spending continues to be robust, cushioning the impact of a slowdown in other constituents. The implementation of proposals in the Union Budget should crowd in private investment as the business environment improves with structural reforms, including the GST, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, and the abolition of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board. Strengthening external demand will likely play a more decisive role in supporting the domestic economy. In addition, the new IIP broadens the recognition of industrial activity. On the downside, global political risks remain elevated and could materialise. Second, rising input costs and wage pressures may prove a drag on the profitability of firms, pulling down overall GVA growth. Third, the twin balance sheet problem - over- leveraged corporate sector and stressed banking sector - may delay the revival in private investment demand. The MPC noted that incoming data suggest that the transitory effects of demonetisation have lingered on in price formations relating to salient food items, entangled with excess supply conditions with respect to fruits and vegetables, pulses and cereals. At the same time, however, the CSO's latest releases on national income accounts and industrial production attest to the effects of demonetisation on the broader economy being sector specific and transient, as well as to the noteworthy resilience of private consumption. At this stage, it is difficult to isolate these factors or to judge the 67. Noting that inflation has fallen below 4 per cent only since November 2016, the MPC remains focused on its commitment to keeping headline inflation close to 4 per cent on a durable basis keeping in mind the output gap. The current state of the economy underscores the need to revive private investment, restore banking sector health and remove infrastructural bottlenecks. Monetary policy can play a more effective role only when these factors are in place. Premature action at this stage risks disruptive policy reversals later and the loss of credibility. Accordingly, the MPC decided to keep the policy rate unchanged with a neutral stance and remain watchful of incoming data. The Reserve Bank will continue to work in partnership with the government to address the stress in banks' balance sheets. Better alignment of administered interest rates on small savings with market rates and stepped-up recapitalisation of banks to facilitate adequate flow of credit to productive sectors are important steps to follow through. Five members were in favour of the monetary policy decision, while Dr.Ravindra H. Dholakia was not in favour. The minutes of the MPC's meeting will be published by June 21, 2017. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled on August 1 and 2, 2017. Jose J. Kattoor Press Release : 2016-2017/3304 Chief General Manager 7."
Poland,2017-06-07,"Warsaw, 7 June 2017 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 6-7 June 2017 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: ï‚§ reference rate at 1.50%; ï‚§ lombard rate at 2.50%; ï‚§ deposit rate at 0.50%; ï‚§ rediscount rate at 1.75%. Signs of improvement in the global economy are strengthening, particularly in industry and international trade. In the euro area, data indicate ongoing recovery. In the United States, economic growth declined in 2017 Q1, yet due to temporary factors. In China, after a rise in GDP growth in 2017 Q1, current data do not indicate a sustained acceleration in economic activity. Despite ongoing global recovery, inflation abroad has stabilised at a moderate level, on the back of fading effects of an earlier increase in commodity prices, including oil prices, alongside low domestic inflationary pressure in many countries. The European Central Bank keeps interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero. The ECB also continues its asset purchase programme. The US Federal Reserve gradually tightens its monetary policy, signalling further increases in interest rates. In Poland. GDP data indicate that economic growth accelerated in 2017 Q1. Growth was still driven primarily by increasing consumer demand, supported by rising employment and wages, very good consumer sentiment and disbursement of benefits. This was accompanied by near-zero investment growth rate. At the same time, exports and imports continued to rise at a strong pace. Leading economic indicators as well as output and sales data, despite slight weakening in the recent period, point to stable economic growth in 2017 Q2. The annual growth in prices of consumer goods and services remains at a moderate level, while core inflation, though gradually increasing, is still low. Growth in unit labour costs also remains moderate. In the Council's opinion, in the following quarters inflation will remain moderate amid fading effects of the past increase in global commodity prices, with only a gradual rise in domestic inflationary pressure stemming from improving domestic economic conditions. In consequence, the risk of inflation running persistently above the target in the medium term is limited. The Council confirms its assessment that, given the available data and forecasts, the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on the sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic balance."
Euroarea,2017-06-08,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. I would like to thank Governor Hansson for his kind hospitality and express our special gratitude to his staff for the excellent organisation of today's meeting of the Governing Council. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We expect them to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases. Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, we confirm that our net asset purchases, at the current monthly pace of â‚¬60 billion, are intended to run until the end of December 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. The net purchases will be made alongside reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme. Our monetary policy measures have continued to preserve the very favourable financing conditions that are necessary to secure a sustained convergence of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The information that has become available since our last monetary policy meeting in late April confirms a stronger momentum in the euro area economy, which is projected to expand at a somewhat faster pace than previously expected. We consider that the risks to the growth outlook are now broadly balanced. At the same time, the economic expansion has yet to translate into stronger inflation dynamics. So far, measures of underlying inflation continue to remain subdued. Therefore, a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation is still needed for underlying inflation pressures to build up and support headline inflation in the medium term. If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, we stand ready to increase our asset purchase programme in terms of size and/or duration. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro area real GDP increased by 0.6%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter of 2017, after 0.5% in the last quarter of 2016. Incoming data, notably survey results, continue to point to solid, broad-based growth in the period ahead. The pass-through of our monetary policy measures has facilitated the deleveraging process and should continue to support domestic demand. In particular, the recovery in investment continues to benefit from very favourable financing conditions and improvements in corporate profitability. Employment gains, which are also benefiting from past labour market reforms, are supporting real disposable income and private consumption. Moreover, the global recovery is increasingly supporting trade and euro area exports. However, economic growth prospects continue to be dampened by a sluggish pace of implementation of structural reforms, in particular in product markets, and by remaining balance sheet adjustment needs in a number of sectors, notwithstanding ongoing improvements. This assessment is broadly reflected in the June 2017 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, finalised in late May, which are conditional on the full implementation of all our monetary policy measures. These projections foresee annual real GDP increasing by 1.9% in 2017, by 1.8% in 2018 and by 1.7% in 2019. Compared with the March 2017 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real GDP growth has been revised upwards over the projection horizon. The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook are considered to be broadly balanced. On the one hand, the current positive cyclical momentum increases the chances of a stronger than expected economic upswing. On the other hand, downside risks relating to predominantly global factors continue to exist. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.4% in May, following 1.9% in April and 1.5% in March. As expected, the recent volatility in inflation rates was mainly due to energy prices and temporary increases in services prices over the Easter period. Looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to remain around current levels in the coming months. At the same time, measures of underlying inflation remain low and have yet to show convincing signs of a pick-up, as unutilised resources are still weighing on domestic price and wage formation. Underlying inflation is expected to rise only gradually over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the continuing economic expansion and the corresponding gradual absorption of economic slack. This assessment is also broadly reflected in the June 2017 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation at 1.5% in 2017, 1.3% in 2018 and 1.6% in 2019. By comparison with the March 2017 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for headline HICP inflation has been revised downwards, mainly reflecting lower oil prices. Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) continues to expand at a robust pace, with an annual rate of growth of 4.9% in April 2017, after 5.3% in March. As in previous months, annual growth in M3 was mainly supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate M1 expanding at an annual rate of 9.2% in April 2017, after 9.1% in March. The recovery in loan growth to the private sector observed since the beginning of 2014 is proceeding. The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations increased to 2.4% in April 2017, from 2.3% in the previous month, while the annual growth rate of loans to households remained stable at 2.4% in April. The pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014 continues to significantly support borrowing conditions for firms and households, access to financing, notably for small and medium-sized enterprises, and, hence, credit flows across the euro area. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed the need for a continued very substantial degree of monetary accommodation to secure a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2%. In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute much more decisively to strengthening economic growth. The implementation of structural reforms needs to be substantially stepped up to increase resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost productivity and potential output growth. Regarding fiscal policies, all countries would benefit from intensifying efforts towards achieving a more growth-friendly composition of public finances. A full, transparent and consistent implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact and of the macroeconomic imbalances procedure over time and across countries remains essential to bolster the resilience of the euro area economy."
Peru,2017-06-08,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JUNE 2017 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 4.0% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 4.0 percent. Tby 25 basis points to 4.25 percent. This decision takes into account the following factors: The supply shocks that affected inflation in the first quarter continued to reverse in May, as a result of which inflation has come closer to the upper band of the inflation target range; Expectations of inflation in 12 months have returned to the target range; The pace of growth of domestic economic activity continues to be below its potential growth level. Economic activity is expected to recover in the following quarters as a result of increased government spending and due to the effect of the higher export prices observed so far this year, and The world economy continues to show a gradual recovery, although there is still some uncertainty about developed countries' policies. The Board oversees new data on inflation and inflation determinants, especially data about inflation expectations and the evolution of economic activity, to assess the convenience of easing the monetary policy stance further in the short term. Inflation in May recorded a rate of -0.42 percent due to the significant reversal of increases in the prices of some foodstuffs, as a result of which the year-to-year rate of inflation fell for the second consecutive month, from 3.69 percent in April to 3.04 percent in May. Inflation without food and energy showed a rate of 0.08 percent, as a result of which the year-to-year rate dropped from 2.79 percent in April to 2.54 percent in May, within the target range. Inflation is forecast to converge to the target range during 2017. The indicators of business expectations remain on the optimistic side, although showing lower levels than those observed in the first quarter. GDP is expected to grow between 2.6 and 3.0 percent in 2017. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 2.75 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 4.55 percent for the first 15 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 15 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.55 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for July on its meeting of July 13, 2017."
Georgia,2017-06-14,"14.06.2017 NBG Keeps Its Policy Rate Unchanged at 7%. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on June 14, 2017 and decided to keep the refinancing rate unchanged at 7 percent. The decision is based on the macroeconomic forecast, according to which, due to the supply side pressures, the inflation is expected to be above its target rate during 2017. In the recent months, due to one-time factors the inflation has risen and reached 6.6% in May, with the contribution of rise in the prices of tobacco products and fuel equaling 2.6 p.p. The rise in inflation is in accord with the existing forecast, according to which the rise in inflation will be temporary and inflation will start decreasing in the second half of the year, reaching the target in 2018. At the same time the inflation expectations have been declining lately. Hence, other things equal there is no need of the further policy tightening. Given the absence of additional shocks and with the elimination of the impact of the one-time factors affecting the inflation, the policy rate in the medium term is expected to decrease to its neutral level in the medium term. This year the demand factors affecting consumer prices are still weak and the GDP growth is below the potential. Lately the aggregate demand indicators have been sending mixed signals: on one hand according to the preliminary estimates the economic growth has slowed down in April, compared to the previous months; on the other hand the export revenues (including that from tourism) have been growing at a high rate. The volume of remittances has also been growing. If the growth trend in the external demand is maintained, the gradual decrease in the current account deficit can be expected. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all means and instruments at its disposal in order to ensure the price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on July 26, 2017."
United States,2017-06-14,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in May indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising moderately so far this year. Job gains have moderated but have been solid, on average, since the beginning of the year, and the unemployment rate has declined. Household spending has picked up in recent months, and business fixed investment has continued to expand. On a 12-month basis, inflation has declined recently and, like the measure excluding food and energy prices, is running somewhat below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance. Addendum to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee continues to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further. Inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to remain somewhat below 2 percent in the near term but to stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely. All participants agreed to augment the Committee's Policy Normalization Principles and Plans by providing the following additional details regarding the approach the FOMC intends to use to reduce the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury and agency securities once normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.1. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1 to 1-1/4 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation. The Committee intends to gradually reduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings by decreasing its reinvestment of the principal payments it receives from securities held in the System Open Market Account. Specifically, such payments will be reinvested only to the extent that they exceed gradually rising caps. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. For payments of principal that the Federal Reserve receives from maturing Treasury securities, the Committee anticipates that the cap will be $6 billion per month initially and will increase in steps of $6 billion at three-month intervals over 12 months until it reaches $30 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. The Committee currently expects to begin implementing a balance sheet normalization program this year, provided that the economy evolves broadly as anticipated. This program, which would gradually reduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings by decreasing reinvestment of principal payments from those securities, is described in the accompanying addendum to the Committee's Policy Normalization Principles and Plans. For payments of principal that the Federal Reserve receives from its holdings of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities, the Committee anticipates that the cap will be $4 billion per month initially and will increase in steps of $4 billion at three-month intervals over 12 months until it reaches $20 billion per month. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Janet L Yellen. Chair; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Lael Brainard; Charles L Evans; Stanley Fischer; Patrick Harker; Robert S Kaplan; and Jerome H Powell. Voting against the action was Neel Kashkari, who preferred at this meeting to maintain the existing target range for the federal funds rate. The Committee also anticipates that the caps will remain in place once they reach their respective maximums so that the Federal Reserve's securities holdings will continue to decline in a gradual and predictable manner until the Committee judges that the Federal Reserve is holding no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively. Implementation Note issued June 14, 2017. Gradually reducing the Federal Reserve's securities holdings will result in a declining supply of reserve balances. The Committee currently anticipates reducing the quantity of reserve balances, over time, to a level appreciably below that seen in recent years but larger than before the financial crisis; the level will reflect the banking system's demand for reserve balances and the Committee's decisions about how to implement monetary policy most efficiently and effectively in the future. The Committee expects to learn more about the underlying demand for reserves during the process of balance sheet normalization. The Committee affirms that changing the target range for the federal funds rate is its primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy. However, the Committee would be prepared to resume reinvestment of principal payments received on securities held by the Federal Reserve if a material deterioration in the economic outlook were to warrant a sizable reduction in the Committee's target for the federal funds rate. Moreover, the Committee would be prepared to use its full range of tools, including altering the size and composition of its balance sheet, if future economic conditions were to warrant a more accommodative monetary policy than can be achieved solely by reducing the federal funds rate. The Committee's Policy Normalization Principles and Plans were adopted on September 16, 2014, and are available at. On March 18, 2015, the Committee adopted an addendum to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, which is available at."
Chile,2017-06-15,"Santiago. Chile. Thursday, 15 June 2017 Monetary Policy Meeting  June 2017 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 2.5%. Internationally, indicators continue to show favorable financial conditions and a scenario of gradual economic recovery in the main developed countries, as described in the latest Monetary Policy Report. Commodity prices show mixed fluctuations, where the drop in the prices of oil and derivatives stands out. On the domestic front, annual inflation stood at 2.6% and inflation expectations at the end of the projection horizon remain near the target. Partial second-quarter figures for activity and demand are consistent with forecasts, and reflect the negative impact of mining and construction. Private consumption remains stable, in line with the performance of the labor market. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. ___ * The Spanish original prevails."
Turkiye,2017-06-15,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels:. a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate at 9.25 percent and borrowing rate at 7.25 percent,. b) One-week repo rate at 8 percent,. c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, and lending rate at 12.25 percent. Recently released data indicate that the recovery in the economic activity has gained pace. Domestic demand conditions have improved and demand from the European Union economies continues to contribute positively to exports. The economic activity is expected to further accelerate due to the supportive measures and incentives provided recently. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly. Although recent improvements in cost factors and expected partial correction in food prices will contribute to disinflation, current elevated levels of inflation pose risks on the pricing behavior. Accordingly, the Committee decided to maintain the tight stance of monetary policy. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. Tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained until inflation outlook displays a significant improvement. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Mongolia,2017-06-16,"MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Lowering the policy rate Number:2017/02 Effective date: 16 June 2017 On 15 June 2017, the Monetary policy committee of the Bank of Mongolia decided to cut its policy rate by 2 percentage points to 12% and the policy rate corridor symmetrically around the policy rate. The width of the corridor remained unchanged at 4%. As of May 2017, annual inflation reached 3.7% nationwide and 3.8% in Ulaanbaatar city. Supply- side factors have contributed to the recent surge of inflation; however, the final impact remains low. In addition, the National Statistics Office introduced changes in the CPI methodology, which were the main factors that caused the inflation rate to rise above the previous forecasts. Despite these developments, the CPI inflation is expected to remain in the target range. The IMF program and the bilateral/multilateral assistance agreed within the program will bring substantial forex inflows into the domestic market. In addition, successful debt operation of the Development Bank's bonds and recent surge in exports caused by favorable commodity prices are also providing substantial contribution to the supply of foreign currency. Therefore, these factors are mitigating the balance of payment related risks, and causing the exchange rate to appreciate. Appreciation of the exchange rate is not only helping to maintain the inflation rate around its target, but also creating a room for the Central Bank to soften its monetary policy stance, and make it more reflective of the current economic fundamentals. First quarter statistics show revival of the economic growth. However, sectoral breakdown of statistics indicates that the economic activity remains weak in many sectors. This also has some negative implications for asset quality of banks and stability of the financial system, in general. Therefore, after careful consideration of these factors and proper weighting of policy objectives, the MPC decided to cut its policy rate. Extracts of the Committee meeting minutes will be released in two weeks on the Bank of Mongolia's website. MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE."
Russia,2017-06-16,"On 16 June 2017, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to cut the key rate to 9.00% per annum. The Board notes that inflation is close to the target, inflation expectations keep declining, and economic activity is recovering. Inflation risks were down in the short term, while they remain in place in the medium term. The Bank of Russia will continue to conduct moderately tight monetary policy to maintain inflation close to the 4% target. The Bank of Russia sees room for cutting the key rate in the second half of 2017. While making its decision hereinafter, the Bank of Russia will assess inflation risks, the inflation dynamics and economic developments against the forecast. In making its key rate decision, the Bank of Russia was guided by the following assumptions. Inflation dynamics. Annual inflation stood at 4.1% in May keeping close to the target. Low inflation is gradually gaining sustainability. Price growth becomes more homogeneous in regions and for major groups of goods and services. Growth in prices for non-food goods and services continued to decline. Food inflation remains relatively low, although since the supply of last year harvest has become exhausted annual growth in prices for fruit and vegetables is currently rising. Annual inflation registered an expected short-term increase against this backdrop standing at an estimated 4.2% as of 13 June 2017. As inflation showed a substantial slowdown, inflation expectations of both households and businesses declined considerably. This trend, however, may temporarily come to a halt amid the seasonal rise in prices for certain types of fruit and vegetables, considering that inflation expectations are sensitive to their dynamics. Inflation expectations should be lowered further to anchor inflation close to 4%. Domestic demand continues to exert a disinflationary impact. Households broadly tend to demonstrate savings behaviour patterns. There are signs of nascent recovery in consumer activity. Consumer lending creates no significant inflation risks so far. Ruble appreciation made a considerable contribution to consumer price growth slowdown since the start of the year. This factor's influence on inflation is abating amid the relatively stable exchange rate. Monetary conditions. Moderately tight monetary conditions played an important role in slowing down inflation. Against the backdrop of the key rate reduction interest rates on loans have dropped. Their level supports balanced demand for loans. Consumption recovery is not outpacing growth in wages for the time being. Banks continue to adhere to a conservative policy by mitigating price and non-price lending conditions primarily for reliable borrowers. The slowing growth in household deposits was attributable in part to the deposit rate reduction. The Bank of Russia will set the monetary conditions to promote savings, which in turn will curb inflation risks. Economic activity. Economic activity continues to recover. Household consumption is on the rise alongside with the growth in investment and industrial output. Currently, a moderate growth in consumer expenditures does not exert any inflationary pressure under increased supply of goods and services. Considering the current recovery trends, the Bank of Russia has increased its GDP growth rate forecast to 1.3-1.8% in 2017. Economic growth is getting closer to its potential level. The situation in the labour market with the shortage of personnel in certain segments being evident is a constraint. In the sequel a GDP growth rate higher than 1.5-2% annually will be reached if structural reforms take place. Inflation risks. Short-term inflation risks connected with oil price dynamics have declined following the prolongation of the agreement to reduce oil production by oil-exporting countries. At the same time short-term risks arising from the implied harvest, its impact on consumer goods prices and inflation expectations are typical of this season. Mid-term risks remain elevated. First, they are connected with the further dynamics of oil prices which under reached the agreements began to take shape at a lower level than expected. Legislative consolidation of a budget rule will contribute to mitigating this risk. Second, a higher structural deficit of labour resources can produce a situation when labour productivity growth rates will be left significantly behind the growth in wages. Third, a change in the household behaviour model connected with a substantial decrease in their propensity to save can be a source of inflationary pressure. Fourth, the sensitivity of inflation expectations to price changes for certain groups of goods and services and in the exchange rate dynamics is still present. Fifth, a possible tax manoeuvre can lead to a temporary acceleration in inflation. Considering these factors the maintenance of moderately tight monetary conditions for a long period of time to anchor inflation close to its target will be required. The Bank of Russia sees room for cutting the key rate in the second half of 2017. While making its decision hereinafter, the Bank of Russia will assess inflation risks, the inflation dynamics and economic developments against the forecast. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next rate review meeting on 28 July 2017. The press release on the Bank of Russia Board's decision is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time.

Thailand,2017-06-19,"1 - Summary Conclusion of the Joint Meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) and the Financial Institutions Policy Committee (FIPC) on 15 June 2017 The Bank of Thailand announced the summary conclusion of the joint meeting of the MPC and the FIPC on 15 June 2017 to assess the risks to Thailand's financial stability as follows. Thailand's financial stability remains sound. Domestic strength was reflected in high capital buffers maintained by financial institutions and insurance companies, as well as large corporates' strong balance sheets. External financial stability also remains strong, with continuing current account surplus, low external debts, and high level of international reserves. These positive factors could provide cushion for uncertainties from macro-financial conditions abroad, which could heighten in the periods ahead. Despite more visible signs of domestic recovery, debt serviceability continued to deteriorate for certain business sectors, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as well as households. This could reflect both the uneven nature of the ongoing recovery and the structural changes and competitiveness issues faced by SMEs. For the housing market, oversupply existed in certain areas and price ranges. However there was no sign of widespread speculative bubbles, while the new project launches seemed to decelerate. The search-for-yield behavior remains. Institutional investors continued to invest in risky assets to generate higher returns expected by customers. Foreign investment, especially through foreign investment funds (FIFs), continuously registered a steady growth. While most FIFs invested primarily in countries with investment-grade sovereign credit ratings, their investment was somewhat concentrated in some countries. Meanwhile the issuance of unrated bonds and the size of accredited investor mutual funds, which had been growing in earlier periods, started to decelerate, following some recent default events. In this regard, the Office of the Securities and Exchange Commission has taken further steps to enhance regulations on bond issuances, with an emphasis on arrangers' sales conduct and disclosure of risk information to investors. Savings cooperatives continued to be a venue for the search-for-yield behavior. This was indicated by a strong growth in deposits and shares mobilized from cooperatives' members, as well as a high level of borrowing from external sources. Although some progress has been made on implementing the cooperatives' prudential measures, further enhancements of the supervisory framework would be needed to ensure proper risk management, corporate governance, and the alignment with the underlying philosophy of cooperatives. In the periods ahead. Thailand's financial system could still face several risk factors. Global macro-financial conditions could be highly uncertain, while domestic growth might still be uneven across sectors. These could weigh on some corporates and households' ability to service debts, and also could add to rollover risks, especially for businesses relying on short-term borrowing and bond issuance for financing. The relevant regulators, including the Bank of Thailand, the Office of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Office of Insurance Commission have together been assessing and monitoring financial stability risks on a regular basis. The three regulators have also been enhancing and enforcing regulations to cope and mitigate emerging risks appropriately. These efforts are aimed at preventing the build-up of vulnerabilities that could potentially affect Thailand's overall financial stability."
Philippines,2017-06-21,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) facility at 3.0 percent. The corresponding interest rates on the overnight lending and deposit facilities were also kept steady. The reserve requirement ratios were likewise left unchanged. The Monetary Board's decision is based on its assessment that the inflation environment continues to be manageable. Latest baseline forecasts indicate a lower path of future inflation, with average inflation remaining within the target range of 3.0 percent Â± 1 percentage point for 2017-2019. Inflation expectations also continue to be firmly anchored to the target over the policy horizon. At the same time, the assessment of risks to the inflation outlook remains tilted toward the upside. While there may be potential transitory impact of the proposed tax reform program, the social safety nets are expected to mitigate the resulting inflationary pressures. The long-run effects on productivity will improve overall supply and further dampen inflation. Meanwhile, prospects for the global economy have improved, but risks to external demand remain tilted to the downside. Nonetheless, the Monetary Board emphasized that while global economic conditions remain challenging, prospects for domestic economic activity continue to be firm owing to buoyant consumer and business sentiment, ample liquidity, and sustained credit growth. In addition, the Monetary Board has considered the potential impact on global financial market conditions of the ongoing monetary policy adjustment in the US, noting that maintaining monetary policy settings at this time would allow the BSP to continue to assess evolving economic developments and calibrate its policy tools as appropriate. With these considerations, the Monetary Board believes that prevailing monetary policy settings remain appropriate. Going forward, the BSP will remain vigilant against any risks to the inflation outlook and will adjust its policy settings as needed to ensure that future inflation remains consistent with the medium-term target while being supportive of sustainable economic growth."
Armenia,2017-06-27,"PRESS RELEASE 27.06.2017 On the June 27, 2017 meeting the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia decided to leave the refinancing rate unchanged, at the 6.0% level. There was 0.2% deflation in May of 2017 compared with that of 0.7% recorded in the same month of the previous year, under which circumstance the 12â€month inflation rate continued expanding amounting to 1.6% at the end of the month. Taking into account current inflation developments, the Board of the Central Bank estimates that, by second quarter results, the inflation behavior is in line with the scenario. In the external environment, the global economic growth outlook is further improving slowly while some shortâ€term deflationary patterns were observable in international commodity markets. The Board of the Central Bank expects no significant inflationary effects from the external sector in the forthcoming months. The Board notes that high growth of economic activity in the second quarter of 2017 persisted owing to high growth registered in mining industry, rendered services and trade sectors. At the same time, domestic demand continues recovering gradually which, under a contractionary fiscal policy, is determined by the influence of expansionary monetary policy implemented by the Central Bank, sustained macroeconomic stability and relatively low inflation expectations. Considering the above developments, as well as balanced inflationary risks, the Board of the Central Bank finds it reasonable to leave the monetary conditions unchanged. As a result, the inflation is expected to gradually increase, shaping within the confidence band during 2017, and to stabilize around the target in the forecast horizon. The Central Bank believes that if the macroeconomic developments proceed with the predicted scenario, the monetary conditions will remain unchanged for some time. However, should there emerge risks to the inflation deviating from its recovery path, the Central Bank would react by adjusting its monetary policy directions accordingly, while fulfilling the inflation target in the medium run. Detailed information on setting of the interest rate will be available in Press Release (Minuets on Interest Rate) to be published by July 7, 2017. Press Service of the Central Bank of Armenia."
Czech Republic,2017-06-29,"<At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank decided unanimously to keep interest rates unchanged. The exit from the exchange rate commitment in April was the first step towards a gradual return of the overall monetary conditions to normal. Interest rate increases will be conditional on the evolution of all key macroeconomic variables, including the exchange rate of the koruna.. According to the current forecast, inflation will stay in the upper half of the tolerance band around the target for the rest of this year. It will decline towards the 2% target at the start of next year. Inflation will remain very close to the target at the monetary policy horizon, i.e. in 2018 Q2 and Q3. Consistent with the forecast is an increase in domestic market interest rates in 2017 Q3 and later also in 2018. The Bank Board assessed the risks to the current forecast as being slightly inflationary. Economic activity in the Czech Republic's main trading partner countries is continuing to rise at a solid pace. Its outlook for this year increased slightly, reflecting faster growth at the start of this year and favourable leading indicators for Q2. Producer price inflation also shifted slightly upwards for this year. Next year, however, the effect of the increase in commodity prices will unwind and producer price inflation will then ease to the levels expected in our current forecast, i.e. towards 2%. The outlook for euro area consumer price inflation remains virtually unchanged. Inflation will thus increase only very gradually and will not approach the European Central Bank's target from below until the close of next year. While the outlook for the three-month EURIBOR is unchanged for this year, it is marginally lower for next year. The market outlook for the Brent crude oil price declined to around USD 51 a barrel owing to continuing excess supply. According to market outlooks, the oil price will stay close to this level until the end of next year. Currently, it is significantly lower. The market outlooks for the euro-dollar exchange rate have shifted towards a slightly stronger euro. This is also a slight anti-inflationary factor as regards koruna prices of oil. Domestic inflation edged down compared to the end of Q1. In May it stood at 2.4%, i.e. 0.2 percentage point below the forecast. This was due mainly to slightly slower growth in food prices and a more marked slowdown in annual fuel price growth compared to the forecast. By contrast, core inflation continued to increase and was slightly higher than forecasted. It still visibly reflects the continued growth in the domestic economy and wages. Inflation pressures are also evident in other price categories. Prices in manufacturing are increasing at a relatively strong pace, although a moderation was observed in May. Growth in agricultural producer prices reached double figures. Construction work prices and market services prices are also rising steadily. In line with expectations, the growth of the Czech economy accelerated in 2017 Q1, reaching almost 3%. GDP growth was 0.4 percentage point higher than forecasted. This was due mainly to a less pronounced decrease in fixed investment and inventories and, to a lesser extent, to faster growth in government consumption. Conversely, the contributions of household consumption and net exports were lower than forecasted. However, these two demand components maintain a dominant share in GDP growth. The data available for 2017 Q2 point to continued solid growth in retail sales and industrial production. Construction output also saw pronounced recovery in April for the first time in a long time. The economic sentiment of both households and corporations remains high. The unemployment rate in the Czech Republic fell slightly further in 2017 Q1. The share of unemployed persons has come down somewhat again in Q2 so far and is approaching 4%. Wage growth in market sectors surged in 2017 Q1, reflecting the robust economic growth and increasing labour market tightness. Wages in non-market sectors have also been rising apace for some time now. The April wage data suggest a further increase in wage growth. To sum up the important facts about recent developments in the Czech economy, inflation was slightly below the forecast in May. Conversely, the growth rates of GDP and the average wage in 2017 Q1 were higher than forecasted. The share of unemployed persons was in line with the forecast in April and May."
Colombia,2017-06-30,"The Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica at today's meeting decided to reduce the benchmark interest rate by 50 bp to 5.75%. For this decision, the Board mainly took into account the following aspects. In May, annual consumer inflation stood at 4.37%, and the average of core inflation indicators posted at 5.33%. These figures are lower than those registered a month ago. Analysts' inflation expectations to December 2017 and 2018 are 4.37% and 3.54%, respectively. Those embedded in public debt bonds recorded slight changes, and are slightly above 3.0% for 2018. The effects of the strong transitory supply shocks that deviated inflation from its target continue to fade. This is suggested by the slowdown of food CPI, for example. The average of core inflation indicators continued to decline more slowly, due to the indexation of prices and the effect of the transitory increase in indirect taxes. The contribution of food CPI to the decline in annual inflation may reverse during the second half of this year. For this reason, forecasts indicate that the annual inflation rate could increase in that semester. In the last month, the price of oil lowered, and so far this year it stands below the forecast by the Central Bank's technical staff for 2017. External demand remains weak, and it is expected to grow somewhat above the figure registered in 2016. In this environment, country risk spreads have increased, and the peso has depreciated vis--vis the US dollar. The information available on retail sales, consumer confidence, and from the monthly survey of economic expectations for the second quarter suggests that consumption growth is weaker than expected. The figures for imports of capital goods suggest that growth of investment different from civil works and construction would be low. With this information, the annual output growth rate is likely to post below the current projection. Based on this information, the Board considered the following factors for its decision. An incremental weakness in economic activity and the risk of deceleration beyond that compatible with the deterioration in the dynamics of income due to the fall in oil prices. Recent indicators suggest a significant increase in the excess capacity of the economy, although its magnitude is highly uncertain. Uncertainty about the pace of convergence of inflation to its 3.0% target. Indexation mechanisms and the persistence of inflation continue to be reflected on the behavior of core inflation indicators. The current level of the real policy interest rate ex-ante is contractionary. In this environment, there was consensus among the Board of Directors to continue reducing the benchmark interest rate. The decision to reduce the benchmark interest rate by 50 bp was approved by four members of the Board. The remaining three Board Members voted for a 25 bp reduction."
Pakistan,2017-07-02,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement July 2, 2017 At the start of FY18, three features of Pakistan's economy stand out. First average headline inflation though higher than FY17 is expected to be lower than earlier outlook and will stay below the target of. percent, mainly on the back of favorable supply conditions. Second domestic demand is set to gain further traction as evidenced in the current growth in the real sector, credit to private sector and imports. Third on the external front, the underperformance of both exports and workers' remittances greatly impinged upon the current account deficit which reached USD 12. billion in FY17. For the time being, the overall balance of payments is expected to stay at manageable level in FY18- an assessment relying on steady anticipated financial account inflows and improvement in world growth. The first two features show that the economy is on an expansionary phase, while the third feature highlights near-term balance of payments challenges. Reflecting further on CPI tendencies, the headline inflation (in YoY terms) has softened at. percent in June 2017, while core inflation has stayed at. percent since April 2017. The latter does indicate rising demand. However marginally lower six-months ahead inflation expectations- captured by IBA- SBP's Consumer Confidence Survey of July-2017, show that these remain reasonably anchored. Accordingly SBP is projecting average CPI inflation in the range of. percent for FY18. This projection is explained by lower than anticipated increase in international oil prices, recent behavior of CPI inflation in June 2017, stable administered prices and lower inflationary expectations. Turning to the real sector, cumulative LSM (YoY) growth statistics till May 2017 depict strong positive momentum with food (especially sugar), steel, cement, automobiles, electronics and pharmaceuticals in the lead. Indeed July-May LSM growth is. percent against. percent recorded during the same period last year. Furthermore the outcome of agriculture sector is far superior to FY16 reaching its target of. percent in FY17. This performance is explained by better supplies of factors of production- positively affecting yields of all major crops, and an increase in area under cultivation of sugarcane. The services sector posted. percent increase in FY17 compared to. percent increase in FY16. Going forward, these developments will further entrench in FY18. As far as the money markets are concerned, market liquidity was able to accommodate strong credit demand from the private sector. In fact, increased economic activity, considerable increase in bank deposits, and low interest rates translated into private sector credit flows in FY17 reaching decade high of Rs748 billion as compared with Rs446 billion in FY16. It is encouraging that fixed investments and working capital loans grew by Rs 258. billion and Rs 360. billion in FY17 compared with an expansion of Rs 171. billion and Rs 219. billion last year, respectively. Demand for consumer financing, especially for auto and personal loans, also gathered pace during FY17. These trends are set to continue in FY18 given the developments on the real side. On the external front, the current account deficit reached US$ 12. billion during FY17. While exports and workers' remittances declined, imports growth surged by 17. percent in FY17. This is mainly owing to machinery imports both for CPEC and non-CPEC energy and infrastructure projects, whereas, imports for plant up-gradation under the ongoing export package for the textiles sector also added pressures. However in view of the last four months performance, the decline in exports appears to have bottomed out. Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN The current account deficit has been managed by FX reserves and financial account surplus which reached US$. billion during FY17 from US$. billion in the same period last year. Apart from the increase in official inflows this accumulation incorporates the impact of increase in private sector borrowing for CPEC projects. Taking into account these developments SBP foreign exchange reserves declined to US$ 16. billion at the end of FY17 as compared to US$ 18. billion in FY16. Going forward, the global forecasts project positive outlook with both growth and international trade picking up in FY18. Based on this assessment coupled with positive domestic policy measures. Pakistan's exports are expected to post gains. Imports on the other hand, albeit at slower pace, are also expected to grow in line with continuation of CPEC related activities and improving economic growth. While it remains uncertain whether remittances can return to posting meaningful positive growth very soon, stability of the external account and instrumental reserve accumulation depends upon timely inflow of budgeted bilateral and financial inflows in FY18 as well. Following detailed deliberations and taking into consideration the strong likelihood of continued growth momentum, contained inflation and the challenges on the external front, the Monetary Policy Committee has decided to maintain the policy rate at.75%.

Romania,2017-07-03," Video: Press briefing, 3 July 2017 (Romanian only)  Board meeting minutes. In its meeting of 3 July 2017, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided the following:. The annual inflation rate advanced to a slightly higher-than-projected 0.64 percent in May 2017, after resuming in April the growth that had been discontinued in March 2017 (0.61 percent, against 0.18 percent). Behind this stood chiefly the step-up in core inflation and the slower negative growth of administered prices, as well as the rise in volatile food prices. The effects of these determinants were partially offset by the impact of slower annual fuel price dynamics, amid a renewed decline in the global oil price. Annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate1 rose slightly above the projected level, coming in at 1.29 percent in May 2017, the highest reading since August 2013, from 1.1 percent in April and 1.03 percent in March, largely on the back of movements in processed food prices. Average 12-month CPI inflation further posted less negative values, standing at -0.2 percent in May, against -0.5 percent in April and -0.9 percent in March; calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, the annual average re-entered positive territory after nearly two years to reach 0.1 percent (compared with -0.2 percent in April and -0.5 percent in March). Economic growth sped up significantly in 2017 Q1, above expectations, with real GDP expanding year on year by 5.7 percent, against the previous three months' 4.8 percent. Swifter GDP dynamics were fully accounted for by domestic demand, which went up on the back of both its components: final consumption of households (6.7 percent, contributing 4.8 percentage points to GDP growth) and gross fixed capital formation (whose negative contribution shrank to -0.1 percentage points, from -3.8 percentage points in the prior quarter). By contrast, the contribution of net exports to GDP growth slipped again into negative territory, as the faster annual pace of imports outran that of exports of goods and services, which hit a 3-year high. On the supply side, the major driver of first-quarter economic activity advance was the industrial sector, whose annual pace stood 6.7 percent higher, ahead of the tertiary sector, up 5.9 percent, that remained the largest contributor to GDP growth (3.6 percentage points). The most recent statistical figures (available for the beginning of 2017 Q2) point to a further sizeable pace of increase of turnover of trade and services, a slight alleviation of the annual dynamics of industrial output volume (but to a large extent attributable to a calendar effect) and a steeper fall of activity in the construction sector. Against the backdrop of a widening differential between the growth rate of wage earnings and that of labour productivity. April saw a renewed rise in the annual pace of increase of unit wage costs industry-wide. Real monetary conditions remained stimulative in 2017 Q2. The annual growth of credit to the private sector continued in May 2017 at a rate similar to that seen in April, i.e. 3.2 percent. The halt in the upward trend recorded previously was attributable to a slight deceleration in the annual dynamics of credit to non-financial corporations and the renewed pick-up in the pace of increase of loans to households, consumer credit in particular. The share of leu-denominated credit in total private sector loans continued to widen to 59.3 percent (from a low of 34.6 percent in May 2012), amid further divergent developments in the two components (up 13.3 percent for lei and down 8.7 percent for foreign currency in May). This certifies the improvement in monetary policy transmission, while also helping mitigate risks to financial stability. The latest assessments reconfirm the outlook for the annual inflation rate to stick to an upward path in the near future, while following a trajectory slightly above that projected in the medium-term forecast published in the May 2017 Inflation Report, including in the case of the annual core inflation rate. The uncertainties and risks surrounding this outlook are, however, influenced by both domestic and external developments. Domestically, they are compounded by the fiscal and income policy stance, also in the context of the recent legislative initiatives in the area. Looking at the external environment, further relevant are the uncertainties and risks associated with euro area and global economic growth, especially amid Brexit talks and the US Administration's economic policies, as well as with the decisions of the major central banks (ECB. Fed). Given the current assessments, as well as the emergence of new sources of uncertainty, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided to keep unchanged the monetary policy rate at 1.75 percent per annum, to further pursue adequate liquidity management in the banking system, and to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board decisions aim to ensure and preserve price stability over the medium term in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth. The NBR Board reiterates that a balanced macroeconomic policy mix and progress in structural reforms are of the essence in preserving a stable macroeconomic framework and strengthening the capacity of the Romanian economy to withstand potentially adverse global developments. The NBR is closely monitoring domestic and external developments and stands ready to use all its available tools. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR website on 10 July 2017, at 3:00 p.m. In line with the announced calendar, the next monetary policy meeting of the NBR Board is scheduled for 4 August 2017, when a new quarterly Inflation Report is to be examined. 1 Calculated by excluding from the consumer price index the following categories: administered prices, volatile prices, and tobacco and alcoholic beverage prices."
Poland,2017-07-05,"Warsaw, 5 July 2017 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 4-5 July 2017 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: ï‚§ reference rate at 1.50%; ï‚§ lombard rate at 2.50%; ï‚§ deposit rate at 0.50%; ï‚§ rediscount rate at 1.75%. Signs of improvement in the global economy are strengthening. In the euro area, data indicate an ongoing recovery driven by rising consumption and investment. In the United States, after a temporary decline. GDP growth probably picked up in 2017 Q2. In turn, in China current data point to a deceleration of economic growth in 2017 Q2. Despite continuing global recovery, inflation abroad remains moderate, on the back of the fading effects of an earlier increase in commodity prices and stable oil prices, alongside low domestic inflationary pressure in many countries. The European Central Bank keeps interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero. The ECB continues its asset purchase programme. The US Federal Reserve gradually tightens its monetary policy by raising interest rates. In Poland, monthly data on economic activity indicate stable GDP growth in 2017 Q2. Growth is still driven primarily by increasing consumer demand, supported by rising employment and wages, disbursement of benefits and very good consumer sentiment. At the same time, data on industrial production and construction output, as well as leading economic indicators, suggest a continuation of favourable trends in the corporate sector. Together with the expected increase in the absorption of EU funds, this should support recovery in investment in the coming quarters. The annual growth in prices of consumer goods and services remains at a moderate level, while core inflation, though gradually increasing, is still low. Growth in unit labour costs also remains moderate. In the Council's opinion, in the following quarters inflation will remain moderate amid fading effects of the past increase in global commodity prices, with only a gradual rise in domestic inflationary pressure stemming from improving domestic economic conditions. In consequence, the risk of inflation running persistently above the target in the medium term is limited. Such an assessment is supported by the results of the July projection of inflation and GDP, prepared by the Economic Analysis Department under the assumption of unchanged NBP interest rates. In line with the July projection based on the NECMOD model, there is a 50-percent probability that the annual price growth will be in the range 1/2 of 1.6  2.3% in 2017 (against 1.6  2.5% in the March 2017 projection), 1.1  2.9% in 2018 (compared to 0.9  2.9%) and 1.3  3.6% in 2019 (compared to 1.2  3.5%). The annual GDP growth  according to this projection  will be with a 50-percent probability in the range of 3.4  4.7% in 2017 (against 3.4  4.0% in the March 2017 projection), 2.5  4.5% in 2018 (compared to 2.4  4.5%) and 2.3  4.3% in 2019 (compared to 2.3  4.4%). The Council confirms its assessment that, given the available data and forecasts, the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on the sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic balance. The Council adopted Inflation Report  July 2017."
Thailand,2017-07-05,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 4/2017 Mr. Jaturong Jantarangs. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 5 July 2017 as follows. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 150 percent. In deliberating their policy decision, the Committee assessed that Thailand's growth outlook improved further due to a better export outlook while domestic demand continued to expand at a gradual pace and not yet sufficiently broad-based. Headline inflation softened and might fall below the lower bound of the target in some periods mainly due to supply-side factors. Nevertheless headline inflation was projected to rise in the latter half of this year. Meanwhile overall financial conditions remained accommodative and conducive to economic growth. Hence the Committee decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at this meeting. Further improvements in the growth outlook were attributed to a more broad-based expansion in merchandise exports across various product categories and export destinations, and also driven by the swift recovery in tourism. Private consumption continued to expand on the back of improvements in farm income. Nevertheless non-farm income did not gain much from the export recovery, and thus overall purchasing power had yet to fully recover. Public expenditure remained an important growth driver. Meanwhile private investment was projected to slowly pick up. However the improved growth outlook was still subject to external risks. These included sustainability of trading partners' growth, uncertainties pertaining to US economic and foreign trade policies, monetary policy directions of major advanced economies. China's economic structural reforms, and geopolitical risks. Furthermore the Committee would also closely monitor the impacts of tighter regulations on immigrant labor that were recently announced. Headline inflation softened mainly due to supply-side factors especially lower fresh food prices that resulted from this year's higher agricultural output and last year's base effects following the drought, as well as the decline in global oil prices. Meanwhile demand-pull inflationary pressures remained low. Nevertheless headline inflation was projected to slowly rise in the latter half of the year, supported by supply-side factors and recovery of domestic demand. The public's medium-term inflation expectations remained close to the midpoint of the target. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative and conducive to economic growth with ample liquidity in the financial system. Government bond yields and real interest rates remained low. Meanwhile business financing through both credit and capital markets continued to expand. With regard to exchange rates, movements in the baht over the recent period were in line with regional currencies, and the Committee would continue to monitor short-term capital flows going forward. The Committee viewed that financial stability remained sound with sufficient cushion against economic and financial volatilities on both domestic and external fronts. However there remained pockets of risks that warranted close monitoring such as the deterioration in debt serviceability of small-and-medium sized enterprises (SMEs) which in part reflected competitiveness issues. Moreover the search-for-yield behavior in the prolonged low interest rate environment continued to warrant monitoring as it could lead to underpricing of risks. 2 Looking ahead. Thailand's growth outlook improved further on the back of external demand, while domestic demand expansion was not yet sufficiently broad-based. Hence the Committee viewed that monetary policy should remain accommodative, and would stand ready to utilize available policy tools to sustain economic growth while also ensuring financial stability."
Egypt,2017-07-06,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release July 6, 2017 In its meeting held on July 6, 2017, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) main operation by 200 basis points to 1875 percent, 1975 percent, and 1925 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also raised by 200 basis points to 1925 percen. Annual headline inflation in May 2017 fell for the first time since October 2016 to record 297 percent compared to 315 percent in the preceding mont. The drop was partly due to a favorable base effect stemming from the exchange rate depreciation in March 2016 that strongly impacted prices in May 201. Meanwhile annual core inflation continued to be supported by favorable base effects since March 2017, dropping to 306 percent in May from 331 percent in Februar. Monthly headline inflation stabilized at 17 percent in May 2017, while monthly core inflation rose to 20 percent in May from 11 percent in Apri. The impact of the November 2016 economic reform measures on prices of goods and services has largely passed-through, with the lagged impact affecting prices of items that witnessed delayed or seasonal consumption such as pilgrimage services in May, which contributed by 06 percentage points and 09 percentage points to headline and core inflation, respectivel. Excluding effects of transitory shocks, underlying inflation remained somewhat higher than consistent with achieving the CBE's target, affected by price-setting behavior in line with annual inflation of 10 percent historically, which has been further magnified recently due to second-round effects of the economic reform measure. This has been reflected especially in food components of core consumer as well as producer price. Additionally higher prices of hydrocarbon products effective June 29, 2017, higher value added taxes effective July 1, 2017, higher electricity prices scheduled for July 2017 as well as other potential regulated price adjustments further increase inflationary pressure. Annual real GDP grew by a revised 43 percent in 2016/17 Q3, strengthening from the 38 percent and 34 percent recorded in the preceding quarters as well as from the 36 percent recorded in 2015/16 Q. This coincided with the narrowing of the unemployment rate to 120 percent in 2016/17 Q3 from 124 percent and 126 percent in the preceding quarter. The structure of economic growth shifted with declining contribution of consumption and increasing contribution of net exports as well as investment by a lesser exten. Tourism natural gas, trade, construction and non-petroleum manufacturing were the main sectors driving economic growt. This was partly supported by looser monetary conditions stemming from the exchange rate depreciatio. Annual broad money (M2) growth has been strongly affected by revaluation effects of its foreign currency components, recording 394 percent in May 201. Excluding revaluation effects, annual broad money growth increased to 221 percent in May 2017, mainly due to the recovery of net foreign assets as well as higher loans to the private sector, while the contribution of net claims on the government eased given higher net external and non-bank financin. In the meantime, annual reserve money (M0) growth adjusted by overnight deposits and seven-day deposit auctions declined to reflect the absorption of short-term excess liquidity, consistent with the tighter monetary policy stanc. Furthermore currency in circulation outside the CBE as a percent of local currency deposits has been reverting to pre-2011 averages, implying normalization of money holding behavio. Developments in the external environment show some firming of international commodity prices on annual terms, despite registering monthly declines since March 2017 mainly on the back of crude oil prices, while food prices declined at a relatively slower pac. Meanwhile global inflation and economic growth continue to maintain weak pressures on domestic prices, given their moderate recovery which supports the gradual tightening of global monetary condition. Against this background, the balance of risks surrounding the inflation outlook has tilted more strongly to the upside with recent economic and monetary development. Consequently the MPC decided that tightening monetary conditions is warranted to achieve the inflation target of 13 percent (+/- 3 percent) in 2018 Q4 and single digits thereafte. The MPC reiterates that the objective of its tighter stance is not to offset first-round effects of supply-shocks, rather to contain second-round effects and ensure that the inflation outlook is consistent with achieving the targeted disinflation pat. As soon as underlying inflation starts to moderate, the MPC envisages a measured easing of the monetary stance to allow for a reduction in interest rate. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic and monetary developments as well as the balance of risks, and will not hesitate to adjust its stance to offset anticipated upside or downside deviations from the inflation targe.

Ukraine,2017-07-06,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to keep its key policy rate at 12.5% per annum. This decision resulted from the need to reduce risks to achieving the inflation targets set for 2017 and 2018. Overall, inflation was kept in check. Although headline inflation has increased in recent months, as expected, core inflation has been stable. Headline inflation sped up to 13.5% in May and to about 15% in June, as estimated by the NBU. These inflation figures were slightly higher than those projected by the NBU in its Inflation Report (April 2017). This was mainly attributed to a rise in raw food prices. An increase in global meat and dairy products has pushed up exports of Ukrainian products, cutting the supply of these products on the domestic market. The partial crop loss due to spring frosts and an increase in the supply of more expensive imported products have affected domestic fruit and vegetable prices. In the meantime, core inflation was lower than expected, making up 6.5% in May. It was reined in by consumer demand, which was lower than its potential level, as well as by prudent fiscal and monetary policies. A significant improvement in inflation expectations, resulting, among other things, from favorable FX market conditions, helped reduce the pressure on prices. The UAH/USD exchange rate has been strengthening since early 2017, driven by a hike in global steel and grain prices and larger agricultural exports. Meanwhile, in spite of a large supply of foreign currency on the domestic market, the demand for it remained depressed. Indeed, a gradual easing of FX restrictions did not have any material influence on the FX market. The NBU, although remaining committed to a flexible exchange regime, did not counteract the gradual appreciation of the hryvnia, while purchasing an excess supply of foreign currency in the interbank market to replenish international reserves. Overall, since the start of the year, the NBU has purchased over USD 1.3 billion net, pushing up reserves to USD 18 billion. Inflation is projected to decrease to its target levels in 2017  2018. The NBU forecasts that inflation in 2017-2018 will meet the announced targets set in the Monetary Policy Guidelines for 2017 and Medium Term (8% Â± 2 pp for 2017 and 6% Â± 2 pp in 2018). The NBU has not changed its inflation projections for 2017-2018 forecasting inflation of 9.1% for 2017 and 6.0% for 2018. In the latter half of 2017, inflation in annual terms is expected to be rather volatile, as it was in the first half of the year. In Q3 2017, it is forecast to remain in the double-digit range. However, in Q4, it is expected to return to a one-digit figure. Inflation projections are expected to be unchanged due to various factors counterbalancing each other. On the one hand, projections of a raw food price increase have to be revised upwards, driven by factors arising from the supply of these products. On the other hand, this will be partly offset by weaker than so far expected growth in administrated prices. Influencing this also are more favorable than expected FX market conditions. As a result, the NBU has revised its core inflation projections downwards, to 6.1% at end-2017. Core inflation is projected to decrease to 3.9% in 2018. Key to inflation continuing on its downward path will be prudent monetary and fiscal policies, which will revive consumer demand, improve inflation expectations further, and prevent considerable fluctuations in the exchange rate. Raw food price growth is expected to be significantly weaker in 2018 compared to the current year. As in previous years, administrated prices will be driven by the inflation rate next year. These prices are forecast to rise by over 10%, reflecting expected growth in global energy prices, as well as Ukraine's excise policy. The NBU has revised its 2017 real GDP growth projections. The economic growth will slow down to 1.6% in the current year. The forecast was revised due to the worse economic performance in the first half of the year, particularly in services, and the revised crop yields assessments. Industries most susceptible to the breach of production ties with the uncontrolled territories (the mining and metals sector, energy industry, transport industry) will continue to underperform. Real GDP growth will increase to 3.2% in 2018. First of all, it will be driven by gradual easing of monetary and fiscal policy that will stimulate consumer demand. Also, economic growth will be bolstered by the strengthening investment attractiveness of the economy and the exports growth against background of better terms of trade and high crop yields. However, the recovery of domestic consumer and investment demand will largely be met by imported products. The current account deficit is expected to remain substantial at 4% of GDP in 2017-2018. It will be fully covered by inflow to the financial account that will provide for the further accumulation of the international reserves. The key assumption of this forecast is further cooperation with the International Monetary Fund, which remains an important source of replenishing the country's international reserves. Along with the surplus of consolidated balance of payments, the receipt of planned tranches under the EFF program will increase the international reserves to USD 20 billion by the end of 2017 and to USD 27 billion by the end of 2018. Also, the accumulation of reserves will be facilitated by the Government's use of special confiscation funds for the public debt servicing. The NBU considers that the current level of the key police rate is consistent with the inflation targets for 2017-2018 and the present balance of risks. The current state of monetary policy is kept to offset the effect of price growth on unprocessed foods on the inflationary expectations and the effects of consumer demand recovery, in particular, through the planned increase in pension payments from October in the form of increased inflationary pressure. The risks of an upward or downward change of the inflation forecast for this year are estimated as equally probable. On the one hand, the possibility exists that administered prices may grow this year (which, however, will ease inflation pressure next year). Supply-side factors related to food products may exert stronger pressure on the inflation trajectory in the current and next year than it is now expected. On the other hand, global energy prices may be lower than those projected in the NBU's baseline scenario. This will directly influence domestic consumer prices, and will also have an indirect impact through lower cost of imports with a correspondent adjustment of the exchange rate. The mid-term outlook takes into account some uncertainties related to the pace at which the government is set to raise social standards, particularly, pensions, as well as possible changes in the state policy on providing subsidies to households. Further, there is continuing uncertainty about the implementation of the macroeconomic policy and structural reforms required to maintain macrofinancial stability, boost the economy's potential and continue cooperation with the IMF. Unsuccessful reforms may undermine economic growth prospects, adversely affecting inflation and exchange rate expectations and increasing inflationary pressure. Apart from that, there is still a high risk that the military conflict in eastern Ukraine will escalate. For the key policy rate to be reduced further, the NBU needs to have clear indications that the above stated risks would not translate into a stronger inflationary pressure and impede the achievement of inflation targets in the medium term. The NBU Board is confident that a sustained and substantial lowering of lending rates for the real sector is only possible provided the achievement of price stability. Apart from that, the monetary policy easing witnessed this year can further facilitate the economic growth, since its effect has not yet fully translated into lower interest rates offered by banks, especially state-owned banks. The decision to keep the key policy rate at 12.5% is approved by NBU Board Decision No. 418D On the Key Policy Rate, dated 6 July 2017. Ð new detailed macroeconomic forecast will be published in the Inflation Report on 13 July 2017. The next meeting of the NBU Board on monetary policy issues will be held on 3 August 2017 as scheduled."
Israel,2017-07-10,"The annual inflation rate is slightly below the target, but the inflation environment remains low: inflation expectations for up to the third year remain below the target range. The increase in nominal wages, the strong economic environment, and inflation worldwide will act to increase the inflation rate, while the appreciation that has occurred in the shekel, increased competition in the economy and measures adopted by the government to reduce the cost of living will act in the opposite direction. Indicators of activity point to continued economic growth at a solid pace in the second quarter as well,and the labor market remains strong. Over time, growth of exports has been based on growth of services exports, while goods exports have essentially stood still. The global economy continues its moderate improvement, and there is an increase in the growth rate of world trade. In Europe, the recovery is becoming entrenched, and political risk has declined. The Federal Reserve increased the federal funds rate, as expected, but central banks of other major economies are continuing the very accommodative policy for now. Since the last monetary discussion, there were relatively sharp changes in cross rates and the effective exchange rate appreciated by less than one percent. In the past 12 months, the effective exchange rate strengthened by 9.4 percent. Stability in home prices has been apparent for the past several months, and housing market indicators continue to point to the market cooling off. The Monetary Committee intends to maintain the accommodative policy as long as necessaryin order to entrench the inflation environment within the target range. The Bank of Israel continues to monitor developments in inflation, the real economy,the financial markets, and the global economy, and will act to attain the monetary policy targets in accordance with such developments. In recent months, the 12-month inflation rate has stabilized at slightly below the lower bound of the target range, and inflation for the 12 months ending in May was 0.8 percent (Figure 1 in the data file). With that, the inflation rate is expected to decline in the coming months, partly as a result of an expectedreduction in water and fuel prices and in the prices of after-school childcare. The rate of increase in tradable goods prices remains negative against the background of the appreciation of the shekel, but continues to increase, impacted by relatively high inflation abroad. The rate of increase in prices of nontradable items has moderated, but is within the inflation target. (Figure 3). One-year expectations from the various sources ranged in opposite directions, but all remain below the target range. Third year forward inflation expectations also declined to below the target range, but longer term expectations are anchored within the range. The increase in nominal wages, the strong economic environment, and inflation worldwide will act to increase inflation, while the appreciation that has occurred, the increased competition in the economy, and measures adopted by the government to reduce the cost of living will act in the opposite direction. All the indicators of economic activity point to the economy having continued its solid growth in the second quarter as well, as conveyed by preliminary data from the Companies Survey (Figure 10), the Purchasing Managers Index, the Consumer Confidence Indices, and the Composite State of the Economy Index. Foreign trade data indicate continued sluggishness in goods exports against the background of the continued appreciation of the shekel and despite the improvement in world trade. Export growth is based on rapid growth in services exports (Figure 12). The entrenchment of growth continues to be reflected in the labor market. The slight increase in the unemployment ratein April and May was accompanied by increases in the participation rate and in the employment rate (Figure 13), the job vacancy rate remains high, and the pace of wage increases continues to accelerate. Housing market data continue to indicate moderation in demand and a slowing of activity. In recent months, home prices seem to have stabilized (Figure 7), and there were declines in the volume of transactions among all buyer types and in the volume of new home sales. The monthly pace of new mortgages granted continues to moderate, the increase in mortgage interest rates has been halted, and there is some decline apparent in those interest rates in recent months (Figure 8). Global economic activity continues to improve moderately. The OECD raised its global growth forecast for 2017, and the improvement includes most major economies other than the US, for which the forecast was lowered (Figure 15). The increasein the growth rate of world trade continues, with an emphasis on emerging markets. The messages from several central banks were slightly less dovish, leading to an increase in bond yields, but with the exception of the US Federal Reserve, none of the major central banks changed their accommodative policy, and inflation in most major economies remains below the target (Figure 18). In the US, the assessment is that there was an improvement in the growth rate in the second quarter, following low growth in the first quarter, and the labor market is near full employment, but wage increases remain moderate and are not being translated into inflationary pressures. Assessments are that the administration will have difficulty implementing the fiscal expansion that was expected. In Europe, assessments are that growth continued at a relatively high pace in the second quarter, and political risk declined, which was reflected in, among other things, a decline in yield spreads between Germany and other European countries. In contrast, in the UK a slowdown is apparent due to the uncertainty regarding the Brexit process. In Japan, the Bank of Japan's assessment is that the output gap has been closed, but inflation remains low. The economic data published in China indicate a continuation of relatively moderate growth. Energy prices declined slightly, and the prices of other commodities were stable. ; The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on July 24, 2017. Thenext decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Tuesday. August 29, 2017.

Chile,2017-07-13,"PRESS RELEASE* Santiago. Chile. Thursday, 13 July 2017 Monetary Policy Meeting  July 2017 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 2.5%. Internationally, long-term interest rates increased, but financial conditions remain favorable. In general, news was consistent with the scenario of gradual recovery in global activity. The copper price rose, while the oil price, beyond fluctuations, trades near its levels of last month. On the domestic front, most noteworthy was June's monthly inflation at 0.4%, heavily influenced by the behavior of prices of fresh fruits and vegetables and some other products, which resulted in y-o-y inflation standing at 1.7%. Inflation expectations at shorter terms have dropped, but at the end of the projection horizon are near the target. Partial second-quarter figures for activity and demand are consistent with forecasts, and reflect the negative impact of mining and construction. Private consumption growth remains stable, in line with the performance of the labor market. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. ___ * The Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2017-07-13,"Base Rate unchanged at 1., 25% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Board considers that the global economic recovery has continued to expand. The global financial markets have shown generally stable movements, although their volatility has risen somewhat due to fluctuations in international oil prices and to changes in expectations related to the monetary policies of major countries. Looking ahead the Board sees the global economic recovery as likely to be affected by factors such as the directions of the US government's economic policies, the pace of monetary policy normalization by the US Federal Reserve, the movements toward spreading trade protectionism, and the direction of international oil prices. The Board judges that the solid trend of domestic economic growth has continued, as exports and investment have improved although the pace of increase in consumption has remained weak. On the employment front, the trend of year-on-year increase in the number of persons employed has slowed, and the employment-to-population ratio and the unemployment rate have risen. The Board sees the domestic economy as likely to continue its trend of recovery going forward, and forecasts a rate of GDP growth for this year higher than the April projection (2., 6%). Exports will sustain their trend of improvement, thanks chiefly to the global economic recovery, and domestic demand activities will also recover moderately, owing to improved economic agents\x80\x99 sentiments. Consumer price inflation has continued at the 2% target level, in line mainly with increases in the prices of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products. Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has stayed in the mid-1% range, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has remained at the mid-2% level. Looking ahead the Board expects that consumer price inflation will for the time being fluctuate at around the 2% level, and for the year as a whole show the level (1., 9%) projected in April. Core inflation appears likely to be in the mid- to upper-1% range. In the domestic financial markets, price variable volatility has expanded somewhat, with the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate having risen considerably, in line with changes in expectations related to the monetary policies of major countries and with increases in geopolitical risks, and long-term market interest rates having increased in concert with government bond rates in major countries. Stock prices have continued to climb, on the effects for example of the trend of solid domestic economic growth and expectations of improved performances at major companies. Household lending has sustained its high rate of increase exceeding past years\x80\x99 levels, although the amount of year-on-year increase has lessened somewhat. In the housing market, the trends of rising sales and leasehold deposit prices have expanded, centering around Seoul and its surrounding areas. Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As the inflationary pressures on the demand side are not expected to be high although the domestic economy is expected to show solid growth, the Board will maintain its stance of monetary policy accommodation. In this process it will closely monitor any changes in the monetary policies of major countries, conditions related to trade with major countries, the directions of the government's economic policies, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks."
Malaysia,2017-07-13,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.00 percent. The global economy continues to strengthen with growth becoming more synchronised across countries. Industrial activity and global trade are exceeding earlier projections. In the advanced economies, the broad-based increase in investment amid the steady growth in consumption is raising growth prospects. In Asia, growth is expected to be driven by domestic activity and stronger external demand. Risks to the global growth outlook arise mainly from political and policy uncertainties in the major economies, geopolitical and financial market developments, and volatility of commodity prices. The Malaysian economy performed better than expected in the first quarter of 2017. Growth was lifted by stronger domestic demand with additional impetus from exports. Going forward, the more favourable global growth prospects will lead to sustained export performance and generate positive spillovers to the domestic economy. Private consumption will be underpinned by higher wages and employment. The improved investment outlook is being driven by new and ongoing infrastructure projects, and stronger capacity expansion in the manufacturing and services sectors. Overall, the economy is expected to register higher growth in 2017. Headline inflation moderated to 3.9% in May, due mainly to the decline in domestic fuel prices during the month. Headline inflation is expected to moderate in the second half of the year mainly reflecting the waning effect of global cost factors. Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation, will be sustained by the more robust domestic demand but is expected to remain contained. The domestic financial markets have been resilient. The ringgit has remained stable with a more balanced demand and supply of foreign currencies following the implementation of the two financial market development measures. Banking system liquidity remains sufficient with financial institutions continuing to operate with strong capital and liquidity buffers. The growth of financing to the private sector has improved, consistent with the pace of economic activity. At the current level of the OPR, the stance of monetary policy is accommodative and supportive of economic activity. The MPC will continue to assess the balance of risks surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation. Bank Negara Malaysia 13 July 2017."
Peru,2017-07-13,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JULY 2017 BCRP LOWERED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE TO 3.75% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to lower the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points to 3.75 percent. This level of the benchmark rate is compatible with an inflation forecast in which inflation remains within the target range during 2017 and 2018. This forecast takes into account the following factors: The reversal of the supply shocks that affected inflation in the first quarter continued in June, as a result of which inflation returned to the target range. Moreover, inflation without food and energy continued to decline within the target range; Expectations of inflation in 12 months have continued to fall and remain within the inflation target range; The pace of growth of domestic economic activity continues to be below its potential growth level. Economic activity is expected to recover in the following quarters as a result of increased government and private spending, and The world economy continues to show a gradual recovery, although there is still some uncertainty about the policies of developed countries, particularly about the reversal of the monetary stimulus of central banks in these economies. The Board is giving special close attention to new data on inflation and inflation determinants, particularly to data about the velocity of expectations' convergence to the inflation target range, the degree of reversal of the supply shocks, and the pace of recovery of public and private spending, to assess the convenience of making additional changes in the monetary policy stance if deemed necessary. Inflation in June registered a rate of -0.16 percent due to the reversal of some food prices, as a result of which the year-to-year rate of inflation fell for the third consecutive month, declining from 3.04 percent in May to 2.73 percent in June. Inflation without food and energy showed a rate of 0.06 percent, as a result of which the year-to-year rate decreased from 2.54 percent in May to 2.38 percent in June, within the target range (between 1 and 3 percent). Inflation is foreseen to remain within this range during 2017 and 2018. The indicators of business expectations about economic activity remain on the optimistic side and GDP is expected to grow between 2.5 and 3.0 percent in 2017. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to lower the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 2.50 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 4.30 percent for the first 15 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 15 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.30 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for August on its meeting of August 10, 2017."
Kazakhstan,2017-07-17,"Press-release – 19 The base rate unchanged at 10.5% July 17, 2017 Almaty The National Bank of Kazakhstan has decided to keep the base rate at the level of 10.5% with a corridor of +/-1%. The annual inflation rate matches the forecasted estimates of the National Bank and remains within the target range, the inflationary expectations gets formed on the stable level. The inflationary risks are possible on the account of the supply factors, appearing in some specific goods markets, and external parameters deviations from the base scenario of the economic development. However, the deceleration trajectory of forecasted inflation in the medium term increases the possibility of lowering the base rate both in the short-run and in the horizon of the upcoming 12-18 months in order to provide the correspondence of the real interest base rate with the long-run potential economic growth rate. The annual inflation in June 2017 amounted to 7.5% and it keeps remaining within the target range of the National Bank (6-8%). The important signs of the descending inflation trend are the lower rate of inflation in the first half of the current year (3.7%) in comparison to that of the first half of 2016 (4.6%), and also the indicators of the base inflation, which do not take into the account the price shocks and volatility components, that are significantly decelerating since the beginning of the year and gets formed on the lower than the general inflation level. In June the base inflation rate amounted to 6.8% (in December 2016  8.9%). The short-term inflationary risk of the past months comes from the situation in the specific segments of the food market; however the beginning of the new harvest period has smoothed the negative tendencies of the general food price dynamics. The inflationary expectation of the population remains stable since the beginning of 2017. In June the quantitative assessment of the inflation for a year ahead amounted to 6.4% and remains below the actual inflation rate, and also within the target range for 2018. The results of the June survey show that the perceivable annual inflation rate and expectations for a year ahead have slightly decreased. The situation in the external commodity market can be characterized as volatile. The observed formation of the oil prices below the level of 50 dollars per barrel and the price index acceleration in the world food markets in May-June, mostly as a result of the price rise of diary and crops products, might lead to the increased inflationary pressure. The currency preferences of the depositors remain in favor of the assets in tenge. According to the preliminary data of June the excess of the tenge deposits share over those of foreign currency keeps extending. The share of the loans in tenge is also on the rise. Along with that, the demand for the crediting recourses remains stable and is accompanied with the gradual decrease of the rates. The short-term crediting dynamics is restricted by the consolidation processes in the banking sector. The economic activity continues demonstrating the recovery; the dynamics of the internal economic indicators affirm maintaining the recovery tendency. This way, in June the growth of the short-run economic indicator that characterizes the aggregate supply in the country amounted to 107.4% in the annual terms. However reconsideration of the estimates of the real income of the population by the statistical agency toward the significant decrease causes the uncertainty of the further dynamics of consumer demand. The monetary conditions remain neutral. In the condition of the excess liquidity the money market rates remain next to the lowest limit of the interest rate corridor. Due to the implementing the program aimed to increase the financial sustainability of the banking sector in the third quarter of the current year the further recovery of its crediting activity is being expected. The next decision on the base rate will be announced on August 21, 2017 at 17:00 Astana time."
Euroarea,2017-07-20,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Vice-President. Mr Dombrovskis. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We expect them to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases. Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, we confirm that our net asset purchases, at the current monthly pace of â‚¬60 billion, are intended to run until the end of December 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. The net purchases are made alongside reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme. Our monetary policy measures have continued to secure the very supportive financing conditions that are necessary to make continuous progress towards a sustained convergence of inflation rates to levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The incoming information confirms a continued strengthening of the economic expansion in the euro area, which has been broadening across sectors and regions. While the ongoing economic expansion provides confidence that inflation will gradually head to levels in line with our inflation aim, it has yet to translate into stronger inflation dynamics. Headline inflation is dampened by the weakness in energy prices. Moreover, measures of underlying inflation remain overall at subdued levels. Therefore, a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation is still needed for underlying inflation pressures to gradually build up and support headline inflation developments in the medium term. If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, we stand ready to increase our asset purchase programme in terms of size and/or duration. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro area real GDP increased by 0.6%, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter of 2017, after 0.5% in the last quarter of 2016. Incoming data, notably survey results, continue to point to solid, broad-based growth in the period ahead. The pass-through of our monetary policy measures is supporting domestic demand and has facilitated the deleveraging process. The recovery in investment continues to benefit from very favourable financing conditions and improvements in corporate profitability. Private consumption is supported by employment gains, which are also benefiting from past labour market reforms, and by increasing household wealth. Moreover, the global recovery should increasingly lend support to trade and euro area exports. However, economic growth prospects continue to be dampened by a slow pace of implementation of structural reforms, particularly in product markets, and by remaining balance sheet adjustment needs in a number of sectors, notwithstanding ongoing improvements. The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook are broadly balanced. On the one hand, the current positive cyclical momentum increases the chances of a stronger than expected economic upswing. On the other hand, downside risks primarily relating to global factors continue to exist. Euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.3% in June, down slightly from 1.4% in May, mainly due to lower energy price inflation. Looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for oil, headline inflation is likely to remain around current levels in the coming months. At the same time, measures of underlying inflation remain low and have yet to show convincing signs of a pick-up, as domestic cost pressures, including wage growth, are still subdued. Underlying inflation in the euro area is expected to rise only gradually over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the continuing economic expansion and the corresponding gradual absorption of economic slack. Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) continues to expand at a robust pace, with an annual rate of growth of 5.0% in May 2017, after 4.9% in April. As in previous months, annual growth in M3 was mainly supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate M1 expanding at an annual rate of 9.3% in May 2017, unchanged from April. The recovery in the growth of loans to the private sector observed since the beginning of 2014 is proceeding. The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations remained stable at 2.4% in May 2017, while the annual growth rate of loans to households increased to 2.6%, from 2.4% in April. The euro area bank lending survey for the second quarter of 2017 indicates that credit standards for loans to enterprises and loans to households for house purchase have further eased and that loan growth continues to be supported by increasing demand. The pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014 continues to significantly support borrowing conditions for firms and households and credit flows across the euro area. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed the need for a continued very substantial degree of monetary accommodation to secure a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2%. In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute decisively to strengthening the longer-term growth potential and reducing vulnerabilities. The implementation of structural reforms needs to be substantially stepped up to increase resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost productivity growth. Regarding fiscal policies, all countries would benefit from intensifying efforts towards achieving a more growth-friendly composition of public finances. A full, transparent and consistent implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact and of the macroeconomic imbalances procedure over time and across countries remains essential to bolster the resilience of the euro area economy."
South Africa,2017-07-20,"South African Reserve Bank PRESS STATEMENT EMBARGO DELIVERY 20 July 2017 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee the inflation outlook has improved. Food price inflation has moderated faster than expected, domestic demand pressures remain subdued and international oil prices have declined. Despite a degree of volatility, the rand exchange rate has been relatively resilient in the face of expected monetary policy tightening in some advanced economies, as well as domestic political risks and uncertainties. Risks to the inflation outlook still remain. At the same time, domestic growth prospects have deteriorated further following the surprise GDP contraction in the first quarter of 2017. The economy has now recorded two successive quarters of negative growth, and although a near-term improvement is expected, the outlook remains challenging. A number of sentiment indicators and data points have reached levels last seen during the 2009 recession, at the height of the global financial crisis. MPC Statement July 20th, 2017 Page 1. MPC Statement July 20th, 2017 Page 1 The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 5.4% and 5.1% in May and June, in line with the Bank's short- term forecast. Food and non-alcoholic beverage inflation measured 6.9% in both months, with the contribution to the overall inflation outcome unchanged at 1.2 percentage points. Meat prices continued to accelerate, and at 13.0%, contributed to the downside stickiness of food price inflation. The Bank's measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity, measured 4.8% in both months. Producer price inflation for final manufactured goods measured 4.6% in April and 4.8% in May. The further moderation in food prices was reflected in the PPI with the category of food products, beverages and tobacco products decelerating for the seventh consecutive month to 5.8%. The divergent trends between the subcategories of â€œproducts of crops and horticultureâ€ and â€œlive animalsâ€ persisted, with year-on-year changes of -24.4% and 21.4% respectively. The Bank's forecast for headline CPI inflation has shown a marked improvement since the previous meeting. The annual average forecast has been revised down by 0.4 percentage points in 2017 and 2018, and by 0.3 percentage points in 2019, to 5.3%, 4.9% and 5.2%. A lower turning point of 4.6% is expected in the first quarter of 2018 (previously 5.1%), and an average of 5.2% is forecast for the final quarter of 2019. The main drivers of the improved forecast were the lower starting point; revised assumptions regarding international oil prices, domestic electricity tariffs and the real effective exchange rate; and a wider output gap. These assumptions are set out in the annexure to this statement. Food price inflation is also expected to be more subdued, due to a lower starting point and more favourable domestic crop estimates. Despite a persistent upward trend in meat price inflation, the forecast for food price inflation has MPC Statement July 20th, 2017 Page 2. Despite a persistent upward trend in meat price inflation, the forecast for food price inflation has MPC Statement July 20th, 2017 Page 2 been revised down from 7.7% to 7.3% for this year; and from 5.4% to 5.1% in 2018. The forecast for 2019 is unchanged at 5.5%. The improvement is also evident in the core inflation outlook, with average forecasts of 4.8% for 2017 and 2018, and 4.9% for 2019. This compares with previous forecasts of 5.0%, 5.1% and 5.3% for these years. This improvement is driven in part by lower unit labour costs, in addition to the exchange rate and output gap developments. Inflation expectations as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research show a marginal improvement, with average expectations slightly below 6% in all three years. The decline was most marked among analysts, particularly over the first two survey years, and to a lesser extent among labour unionists. Both these categories of respondents expect inflation to be within the target range over the forecast period. The expectations of business respondents are largely unchanged and remain above 6% for all three years. By contrast, average 5-year expectations of all groups edged up from 5.7% to 5.9%, and ranged between 5.5% for analysts and 6.3% for business respondents. Median inflation expectations of market analysts improved over the near term. According to the Reuters Econometer survey conducted in July, expected inflation declined by 0.2 percentage points to 5.5% in 2017 and to 5.3% in 2018, compared with the May survey. However, the longer term trend is reversed with an expectation of 5.5% in 2019. Expectations implicit in the difference between nominal bonds and inflation-linked bonds have also declined slightly since the previous meeting, with the 5-year break-even rate at 5.3%. The global growth backdrop remains positive, with sustained upswings evident in most regions. This is despite continued uncertainty regarding economic policy reforms in MPC Statement July 20th, 2017 Page 3. This is despite continued uncertainty regarding economic policy reforms in MPC Statement July 20th, 2017 Page 3 the US. Nevertheless, growth rates and potential output estimates are still generally lower than those in the pre-crisis period. While there are lingering concerns about financial stability risks from the shadow banking sector in China, the recent strong performance of the economy has contributed to the favourable environment for emerging markets. Underlying global inflation trends remain benign, with inflation below target in most of the advanced economies, notwithstanding the positive growth prognosis and tightening labour markets. An exception is the UK where inflation has accelerated in the wake of the Brexit-induced depreciation of sterling. The subdued global inflation outlook is reinforced by generally slow wage and productivity growth in developed economies. Despite the absence of inflationary pressures, central banks in a number of advanced economies have signalled intentions to move from highly accommodative monetary policy stances. These countries include the US, the UK, the euro area and Canada. This process is unlikely to be smooth or perfectly synchronised and could generate bouts of uncertainty. In the US, expectations of further near-term rate increases by the Fed have been scaled down following a succession of downside inflation surprises. The gradual nature of the planned balance sheet contraction by the Fed has also been well communicated and appears to be largely priced in by the markets. While changing expectations regarding ECB and US monetary policy in particular have impacted on a number of emerging market currencies and bond yields, the reaction has been relatively muted, and a repeat of the 2013 so-called taper tantrum episode is not expected. Those economies that were most sensitive to that episode have much improved macroeconomic balances, and their currencies are less vulnerable to MPC Statement July 20th, 2017 Page 4. Those economies that were most sensitive to that episode have much improved macroeconomic balances, and their currencies are less vulnerable to MPC Statement July 20th, 2017 Page 4 possible spill-over effects from gradual monetary tightening in the advanced economies. The rand has also been affected by these changing expectations, as well as by domestic political developments, including concerns about a proposal to change the SARB's monetary policy mandate. While the rand is more or less unchanged since the previous meeting of the MPC, it has been relatively volatile, having fluctuated in a range between R12.60 and R13.60 against the US dollar. The rand's relative resilience had been underpinned by the generally positive sentiment towards emerging markets, as well as by sustained trade surpluses. The current account deficit is still expected to widen over the forecast period, but the degree of widening has been revised down. The rand remains vulnerable to increased global risk aversion, domestic political shocks, and to the possibility of further ratings downgrades. The domestic growth outlook remains a concern, following the surprise broad-based GDP growth contraction during the first quarter of this year. With the exception of the primary sector, all sectors recorded negative growth. While positive growth is expected in the second quarter, the Bank's annual growth forecasts have been revised down further. The forecast for 2017 has been adjusted down from 1.0% to 0.5%, and the forecast for 2018 is down from 1.5% to 1.2%. Growth of 1.5% is expected in 2019, compared with 1.7% previously. As a result of these trends, the output gap has widened somewhat despite a further downward revision to potential output growth by 0.3 percentage points for each year, to 1.1% in 2017 and rising to 1.3% in 2019. The weak outlook is consistent with the decline in the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index to levels last seen during the MPC Statement July 20th, 2017 Page 5. The weak outlook is consistent with the decline in the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index to levels last seen during the MPC Statement July 20th, 2017 Page 5 recession following the global financial crisis. The SARB's composite leading business cycle indicator has also moderated somewhat since January. Monthly data for both the mining and manufacturing sectors in April and May suggest that, in the absence of a sharp contraction in June, these sectors are likely to contribute positively to growth in the second quarter, along with the continued rebound in the agricultural sector. The recovery is nevertheless expected to be modest, particularly in the light of a sharp fall in the ABSA Purchasing Mangers' Index in June, which returned to below the neutral level of 50 index points. The construction sector also remains under pressure following the marked fall in building plans passed in the first quarter of this year, with the negative trend continuing into April. The continued poor performance of gross fixed capital formation contributes to the weak state of the economy. Although private sector investment recorded positive growth after five consecutive quarters of contraction, at a growth rate of 1.2% it remains very subdued. Given the extremely low level of business confidence, a near- term improvement is unlikely. Policy uncertainty, a recent example being in the mining sector, is likely to constrain investment. As a consequence, employment growth has been minimal, and the prospects are unfavourable. Given the need for fiscal consolidation, a continued decline in government's contribution to employment creation is expected. The official unemployment rate increased to 27.7% in the first quarter of this year. Consumption expenditure by households contracted in the first quarter of this year, amid a further deterioration in consumer confidence. Although the monthly retail sales data suggest a more positive outcome for the second quarter, this improvement is likely to be offset in part by a decrease in new vehicle sales in the quarter. The outlook MPC Statement July 20th, 2017 Page 6. The outlook MPC Statement July 20th, 2017 Page 6 for consumption expenditure is expected to remain weak, amid employment uncertainty and higher tax burdens. These consumption trends are mirrored in the continued moderation in credit extension to households. Growth in mortgage advances and instalment sales credit finance remained subdued, reflective of the difficult conditions in the housing and vehicle markets. General loans to households increased moderately in May, but off a low base. Credit extension to the corporate sector, by contrast, remains relatively buoyant, but on a downward trend. Wage trends have been an important contributor to the persistence of inflation at higher levels. There are, however, indications of some moderation in average salaries, and related unit labour costs, which are expected to remain below the 6% level over the forecast period. The outcome of a number of multi-year wage agreements that are due for renewal in 2017 will be closely watched as they could pose a risk to the inflation trajectory. The persistent global oil supply glut, along with increased shale gas production in the US, have undermined efforts by OPEC and other producers to support prices through output restrictions. Since the beginning of June. Brent crude oil prices have traded at levels below US$50 per barrel, and the Bank's oil price assumptions have been revised down over the forecast period. These recent oil price trends, along with the stronger exchange rate, contributed to a 69 cent per litre reduction in the petrol price in July. Following a weakening of the rand and a partial recovery in crude oil prices, a moderate petrol price increase is expected in August. MPC Statement July 20th, 2017 Page 7. MPC Statement July 20th, 2017 Page 7 The inflation outlook has improved significantly since the previous meeting of the MPC and has been fairly broad-based. The lower core inflation outlook is indicative of weaker underlying inflation pressures, at a time when the impact of exogenous shocks on headline inflation has been dissipating. These shocks include drought-induced food price inflation and to a lesser extent international oil price increases earlier this year that have since been reversed. A number of risks to the inflation outlook persist and the MPC assesses the risks to the inflation outlook to be broadly balanced. Although the rand has been relatively resilient, it remains vulnerable to heightened political uncertainty, global monetary policy developments and possible further credit ratings downgrades. On the positive side, it is supported by a sustained narrowing of the current account deficit and positive investor sentiment towards emerging markets. A further upside risk relates to the possible supply side shock of a large electricity tariff increase from July next year. Eskom has approached Nersa for an increase of around 20%, but the current forecast assumes an increase of 8%. This assumption will be adjusted in line with any new determinations made by Nersa. The MPC also remains concerned that inflation expectations remain sticky at the upper end of the target range. To the extent that these expectations are formed adaptively, they should adjust downwards if the lower inflation trajectory is sustained. The MPC would prefer expectations to be anchored closer to the mid-point of the target range. Underlying demand in the economy is extremely weak and the MPC is concerned about the deterioration in the growth outlook over the forecast period. It is unclear where the drivers of accelerated growth will come from in the absence of credible structural policy initiatives that will reduce uncertainty and increase business and consumer confidence. The MPC assesses the risks to the revised growth forecast to be slightly on the downside. MPC Statement July 20th, 2017 Page 8. MPC Statement July 20th, 2017 Page 8 Given the improved inflation outlook and the deteriorated growth outlook, the MPC has decided to reduce the repurchase rate by 25 basis points with effect from 21 July 2017, to 6.75% per annum. Four members preferred a reduction, while two members preferred an unchanged stance. As we have emphasised on numerous occasions, the MPC does not view monetary policy as the solution to the structural growth constraints in the economy. Nor does it believe that a reduction in interest rates will provide a significant stimulus to growth in the current environment of low confidence and political uncertainty. It will however provide some relief at the margin. In this highly uncertain environment, future policy decisions will be dependent on data outcomes and our assessment of the balance of risks. We remain vigilant and would not hesitate to reverse this decision should the inflation outlook and risks deteriorate.

Nigeria,2017-07-25,"CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO 114 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING OF 24th AND 25th JULY, 2017 Background The Monetary Policy Committee met on the 24th and 25th of July 2017, against the backdrop of a relatively improving global economy. However protectionism in trade and immigration; fragilities in the financial markets, remain the key risks to global economic stability. On the domestic front, the economy is on a path to moderate recovery with a positive short- to medium-term outlook, premised largely on fiscal stimulus and a stable naira exchange rate. Inflation expectations also appear sufficiently anchored with the current stance of monetary policy. In attendance were 8 out of 12 members of the Committee. The Committee examined the global and domestic economic and financial environments in the first half of 2017 and the outlook for the rest of the year. 2 External Developments The momentum witnessed in the global economy in Q1 2017 continued through the second quarter, driven by a generally accommodative monetary policy stance in most advanced economies, moderation in energy prices and improved global demand. The emerging markets and developing economies, are experiencing positive spillovers from somewhat improved commodity prices and developments in the advanced economies. The growth prospects for this group of countries in 2017 are expected to rise to about 46 per cent from 43 per cent in 2016. Complemented by the momentum in other blocks and a potential positive prospect for expansion in world trade, the IMF in its July edition of the World Economic Outlook (WEO) projected global output growth in 2017 at 35 per cent from 31 per cent in 2016. The MPC, however, noted some headwinds confronting the optimistic outlook to global growth arising mainly from receding market expectations of expansionary US. fiscal policy, weaker than expected growth in the UK due to difficult BREXIT negotiations and geo-political risks associated with the forthcoming German general elections. In addition, the Committee noted the downward trend in global inflation after earlier indications of an uptick as the US. continues to build up inventories in shale oil, while emerging 3 economies such as Brazil. Russia and South Africa witness strong economic headwinds leading to sharp downturn in output. Domestic Output Developments Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that the contraction in the economy moderated to 052 per cent in Q1 2017 from 130 per cent in Q4 2016. The data further revealed that fifteen economic activities recorded positive growth in Q1 2017, showing strong signs of recovery. The Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for manufacturing and non-manufacturing activities stood at 529 and 542 index points in May and June 2017, respectively from 527 and 525 index points in May 2017, indicating an expansion for the third consecutive month. Similarly the Composite Index of Economic Activities (CIEA) rose from 5585 to 5950 index points between April and June 2017. The Committee noted the continuous positive effects of improved foreign exchange management on the performance of manufacturing and other economic activities. Non-oil real GDP grew by 072 per cent in Q1 2017, reflecting growth in the agricultural sector by 077 per cent in the same period. Provisional data also showed that the external sector remained resilient in Q2 2017, as the overall Balance of Payments (BOP) position recorded a surplus of US$065 billion, equivalent to 08 per cent of GDP. The Committee hopes that the implementation of the 2017 budget and the 4 Economic Recovery & Growth Plan (ERGP) will further strengthen growth and stimulate employment. Developments in Money and Prices The Committee noted that money supply (M2) contracted by 733 per cent in June 2017, annualized to a contraction of 1466 per cent, in contrast to the provisional growth benchmark of 1029 per cent expansion for 2017. The development in M2 reflected a contraction of 745 per cent in net foreign assets (NFA) in June 2017. Similarly M1 contracted by 798 and 1070 per cent in May and June 2017, respectively, consistent with the directive of the MPC that expansion in narrow money should be controlled. On the other hand, net domestic credit (NDC) grew modestly by 102 per cent in June 2017, (annualized at 204 per cent), driven mainly by net credit to government, which grew by 591 per cent. Credit to the private sector, however, declined relative to end-December 2016 by 002 per cent. The MPC noted the widening fiscal deficit of N251 trillion in the first half of 2017 and the growing level of government indebtedness and expressed concern about the likely crowding out effect on private sector investment. The constrained growth in the monetary aggregates provides evidence of weak financial intermediation in the banking system arising from the constraints imposed by developments in the macroeconomy. 5 Headline inflation (year-on-year) declined for the fifth consecutive month in June 2017, to 1610 per cent from 1625 per cent in May, and 1872 per cent in January 2017. Core inflation moderated to 1250 per cent in June from 1300 per cent in May 2017 while the food index rose marginally to 1991 per cent in June from 1927 per cent in May 2017. This development was traced to intermittent attacks by herdsmen on farming communities, sporadic terrorist attacks in the North-East and other seasonal farming effects. The Committee was particularly concerned about the unabating pressure from food inflation but hopeful that the situation will dampen in the third quarter as harvests begin to manifest. The Committee also attributed the moderation in inflation to be partly due to the effects of the relative stability in the foreign exchange market, stemming from improved management, which promoted increased inflows. Against this backdrop, the Committee reiterated its commitment to sustain and deepen flexibility in the foreign exchange market to further enhance foreign exchange flow in the economy. The Committee, however, noted the protracted effects of high energy and transportation costs as well as other infrastructural constraints on consumer price developments and expressed hope that government will fast-track its reform agenda to address these legacy issues. The Committee noted that while responding to the current tight monetary policy stance, inflation still had a strong base effect which is expected to wane by August 2017. 6 Money market interest rates moved in tandem with the high level of liquidity in the banking system. The interbank call rate opened at 1613 per cent on May 25, 2017 and closed at 443 per cent on June 29, 2017. However the average inter-bank call rate during the period stood at 1249 per cent. The movement in the net liquidity position reflected the effects of OMO, foreign exchange interventions, statutory allocation to state and local governments, and maturity of CBN Bills. The Committee noted the improvements in the equities segment of the capital market as the All-Share Index (ASI) rose by 3333 per cent from 25,,51634 on March 31, 2017, to 34,,02037 on July 21, 2017. Similarly Market Capitalization (MC) rose by 3284 per cent from N883 trillion to N1173 trillion during the same period. Relative to end- December 2016, capital market indices rose by 2659 and 2681 per cent, respectively, reflecting growing investor confidence due to improvements in foreign exchange management. The Committee however, noted the seeming bubble in the capital market and cautioned on the utilization of the inflows. Total foreign exchange inflows through the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) increased by 3541 per cent in June 2017 compared with the previous month. Total outflows, on the other hand, decreased by 1273 per cent during the same period, as a result of reduced CBN intervention in the interbank foreign exchange market, which also reduced TSA (dollar) payments balances by 614 per cent in the 7 period under review. The positive net flows resulted in an improvement of gross external reserves to $3030 billion at end-June 2017, compared with $2981 billion at end-May 2017. The Committee noted the emerging convergence between the bureau-de-change (BDC) and Nigeria Autonomous Foreign Exchange (NAFEX) segment rates and the stability of the average naira exchange rate at the inter-bank segment of the foreign exchange market during the review period. Overall Outlook and Risks Available forecasts of key macroeconomic indicators point to a fragile economic recovery in the second quarter of the year. The Committee cautioned that this recovery could relapse in a more protracted recession if strong and bold monetary and fiscal policies are not activated immediately to sustain it. Thus the expected fiscal stimulus and non-oil federal receipts, as well as improvements in economy-wide non-oil exports, especially agriculture, manufacturing, services and light industries, all expected to drive the growth impetus for the rest of the year must be pursued relentlessly. The Committee expects that timely implementation of the 2017 Budget, improved management of foreign exchange, as well as security gains across the country, especially, in the Niger Delta and 8 North Eastern axis, should be firmly anchored, to enhance confidence and sustainability of economic recovery. The Committee identified the downside risks to this outlook to include weak financial intermediation, poorly targeted fiscal stimulus and absence of structural programme implementation. 9 30. The Considerations of the Committee Notwithstanding the improved outlook for growth, the Committee assessed the implications of the uncertainties arising from the continued normalization of monetary policy by the US Fed and the implications of a strong dollar, the weak recovery of commodity prices, and the uncertainty of US fiscal policy. The Committee similarly evaluated other challenges confronting the domestic economy and the opportunities for achieving economic growth and price stability in 2017. The Committee expressed satisfaction with the gradual but consistent decline in inflationary pressures in the domestic economy, noting its substantial base effect, continuous improvements in the naira exchange rate across all segments of the foreign exchange market, and considerable signs of improved investments inflows. The Committee welcomed the move by the fiscal authorities to engage the services of asset-tracing experts to investigate the tax payment status of 150 firms and individuals in an effort to close some of the loopholes in tax collection, towards improving government revenue. However the Committee expressed concern about the slow implementation of the 2017 Budget and called on the relevant authorities to ensure timely implementation, especially, of the capital portion in order to realize the objectives of the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan. 10 The MPC believes that at this point, developments in the macroeconomy suggest two policy options for the Committee: to hold or to ease the stance of monetary policy. Against the backdrop of the outlook for the domestic and global economy; the enthusiasm around the base-effect which reduced inflationary pressures and the continuous relative stability in the naira exchange rate, there is need to maintain cautious optimism, given the potential ramification of a major deviation from the existing policy path. The Committee is not unmindful of the high cost of capital and its implications on the still ailing economy, which arguably necessitates an accommodating monetary policy stance. The MPC also noted the liquidity surfeit in the banking system and the continuous weakness in financial intermediation, but agreed on the need to support growth without jeopardizing price stability or upsetting other recovering macroeconomic indicators, particularly the relative stability in the foreign exchange market. The MPC thinks that easing at this point would signal the Committeeâ€™s sensitivity to growth and employment concerns by encouraging the flow of credit to the real economy. It would also promote policy consistency and credibility of its decisions. Also the Committee observed that easing at this time would reduce the cost of debt service, which is actually crowding out government expenditure. The risks to easing however, would show in terms of upstaging the modest stability achieved in the foreign exchange 11 market, the possible exit of foreign portfolio investors as well as a resurgence of inflation following the intensified implementation of the 2017 budget in the course of the year. The Committee also reasoned that easing would further pull the real interest rate down into negative territory. The argument for holding is largely premised on the need to safeguard the stability achieved in the foreign exchange market, and to allow time for past policies to work through the economy. Specifically the MPC considered the high banking system liquidity level; the need to continue to attract foreign investment inflow to support the foreign exchange market and economic activity; the expansive outlook for fiscal policy in the rest of the year; the prospective election related spending which could cause a jump in system liquidity, etc. The MPC expressed concern over the increasing fiscal deficit estimated at N251 trillion in the first half of 2017 and the crowding out effect of high government borrowing. While urging fiscal restraint to check the growing deficit, the Committee welcomed the proposal by government to issue sovereign-backed promissory notes of about N34 trillion for the settlement of accumulated local debt and contractors arrears. The Committee, however, advised the Management of the Bank to monitor the release process of the promissory notes to avoid an excessive injection of liquidity into the 12 system thereby offsetting the gains so far achieved in inflation and exchange rate stability. On the outlook for financial system stability, the Committee noted that, in spite of the resilience of the banking sector, the prolonged weak macroeconomic environment has continued to impact negatively on the sectorâ€™s stability. The MPC reiterated its call on the Bank to sustain its intensive surveillance of deposit money banksâ€™ activities for the purpose of promptly identifying and addressing vulnerabilities. The Committee also called on the DMBs to support economic recovery and growth by extending reasonably priced credit to the private sector. The Committeeâ€™s Decisions In consideration of the headwinds confronting the domestic economy and the uncertainties in the global environment, the Committee decided by a vote of 6 to 2 to retain the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) at 140 per cent alongside all other policy parameters. Consequently 6 members voted to retain the MPR and all other parameters at their current levels while two members voted to ease the stance of monetary policy. In summary, the MPC decided to: Retain the MPR at 14 per cent; Retain the CRR at 225 per cent; 13 Retain the Liquidity Ratio at 3000 per cent; and Retain the Asymmetric corridor at +200 and -500 basis points around the MPR. Thank you for listening. Godwin I Emefiele Governor. Central Bank of Nigeria 25th July, 2017."
Brazil,2017-07-26,"The Copom unanimously decided to reduce the Selic rate by one percentage point, to 9.25 percent per year, without bias. The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario:. The set of indicators of economic activity released since the last Copom meeting remains consistent with stabilization of the Brazilian economy in the short run and gradual recovery. The recent increase in uncertainty regarding the evolution of reforms and adjustments in the economy had a negative impact on confidence indices. However, available information suggests that the impact of this drop in confidence on economic activity has been limited so far. The global outlook has been favorable, as global economic activity remains on a gradual recovery path, without pressuring financial conditions in developed economies. This has contributed to support risk appetite towards emerging economies. In addition, changes in economic policy in some central economies have become less likely. Inflation developments remain favorable. Disinflation is widespread and includes IPCA components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy. So far, the short-run effects of higher uncertainty regarding the evolution of reforms and adjustments in the economy have been neither inflationary nor disinflationary. Inflation expectations collected by the Focus survey for 2017 and 2018 fell to around 3.3% and 4,2%, respectively. Expectations for 2019 are around 4.25%, and expectations for 2020 are around 4.00%; and. The Copom's inflation projections for 2017 and 2018 in the scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the Focus survey retreated to around 3.6% and 4.3%, respectively. This scenario assumes a path for the policy interest rate that ends 2017 at 8.0% and remains at that level until the end of 2018. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the wide array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to reduce the Selic rate by one percentage point, to 9.25 percent per year, without bias. The Committee judges that convergence of inflation to the 4.5% target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, which includes 2018, is compatible with the monetary easing process. The Copom emphasizes that the extension of the monetary easing cycle will depend on cyclical factors and on estimates of the structural interest rate of the Brazilian economy. The Committee judges that the evolution of reforms and adjustments in the economy (especially those that pertain to fiscal and credit policies) is important for the reduction of estimates of the structural interest rate. The Committee will continue to reassess these estimates over time. The Copom emphasizes that, despite the increase in uncertainty regarding the evolution of reforms and adjustments in the economy, the continuation of economic conditions so far has allowed the same pace of monetary easing at this meeting. Regarding the next Copom meeting, maintenance of this pace will depend on the continuation of conditions described in the Committee's baseline scenario and on estimates of the extension of the monetary easing cycle. The pace of easing will continue to depend on the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, possible reassessments of the extension of the cycle, and on inflation forecasts and expectations. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Ilan Goldfajn (Governor). Anthero de Moraes Meirelles. Carlos Viana de Carvalho. Isaac Sidney Menezes Ferreira. Luiz Edson Feltrim. Otavio Ribeiro Damaso. Reinaldo Le Grazie. Sidnei Corr=AAa Marques, and Tiago Couto Berriel."
Georgia,2017-07-26,"26.07.2017 The NBG has decided to keep its monetary policy rate unchanged at 7.0% The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on 26th of July, 2017 and decided to keep the refinancing rate unchanged at 7 percent. In the second quarter of 2017, the hike of inflation is in line with existing forecasts, according to which due to one-time, supply side factors, the inflation is expected to remain above the target rate for the remainder of the year. In June, the annual inflation rate has increased, reaching 7.1%. The price increase on Tobacco products and fuel has contributed by 2.6 percentage points. The increase in the inflation rate is temporary, it is expected inflation to start declining from the second half of the 2017 and with the after the impact of one-off factors will die out in the beginning of 2018 the inflation will converge to its target level. Thus, there is no need for further tightening of monetary policy. Given the absence of additional shocks in the medium term, the policy rate is expected to decrease to its neutral level. In the first half of 2017, economic growth indicators reveal higher than expected growth, which can be attributed to the improvement of the external sector. In particular growth of exports of goods and services (tourism) should be noted, as well as the increase in remittances. Along with the rise of external inflows, consumption has increased, contributing to economic growth.Yet, domestic demand and overall economic activity are still below its potential level; thus, it does not create demand side pressure on inflation. In the second quarter of 2017, the annual growth rate of the bank lending is around 15%. The growth of credit portfolio can be attributed to loans issued in the national currency, allowing price stability to be achieved with only moderate changes in the policy rate. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all means and instruments at its disposal to maintain financial and price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on 6th of September, 2017."
United States,2017-07-26,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising moderately so far this year. Job gains have been solid, on average, since the beginning of the year, and the unemployment rate has declined. Household spending and business fixed investment have continued to expand. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and the measure excluding food and energy prices have declined and are running below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee continues to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further. Inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to remain somewhat below 2 percent in the near term but to stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1 to 1-1/4 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. For the time being, the Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. The Committee expects to begin implementing its balance sheet normalization program relatively soon, provided that the economy evolves broadly as anticipated; this program is described in the June 2017 Addendum to the Committee's Policy Normalization Principles and Plans. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Janet L Yellen. Chair; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Lael Brainard; Charles L Evans; Stanley Fischer; Patrick Harker; Robert S Kaplan; Neel Kashkari; and Jerome H Powell. Implementation Note issued July 26, 2017."
Colombia,2017-07-27,"Pgina relacionada. Minutes of the Meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica on July 27, 2017. The Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica at today's meeting decided to reduce the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp to 5.5%. For this decision, the Board mainly took into account the following aspects. In June, annual consumer inflation stood at 3.99%, and the average of core inflation indicators posted at 5.09%. These figures are lower than those registered a month ago. Analysts' inflation expectations to December 2017 and 2018 lowered, reaching 4.28% and 3.52%, respectively. Those embedded in public debt bonds recorded modest changes, and are slightly above 3.0% for 2018. The effects of the strong transitory supply shocks that deviated inflation from its target continue to fade. This is suggested by the slowdown in the food CPI and the behavior of the prices which are more sensitive to the exchange rate. The average of core inflation indicators declined more slowly as a consequence of the indexation of prices and the effect of the transitory increase in indirect taxes. The contribution of food CPI to the decline in annual inflation may reverse during the second half of this year. For this reason, forecasts indicate that annual inflation could increase slightly in that period. Forecasts for the price of oil and the terms of trade for the rest of 2017 lowered, but continue to reflect increases versus the averages recorded in 2016. External demand remains weak, and its growth is expected to be somewhat higher than the figure registered a year ago. In the last month, country risk spreads were relatively stable, and the peso depreciated vis--vis the US dollar. Recent figures of economic activity for the second quarter suggest that output would have grown at a low rate, similar to the one recorded in the first quarter. The dynamics of domestic demand would have been weak, although somewhat better than three months ago. Net exports would have been similar to those of the first quarter of 2017. Based on this information, the Board considered the following factors for its decision. The increasing weakness in economic activity and the risk of a slowdown beyond what is compatible with the deterioration in the dynamics of income due to the fall in oil prices. Recent indicators confirm an excess capacity of the economy, although its magnitude is highly uncertain. Uncertainty about the pace of convergence of inflation to its 3.0% target. Indexation mechanisms and the persistence of inflation continue to be reflected on core inflation indicators, which exceed the inflation target (3.0%). The current level of the real policy interest rate ex-ante is contractionary. With this, the Board of Directors decided to reduce the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp. The decision to reduce the benchmark interest rate was approved by six members of the Board. The remaining member voted not to modify the benchmark interest rate."
Turkiye,2017-07-27,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels:. a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate at 9.25 percent and borrowing rate at 7.25 percent,. b) One-week repo rate at 8 percent,. c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, and lending rate at 12.25 percent. Recently released data indicate an ongoing recovery in the economic activity. Domestic demand conditions have improved and demand from the European Union economies continues to contribute positively to exports. The economic activity is expected to maintain its strength due to the supportive measures and incentives provided recently. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly. Although recent improvements in cost factors and expected partial correction in food prices will contribute to disinflation, current elevated levels of inflation pose risks on the pricing behavior. Accordingly, the Committee decided to maintain the tight stance of monetary policy. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. Tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained until inflation outlook displays a significant improvement. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Russia,2017-07-28,"On 28 July 2017, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to keep the key rate at 9.00% per annum. The Board notes that inflation remains close to the target level, while economic recovery is continuing. At the same time, short-term and mid-term inflation risks persist. The decline of inflation expectations has come to a halt, consistent with predictions, in response to price movements in a number of products and services. In order to maintain inflation close to the 4% target, the Bank of Russia will continue to conduct moderately tight monetary policy. The Bank of Russia sees room for cutting the key rate in the second half of 2017. While making its decision hereinafter, the Bank of Russia will assess inflation risks, the inflation dynamics and economic developments against the forecast. In making its key rate decision, the Bank of Russia was guided by the following assumptions. Inflation dynamics. Inflation remains close to the target. June saw a slight short-term rise in inflation to 4.4%, which came as a result of price movements in fruit and vegetables under the influence of bad weather conditions. At the same time, the trend towards sustainably low inflation remains in place. Growth rates of food product prices, but for fruit and vegetables, continued to slow, so did prices in the non-food product market and core inflation. Price growth rates continue to show consistency both across regions and in the consumer basket. This is reflected in the growing proportion of products and services posting price growth rates around 4%. In this environment, recovering consumer demand alongside the decline of its disinflationary effect brings no material risks. In the months ahead, as new harvest comes in, prices for fruit and vegetables are set to show a seasonal downward trend. Consistent with expectations, the seasonal rise in prices on individual food products brought about a temporary halt in the decline of household and corporate inflation expectations. Their performance could also have been impacted by the traditional rise in regulated prices and tariffs. The weakening of the ruble in June and July had no meaningful implications for annual inflation and inflation expectations, given its substantial strengthening observed since early this year. For inflation to become anchored close to the 4% target, sustainable decline in inflation expectations in required. Monetary conditions. Monetary conditions are crucial in the efforts to bring about sustainably low inflation. They are adjusting to the key rate reduction. Interest rates on loans have declined but their level supports moderate demand for borrowing. Banks continue to adhere to a conservative policy by mitigating price and non-price lending conditions, primarily for reliable borrowers. The slowdown in the growth of household deposits mainly comes as a result of the declining paces of money supply growth, triggered by fiscal operations, rather than as a result of declining deposit rates. The Bank of Russia will continue to set such monetary conditions which will support the propensity to save and warrant balanced growth in consumption, thereby curbing inflation risks. Economic activity. The economic activity is rebounding. Positive trends in industrial production are gaining momentum, freight turnover is growing, and construction has turned to recovery. Growth in household consumption expenditures went up along with the increase in investment and production. A moderate increase in consumer spending is not adding inflationary pressure as the supply of goods and services expands. Annual GDP is to grow by 1.3-1.8%. At the same time, economic growth is nearing its potential level. It is constrained, among other things, by the situation in the labour market where shortages of labour force are already visible in some segments. Further GDP growth above 1.5-2% a year is attainable if structural reforms are put in place. Inflation risks. Short-term inflation risks persist as regards harvest prospects and their impact on food prices and inflation expectations. Furthermore, volatility in global commodity and financial markets, as well as exchange rate dynamics amid elevated geopolitical risks may have negative implications for exchange rate and inflation expectations. The sources of medium-term risks remain unchanged. First, they are connected with further movements of oil prices which are lower than expected in the light of the agreements achieved. Legislative consolidation and implementation of the budget rule will mitigate these risks. Second, growth in the productivity of labour may lag considerably behind the wage growth as structural shortage of labour force aggravates. Third, inflationary pressure may stem from changes in households' behaviour as their propensity to save can become considerably lower. Fourth, inflation expectations remain sensitive to changing prices of individual groups of goods and services and exchange rate movements. Fifth, the likely tax manoeuvre may result in a temporary acceleration of inflation. These factors call for moderately tight monetary conditions to remain in place for a long time for inflation to become anchored close to target. While making its decision hereinafter, the Bank of Russia will assess inflation risks, the inflation dynamics and economic developments against the forecast.

India,2017-08-02,"Third Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2017-18 Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) Reserve Bank of India On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation at its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to: reduce the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 25 basis points from 6.25 per cent to 6.0 per cent with immediate effect. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF stands adjusted to 5.75 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate to 6.25 per cent. The decision of the MPC is consistent with a neutral stance of monetary policy in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Assessment 2. Since the June 2017 meeting of the MPC, impulses of growth have spread across the global economy albeit still lacking the strength of a self-sustaining recovery. Among the advanced economies (AEs), the US has expanded at a faster pace in Q2 after a weak Q1, supported by steadily improving labour market conditions, increasing consumer spending, upbeat consumer confidence helped by softer than expected inflation, and improving industrial production. Policy and political risks, however, continue to cloud the outlook. In the Euro area, the recovery has broadened across constituent economies on the back of falling unemployment and a pickup in private consumption; political uncertainty has receded substantially. In Japan, a modest but steady expansion has been taking hold, underpinned by strengthening exports, accelerating industrial production and wage reflation. Among emerging market economies (EMEs), growth has regained some lost ground in China in Q2, with retail sales and industrial production rising at a steady pace. Nonetheless, tightening financial conditions on account of deleveraging financial institutions and slowdown in real estate could weigh negatively. The Russian economy has emerged out of two years of recession, aided by falling unemployment, rising retail sales and strong industrial production. In Brazil, a fragile recovery remains vulnerable to political uncertainty and a still depressed labour market. Economic activity in South Africa continues to be beset by structural and institutional bottlenecks and is in a technical recession. The modest firming up of global demand and stable commodity prices have supported global trade volumes, reflected in rising exports and imports in key economies. In the second half of July, crude prices have risen modestly out of bearish territory on account of inventory drawdown in the US, but the supply overhang persists. Chinese demand has fuelled a recent2017-18 set by the Ministry of Agriculture at a higher level than the peak attained in the previous year. Meanwhile, procurement operations in respect of rice and wheat during the rabi marketing season have been stepped up to record levels  36.1 million tonnes in April-June 2017  and stocks have risen to 1.5 times the buffer norm for the quarter ending September. Industrial performance has weakened in April-May 2017. This mainly reflected a broad-based loss of speed in manufacturing. Excess inventories of coal and near stagnant output of crude oil and refinery products combined to slow down mining activity. For electricity generation, deficiency of demand seems to remain a binding constraint. In terms of uses, the output of consumer non-durables accelerated and underlined the resilience of rural demand. It was overwhelmed, however, by contraction in consumer durables  indicative of still sluggish urban demand  and in capital goods, which points to continuing retrenchment of capital formation in the economy. The weakness in the capex cycle was also evident in the number of new investment announcements falling to a 12-year low in Q1, the lack of traction in the implementation of stalled projects, deceleration in the output of infrastructure goods, and the ongoing deleveraging in the corporate sector. The output of core industries was also dragged down by contraction in electricity, coal and fertiliser production in June, owing to excess inventory and tepid demand. On the positive side, natural gas recorded an uptick in production after a prolonged decline and steel output remained strong. The 78th round of the Reserve Bank's industrial outlook survey (IOS) revealed a waning of optimism in Q2 about demand conditions across parameters, and especially on capacity utilisation, profit margins and employment. The manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) moderated sequentially to a four-month low in June and the future output index also eased marginally. In July, the PMI declined into the contraction zone with a decrease in new orders and a deterioration in business conditions, reflecting inter alia the roll out of the GST; however, both new export orders and the future output index rose, reflecting optimism in the outlook.3. Surplus liquidity conditions persisted in the system, exacerbated by front-loading of budgetary spending by the Government. There was also some moderation in the pace of increase in currency in circulation (CiC) which is typical at this time of the year  as against the increase of 1.5 trillion in CiC during the first two months of 2017-18, it was 436 billion and 95 billon during June and July, respectively. Normally, currency returns to the banking system in these months and is reflected in a decline in CiC; consequently, the increase in CiC recorded this year reflects the sustained pace of remonetisation and the associated absorption of liquidity from the system. Surplus liquidity of 1 trillion was absorbed through issuance of treasury bills (TBs) under the market stabilisation scheme (MSS) and 1.3 trillion through cash management bills (CMBs) on a cumulative basis so far this financial year. Enduring surplus conditions warranted outright open market sales of 100 billion each on two occasions in June and July. Another auction of an equivalent amount has been announced and will be conducted on August 10, 2017. Apart from these operations, net average absorption of liquidity under the LAF was at 3.1 trillion in June and 3.0 trillion in4. Turning to the external sector, merchandise export growth weakened in May and June from the April peak as the value of shipments across commodity groups either slowed or declined. By contrast, import growth remained in double digits, primarily due to a surge in oil imports and stockpiling of gold imports ahead of the implementation of the GST. Imports of coal, electronic goods, pearls and precious stones, vegetable oils and machinery also accelerated. As import growth continued to outpace export growth, the trade deficit at US$ 40.1 billion in Q1 was more than double its level a year ago. Net foreign direct investment doubled in April-May 2017 over its level a year ago, flowing mainly into manufacturing, retail and wholesale trade and business services. Foreign portfolio investors made net purchases of US$ 15.2 billion in domestic debt and equity markets so far (up to July 31), remaining bullish on the outlook for the Indian economy. The level of foreign exchange reserves was US$ 392.9 billion as on July 28, 2017. Outlook 15. The second bi-monthly statement projected quarterly average headline inflation in the range of 2.0-3.5 per cent in the first half of the year and 3.5-4.5 per cent in the second half. The actual outcome for Q1 has tracked projections. Looking ahead, as base effects fade, the evolving momentum of inflation would be determined by (a) the impact on the CPI of the implementation of house rent allowances (HRA) under the 7th central pay commission (CPC); (b) the impact of the price revisions withheld ahead of the GST; and (c) the disentangling of the structural and transitory factors shaping food inflation. The inflation trajectory has been updated taking into account all these factors and incorporates the first round impact of the implementation of the HRA award by the Centre (Chart 1). There are several factors contributing to uncertainty around this baseline inflation trajectory. Implementation of farm loan waivers by States may result in possible fiscal slippages and undermine the quality of public spending, entailing inflationary spillovers. Moreover, the timing of the States' implementation of the salary and allowances award is critical  it is not factored into the baseline projection in view of lack of information on their plans. If States choose to implement salary and allowance increases similar to the Centre in the current financial year, headline inflation could rise by an additional estimated 100 basis points above the baseline over 18-24 months. Also, high frequency indicators suggest that price pressures are building up in vegetables and animal proteins in the near months. There are, however, some moderating forces at work. First, the second successive normal monsoon coupled with effective supply management measures may keep food inflation under check. Second, if the general moderation of price increases in CPI excluding food and fuel continues, it will contain upside pressures on headline inflation. Third, the international commodity price outlook is fairly stable at the current juncture. Business sentiment polled in the manufacturing sector reflects expectations of moderation of activity in Q2 of 2017-18 from the preceding quarter. Moreover, high levels of stress in twin balance sheets  banks and corporations  are likely to deter new investment. With the real estate sector coming under the regulatory umbrella, new project launches may involve extended gestations and, along with the anticipated consolidation in the sector, may restrain growth, with spillovers to construction and ancillary activities. Also, given the limits on raising market borrowings and taxes by States, farm loan waivers are likely to compel a cutback on capital expenditure, with adverse implications for the already damped capex cycle. At the same time, upsides to the baseline projections emanate from the rising probability of another good kharif harvest, the boost to rural demand from the higher budgetary allocation to housing in rural areas, the significant step-up in the budgetary allocation for roads and5 basis points. Noting, however, that the trajectory of inflation in the baseline projection is expected to rise from current lows, the MPC decided to keep the policy stance neutral and to watch incoming data. The MPC remains focused on its commitment to keeping headline inflation close to 4 per cent on a durable basis. On the state of the economy, the MPC is of the view that there is an urgent need to reinvigorate private investment, remove infrastructure bottlenecks and provide a major thrust to the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana for housing needs of all. This hinges on speedier clearance of projects by the States. On their part, the Government and the Reserve Bank are working in close coordination to resolve large stressed corporate borrowers and recapitalise public sector banks within the fiscal deficit target. These efforts should help restart credit flows to the productive sectors as demand revives.6, 2017. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled on October 3 and 4, 2017. Jose J.

Czech Republic,2017-08-03,"<At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank decided unanimously to increase the two-week repo rate by 20 basis points to 0.25% The Lombard rate was increased by 25 basis points to 0.50%. The discount rate was left unchanged at 0.05%.. The decision adopted by the Bank Board is underpinned by a new macroeconomic forecast of the Czech National Bank. Consistent with the forecast is an increase in domestic market interest rates in 2017 Q3. According to the forecast, inflation will stay in the upper half of the tolerance band for the rest of this year and decrease towards the 2% target at the start of next year. According to the assumptions of the new forecast, economic growth in the effective euro area will fluctuate around 2% over the entire forecast horizon. It will be highest in the second half of this year. Growth in industrial producer prices will slow this year and early next year. This will be due mainly to the fading effect of the previous rise in prices of energy and industrial commodities. Producer price inflation in the euro area will then rise again. Consumer price inflation in effective terms will increase slightly. The outlook for 3M EURIBOR market rates is negative until early 2019 on account of the European Central Bank's still easy monetary policy. The euro-dollar exchange rate is expected to remain relatively stable. The Brent crude oil price will be close to the current levels, i.e. around USD 50 a barrel, over the entire forecast horizon. According to the new forecast, domestic inflation will stay in the upper half of the tolerance band around the 2% target this year. Inflation pressures are currently peaking, reflecting accelerating growth in wages and economic activity. Growth in domestic costs will slow in the period ahead due to rising labour productivity growth, which will increasingly offset the impact of faster growth in wages and economic activity. The current already only slightly inflationary effect of import prices will quickly turn anti-inflationary. This will reflect subdued foreign producer price inflation and a strengthening koruna. Inflation will thus decrease towards the Czech National Bank's 2% target in early 2018 and will be slightly below it over the monetary policy horizon. Core inflation will meanwhile fluctuate stably around 2%. The growth of the Czech economy will accelerate visibly above 3% this year. It will stay slightly above this level in the following two years. Growth in domestic economic activity will be driven by robust growth in household consumption. This will continue to reflect optimism of consumers in an environment of ongoing employment growth, accelerating wages and low interest rates. At the same time, investment will recover, especially in the government sector as a result of higher drawdown of EU funds. The economy will also benefit from continued demand growth in the Czech Republic's main trading partner countries. However, its favourable effect on net exports will be gradually outweighed by rising domestic demand and a stronger exchange rate. Stable growth in labour demand coupled with an increasingly distinct shortage of available labour will manifest itself in robust wage growth. Consistent with the forecast is an increase in domestic market interest rates in 2017 Q3 and later also in the following two years. However, the return of interest rates to their long-run neutral level will be strongly hampered until around mid-2018 by the European Central Bank's ongoing quantitative easing. According to the forecast, the koruna will appreciate further against the euro. The appreciation will be due to continued real convergence of the Czech economy to the euro area, a positive interest rate differential vis-Ã -vis the euro area and ongoing asset purchases by the European Central Bank. However, the exchange rate forecast does not take into account that the appreciation of the koruna may still be strongly dampened in the coming quarters by market â€œoverboughtnessâ€. This is due to exchange rate risk hedging by exporters before the exit from the exchange rate commitment and the large koruna positions of financial investors. Compared to the previous forecast, the outlook for inflation and market interest rates is almost unchanged. However, the GDP growth forecast has shifted higher, due largely to faster expected household consumption growth and investment growth."
Ukraine,2017-08-03,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to keep its key policy rate at 12.5% per annum. The decision reflects the need to mitigate inflation risks to achieving the inflation targets. Annual headline inflation peaked in June 2017 and is projected to gradually trend downwards. In June, actual inflation (15.6% yoy) came in above the NBU's projections, reflecting a sharp increase in raw food prices. Prices for meat and milk accelerated further in annual terms, driven by rising global prices and large exports. Prices for fruit and vegetables rose at a faster-than-expected pace as well, reflecting a partial crop loss and changes in the SSSU methodology for calculating the CPI (for more details, follow the link). There is a high probability that in monthly terms, deflation will be recorded in July that will continue in August, gradually bringing the annual inflation reading closer to the path projected by the NBU. In particular, prices for fruit and vegetables reported a substantial fall in recent weeks, according to SSSU monitoring of selected consumer good prices, as well as web-scrapped data from the online supermarkets collected by the NBU. Core inflation rose to 6.8% yoy in June, accelerating further in July, according to the NBU estimates,. The acceleration was driven by secondary effects from rising raw food prices, higher production costs, including labor costs, as well as a further increase in dwelling maintenance tariffs. Meanwhile, inflation was restrained by the strengthening of the hryvnia against the US dollar, which, inter alia, occurred due to favorable global price conditions for commodities, prevailing in Ukrainian exports and improving exchange rate expectations. The latter stimulated households to actively sell foreign currency cash. The NBU, remaining committed to a flexible exchange regime, did not counteract a gradual appreciation of the hryvnia driven by fundamental factors. Overall favorable FX market conditions enabled the NBU to purchase foreign currency to replenish international reserves, with the NBU's net FX purchases having reached about USD 1.4 billion since the start of the year. Domestic demand, particularly investment and consumer demand, is gradually strengthening. Further output expansion in the construction sector indicates investment activity remained high. High paces of growth in retail trade turnover (9.0% yoy in June 2017) signaled about increasing role of consumer demand in driving economic growth. An increase in wages and an improvement of consumer confidence have contributed to the pick-up in private consumption. The Inflation Report published in July 2017 envisages annual inflation to decelerate 9.1% by year-end. Since the publication of the Inflation Report the risks have increased that 2017 year-end inflation may deviate more significantly from the mid-point of the target range (8% Â± 2 pp) than previously expected. In particular, a rather sharp recovery in consumer demand, which can be further bolstered by a rise in budgetary spending and pension payments in the second half of 2017, poses the risk of increasing underlying inflation pressures. Also, high headline inflation may pressure the trend towards an improvement in inflation expectations, which has been observed in the past two years, to reverse. However, an appropriately tight monetary policy may help anchor inflation expectations and return inflation to the mid-point of the target range throughout the first half of 2018. (For reference: According to the NBU Boardâ€˜s Proposals to the Monetary Policy Guidelines for 2018 and Medium Term, the target bands for annual headline inflation are set as follows: 7.5% Â± 2 pp by the end of Q1 2018 and 7.0% Â± 2 pp by the end of Q2 2018. The need to return inflation to the target may require the NBU to keep its key policy rate at its current level until the central bank sees clear signs of alleviation of inflation risks. The NBU Board is confident that the achievement of price stability is key to sustainable economic growth. This being said, the NBU Board considers it possible to move ahead with gradual FX liberalization through the relaxation of administrative restrictions provided that this move will not destabilize the FX market. The NBU will resume its monetary easing cycle once inflation risks abate and inflation expectations become well anchored. This is contingent on continued cooperation with the IMF, which envisages the implementation of structural reforms, as well as the the authorities' commitment to prudent fiscal policy. At the same time, should underlying inflation pressure increase, the NBU will implement a rather tight monetary policy for a longer term to put inflation back on a downward trend in accordance with the announced targets. The decision to keep the key policy rate at 12.5% is approved by NBU Board Decision No. 493D On the Key Policy Rate, dated 3 July 2017. The next meeting of the NBU Board on monetary policy issues will be held on 14 September 2017 as scheduled."
Romania,2017-08-04," Video: Press conference, 8 August 2017 - Quarterly Inflation Report (Romanian only) Video: Press briefing, 4 August 2017 (Romanian only) Board meeting minutes. In its meeting of 4 August 2017, the Board of the National Bank of Romania (NBR) decided the following:. The annual inflation rate followed a steeper upward trend in June 2017, standing at a higher-than-forecasted 0.85 percent, against 0.64 percent in the prior month. Behind this increase stood the evolution of volatile food prices and tobacco prices, as well as the acceleration of core inflation. Their effects were partly offset by the impact of slower annual dynamics of fuel prices. In the absence of the VAT rate cut and other changes in the non-tax fees and charges, the inflation rate would have climbed to 1.9 percent in June 2017 and stayed in the variation band of the flat target. The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate1 saw, in its turn, a higher-than-forecasted level, reaching 1.42 percent in June 2017, from 1.29 percent in May 2017, on account of a faster pick-up in processed food prices and, to a lower extent, owing to developments in services prices. The average annual CPI inflation rate turned further less negative to -0.1 percent in June 2017, from -0.2 percent in May 2017; calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, the annual average consolidated in positive territory at 0.2 percent, against 0.1 percent in May 2017. Revised economic growth data for 2017 Q1 reconfirm the step-up in the annual dynamics of real GDP to 5.7 percent (from 4.8 percent in the previous quarter). The faster growth rate owed entirely to domestic demand  private consumption expanded by 7.3 percent (contributing 5.3 percentage points to GDP growth) under the impact of fiscal and wage measures and the improvement in employment, whereas gross fixed capital formation posted a slower decline (-1 percent from -14.2 percent, thus causing its negative contribution to shrink to -0.2 percentage points from -3.8 percentage points in the previous quarter). Although still positive, the contribution of net exports to GDP growth dropped significantly (to 0.2 percentage points), amid the narrowing of the favourable spread between the growth rate of exports of goods and services (among the fastest over the last three years) and that of imports thereof. On the supply side, the main driver of the stronger advance in economic activity in 2017 Q1 was industrial activity, whose annual dynamics of 6.8 percent were the highest in 12 quarters. Statistical data for the first two months of Q2 indicate a step-up in the annual pace of increase of industrial output and new orders in manufacturing, as well as further rapid growth rates of the exports and imports of goods. In the same period, the turnover in trade and services to households saw a fast-paced rise, while the activity in the construction sector witnessed a steeper decline. The annual increase in unit wage costs in industry slowed down versus the previous quarter, against the backdrop of new productivity gains (especially in the auto sub-sector), as well as of the base effect associated with the hike in the minimum wage in May 2016; however, in consumer goods industries, it remained stuck at two-digit levels. Real monetary conditions have a pronounced stimulative nature. The annual dynamics of credit to the private sector resumed its rise in June, reaching 4.2 percent, from 3.2 percent in the previous month, due largely to a renewed pick-up in the growth of leu-denominated component to non-financial corporations and both local- and foreign-currency loans to non-monetary financial institutions. The share of leu-denominated credit in total private sector loans continued to widen to 60.2 percent, a record high since December 1996. This certifies the improvement in monetary policy transmission, while also helping mitigate risks to financial stability. In today's meeting, the NBR Board examined and approved the August 2017 Inflation Report, which incorporates the most recent data and information available. The new scenario of the projection reconfirms the prospects for a speed-up in inflation throughout the forecast interval. Compared to the previous Report, the rising path of the projected annual inflation rate was revised upwards over the entire forecast period, particularly in the short term, remaining, however, within the variation band of the target. The uncertainties and risks associated with this outlook stem from the domestic and external environment. Domestically, they are compounded by the fiscal and income policy stance, also ahead of the envisaged budget revision. Turning to the external environment, further relevant are the uncertainties and risks relative to economic growth and inflation developments in the euro area and worldwide, amid Brexit talks and the US economic policies. Monetary policy stances of the major central banks and their implications on the local financial market, also in the present and future economic and financial context in the region, continue to generate uncertainty and risks as well. Given the current assessments, the information available at present, and the new sources of uncertainty, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided to keep unchanged the monetary policy rate at 1.75 percent per annum, to further pursue adequate liquidity management in the banking system, and to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The decisions aim to ensure and preserve price stability over the medium term in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth. The NBR Board reiterates that a balanced macroeconomic policy mix and progress in structural reforms are of the essence in preserving a stable macroeconomic framework and strengthening the capacity of the Romanian economy to withstand potential adverse global developments. The NBR is closely monitoring domestic and external developments and stands ready to use all its available tools. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be presented to the public in a press conference on 8 August 2017. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR website on 11 August 2017, at 3:00 p.m. In line with the announced calendar, the next monetary policy meeting of the NBR Board is scheduled for 3 October 2017. 1 Calculated by excluding from the consumer price index the following categories: administered prices, volatile prices, and tobacco and alcoholic beverage prices."
Philippines,2017-08-09,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) facility at 3.0 percent. The corresponding interest rates on the overnight lending and deposit facilities were also kept steady. The reserve requirement ratios were likewise left unchanged. The Monetary Board's decision is based on its assessment that the inflation environment remains manageable. While inflation forecasts have risen slightly due to the recent increase in global oil prices, the future inflation path continues to be within the target for 2017-2019. Meanwhile, inflation expectations also remain firmly anchored close to the midpoint of the Government's 3 percent Â± 1 percentage point target over the policy horizon. The Monetary Board also recognizes that the balance of risks to the inflation outlook continues to be on the upside. While the proposed tax reform program may exert potential transitory pressures on prices, various social safety nets and the resulting improvement in productivity will likely temper the impact on inflation over the medium term. At the same time, while output prospects for the global economy have improved, downside risks to external demand remain, due in part to geopolitical tensions and lingering uncertainty over macroeconomic policies in advanced economies. The outlook for domestic economic activity continues to be firm, supported by buoyant consumer and business sentiment and ample liquidity. Moreover, as credit activity expands in line with output growth, the economy's improving absorptive capacity is likewise seen to be sustained, thus mitigating inflation pressures over the long run. Nonetheless, the Monetary Board continues to pay close attention to the evolving economic growth and liquidity conditions and their implications for price and financial stability. With these considerations, the Monetary Board believes that prevailing monetary policy settings continue to be appropriate. Looking ahead, the BSP will remain vigilant against any risks to the inflation outlook and will adjust its policy settings as needed to ensure that future inflation stays aligned with the medium-term target while being supportive of sustainable economic growth."
Peru,2017-08-10,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR AUGUST 2017 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 3.75% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 3.75 percent. This decision takes into account the following factors: Inflation remains within the target range and inflation without food and energy has continued to decline within the inflation target range. Both rates are expected to converge to 2.0 percent by the end of the year; Expectations of inflation in 12 months have also continued to decrease within the inflation target range; The pace of growth of domestic economic activity continues to be below its potential growth level. Economic activity is expected to recover in the following quarters as a result of increased government and private spending, and The world economy continues to show a gradual recovery, although there is still some uncertainty about the policies of developed countries, particularly about the reversal of central banks' monetary stimulus in these economies. The Board gives special close attention to new data on inflation and inflation determinants, especially data about inflation expectations and the evolution of economic activity, to continue easing the monetary policy stance in the short term. Inflation in July recorded a rate of 0.20 percent, as a result of which the year-to-year rate of inflation rose from 2.73 percent in June to 2.85 percent in July, within the target range. Inflation without food and energy showed a rate of 0.17 percent, as a result of which the year-to-year rate fell from 2.38 percent in June to 2.36 percent in July, within the target range as well. Inflation is forecast to remain within this range during 2017 and 2018. The indicators of business expectations remain on the optimistic side and GDP is expected to grow between 2.5 and 3.0 percent in 2017. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 2.50 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 4.30 percent for the first 15 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 15 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.30 percent. The Board of BCRP will approve the Monetary Program for September on its meeting of September 14, 2017."
Armenia,2017-08-15,"PRESS RELEASE 15.08.2017 On the August 15th of 2017 meeting the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia decided to leave the refinancing rate unchanged, at the 6.0% level. At the end of the second quarter of 2017 the 12â€month inflation rate was 1.1%, which was 0.3 pp higher than the level as anticipated in the monetary policy program for the second quarter. In July 2.6% deflation was recorded due to the seasonal fall in prices of agricultural products, and the 12â€month inflation rate has reduced slightly, amounting to 0.9% as of endâ€July. In the external environment, the global economic growth outlook is further improving, and prices in international commodity markets have shown trends of stabilization. Based on this, the Board of the Central Bank expects no significant inflationary effects from the external sector in the forthcoming months. The Board notes that, according to the actual second quarter of 2017 data, the economic activity remained strong and domestic demand continued recovering. This, under the currently implemented contractionary fiscal policy, is determined by expansionary monetary policy of the Central Bank. In consideration of this situation, the Board of the Central Bank finds it reasonable to leave the monetary conditions unchanged. This will gradually increase the inflation as a result  it will be shaping within the confidence band by the end of 2017 and will stabilize around the target in the forecast horizon. The Central Bank believes that if the macroeconomic developments proceed with the predicted scenario, the monetary conditions will remain expansionary for a while. However, should there emerge risks to the economic growth outlook and inflation deviating from its recovery path, the Central Bank would react by adjusting its monetary policy directions accordingly, while fulfilling the inflation target in the medium run. Detailed information on setting of the interest rate will be available in Inflation Report (Monetary Policy Program Q3, 2017), to be published by August 25, 2017.

Thailand,2017-08-16,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 5/2017 Mr. Jaturong Jantarangs. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 16 August 2017 as follows. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 150 percent. One MPC member was unable to attend this meeting. In deliberating their policy decision, the Committee assessed that Thailand's growth outlook improved further on the back of the expansion in merchandise and services exports. Meanwhile domestic demand continued to expand at a gradual pace, although it was not sufficiently broad-based. Headline inflation gradually rose at a slightly slower pace than previously expected mainly because of supply-side factors, especially fresh food prices. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative and conducive to economic growth. Hence the Committee decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at this meeting. Thailand's economic growth gained further traction on account of stronger growth in merchandise exports across various product categories and destinations, continued expansion in tourism, and higher agricultural output. Meanwhile private consumption continued to expand at a gradual pace. Private investment was projected to expand slowly as construction investment moderated. Public investment growth was softer than previously expected. The improved growth outlook was still subject to external risks, such as trading partners' growth outlook, uncertainties pertaining to US economic and foreign trade policies, and geopolitical risks. Headline inflation increased at a slightly slower pace than the previous assessment due primarily to supply-side factors. In particular, fresh food prices declined as a result of this year's higher agricultural output thanks to favorable weather conditions and last year's base effects following the drought. Meanwhile demand-pull inflationary pressures remained low. Nevertheless headline inflation was projected to slowly rise in the latter half of the year from the gradual dissipation of supply-side pressures and the recovery in domestic demand. The public's inflation expectations remained close to the midpoint of the target. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative and conducive to economic growth with ample liquidity in the financial system. Government bond yields and real interest rates remained low, with short-term bond yields held down by decreased issuances of short- term BOT bonds and treasury bills. Meanwhile business financing through credit and capital markets continued to expand. With regard to exchange rate movements over the recent period, the baht appreciated due to decreased investor confidence in the US dollar coupled with Thailand's stronger external position. However the Committee noted that the stronger appreciation of the baht relative to those of regional currencies in some periods might affect business adjustments and thus would continue to closely monitor developments in the foreign exchange market. The Committee viewed that financial stability remained sound with sufficient cushion against economic and financial volatilities on both domestic and external fronts. However there remained pockets of risks that warranted close monitoring, particularly the search-for- yield behavior in the prolonged low interest rate environment that might lead to underpricing of risks, and the deterioration in debt serviceability of small-and-medium sized enterprises (SMEs). 2 Looking ahead. Thailand's growth outlook improved further on the back of external demand, with the recovery of domestic demand to be monitored. Hence the Committee viewed that monetary policy should remain accommodative, and would stand ready to utilize available policy tools to sustain economic growth while also ensuring financial stability."
Chile,2017-08-17,"Santiago. Chile. Thursday, 17 August 2017 Monetary Policy Meeting  August 2017 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 2.5%. Incoming international news continue to point to a favorable scenario. The world activity outlook has strengthened and global financial conditions remain expansionary. In general, commodity prices have increased, most notably in the case of copper. On the domestic front. July's inflation was 0.2%, thus in annual terms it remained at 1.7%, below the last Monetary Policy Report's estimate. Inflation expectations brought no relevant news. During the second quarter activity posted weak growth, attributable to the performance of some investment-related sectors and some specific factors. Private consumption remains stable, in line with conditions in the labor market and expectations that have become less pessimistic. The peso has appreciated. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. ___ * The Spanish original prevails."
Egypt,2017-08-17,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release August 17, 2017 In its meeting held on August 17, 2017, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) main operation unchanged at 1875 percent, 1975 percent, and 1925 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged 1925 percen. Since the MPC meeting on July 6, 2017, annual headline inflation inched up to 330 percent in July 2017, after remaining broadly unchanged at 298 percent in June 2017 compared to May 2017, where it registered the first decline since October 201. Meanwhile annual core inflation rose to 353 percent in July from 319 percent in June, after declining between March and Ma. The recent increase reflected an expected upward adjustment of regulated hydrocarbon prices and a higher VAT rat. In addition to the direct effects of higher hydrocarbon prices on headline inflation, several CPI items echoed indirect effects, notably food, and services such as inland transportation, cafes and restaurants and outpatient service. Moreover other regulated prices also rose such as tobacco, public hospitals, and landline telephones, while higher prices of motor oils and medical products increased the contribution of retail items somewha. Prices of retail items have not been contributing to headline inflation since March 2017, except in June due to the seasonal effect of Eid-El-Fitr on clothing price. Services have been also only contributing marginally to headline inflation since January 2017, except in May due to higher prices of pilgrimag. Both exceptions reflected a delayed impact of the depreciation of the Egyptian pound on seasonal item. In the meantime, after bottoming in March 2017, the contribution of core food inflation rose somewhat between April and June and by a greater extent in July, while the contribution of volatile food inflation has been declining, except for an uptick in July, leading core food items to be the main contributor to food inflation since Ma. Meanwhile annual real GDP growth continued to strengthen in the quarter ending June 2017 and leading activity indicators solidify this improvemen. In the quarter ending June, real GDP reportedly grew by 49 percent, up from 43 percent, 38 percent and 34 percent in the preceding quarter. This coincided with the narrowing of the unemployment rate to below 120 percent in the quarter ending June 2017 from 120 percent, 124 percent and 126 percent in the preceding quarter. Available data up to March showed that the structure of economic growth shifted towards increased sustainability with declining contribution of consumption and increasing contribution of net exports as well as investment by a lesser exten. Tourism natural gas, trade, construction and non-petroleum manufacturing were the main sectors driving economic growt. Given the strengthening of demand indicators, in addition to the strong second-round effects of the economic reform measures implemented in November 2016, and in anticipation of the second-round effects of the subsidy-reform measures implemented in June and July 2017, the MPC had raised the CBE's key policy rates to achieve the targeted disinflation path over the specified horizo. Consistent with the tighter monetary policy stance, annual reserve money (M0) growth adjusted by overnight deposits and seven-day deposit auctions shrunk to reflect the absorption of excess liquidity via longer- term operation. The MPC reiterates that it tolerates higher inflation as a result of first-round effects of such supply shocks and uses its monetary policy tools to contain the second-round effect. Incoming information since the MPC last met were broadly as expected, accordingly, the MPC judges that current policy rates remain consistent with achieving the inflation target of 13 percent (+/- 3 percent) in 2018 Q4 and single digits thereafte. Nevertheless there are several risks surrounding the baseline inflation outlook, notably the evolution of inflation expectations, demand-side pressures as well as the magnitude of any subsidy-reform measures and their second-round effect. The materialization of such risks could lead to a stronger than projected loosening or tightening of the committee's stance to ensure that the inflation outlook is consistent with the targeted disinflation pat. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments as well as the balance of risks, and will not hesitate to adjust its stance to offset anticipated upside or downside deviations from the inflation targe.

Kazakhstan,2017-08-21,"Press-release – 23 The base rate reduced to 10.25% August 21, 2017 Almaty The National Bank has decided to reduce the base rate to 10.25% with a corridor of +/-1%1. The annual inflation rate continues to decelerate and remains within the target range; its deceleration trajectory matches the forecasted estimates of the National Bank. Easing of the monetary policy conditions is stipulated by the stable level of the inflationary expectations, stabilization of the situation on the commodity markets, and also by the forecasts for the further deceleration of the inflation level in the medium term. Along with that the National Bank, taking into the account the existing uncertainty and the volatility of the external conditions, has reconsidered the possibility of the further reduction of the base rate in the short run. The decision on the base rate was made with the account of the following factors. The annual inflation in July 2017 as expected has decelerated to 7.1% under the influence of the price drop of food products and is in the middle of the target range. The price statistics of both socially important food products and nonfood products and services in general matches the historical dynamics of the price movements in this period. The core inflation in the annual terms also keeps decreasing. The expected temporary insignificant increase of the annual inflation in the fall months of the current year due to the low base of the past year will not require taking any correcting measures of the monetary policy. The inflationary expectations of the households remain stable. The quantitative assessment of the inflation for a year ahead amounted to 6.4% and remains below the actual inflation rate, and also within the target range for 2018. 1 Simultaneously the official refinancing rate is reduced to the same level (10.25%) The economic activity continues demonstrating the recovery; the trends in the domestic consumer and investment demand dynamics remain positive. The recovery of economy is confirmed by the trade data, employment and external demand indicators. At the same time the negative dynamics of the real wages limit the inflationary risks. The gradual credit expansion supports the consumer demand; however the further expansion of the consumer credit will depend on the dynamics of the interest rate for individuals, which currently remains at a rather high level. The stabilization of the situation in the commodity markets and approaching of the oil prices to the level about 50 US dollars per 1 barrel after the drop in June are being observed. Along with that the external situation can be characterized by the growth of uncertainty and the aggravation of risks. In July the rise of the FAO Food Price Index was higher than expected as the result of the price growth for most cereals and dairy. The increase of the external pressure was also caused by the change of economic conditions in the countries  main trade partners. The monetary conditions remain neutral. The level of the real interest rate (i.e. the nominal interest rate adjusted for the targeted level of inflation  5-7% in 2018) is at the level corresponding to the long-run potential economic growth rates. The next decision on the base rate will be announced on October 9, 2017 at 17:00 Astana time. For more detailed information please contact: +7 (727) 2704 585 e-mail: press@nationalbank.kz."
Hungary,2017-08-22,"At its meeting on 22 August 2017, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 23 August 2017:. In the Council's assessment. Hungarian economic growth picks up over the forecast horizon. Some degree of unused capacity has remained in the economy, but this is likely to be gradually absorbed as output grows dynamically. The inflation target is expected to be achieved in a sustainable manner from early 2019. In July 2017, inflation rose to 2.1 percent and core inflation to 2.6 percent. The increase in core inflation adjusted for the effects of indirect taxes primarily reflected the change in processed food prices. Developments in the Bank's measures of underlying inflation remained stable, in line with expectations. The expansion in domestic employment, the tight labour market as well as increases in the minimum wage and the guaranteed minimum wage have led to a general, dynamic rise in whole-economy wages. The upward effect of this on costs is being offset by the reduction in employers' social contributions and in the corporate income tax rate early this year. In line with the Bank's expectations, there has not yet been any upward pressure on inflation from wages. Global inflation started to rise at the end of 2016, but has moderated in recent months. The external inflation environment, particularly in the euro area, is likely to remain low for a prolonged period. The consumer price index is likely to rise temporarily in the coming months, before easing back to around current levels by the end of the year. To a smaller extent, the expansion in household consumption is expected to lead to higher core inflation and, to a greater extent, to a reduction in the trade surplus. Moderate imported inflation and historically low inflation expectations as well as the VAT rate cuts, announced for next year, have been slowing the rise in domestic prices. In the baseline projection, the 3 percent inflation target is expected to be achieved in a sustainable manner from early 2019. The GDP data for the second quarter of 2017 showed that Hungarian economic output growth continued. Industrial production rose again in June; and the sector's performance is expected to be buoyant in 2017 as a whole. Robust growth in construction is likely to continue in the coming months. Labour demand remained strong: employment grew further in the second quarter of 2017 and the unemployment rate remained at historically low levels. Driven mainly by the strong growth in investment alongside continued expansion in household consumption, the increase in domestic demand will continue to play a central role in economic growth. Hungary's current account surplus is expected to fall over the forecast horizon in response to rising domestic demand. Economic growth this year will also be supported by the fiscal budget and the stimulating effects on investment of EU funding. The Monetary Council expects stable annual economic growth of between 34 percent over the coming years, to which the Bank's and the Government's measures to stimulate economic growth contribute substantially. The Funding for Growth Scheme ended at the end of March 2017. After it was phased out, the transition to lending under market conditions is ensured by the Bank's Market-Based Lending Scheme introduced in early 2016 and extended in 2017. At the tender held in the second phase of the Scheme in July, commercial banks raised their lending commitment by one-third. This will ensure that growth in lending to SMEs is maintained in the upper half of the 510 percent range, deemed necessary by the MNB for sustainable economic growth. Sentiment in international financial markets has been mixed in the period since the Council's previous interest rate decision. Risk appetite was influenced mainly by the release of macroeconomic data and expectations related to the monetary policy of the world's leading central banks. Market expectations for the timing of policy tightening by the ECB have shifted out. Investors' perceptions about the Central and Eastern European region improved, which led to an appreciation of local currencies. Inflation has been rising in the countries of the region. However, in light of the changed monetary conditions and the different inflation targets, market pricing suggests that the timing of central bank actions will differ. The amount of liquidity crowded out due to the introduction of an upper limit on the stock of three-month deposits continued to have a marked influence on domestic money market rates. As a result, the three-month BUBOR remained at a historically low level. Yields on short-term government securities up to one-year maturity were little changed, while there was a slight increase at the long end of the yield curve of Hungarian government securities. Three and five-year yields are near record low levels. Hungary's strong external financing capacity and the decline in external debt are contributing to the sustained reduction in the vulnerability of the economy. Forward-looking domestic money market real interest rates have fallen significantly over recent years and are expected to remain in negative territory for a prolonged period. In the Council's assessment, a watchful approach to monetary policy is still warranted due to uncertainty in the global financial environment. At its meeting in June 2017, the Council set a HUF 300 billion upper limit on the stock of three-month central bank deposits as at the end of the third quarter of 2017, in order to preserve the amount of liquidity crowded out of the deposit facility, and thereby to maintain the loose monetary conditions achieved. The MNB has managed uncertainties related to liquidity developments in the banking sector using fine-tuning operations introduced in October 2016 and extended with longer maturities in March 2017. The limit set on the three-month deposit stock and its potential future change are considered to be integral parts of instruments. The Bank continues to aim to maintain loose monetary conditions and provide a corresponding degree of support to the economy through money market rates. The Monetary Council intends to ensure that the limit imposed on the stock of three-month deposits exerts its expected effect on monetary conditions efficiently. On the next occasion, a decision on its level as at end of the fourth quarter of 2017 will be made in September 2017. In the Council's assessment, some degree of unused capacity has remained in the economy, but this is likely to be absorbed gradually as output grows dynamically. Over the forecast period, the inflation target is expected to be achieved in a sustainable manner from early 2019. If the assumptions underlying the Bank's projections hold, it is the maintenance for an extended period of the current level of the base rate and the loose monetary conditions achieved through the change in monetary policy instruments earlier, which is consistent with the medium-term achievement of the inflation target and a corresponding degree of support to the economy. In the Council's assessment, the external environment continues to pose a downside risk to inflation. The Council will stand ready to ease monetary conditions further using unconventional, targeted instruments to ensure the monetary conditions necessary to meet the inflation target in a sustainable manner."
Israel,2017-08-29,"The inflation environment remains markedly lower than the target, but it does not reflect a decrease in demand. In the past two months, there was a sharp decline in inflation, but inflation expectations for the various ranges did not change markedly. The increase in wages in the economy and the change in the trend of the exchange rate, to the extent that it persists, will support inflation, while the effect of additional initiated price reductions and the moderation of inflation worldwide act to reduce the inflation rate. The rate of growthin the first half of 2017 (net of the impact of vehicle imports) is somewhat moderate compared with the accelerated growth in 2016, against the background of the labor market being at full employment. Exports are growing at a solid pace as a result of the rapid expansion of services exports, while growth of goods exports remains slow. The picture of global economic activity is improving, and world trade is growing by a solid rate.In Europe, growth is becoming entrenched and political risk has decreased, butin the US, the difficulties encountered by the administration in implementing its economic policy are weighing on growth. Inflation is lower than central banks' targets, and changes in Federal Reserve and ECB policies are not expected in the near future. In recent months, the shekel appreciation has halted: Since the last monetary policy discussion there was a depreciation of 3.2 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate; the shekel weakened primarily against the euro and to a moderate extent againstthe dollar. Over the past 12 months, the appreciation in terms of the effective exchange rate was 4.1 percent. From the beginningof the year, home prices have risen by a moderate rate and most indicators point to stabilization of activity in the housing market. For the file of data accompanying this notice, click here. Since the previous interest rate decision, there has been a sharp decline in inflation: The rate of inflation over the past 12 months declined to -0.7 percent (Figure 1 in the data file). Even net of initiated price reductions, the inflation rate is negative (Figure 2). The decline in the inflation rate does not reflect a decrease in demand; apparently, the CPI was temporarily impacted by technical changes in the method of measuring the clothing and footwear component. Furthermore, the cumulative appreciation in the exchange rate tothe beginning of July (Figure 6) had a sharp impact on prices of tradable goods (Figure 3). In addition, the enhancement of competition in the economy is apparently preventing price increases in some industries. The wage increases in the economy and the change in the trend of the exchange rate, to the extent that it persists, will support inflation, while the effect of additional initiated price reductions and the moderation of inflation worldwide act to reduce inflation. The decline in inflation was accompanied by a decline in 1-year inflation expectations derived from the capital market, but forecaster's projections, as well as medium-term and long-term forward expectations, remained stable. Forward expectations beginning from the end of the third year are anchored within the target range (Figure 5). Since the previous interest rate decision, there has been a sharp decline in long-term government bond yields and the spread vis-C 3A 0-vis US government bond yields is at a historic low. Yield spreads between corporate and government bonds are also at a low level (Figure 7). The initial estimate of National Accounts data for the second quarter indicates that the rate of growth in the first half of 2017 (net of the effect of vehicle imports) is somewhat moderate compared with the accelerated growth in 2016. Against the background of the acceleration in the growth rate of world trade, exports are growing at a solid pace as a result of the rapid expansion of services exports (Figure 12). Growth of goods exports remains low, against the background of the cumulative appreciation through the beginning of July. The most recent data indicate continued growth of economic activity at a similar rate in the beginning of the third quarter. The moderation in growth reflects supply side constraints derived from the labor market being at full employment: the job vacancy rate continues to increase; participation and employment rates are stable at high levels, and unemployment is low. The wage increase in the business sector halted in recent months (Figure 14), but the overall wage increased by 3.9 percent in the past year, and the growth in health tax receipts indicates that apparently wage increases are continuing. Housing market data continue to indicate moderate demand and a slowing of activity. From the beginning of the year, home prices increased by a moderate rate (Figure 8), the number of transactions remains moderate relative to 2016, and home purchases by investors continue to decline. The monthly pace of new mortgages granted increased slightly in the past two months, and a downward trend in the interest rate is apparent in recent months (Figure 9). The improvement in global economic activity continues, and world trade is growing at a solid pace (Figure 17). The IMF kept its global growth forecast unchanged, while reducing the forecast for US growth and increasing the forecast for other major blocs (Figure 16). Inflation in most major economies remains below target (Figure 19), and major central banks did not change their accommodative policies. US growth recovered in the second quarter, driven by private consumption, but the difficulties encountered by the administrationin implementing its economic policy are weighing on future growth. Despite the improvement in the labor market, the low inflation rate led to a decline in the Fed's expected interest rate path, and it is not clear when it willbegin the process of reducing its balance sheet. In Europe, growth is becoming entrenched, encompassing most economies in the bloc in the second quarter, and sentiment indices indicate continued improvement in the coming months. The low inflation rate is expected to delay the ECB's stepping back from its quantitative easing. Uncertainty regarding the Brexit process continues to weigh on growth in the UK. In Japan, there was especially high growth in the second quarter. In China, growth remained stable, but activity data indicate a slight moderation in the beginning of the third quarter. Oil prices increased slightly, with fluctuations in supply. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on September 12, 2017. Thenext decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Thursday. October 19, 2017, and after the publication there will be a press briefing with the Governor.

Colombia,2017-08-31,"Pgina relacionada. Minutes of the Meeting of the Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica on July 27, 2017. The Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica at today's meeting decided to reduce the benchmark interest rate 25 bp to 5.25%. For this decision, the Board mainly took into account the following aspects. In July, annual consumer inflation stood at 3.4%, and the average of core inflation indicators posted at 4.9%. These figures are lower than those registered a month ago. Analysts' inflation expectations to December 2017 and 2018 are 4.16% and 3.64%, respectively. Those embedded in public debt bonds recorded slight changes, and are slightly above 3.0% for 2018. The effects of the strong transitory supply shocks that deviated inflation from its target continue to fade. This is suggested by the slowdown in the food CPI and the behavior of the prices which are more sensitive to the exchange rate. The average of core inflation indicators declined more slowly as a consequence of the indexation of prices and of the transitory effect of the increase in indirect taxes, which had already been assimilated during the first months of the year. The contribution of food CPI to the decline in annual inflation may reverse during the rest of the year. Therefore, the forecasts for that period suggest a slight increase in annual inflation. The external demand from the economies of the region remains weak, in contrast to that from developed economies. In the United States, inflation remains low, and the likelihood of increases in the Fed's benchmark interest rate reduced for this year. Oil prices are close to the average estimated by the technical staff for 2017, and Colombia's terms of trade exceed the low average registered in 2016. In this environment, the peso has appreciated vis--vis the US dollar. In Colombia. GDP growth in the second quarter (1.3%) was close to the technical staff's estimate. Domestic demand accelerated more than expected due to the behavior of consumption government. The dynamics of household spending remained weak, and gross capital formation growth was low, although better than in the first quarter. Net exports subtracted more than estimated from growth due to the increase in imports. The available figures of economic activity suggest that the slowdown of the economy has bottomed out, and that higher growth can be expected during the second half of the year. Based on this information, the Board considered the following factors for its decision. Weakness in economic activity and the risk of a slowdown beyond what is compatible with the deterioration in the dynamics of income due to the fall in oil prices. Recent indicators confirm an excess capacity of the economy, although its magnitude is highly uncertain. Uncertainty about the pace of convergence of inflation to its 3.0% target. Indexation mechanisms and the persistence of inflation continue to be reflected on core inflation indicators, which exceed the inflation target (3.0%). The current level of the real interest rate is compatible with the convergence of inflation to the target over the policy horizon, and some indicators suggest that it is close to its neutral level, although its value is uncertain. With this, the Board of Directors decided to reduce the benchmark interest rate 25 bp. The decision to reduce the benchmark interest rate was approved by four members of the Board. Two other Board Members voted in favor of reducing the benchmark interest rate by 50 bp, and the remaining one voted not to modify it. Bogot."
South Korea,2017-08-31,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period. (English translation prepared by the Bank of Korea staff) The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Board considers that the global economic recovery has continued to expand. Global financial market volatility has meanwhile increased somewhat, due mainly to changes in expectations related to the monetary policies of major countries and to geopolitical risks. Looking ahead the Board sees the global economic recovery as likely to be affected by factors such as the paces of monetary policy normalization in major countries, the directions of the US government's economic policies, the movements toward spreading trade protectionism, and geopolitical risks. The Board judges that the solid trend of domestic economic growth has continued, as exports have sustained their high rate of increase and consumption has recovered moderately although investment has temporarily slowed. Employment conditions have improved moderately, with the employment-to-population ratio having risen as the trend of year-on-year increase in the number of persons employed has expanded, centering around the manufacturing sector. Going forward domestic economic growth is expected to be generally in accord with the path projected in July. The Board judges that consumption will likely continue its moderate trend of recovery, due to the improvement in employment condition and to the execution of a supplementary budget. Facilities investment will likely be above the levels forecast in July, due to expanded IT industry investment. Exports are expected to fall below the July projection, however, as service exports have slowed owing to a decline in the number of foreign tourists, while construction investment will probably also be less than forecast, in consequence of real estate market stability. Consumer price inflation has risen to the lower-2% level, in line mainly with increases in the prices of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products and with the base effect from the reduction of electricity fees last year. Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has stayed in the mid-1% range, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has remained at the mid-2% level. Looking ahead the Board expects that consumer price inflation will for the time being fluctuate at around the 2% level, and for the year as a whole show the level (1.9%) projected in July. Core inflation appears likely to be in the mid- to upper-1% range. In the domestic financial markets price variable volatility has expanded, with stock prices, the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate and long-term market interest rates having fluctuated to considerable extents, in line with increases in geopolitical risks. Household lending has sustained its high rate of increase exceeding past years' levels, although the amount of year-on-year increase has lessened somewhat. In the housing market, the trend of rising sales prices has slowed since the government's announcement of housing market stabilization measures. Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As the inflationary pressures on the demand side are not expected to be high although the domestic economy is expected to show solid growth, the Board will maintain its stance of monetary policy accommodation. In this process it will closely monitor any changes in the monetary policies of major countries, conditions related to trade with major countries, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks."
Brazil,2017-09-06,"The Copom unanimously decided to reduce the Selic rate by one percentage point, to 8.25 percent per year, without bias. The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario:. The set of indicators of economic activity released since the last Copom meeting is consistent with a gradual recovery of the Brazilian economy. The global outlook has been favorable, as global economic activity remains on a gradual recovery path, without pressuring financial conditions in advanced economies. This supports risk appetite towards emerging economies. Inflation developments remain favorable, with various measures of underlying inflation running at low levels. This includes the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy. Inflation expectations collected by the Focus survey edged up to around 3.4% for 2017 and remained around 4.2% for 2018. Expectations for 2019 are around 4.25%, and expectations for 2020 are around 4.00%; and. The Copom's inflation projections in the scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the Focus survey retreated to around 3.3% for 2017, and increased to around 4.4% for 2018. This scenario assumes a path for the policy interest rate that ends 2017 at 7.25%, edges down to 7.00% in early 2018 and reaches 7.5% by the end of the year. The Committee emphasizes that its baseline scenario involves risks in both directions. On the one hand, the combination of possible second-round effects of the ongoing favorable food price shock and of low current levels of industrial goods inflation, and the possible propagation through inertial mechanisms of the low level of current inflation, including the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy, may lead to a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory. On the other hand, frustration of expectations regarding the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy may affect risk premia and increase the path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy. This risk intensifies in the case of a reversal of the current benign global outlook for emerging economies. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the wide array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to reduce the Selic rate by one percentage point, to 8.25 percent per year, without bias. The Committee judges that convergence of inflation to the 4.5% target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, which includes 2018, is compatible with the monetary easing process. The Committee judges that economic conditions prescribe accommodative monetary policy, i.e., interest rates below the structural level. The Copom emphasizes that the evolution of reforms, such as the recently approved credit policy measures, and adjustments in the Brazilian economy contributes to the reduction of its structural interest rate. The Committee will continue to reassess estimates of this rate over time. The Copom emphasizes that economic conditions have allowed the same pace of monetary easing at this meeting. Regarding the next Copom meeting, provided the Committee's baseline scenario evolve as expected, and taking into account the stage of the monetary easing cycle, at this time the Copom views a moderate reduction of the pace of easing as appropriate. In addition, under those same circumstances, the Copom foresees a gradual ending to the cycle. Notwithstanding these perspectives, the Copom emphasizes that the monetary easing process will continue to depend on the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, possible reassessments of the extension of the cycle, and on inflation forecasts and expectations. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Ilan Goldfajn (Governor). Anthero de Moraes Meirelles. Carlos Viana de Carvalho. Isaac Sidney Menezes Ferreira. Luiz Edson Feltrim. OtÃ¡vio Ribeiro Damaso. Reinaldo Le Grazie. Sidnei CorrÃªa Marques, and Tiago Couto Berriel."
Georgia,2017-09-06,"06.09.2017 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on September 6, 2017 and decided to keep the refinancing rate unchanged at 7 percent The inflation dynamics is in accord with the existing forecast. The annual inflation in August has decreased to 5.7%. According to the forecast the inflation will remain above the target until the end of the year, whereas in the beginning of 2018, once the temporary factors will have petered out, the inflation will get close to the 3% level. The inflation expectations are stable as well. Hence, the Monetary Policy Committee has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at the current stage. In case of no additional shocks the policy rate in the medium term is expected to gradually decrease to its neutral level. The developments in the external demand are still positive. Both the goods exports and tourism revenues have been growing at a high rate, whereas the volume of remittances has been rising as well. At the same time the growth in imports has been moderate. According to the preliminary estimates the economic growth in the first seven months of 2017 was 4.4%. The economic activity is still below the potential and hence there are no inflationary risks from the demand side. Notably, the larization of the financial sector has been increasing. The credit growth during the year has been mostly caused by the increase in GEL loans. At the same time in the recent months the GEL deposits have been growing as well. The increase in larization reduces the effect of currency fluctuations on the disposable income and fosters the macroeconomic stability in the medium term. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all means and instruments at its disposal in order to ensure the price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on October 25, 2017."
Poland,2017-09-06,"Warsaw, 6 September 2017 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 5-6 September 2017 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: â–ª reference rate at 1.50%; â–ª lombard rate at 2.50%; â–ª deposit rate at 0.50%; â–ª rediscount rate at 1.75%. Signs of improvement in the global economy are strengthening. In the euro area. GDP growth rate accelerated in 2017 Q2, and incoming data indicate continued favourable sentiment in this economy. Also in the United States, economic growth picked up in 2017 Q2, and monthly indicators point to a continuation of strong economic conditions there. At the same time. China's GDP growth stabilised in 2017 Q2. Despite ongoing global recovery, inflation abroad remains moderate, on the back of persistently low domestic inflationary pressure in many countries, alongside relatively stable global commodity prices. The European Central Bank keeps interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero, and continues its asset purchase programme. The US Federal Reserve gradually tightens its monetary policy. In Poland, incoming data confirm continued stable growth in economic activity. GDP growth rate in 2017 Q2 was close to that observed in the previous quarter. Growth was still driven primarily by increasing consumer demand, supported by rising employment and wages, disbursement of benefits and very good consumer sentiment. Investment growth rate was however still weak. At the same time, export growth slowed down, and as a result, the contribution of net exports to GDP growth turned negative. The annual growth in prices of consumer goods and services remains at a moderate level. At the same time, while wage growth in the economy has picked up, core inflation is still low. In the Council's opinion, in the following quarters inflation will remain moderate. This will result from a gradual rise in domestic inflationary pressure stemming from improving domestic economic conditions, alongside a decline in import price growth due to the expected stabilisation of energy commodity prices and low inflationary pressure abroad. In consequence, the risk of inflation running persistently above the target in the medium term is limited. 1/2 The Council confirms its assessment that, given the available data and forecasts, the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on the sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic balance."
Euroarea,2017-09-07,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We expect them to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases. Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, we confirm that our net asset purchases, at the current monthly pace of â‚¬60 billion, are intended to run until the end of December 2017, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. The net purchases are made alongside reinvestments of the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme. The incoming information, including our new staff projections, confirms a broadly unchanged medium-term outlook for euro area economic growth and inflation. The economic expansion, which accelerated more than expected in the first half of 2017, continues to be solid and broad-based across countries and sectors. At the same time, the recent volatility in the exchange rate represents a source of uncertainty which requires monitoring with regard to its possible implications for the medium-term outlook for price stability. While the ongoing economic expansion provides confidence that inflation will gradually head to levels in line with our inflation aim, it has yet to translate sufficiently into stronger inflation dynamics. Measures of underlying inflation have ticked up slightly in recent months but, overall, remain at subdued levels. Therefore, a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation is still needed for underlying inflation pressures to gradually build up and support headline inflation developments in the medium term. If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, we stand ready to increase our asset purchase programme in terms of size and/or duration. This autumn we will decide on the calibration of our policy instruments beyond the end of the year, taking into account the expected path of inflation and the financial conditions needed for a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2%. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro area real GDP increased by 0.6%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2017, after 0.5% in the first quarter. Survey data point to continued broad-based growth in the period ahead. Our monetary policy measures are supporting domestic demand and have facilitated the deleveraging process. Private consumption is underpinned by employment gains, which are also benefiting from past labour market reforms, and by increasing household wealth. The recovery in investment continues to benefit from very favourable financing conditions and improvements in corporate profitability. Moreover, the broad-based global recovery will support euro area exports. This assessment is broadly reflected in the September 2017 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. These projections foresee annual real GDP increasing by 2.2% in 2017, by 1.8% in 2018 and by 1.7% in 2019. Compared with the June 2017 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real GDP growth has been revised up for 2017, reflecting the recent stronger growth momentum, and is broadly unchanged thereafter. Risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain broadly balanced. On the one hand, the current positive cyclical momentum increases the chances of a stronger than expected economic upswing. On the other hand, downside risks continue to exist, primarily relating to global factors and developments in foreign exchange markets. Looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for oil, annual rates of headline inflation are likely to temporarily decline towards the turn of the year, mainly reflecting base effects in energy prices. At the same time, measures of underlying inflation have ticked up moderately in recent months, but have yet to show convincing signs of a sustained upward trend. Domestic cost pressures, notably from labour markets, are still subdued. Underlying inflation in the euro area is expected to rise gradually over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the continuing economic expansion, the corresponding gradual absorption of economic slack and rising wages. This assessment is also broadly reflected in the September 2017 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation at 1.5% in 2017, 1.2% in 2018 and 1.5% in 2019. Compared with the June 2017 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for headline HICP inflation has been revised down slightly, mainly reflecting the recent appreciation of the euro exchange rate. Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3), despite some monthly volatility, continues to expand at a robust pace, with an annual rate of growth of 4.5% in July 2017, after 5.0% in June. As in previous months, annual growth in M3 was mainly supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate M1 expanding at an annual rate of 9.1% in July 2017, down from 9.7% in June. The recovery in the growth of loans to the private sector observed since the beginning of 2014 is proceeding. The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations increased to 2.4% in July 2017, up from 2.0% in June, while the annual growth rate of loans to households remained stable at 2.6%. The pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014 continues to significantly support borrowing conditions for firms and households, access to financing â€’ notably for small and medium-sized enterprises â€’ and credit flows across the euro area. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed the need for a continued very substantial degree of monetary accommodation to secure a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2%. In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute decisively to strengthening the longer-term growth potential and reducing vulnerabilities. The implementation of structural reforms needs to be substantially stepped up to increase resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost euro area growth potential and productivity. Regarding fiscal policies, all countries would benefit from intensifying efforts towards achieving a more growth-friendly composition of public finances. A full, transparent and consistent implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact and of the macroeconomic imbalances procedure over time and across countries remains essential to bolster the resilience of the euro area economy. The Governing Council welcomes the ongoing discussions on further enhancing the institutional architecture of our Economic and Monetary Union."
Malaysia,2017-09-07,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.00 percent. The global economy continues to strengthen with growth becoming more entrenched and synchronised across countries. Global trade has picked up significantly. In the advanced economies, both consumption and investment continue to improve. In Asia, growth is driven by sustained domestic activity and strong external demand. These developments point to sustained momentum in global growth. This outlook nevertheless may be affected by political and policy developments in major economies and geopolitical risks. The Malaysian economy recorded a higher growth in the second quarter of 2017, driven by firmer domestic activity and exports. Looking ahead, growth prospects will be sustained by the more positive global growth outlook and stronger spillovers from the external sector to the domestic economy. Domestic demand will remain the key driver of growth, supported by improving incomes and overall labour market conditions, new and ongoing infrastructure projects and sustained capital investment by firms in the manufacturing and services sectors. Overall, growth in 2017 will be stronger than earlier expected. Headline inflation continued its moderating trend, declining to 3.2% in July, due mainly to the decline in domestic fuel prices. Going forward, headline inflation is projected to moderate on expectations of a smaller effect from global cost factors. Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation, will be sustained by the more robust domestic demand but is expected to remain contained. The domestic financial markets have been resilient. The ringgit has strengthened to better reflect the economic fundamentals. Banking system liquidity remains sufficient with financial institutions continuing to operate with strong capital and liquidity buffers. The growth of financing to the private sector has been sustained and is supportive of economic activity. At the current level of the OPR, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative. The MPC will continue to assess the balance of risks surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation. Bank Negara Malaysia 07 September 2017."
Chile,2017-09-14,"Thursday, 14 September 2017 Monetary Policy Meeting  September 2017 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 2.5%. On the external front, the financial markets were somewhat more volatile, in a context where global financial conditions remain favorable and the US dollar has weakened. World activity prospects are still positive; commodity prices rose in the last month, including copper, even considering its recent drop. On the domestic front. August's inflation was in line with forecasts in the last Monetary Policy Report, at 1.9% annually. Inflation expectations at shorter terms have fallen, reflecting the effects of the peso appreciation, but remain around 3% two years out. Regarding activity, the improved performance of consumption-related sectors continues to stand out, outperforming those related with investment. The behavior of private consumption reflects the labor market situation and not-so-pessimistic expectations. Incoming data since the publication of the September Report are consistent with the baseline scenario and the monetary impulse described therein, i.e., the policy rate staying close to its current levels and beginning to rise to neutral only once the economy starts closing the activity gap. The risk balance has not changed either. In particular, the risk balance for medium-term inflation and activity are estimated to be unbiased, but with a downward bias for short-term inflation. As always, the Board will continue to monitor any deviations of the baseline scenario that may hinder the convergence of inflation to 3% over a two-year horizon and warrant moving the monetary policy interest rate. ___ * The Spanish original prevails."
Peru,2017-09-14,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR SEPTEMBER 2017 BCRP LOWERED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE TO 3.50% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to lower the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points to 3.50 percent. This level of the benchmark rate is compatible with an inflation forecast in which inflation remains within the target range during 2017 and 2018. This forecast takes into account the following factors: The increase in prices of some food products and water tariffs in August will have a transitory effect on inflation. Measures of inflationary trend are within the target range and are projected to continue to decline in the coming months; Expectations of inflation in 12 months' time continued to decrease, standing at 2.7 percent in August; The pace of growth of domestic economic activity continues to be below its potential growth level. Economic activity is expected to recover as a result of increased government and private spending, and The world economy continues to show a gradual recovery, although there is still some uncertainty associated with a possible reversal of central banks' monetary stimulus in developed countries. The Board oversees new data on inflation and inflation determinants to assess the convenience of making additional changes in the monetary policy stance if deemed necessary. Inflation in August recorded a rate of 0.67 percent, as a result of which the year-to-year rate of inflation rose from 2.85 percent in July to 3.17 percent in August. If it not considers the contribution of the increases in prices of water and lemon, the inflation on the month would be 0.07 percent and the year-to-year inflation, 2.41 percent. Inflation without food and energy recorded 0.38 percent, as a result of which the year-to-year rate rose from 2.36 percent in July to 2.57 percent in August, within the target range (1-3 percent). Inflation is forecast to converge to the target range during 2017 and remain within this range during 2018. The indicators of business expectations have improved and remain on the optimistic side. GDP is expected to grow between 2.5 and 3.0 percent in 2017. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to lower the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 2.25 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 4.05 percent for the first 15 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 15 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.05 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for October on its meeting of October 12, 2017."
Turkiye,2017-09-14,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels:. a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate at 9.25 percent and borrowing rate at 7.25 percent, b) One-week repo rate at 8 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, and lending rate at 12.25 percent. Recently released data indicate that the recovery in the economic activity has gained strength. Domestic demand conditions keep improving and demand from the European Union economies continues to contribute positively to exports. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly. Current elevated levels of inflation and developments in core inflation indicators pose risks on the pricing behavior. Accordingly, the Committee decided to maintain the tight stance of monetary policy. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. Tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained until inflation outlook displays a significant improvement. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Ukraine,2017-09-14,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to keep its key policy rate at 12.5% per annum. The decision was prompted by the need to return inflation to the target path. In August, annual headline inflation accelerated further to 16.2%. Meanwhile, in monthly terms, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) decreased by 0.1%, reflecting a seasonal decline in the prices of fruit, vegetables, clothing and footwear. Actual annual inflation came above the NBU's forecast of CPI path published in the July 2017 Inflation Report, primarily reflecting faster-than-expected growth in raw food prices and tobacco products. As in previous months, this was due to supply factors  the unfavorable weather conditions seen in spring 2017 pushed fruit and vegetable prices up, while significant exports of meat and dairy products led to an increase in domestic prices. Second-round effects from rising prices for meat and dairy products, as well as higher production costs, including increased labor costs, which were passed through to prices for services, drove core inflation up. Thus, the Core CPI increased by 0.2% mom and by 7.8% yoy. As a result, actual core inflation came in slightly above the NBU's projections published in the July 2017 Inflation Report. In spite of this, underlying inflationary pressure remained moderate, due to a further improvement in inflation expectations. FX market conditions were yet another factor restraining inflation. The recent strengthening of the hryvnia against the US dollar, which occurred thanks to favorable global price conditions for Ukrainian export commodities and improved exchange rate expectations, stimulated households to actively sell foreign currency cash. From late August through early September, the hryvnia exchange rate weakened slightly. However, the NBU attributed this weakening to temporary and psychological factors, with economic agents' behavior following a seasonal pattern. Through the end of the year, inflation is expected to trend downwards in annual terms, primarily reflecting last year's high base of comparison, the expected moderate volatility of the exchange rate, and the fading effects of inflation surprises. At the same time, inflation is expected to decelerate at a slower pace than anticipated in the Inflation Report for July 2017 (to 9.1%). As a result, the 2017 year-end inflation is projected to deviate more significantly from the mid-point of the target range (8% Â± 2 pp for end-2017). In addition, recent months have seen a heightened risk that underlying pressure on prices, particularly demand-driven pressure, will intensify in the medium term. Consumption, which has picked up markedly on the back of rising wages, is expected to be further boosted by rising budgetary spending and pension payments over the next months. Also, current high inflation readings may reverse the trend towards an improvement in inflation expectations seen over the last two years. In view of the above risks, the NBU Board has decided to keep its key policy rate at 12.5% per annum. However, appropriately tight monetary policy should help anchor inflation expectations and bring inflation closer to the mid-point of the target range in Q2 2018. (For reference: According to the Monetary Policy Guidelines for 2018 and Medium Term, the target bands are set as follows: 7.5% Â± 2 pp by the end of Q1 2018 and 7.0% Â± 2 pp by the end of Q2 2018). At the same time, the NBU will continue to closely monitor factors that may increase pressure on inflation and incorporate the expected effect in the updated inflation projections that will be published in the Inflation Report in late October together with other revised macroeconomic forecasts. Further on, the need to return inflation to the target may prompt the NBU to keep its key policy rate at its current level until the central bank sees clear signs of alleviation of inflation risks. The NBU Board is confident that the achievement of price stability is key to sustainable economic growth. The NBU will resume its monetary easing cycle once inflation risks abate and inflation expectations become well anchored. This is contingent on continued cooperation with the IMF, which envisages the implementation of structural reforms, as well as the authorities' commitment to prudent fiscal policy. However, should demand-driven inflationary pressures increase, including due to a rise in social standards that is inconsistent with economic productivity growth as well as a significant increase in inflation expectations, the NBU may resort to a tighter monetary policy and raise its key policy rate to mitigate inflationary pressures and return inflation to the target level. The decision to keep the key policy rate at 12.5% is approved by NBU Board Decision No. 593D, dated 14 September 2017. On the Key Policy Rate. The next meeting of the NBU Board on monetary policy issues will be held on 26 October 2017 as scheduled."
Mongolia,2017-09-15,"MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Keeping the policy rate unchanged Number: 2017.03 Effective date: 15 September 2017 The Monetary Policy Committee meeting was held on 15 September 2017, and it was decided to keep the Policy rate unchanged at 12 percent. As of August 2017, annual inflation measured by the consumer price index has reached 5 percent nationwide and 5.4 percent in Ulaanbaatar city. In the first half of this year, growth of the Mongolian economy exceeded forecasts and reached 5.3 percent (on annual basis). Furthermore, economic growth is expected to accelerate and inflation is expected to stabilize around the medium term target rate of 8 percent. Mongolian economy is currently stimulated by improved external demand, relatively high prices of the major export commodities and increased investments in the mining sector. While the Bank observes positive changes in market sentiment and positive trends in economic activities, further prospects are highly conditional on export prices and volume. The Bank's decision to maintain the policy rate unchanged is consistent with its mandate to stabilize inflation around the target rate and thereby facilitate the stability of macroeconomic environment in the medium to long run. Extracts of the meeting minutes will be released in two weeks on the Bank of Mongolia's website. MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE."
Russia,2017-09-15,"On 15 September 2017, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to cut the key rate by 50 b.p. to 8.50% per annum. The Board of Directors notes that inflation is close to 4% while the economy keeps growing. Amid favourable price dynamics of a number of goods and services, inflation expectations resumed their decline, though they have not yet anchored at a low level. Medium-term risks of inflation overshooting 4% dominate over the risk of its steady downward deviation from the target. In order to maintain inflation close to 4%, the Bank of Russia will continue to conduct moderately tight monetary policy. During the next two quarters, the Bank of Russia deems it possible to cut the key rate further. While making its decision hereinafter, the Bank of Russia will assess the risks of inflation's material and sustainable deviation from the target, as well as consumer price movements and economic activity against the forecast. In making its key rate decision, the Bank of Russia recognised the factors as follows. Inflation dynamics. Inflation stays close to 4%. In August, inflation totalled 3.3% following a short-lived rise to 4.4% in June. Inflation continues to decline in the non-food goods market; services price growth has stabilised around 4%. High homogeneity of inflation is maintained for consumer basket and across regions. Food price growth decelerates due to the seasonal cheapening of vegetables and fruit, which has exceeded preliminary estimates. As inflation becomes lower, the contribution of volatile components, consisting of vegetable and fruit prices, among other things, to the general movement of the consumer price index becomes more pronounced. During 2018 short-term factors may cause inflation to deviate from the 4% both to the upside and to the downside. Noticeable changes in the prices for the consumer goods and services most often purchased by the population feed through to inflation expectations dynamics rather quickly. To keep inflation close to 4%, it is necessary to make inflation expectations less sensitive to price movements. Monetary conditions. Monetary stance continues to support household propensity to save amid elevated economic activity and recovery in current incomes. Real bank rates remain in positive territory. Nominal lending rates continue to decline influenced by earlier key rate cuts, as well as those expected by market participants. Banks tend to ease non-price lending conditions on a case-by-case basis and continue to thoroughly select borrowers. Conservative approach employed by banks, coupled by moderately tight monetary policy, shapes conditions required for anchoring inflation close to 4% and for the further reduction in inflation expectations. Economic activity. In Q2. GDP growth exceeded the forecast figures. Economic growth was spurred by investment and consumer demand along with the recovery of production inventories. Higher consumer demand under current monetary conditions does not pose significant inflation risks amid the expanding supply of goods and services. Q2 saw further growth in manufacturing output; construction began to rise. Trade, mining and transport made a major contribution to the accelerating economic growth. Certain industries experienced faster growth due to both persistent and one-off factors that will most likely have less influence during the next six months, which is in part supported by July statistics. In view of the positive trend set by Q2, the forecast for GDP growth in 2017 has been revised upwards to 1.7-2.2%. The Bank of Russia's assessment of the medium-term economic development remains the same. The economy is close to its potential. Growth might be constrained by insufficient production capacity together with the possible skilled labour shortages affecting certain segments of the labour market. Further GDP growth above 1.5-2% a year is attainable if structural reforms are put in place. Inflation risks. Medium-term risks of inflation overshooting 4% dominate over the risk of its steady downward deviation from the target. Fluctuations of food prices will remain the source of inflation volatility over the next six months. Food price dynamics will depend on the quality and preserved volumes of the harvest. Short-term food market factors might trigger temporary deviation of inflation (both upward and downward) from the 4%, which, however, will not persist. Key sources of medium-term inflation risks remain unchanged. First, there are potential price fluctuations in global commodity markets. Implementation of the budget rule will reduce risks linked to oil price movements. Second, labour productivity growth may lag considerably behind the wage growth as the structural shortage of labour force aggravates. Third, inflationary pressure may stem from changes in households' behaviour as the propensity to save becomes much lower. Fourth, inflation expectations remain highly sensitive to changing prices for individual groups of goods and services and exchange rate movements. These factors call for moderately tight monetary conditions to be kept in place in order to anchor inflation close to the target. During the next two quarters, the Bank of Russia deems it possible to cut the key rate further. While making its decision hereinafter, the Bank of Russia will assess the risks of inflation's material and sustainable deviation from the target, as well as consumer price movements and economic activity against the forecast. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next rate review meeting on 27 October 2017. The Board's decision press release is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time. The reference to the Press Service is mandatory if you intend to use this material."
Hungary,2017-09-19,"At its meeting on 19 September 2017, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 20 September 2017:. In the Council's assessment. Hungarian economic growth picks up over the forecast horizon. Some degree of unused capacity has remained in the economy, but this is likely to be gradually absorbed as output grows dynamically. In the September projection, the inflation target is expected to be achieved in a sustainable manner one additional quarter later, i.e. by the middle of 2019, following a delay of half a year indicated in the June projection. In August 2017, inflation rose to 2.6 percent and core inflation to 2.8 percent. The increase in core inflation mainly reflected base effects and temporary effects, such as changes in the prices of tobacco and dairy products. In line with the Bank's expectations measures of underlying inflation were around 2 percent, significantly below the level of core inflation. The expansion in domestic employment, the tight labour market as well as increases in the minimum wage and the guaranteed minimum wage have led to a general, dynamic rise in whole-economy wages. The upward effect of this on costs is being offset by the reduction in employers' social contributions and in the corporate income tax rate early this year. In line with the Bank's expectations, there has not yet been any significant upward pressure on inflation from wages. The rise in global inflation which started at the beginning of the year has stalled, and consumer price indices in some economies have fallen. The European Central Bank revised down its projection for euro-area inflation again. External inflation, particularly in the euro area, is likely to remain low for a prolonged period. In the coming months, the consumer price index is likely to decline again from its current level to the bottom of the tolerance band by the end of 2017. Core inflation is expected to decrease in the second half of next year as the temporary effects wane. Looking ahead, the Bank's measures of underlying inflation are expected to be around 2 percent. Moderate imported inflation and historically low inflation expectations as well as the VAT rate cuts, announced for next year, have been slowing the rise in domestic prices. According to the projection of the September Inflation Report, the price stability target can be achieved sustainably one quarter later, i.e. by the middle of 2019. Growth of the Hungarian economy continued in the second quarter of 2017. Industrial production stagnated in July due to factory shutdowns in the summer. A reversal and gradual pick-up in industrial production is expected towards the end of the year. Robust growth in construction and the expansion in the performance of the service sector are likely to continue in the coming months. Retail sales growth slowed somewhat in July. Labour demand remained strong: employment was at historically high levels in the second quarter of 2017. The unemployment rate remained at a low level. The general increase in domestic demand will continue to play a central role in economic growth. Hungary's current account surplus is expected to fall over the forecast horizon in response to rising domestic demand. Economic growth this year will also be supported by the fiscal budget and the stimulating effects on investment of EU funding. The Monetary Council expects annual economic growth of 3.6 percent in 2017 and stable growth of between 3-4 percent over the coming years. The Bank's and the Government's stimulating measures contribute substantially to economic growth. Sentiment in international financial markets has, on the whole, improved in the period since the Council's previous interest rate decision. Besides to an escalation in geopolitical risks, favourable macroeconomic data and negotiations about Brexit also had an effect on risk appetite. Investors' perceptions about the Central and Eastern European region continued to be positive. Due to the different inflation paths expected in the countries of the region and the different characteristics of inflation targeting regimes, market pricing suggests that the timing of central bank actions will differ. The amount of liquidity crowded out due to the introduction of an upper limit on the stock of three-month deposits continued to have a marked influence on domestic money market rates. The three-month BUBOR fell to a new historic low. The yield curves for the interbank and government securities markets shifted downwards. Three and five-year yields on government securities are at their historical lows. Achieved through the change in monetary policy instruments, the earlier loose monetary conditions, necessary to meet the inflation target in a sustainable manner, have, on the whole, become tighter in recent months. The repeated delay in the date of meeting the inflation target also warrants monetary easing. The Monetary Council decided on harmonised measures to ensure the adequate monetary conditions. In particular, the Council reduced the interest rate on the overnight central bank deposit by 10 basis points. In addition, it set a HUF 75 billion upper limit on the stock of three-month central bank deposits outstanding from the end of 2017. The stock of swap instruments will be increased in the coming period. The objective of the latter is to provide the loosening effect up to the longest possible section of the yield curve as soon as possible. In the Council's assessment the limitation on the stock of three-month deposits has fulfilled its role and the HUF 75 billion year-end upper limit on the stock will not be reduced further. The importance of the stock and maturity structure of swap instruments providing forint liquidity increases in the future. In the Council's assessment, some degree of unused capacity has remained in the economy, but this is likely to be absorbed gradually as output grows dynamically. The inflation target is expected to be achieved in a sustainable manner one additional quarter later, i.e. by the middle of 2019, following a delay of half a year indicated in the June projection. The Council lowered the overnight deposit rate by 10 basis points to -0.15 percent and left the base rate, the overnight and one-week lending rates unchanged. The Council considers that the external environment continues to pose a downside risk to inflation. In the Council's assessment, maintaining the base rate and loose monetary conditions for an extended period are necessary to achieve the inflation target in a sustainable manner. The Monetary Council will continue to monitor closely the risks to inflation and developments in monetary conditions, and will stand ready to ease them further using additional unconventional, targeted instruments."
Philippines,2017-09-20,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) facility at 3.0 percent. The corresponding interest rates on the overnight lending and deposit facilities were also kept steady. The reserve requirement ratios were likewise left unchanged. The Monetary Board's decision is based on its assessment that the inflation environment remains manageable. Latest forecasts show the future inflation path will continue to be within the target range for 2017-2019. Meanwhile, inflation expectations remain firmly anchored close to the midpoint of the Government's 3 percent Â± 1 percentage point target over the policy horizon. The balance of risks to the inflation outlook also continues to be on the upside. While the proposed tax reform program may exert potential transitory pressures on prices, various social safety nets and the resulting improvement in output and productivity are also expected to temper the impact on inflation over the medium term. At the same time, while prospects for global economic growth have stayed broadly upbeat, geopolitical tensions and lingering uncertainty over macroeconomic policies in advanced economies continue to pose downside risks to external demand. The outlook for domestic economic activity remains firm, supported by positive consumer and business sentiment and ample liquidity. Moreover, as credit for production activities continues to expand in line with output growth, the economy's absorptive capacity is likewise seen to improve, thus mitigating inflation pressures over the long run. Nonetheless, the Monetary Board remains watchful over evolving economic growth and liquidity conditions and their implications for price and financial stability. Based on these considerations, the Monetary Board believes that prevailing monetary policy settings continue to be appropriate. Looking ahead, the BSP will continue to be vigilant against any risks to the inflation outlook and will adjust its policy settings as needed to ensure stable prices while supporting sustainable economic growth."
United States,2017-09-20,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in July indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising moderately so far this year. Job gains have remained solid in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low. Household spending has been expanding at a moderate rate, and growth in business fixed investment has picked up in recent quarters. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and the measure excluding food and energy prices have declined this year and are running below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. Hurricanes Harvey. Irma, and Maria have devastated many communities, inflicting severe hardship. Storm-related disruptions and rebuilding will affect economic activity in the near term, but past experience suggests that the storms are unlikely to materially alter the course of the national economy over the medium term. Consequently, the Committee continues to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further. Higher prices for gasoline and some other items in the aftermath of the hurricanes will likely boost inflation temporarily; apart from that effect, inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to remain somewhat below 2 percent in the near term but to stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1 to 1-1/4 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. In October, the Committee will initiate the balance sheet normalization program described in the June 2017 Addendum to the Committee's Policy Normalization Principles and Plans. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Janet L Yellen. Chair; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Lael Brainard; Charles L Evans; Stanley Fischer; Patrick Harker; Robert S Kaplan; Neel Kashkari; and Jerome H Powell. Implementation Note issued September 20, 2017."
South Africa,2017-09-21,"South African Reserve Bank PRESS STATEMENT EMBARGO DELIVERY 21 September 2017 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank The South African economy recorded positive growth during the second quarter of 2017 following two consecutive quarters of contraction. Growth prospects, however remain subdued as domestic fixed investment contracted further amid low business confidence. The inflation forecast has increased marginally since the previous meeting of the MPC, with increased uncertainty regarding a number of the main drivers. The global economy is on a recovery path. Inflation has moderated in the emerging economies and remains benign in most advanced economies. The FOMC statement yesterday confirmed the gradual pace of reduction of its balance sheet and normalisation of its policy rate. Along with continued accommodative policies by the ECB, this is expected to contribute to the continuation of favourable prospects for capital flows to emerging economies. MPC Statement September 21st, 2017 Page 1. MPC Statement September 21st, 2017 Page 1 The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas increased to 4.8% in August, up from 4.6% previously, marginally below the Bank's short-term forecast. Food and non-alcoholic beverage inflation surprised on the downside, moderating from 6.8% to 5.7%. Meat prices continued to accelerate in August, having measured 15.0%, but the lower cereal prices contributed to the slowing momentum. The Bank's measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity, measured 4.7% in July and 4.6% in August in line with the short-term forecast. Year-on-year producer price inflation for final manufactured goods declined from 4.0% in June to 3.6% in July. Food products price inflation moderated further, to 3.3% in July, but the divergent trend of manufactured meat prices continued with an increase of 17.8%. This trend was also evident in agricultural prices, where the subcategory of â€œlive animalsâ€ increased by 31.7%, while â€œproducts of crops and horticultureâ€ declined by 26.9%. The Bank's forecast for headline CPI inflation is unchanged at an annual average of 5.3% in 2017, and revised up by 0.1 percentage point to 5.0% and 5.3% in 2018 and 2019. A lower turning point of 4.6% is still expected in the first quarter of 2018. The same pattern is observed in the forecast for core inflation which is unchanged at 4.8% for 2017, but adjusted up to 4.9% and 5.0% for the next two years. These forecasts do not incorporate the most recent inflation outcome. The main drivers of these changes are a lower repurchase rate, a less appreciated exchange rate assumption, a slightly narrower output gap and a marginal adjustment to the food price forecast as meat prices continue to surprise on the upside. Food price MPC Statement September 21st, 2017 Page 2. Food price MPC Statement September 21st, 2017 Page 2 inflation is forecast to reach a low turning point of 4.8% in the first quarter of 2018, and to average 7.3% in 2017, and 5.2% and 5.6% in 2018 and 2019. There may be some downside risk to this forecast in light of the August food inflation outcomes. The electricity tariff assumption remains unchanged at 8.0% from July next year, but there may be some upside risk to this assumption, given Eskom's recent application to Nersa. Inflation expectations as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research at Stellenbosch University in the third quarter of 2017 continue to be relatively anchored at the upper end of the target range. Despite a decline of 0.2 percentage points in the average expected inflation for 2017 to 5.7%, expectations remain unchanged at 5.8% and 5.9% for the next two years. Expectations of analysts and business people moderated - although the latter remain above the target range - while those of trade unionists increased marginally. A welcome development is that average 5-year inflation expectations declined from 5.9% to 5.6%. This is the lowest level recorded since long-term expectations were first surveyed in 2011. Expectations implicit in the difference between nominal bonds and inflation-linked bonds are more or less unchanged since the previous meeting, with the 5-year break-even rate at 5.2%. Global conditions remain generally favourable despite some geopolitical risks. The upswing appears to be synchronised, with increased world trade volumes. Growth in the US is forecast to remain above potential in the short to medium term, with the devastation caused by the recent hurricanes expected to have only a limited and short- lived impact on growth. The improved growth performance in the euro area also appears to be sustained and region-wide, while the Japanese economy has MPC Statement September 21st, 2017 Page 3. The improved growth performance in the euro area also appears to be sustained and region-wide, while the Japanese economy has MPC Statement September 21st, 2017 Page 3 experienced moderate growth in the past few quarters. By contrast, growth in the UK has slowed, following weak investment in the face of the Brexit headwinds. The outlook for emerging markets is also relatively positive amid generally improving fundamentals. Despite the improved growth outlook, global inflation pressures remain benign, particularly in the advanced economies. These trends are likely to contribute to the persistence of accommodative monetary policy stances in Japan and the euro area, where the recent appreciation of the euro is likely to dampen inflation pressures further. As expected, the US Fed yesterday announced a gradual reduction of its balance sheet. The process had been communicated previously and was largely priced in by the financial markets. The pace of policy rate normalisation is also expected to remain measured, as inflation continues to surprise on the downside, despite tightening labour market conditions. The stance of US fiscal policy is a source of uncertainty. Although tax reductions could lead to a faster pace of monetary tightening, the prospect of significant tax reforms has receded over time. The rand exchange rate traded in a range of between R13.54 and R12.74 since the previous meeting of the MPC, driven in part by movements in the major currencies. Over this period, the rand depreciated by 2.8% against the US dollar, by 6.2% against the euro, and by 4.5% on a trade-weighted basis. The rand remains sensitive to political developments, weak economic growth prospects and the risk of further sovereign ratings downgrades. However, it has been supported by persistent trade account surpluses and associated narrowing of the current account deficit. MPC Statement September 21st, 2017 Page 4. MPC Statement September 21st, 2017 Page 4 The rand has also been supported by the relatively accommodative global monetary policy settings. These have contributed to sustained demand for high-yielding emerging market bonds. Net purchases by non-residents of South African government bonds have amounted to R(63) billion year to date. The domestic yield curve relative to other peer emerging market economies remains attractive to non-residents despite a decline in the curve across all maturities. However, longer-term bond yields and the rand remain vulnerable to a large non-resident sell-off in the event of further credit ratings downgrades resulting in South Africa falling out of the global bond indices. The domestic economic growth outlook remains constrained despite the higher-than- expected growth outcome of 2.5% in the second quarter of this year. This broad-based improvement, while welcome, is not expected to have a significant impact on the annual growth outcome. The Bank's forecast for GDP growth for 2017 has been revised up marginally from 0.5% to 0.6%, while the forecasts for 2018 and 2019 have remained unchanged at 1.2% and 1.5%. This outlook is consistent with the Bank's leading business cycle indicator which has been weakening since the beginning of the year, indicative of muted growth prospects. Business confidence also remains at very low levels, despite the slight improvement in the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index during the third quarter. All the major sectors, apart from construction, recorded positive growth in the second quarter, with a particularly strong performance in the agricultural sector. The recovery in the manufacturing sector followed three successive quarterly contractions, while the tertiary sector reversed its one quarter contraction. The limited monthly data for the third quarter present a mixed picture at this stage. Mining sector output contracted in MPC Statement September 21st, 2017 Page 5. Mining sector output contracted in MPC Statement September 21st, 2017 Page 5 July while manufacturing recorded positive growth. However, the Absa PMI has averaged 43.5 index points in the first two months of the quarter, suggesting continued headwinds for the sector. The underlying weakness in the economy is evident in the 2.6% contraction in gross fixed capital formation during the second quarter. Of particular concern is the 6.9% decline in private sector fixed investment, reflecting the low levels of business confidence. This subdued outlook is expected to persist against a backdrop of continued political and policy uncertainty. These investment trends do not bode well for employment creation in the economy. Total employment declined in the second quarter of 2017 and the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 27.7%. The public sector, previously the main source of employment growth in the economy, is likely to continue to shed jobs as fiscal constraints intensify. Consumption expenditure by households rebounded strongly in the second quarter following the sizeable contraction in the previous quarter. Spending on all three major goods components recovered, but expenditure on services contracted. Despite the improved outcome, the outlook for consumption expenditure growth remains subdued, although positive, amid very low levels of consumer confidence. Month-on-month retail trade sales decreased in July, but motor vehicle sales remained relatively strong in July and August. The Bank expects household consumption growth to be in the region of 1% for this year. MPC Statement September 21st, 2017 Page 6. MPC Statement September 21st, 2017 Page 6 The underlying drivers of household consumption expenditure remains unchanged. Lower inflation, lower interest rates and higher real income growth are expected to provide some support for consumption. Offsetting effects include depressed consumer confidence, weak employment growth, the absence of significant wealth effects, and the prospect of further tax increases in the wake of fiscal revenue shortfalls. In addition, growth in credit extension to the private sector has declined steadily over the past few months, as corporate demand for mortgage finance and general loans in particular moderated. Growth in credit extension to households remains weak and negative in real terms. These trends are also reflected in continued household deleveraging, with household debt to disposable income declining further to 72.6% in the second quarter, its lowest level since the beginning of 2006. International oil prices have increased by about US$5 per barrel since the previous meeting, with Brent crude oil currently trading at around US$55 per barrel. Nevertheless, the MPC does not expect a further sustained acceleration in prices as the flexibility of US shale oil production is expected to provide a ceiling to prices. The previous oil price assumptions therefore remain unchanged. The domestic price of 95 octane petrol has increased by a cumulative 86 cents per litre since August, mainly due to higher international product prices. A further moderate increase is expected in October. MPC Statement September 21st, 2017 Page 7. MPC Statement September 21st, 2017 Page 7 The MPC expects inflation to remain within the target range over the forecast period, closer to the mid-point than was the case early in the year. Core inflation has remained relatively stable, indicative of the absence of significant demand pressures. However, a number of risks to the inflation outlook have increased and the MPC assesses the risks to the inflation outlook to be somewhat on the upside. The rand remains a key upside risk to the inflation outlook. Furthermore, some of the event risks, particularly those of a political nature, are now more imminent but with no greater degree of clarity regarding the outcome. The prospect of a further ratings downgrade persists, particularly given the increased fiscal challenges and political uncertainty. The narrower current account deficit and the global environment remain supportive of the rand. However, should inflation and/or growth surprise on the upside in Europe and in the US in particular, we could see a faster pace of monetary tightening, which could impact on capital flows and the rand exchange rate. At this stage, the markets appear to be pricing a high probability of an increase in the Federal funds rate in December, and three further increases next year. A further upside risk relates to the possibility of a large electricity tariff increase than is currently assumed in our forecast from July next year. A tariff increase of 20% could raise the headline inflation forecast by between 0.2 and 0.3 percentage points, and the MPC will continue to assess the possible second round effects of these increases. The MPC remains concerned that inflation expectations of business people and trade unions remains above or close to 6% for the next two years even though our own forecast and those of most analysts expect inflation to be much closer to 5%. Lower MPC Statement September 21st, 2017 Page 8. Lower MPC Statement September 21st, 2017 Page 8 inflation expectations among key price setters is an important element in reducing inflation in the future, thus enabling lower nominal interest rates. Until August, food price inflation had been moderating at a slower pace than expected, mainly due to the continued acceleration in meat prices. However, the August year- on-year outcome surprised significantly on the downside. Should this lower trajectory continue, there could be a downside risk to the food price forecast, and to the overall inflation outlook, particularly in the short term. Although household consumption expenditure rebounded strongly in the second quarter, the MPC does not view this as indicative of the longer-term trend of expenditure, which is expected to remain constrained. The second quarter growth outcome, while positive, does not change our growth forecast significantly, and the outlook remains weak. The MPC assesses the risks to the revised growth forecast to be slightly on the downside. In light of these developments and the deteriorating assessment of the balance of the risks, the MPC has decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 6.75% per annum. Three members preferred an unchanged stance and three members preferred a 25 basis point reduction. Ultimately the committee decided to keep the rate unchanged. Given the heightened uncertainties in the economy, the MPC felt it would be appropriate to maintain the current monetary policy stance at this stage, and reassess the data and the balance of risks at the next meeting.

Armenia,2017-09-26,"PRESS RELEASE 26.09.2017 On the September 26th of 2017 meeting the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia decided to leave the refinancing rate unchanged, at the 6.0% level. There was 0.4% deflation registered in August of 2017, and the 12â€month inflation rate persisted at the same level, 0.9% as of the end of August. Meanwhile, the 12â€month core inflation has increased at a faster pace over the headline inflation, from 0.7% in the previous month to 1.5% this month, while the rise in seasonal prices of agricultural products has slowed down sharply to 1.2% from 7.8%. In the external environment, the global economic growth outlook further followed a positive track in both developed and developing economies. This has pushed the copper prices considerably up while moderate price inflation has been observable in other commodity markets. Based on this, the Board of the Central Bank expects minor inflationary effects from the external sector. The Board notes that in the first half of 2017, compared to the same period last year, economic growth had exceeded the expectations by 1.0 pp, amounting to 6.0%. Economic activity remained strong in the third quarter too, driven by the growth in industry and services sectors that have offset the decline in agriculture and construction sectors. According to the Central Bank estimates, domestic demand is recovering faster than expected, pointing to reported high growth rates in economy lending, imports and core inflation. The recovery of domestic demand has been largely conditioned by the implemented expansionary monetary policy and the fiscal policy which proved less contractionary than predicted. In such a situation, the Board of the Central Bank is of the opinion that the current policy rate is quite expansionary and will remain so for some time according to prediction scenario. It will continue transmitting its impact on aggregate demand, prompting the inflation to increase gradually and to stabilize around the target in the forecast horizon. Should there emerge risks to the economic growth outlook and inflation deviating from its recovery path, the Central Bank would react by adjusting its monetary policy directions accordingly, while fulfilling the inflation target in the medium run. Detailed information on setting of the interest rate will be available in Press Release (Minutes on Interest Rate), to be published by October 6, 2017. Press Service of the Central Bank of Armenia."
Nigeria,2017-09-26,"CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO 115 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING OF 25th AND 26th SEPTEMBER, 2017 Background The Monetary Policy Committee met on the 25th and 26th of September, 2017 against the backdrop of a relatively optimistic global economy. The Committee examined the global and domestic economic and financial environments up to the third quarter of 2017, and the outlook for the rest of the year. The recent spate of flooding and hurricanes in some parts of the globe; the flooding in Nigeria; the increasing tension between the US and North Korea, and the perception of hostilities on the Korean Peninsula as well as the associated geo-political tensions, were identified as key risks to global output growth. On the domestic front, the economy exited recession (which began in the first quarter of 2016) in the second half of 2017, with a modest positive short to medium-term outlook, resulting largely from deliberate macroeconomic stimulus and a stable naira exchange rate. Inflation expectations also appeared anchored on the strength of prevailing tight monetary policy stance. Seven members of the MPC were present at the meeting. External Developments Global output is projected to improve further in 2017, as growth forecast by the IMF in its July World Economic Outlook (WEO) was projected at 35 per cent, up from 32 per cent in 2016. Output growth in some advanced economies, including Japan, the Euro- area as well as some emerging market and developing economies is expected to improve in 2017. Nigeria Brazil and South Africa, all exited recession, while Russia is likely to exit recession in the fourth quarter of 2017, after a mild contraction of 057 per cent in the second quarter. Growth forecast for the US was revised downwards from 23 per cent to 21 per cent in 2017, as a result of the weak growth observed in the first quarter of the year. The MPC, however, noted some headwinds confronting the optimistic global growth prospects to include: recent developments on the Korean peninsula; the damage to infrastructure caused by hurricanes - Harvey. Irma and Maria; the lull in BREXIT negotiations and the normalization of monetary policy by the US Fed, which is expected to instigate global capital flow reversal. Other challenges include the continued slow pace of recovery in global oil and other commodity prices and China's reduction in uptake of global commodities. In addition, the 2 Committee noted the tepid global inflation momentum, implying that continued monetary policy normalization could be injurious to global growth prospects. The uptick in global inflation persisted, but moderated, in response to rising oil prices, continued accommodative monetary policy in the advanced economies; and currency appreciation in some emerging markets and developing countries. Average inflation for the developed economies is projected at 19 per cent in 2017, while it is forecast to average 45 per cent in the emerging and developing economies, as prices are expected to moderate due to seasonal effects. The Committee observed that the outlook for global monetary policy remains predominantly accommodative, in support of recovery and growth. Domestic Output Developments Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 055 per cent in the second quarter of 2017, against the contractions of 091 and 149 per cent in the previous quarter of 2017, and the corresponding quarter of 2016, respectively, marking the technical exit of the Nigerian economy from recession. Non-oil real GDP grew by 045 per cent in Q2, 2017, driven largely by agriculture (30%), industry (11%), and construction (01%). The modest growth was attributed to fiscal injections from the implementation of the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP), and enhanced supply of 3 foreign exchange arising from improved crude oil prices. The Committee also noted the positive outlook from the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for manufacturing and non-manufacturing activities, which stood at 536 and 541 index points in August 2017, respectively, above the 50 index points benchmark, indicating moderate signs of recovery. The Committee further noted that, although the recovery was weak, it was hopeful that the active implementation of the 2017 budget could boost aggregate demand and employment. Developments in Money and Prices The Committee noted that money supply (M2) contracted by 1106 per cent in August 2017 (annualised), in contrast to the provisional growth benchmark of 1029 per cent for 2017. The development in M2 is largely due to the contraction of 1842 per cent in other assets net (OAN) in August 2017. Similarly M1 contracted by 1225 per cent in August 2017, (annualised to -1837 per cent). Net domestic credit (NDC) contracted by 014 per cent, annualized at -020 per cent, driven majorly by net credit to government, which also contracted by 105 per cent against the programmed growth of 3312 per cent. Credit to the private sector, however, grew marginally by 007 per cent in August 2017, compared with the provisional benchmark of 1488 per cent. The MPC also noted the policy constraints in ensuring the flow of credit to the real sector in the face of weak and underperforming monetary aggregates. Inflationary pressure in the economy continued to moderate with headline inflation (year-on-year) receding for the seventh consecutive month to 1601 per cent in August 2017, from 1605 per cent in July 2017. Food inflation declined slightly to 2025 per cent in August 2017 from 2028 per cent in July 2017, while core inflation increased to 1230 per cent in August 2017 from 1221 per cent in July 2017. This development was attributed to the contraction in money supply, decline in imported food and non- food prices, favourable base effects, and the moderating effects of stable exchange rates. The Committee, however, noted that the high food inflation was traceable to rising prices of farm inputs and supply shortages, intermittent clashes between farmers and herdsmen, as well as weak harvest, due to increased flooding of farmlands. Money market interest rates oscillated in tandem with the level of liquidity in the banking system as the average inter-bank call rate which opened at 1800 per cent on July 26, 2017, closed at 700 per cent on August 31, 2017. The OBB rate opened at 1503 per cent and closed lower at 783 per cent in the same period. However the average inter-bank call and OBB rates for the period stood at 2263 and 3966 per cent, respectively. The movement in net liquidity positions and flows reflected the effects of OMO sales; foreign exchange interventions; statutory revenue payments to states and local governments; remittances by Nigerian Customs 5 and Federal Inland Revenue Services for FAAC meetings; and the maturity of CBN Bills. The Committee noted the continuing improvement in the external reserves position and the equities segment of the capital market. External reserves position grew to US$329 billion at close of business on 25th September, 2017 while the All-Share Index (ASI) rose by 720 per cent from 33,,11748 on June 30, 2017 to 35,,50462 on August 31, 2017. Market Capitalization (MC) improved by 690 per cent to N1224 trillion from N1145 trillion during the same period. Relative to end-December 2016, capital market indices rose by 3210 and 3230 per cent, respectively, reflecting growing investor confidence, due to improvements in foreign exchange management. Total foreign exchange inflows through the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) rose by 198 per cent in August 2017, compared with the previous month. Similarly total outflow increased by 703 per cent during the same period, as a result of increased international remittances, inclusive of public sector and JVC payments; which rose by 5859 per cent in the period under review. The Committee noted the trend towards convergence between the rates at the bureau-de-change (BDC) and the Nigeria Autonomous Foreign Exchange (NAFEX) segments, as well as the stability of the exchange rate at the inter-bank segment of the 6 foreign exchange market during the review period. Similarly the Committee noted the success of the Investor and Exporters' window (I &E) of the foreign exchange market and traced this not only to foreign investor confidence but also to the zeal and commitment of Nigerian exporters who have demonstrated preference for the window to the parallel market. The Committee observed that the I&E window has increased liquidity and boosted confidence in the market with over US$70 billion inflow in the last five months. The Committee will continue to introduce policies that will improve the confidence of foreign investors in the country's macroeconomic management regime. Overall Outlook and Risks Available data and forecast of key macroeconomic variables indicate a relatively positive outlook, predicated on existing policy initiatives including the ERGP. Other potential drivers of economic recovery are; the expected increase in government revenue arising from favourable crude oil prices, stable output, and general improvements in the non-oil sector, especially, agriculture, industry and construction. The intervention by the CBN in the real sector is expected to continue to yield positive results in terms of output and lower consumer prices. The Committee, however, noted some downside risks to the overall short- to medium-term positive outlook for the economy. These include; flooding which displaced farming communities and 7 political agitations. On the external front, the hawkish policy stance in the United States, rising geo-political tensions and sluggish output recovery in the Euro-area and Japan, could slow- down the momentum of global output growth, with significant spillovers to emerging markets and developing countries, including Nigeria. The Considerations of the Committee The Committee applauded the exit of the Nigerian economy from recession but observed that the growth remains fragile and, therefore, hopes that complementary fiscal and monetary policies would sustain the growth momentum. The Committee further expressed satisfaction with the gradual, but consistent decline in inflation, noting, however, the substantial base effect in addition to the continuous improvement in the naira exchange rate across all segments of the foreign exchange market; and considerable improvement in foreign capital inflow. The Committee welcomed the steady implementation of the 2017 Budget, especially, the capital component of the budget, and urged increased momentum in expenditure directed at the growth-stimulating sectors of the economy in order to reduce youth unemployment and restiveness. The Committee, however, expressed concern on the sustained pressure on food prices, noting risks posed by floods, strikes and insurgencies in various parts of the country to food production and 8 distribution. Regarding the tepid turnaround in economic activities in the second quarter of 2017, the Committee emphasized that the employment gains of recovery were still minimal, noting that a number of important job elastic sub-sectors were still weak and may require more fiscal support to regain traction. The Committee, however, commended the Federal Government for issuing the Executive Order aimed at improving the ease of doing business in the country. It also noted the efforts of the government to create jobs in the agricultural sector with the inauguration of the Presidential Committee on job creation, targeting at least ten thousand jobs in each state of the Federation, over the next six months through a boost in agricultural support and funding. The Committee enjoins the state governments to work with the Presidential Committee to actualise this plan without further delay. The MPC also noted with satisfaction, the directive of the Federal Government to all states to promptly pay outstanding salary arrears, in order to boost aggregate demand. It commended efforts to clear outstanding contractor arrears; prompt settlement of trade disputes with certain Unions of organised labour, including the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) and Health Workers; as well as the release of money to settle outstanding entitlements of the erstwhile workers of the defunct Nigeria Airways. These efforts, the Committee reasoned would improve aggregate demand and strengthen the weak recovery. The Committee restated its commitment to maintaining stability in prices, without which meaningful recovery cannot be achieved. In this regard, members welcomed the gradual narrowing of rate spreads in the foreign exchange market and urged the Bank to continue to monitor and respond proactively to threats and vulnerabilities in the foreign exchange market. On the outlook for financial stability, the Committee noted that, in spite of the banking sub-sector's resilience, the weak macroeconomic environment has continued to impact negatively on the stability of the sub-sector. The Committee reiterated its call on the Bank to sustain its surveillance of deposit money banks (DMBs) activities for the purpose of prompt identification and mitigation of potential vulnerabilities. The Committee also called on the DMBs to support the quest to move the economy forward by extending reasonably low priced credit to the private sector. The Committee's Decisions In arriving at its decision, the Committee took note of the gains so far achieved as a result of its earlier decisions; including the stability in the foreign exchange market and the moderate reduction in inflation. The option was whether to hold, tighten or ease. These were subjected to extensive debate. As in previous meetings, although tightening would help rein in inflation expectations and strengthen the stability in the foreign exchange 10 market, the Committee felt that it would further widen the income gap, depress aggregate demand and adversely affect credit delivery to the private sector. The Committee also noted that tightening may result in the deposit money banks re-pricing their assets and loans, thus raising the cost of borrowing and therefore heightening the already weak investment climate and non- performing loans. With respect to loosening, the Committee believed that although while it would make it more attractive for Nigerians to acquire assets at cheaper prices, thus increasing their net wealth, and therefore stimulate spending as confidence rises, it nevertheless, felt constrained that loosening at this time would exacerbate inflationary pressures and worsen the exchange rate and inflationary conditions. The Committee also felt that loosening will further pull the real rate deeper into negative territory as the gap between the nominal interest rate and inflation widens. On the argument to hold, the Committee believes that the effects of fiscal policy actions towards stimulating the economy have begun to manifest as evident in the exit of the economy from the fifteen-month recession. Although still fragile, the fragility of the growth makes it imperative to allow more time to make appropriate complementary policy decisions to strengthen the recovery. Secondly the Committee was of the view that economic activity would become clearer between now and the 11 first quarter of 2018, when growth is expected to have sufficiently strengthened and gains in receding inflation, very obvious. The most compelling argument for a hold was to achieve more clarity in the evolution of key macroeconomic indicators including budget implementation, economic recovery, exchange rate, inflation and employment generation. In consideration of the headwinds confronting the domestic economy and the uncertainties in the global environment, the Committee decided by a vote of 6 to 1 to retain the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) at 140 per cent alongside all other policy parameters. In arriving at this HOLD decision, the MPC commits to employing maximum flexibility to guide the economy on the path to optimal growth. Consequently 6 members voted to retain the MPR and all other parameters at their current levels, while one member voted to lower the MPR to signal an ease to the current stance of tight monetary policy. However overall, majority of the members expressed a strong commitment to policy flexibility that would allow the Committee to promptly take the necessary actions that would promote overall macroeconomic stability and engender sustainable growth. In summary, the MPC voted to: Retain the MPR at 140 per cent; Retain the CRR at 225 per cent; 12 Retain the Liquidity Ratio at 300 per cent; and Retain the Asymmetric corridor at +200 and -500 basis points around the MPR. Thank you for listening. Godwin I Emefiele Governor. Central Bank of Nigeria 26th September, 2017 13."
Czech Republic,2017-09-27,"<At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank decided to keep interest rates unchanged. The two-week repo rate thus remains at 0.25%, the discount rate at 0.05% and the Lombard rate at 0.50%. Four members voted in favour of this decision. Three members voted for raising the two-week repo rate to 0.50% and the Lombard rate to 1.00%. . According to the current forecast, inflation will stay in the upper half of the tolerance band around the target for the rest of this year and decline towards the 2% target at the start of next year. Following the August rise in interest rates, a further increase in rates over the next two years is consistent with the forecast. The Bank Board assessed the risks to the current forecast as being slightly inflationary. The outlook for economic activity in the Czech Republic's main trading partner countries has risen slightly over the entire forecast horizon, but most markedly at its shorter end. By contrast, the outlook for foreign industrial producer prices for this year and the next has been revised downwards slightly. Expected consumer price inflation in the euro area this year has also been lowered marginally. The outlook for euro interest rates has also shifted slightly lower over the entire forecast horizon and remains negative until the end of 2019. The market outlook for the Brent crude oil price has increased over the entire forecast horizon. In terms of koruna prices of oil, however, this is partly offset by a stronger euro against the dollar. Domestic inflation rose to 2.5% in July and stayed at the same level in August. The inflation outturn in August was 0.1 percentage point below the forecast. This small deviation was due to slightly lower-than-forecasted growth in food prices. In line with our expectations, core inflation continued to increase, mainly due to accelerating growth of the domestic economy and wages. Following a previous decline, price growth in manufacturing rebounded modestly in August. Growth in agricultural producer prices remains in double figures. Growth in construction work prices and market services prices is accelerating gradually. The growth of the Czech economy accelerated to more than 4.5% in 2017 Q2, whereas the forecast had expected it to be more than a percentage point lower. The stronger growth of the Czech economy was aided by household consumption, reflecting buoyant growth in wages and employment. It was also fostered by a marked recovery in investment activity and by foreign trade. The available monthly indicators point to continued solid growth in industrial production and retail sales. Following a long period of decline, construction output rose for the fifth consecutive month. The economic sentiment of both households and corporations remains high. These indicators thus suggest continued robust economic growth in Q3. In line with our prediction, the unemployment rate fell slightly again in 2017 Q2. The share of unemployed persons has also come down somewhat further in Q3 so far. A shortage of available labour coupled with high labour demand led to a further sizeable increase in job vacancies and stronger upward pressure on wages. As a result, wage growth in market sectors rose sharply in Q2, significantly exceeding the forecasted levels. Wages in non-market sectors are also rising very quickly. The tightness in the labour market has thus increased again. To sum up the important facts about recent developments in the Czech economy, inflation was only slightly below the forecast in August. The share of unemployed persons in July and August was also very close to the forecast. Conversely. GDP and the average wage increased much faster in Q2 compared to the forecast."
Thailand,2017-09-27,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 6/2017 Mr. Jaturong Jantarangs. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 27 September 2017 as follows. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 150 percent. One MPC member was unable to attend this meeting. In deliberating their policy decision, the Committee assessed that the Thai economy would grow at a faster pace than the previous assessment, driven by expansion in merchandise and service exports and a continued recovery in domestic demand that started to be more broad-based. Headline inflation was projected to edge up albeit at a slower pace than previously expected mainly because of supply-side factors, especially fresh food prices. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative and conducive to economic growth. Hence the Committee viewed that the current accommodative monetary policy stance remained conducive to the continuation of economic growth, and it should foster the return of headline inflation to target although this could take some time. Thus the Committee decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at this meeting. The Thai economy gained further traction on account of stronger growth in merchandise exports and tourism driven by a stronger global economic recovery. Private consumption continued to expand on the back of services and durable goods. Nonetheless overall private consumption gradually expanded as household purchasing power was not sufficiently strong, particularly low-income households whose income had yet to fully recover. Private investment in machinery and equipment picked up across various business sectors and was expected to gradually expand. Meanwhile public investment remained an important growth driver, although it would likely slow down in the near term following accelerated disbursement in the previous period. Nevertheless the improved growth outlook was still subject to both domestic and external risks that warranted close monitoring, such as impacts from regulations on immigrant workers, uncertainties pertaining to US economic and foreign trade policies, and geopolitical risks. Headline inflation increased at a slower pace than the previous assessment. This was due primarily to the decline in fresh food prices as a result of higher output of vegetable and fruits thanks to favorable weather conditions. Meanwhile demand-pull inflationary pressures remained low, and would be subject to structural changes that might lead to slower pace of inflation than in the past. Nevertheless headline inflation was projected to slowly rise from the recovery in domestic demand, an increase in excise tax, and regulations on immigrant workers that might affect wages going forward. The public's inflation expectations remained close to the midpoint of the target. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative and conducive to economic growth with ample liquidity in the financial system. Government bond yields and real interest rates remained low. Business financing through both credit and capital markets continued to expand. Meanwhile the Thai baht appreciated somewhat owing primarily to the weakening of US dollar, and Thailand's current account surplus. However the Thai baht's movement relative to those of trading partners was largely unchanged. In the period ahead, exchanges rates might experience high volatilities due to uncertainties on the external front such as uncertainties pertaining to US economic policies, and monetary policy conducts of major advanced 2 economies. Thus the Committee would continue to closely monitor developments in foreign exchange market. The Committee viewed that financial stability remained sound but would continue to monitor pockets of risks that might pose vulnerabilities to financial stability in the future. These included, in particular, the search-for-yield behavior in the prolonged low interest rate environment that might lead to underpricing of risks, and the deterioration in debt serviceability of small-and-medium sized enterprises (SMEs) especially those affected by changes in structural factors and business models. Looking ahead. Thailand's growth outlook improved further on the back of external demand while strength in recovery of domestic demand must be monitored. Hence the Committee viewed that monetary policy should remain accommodative and would stand ready to utilize available policy tools to sustain economic growth while also ensuring financial stability."
Egypt,2017-09-28,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release September 28, 2017 In its meeting held on September 28, 2017, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) main operation unchanged at 1875 percent, 1975 percent, and 1925 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 1925 percen. Since the MPC meeting on August 17, 2017, annual headline inflation declined to 319 percent from 330 percent in July, while monthly headline inflation declined to 11 percent from 32 percen. Inflation in August was mainly driven by an upward adjustment of regulated prices due to higher electricity tariffs, as well as by the increase in prices of fresh vegetable. On the other hand, core food prices registered the lowest increase since August 2016, and prices of services were only affected by the indirect first- round effect of the hydrocarbon-subsidy reforms on inland transportatio. Meanwhile prices of retail items remained broadly unchange. Consequently annual core inflation declined to 349 percent in August from 353 percent in July, while monthly core inflation dropped to 03 percent from 28 percent, recording the lowest monthly inflation rate since July 201. Economic activity continued to improve with real GDP growing by a revised 50 percent in 2016/17 Q4 and more recent activity indicators solidifying the improvemen. As a result, real GDP growth averaged 46 percent during the second half of 2016/17, growing at the fastest pace since 2009/1. This coincided with the narrowing of the unemployment rate to 120 percent on average during the second half of 2016/17, registering the lowest rate since 2011/1. Available data up to March showed that the structure of economic growth shifted towards increased sustainability, with declining contribution of consumption and increasing contribution of net exports as well as investment by a lesser exten. Tourism natural gas, trade, construction and non-petroleum manufacturing were the main sectors driving economic growt. Real monetary conditions continued to tighten, a necessary requirement to achieve the CBE's inflation targe. This process was supported by the combination of previous policy rate increases and the recent stability of the Egyptian pound against trading-partner currencie. Consistent with the tighter monetary policy stance, annual reserve-money growth adjusted by overnight deposits and seven-day deposit auctions shrunk to reflect the absorption of excess liquidity via longer-term open market operation. The inflation outlook remains in line with achieving the inflation targe. Against this background and given the continuation of tightening real monetary conditions, the MPC decided that current policy rates remain appropriate at this junctur. The MPC continues to closely monitor all economic developments as well as the balance of risks, and will not hesitate to adjust its stance to offset anticipated deviations from the inflation target of 13 percent (+/- 3 percent) in 2018 Q4 and single digits thereafte.

Colombia,2017-09-29,"The Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica at today's meeting decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 5.25%. For this decision, the Board mainly took into account the following aspects. As expected, after a year of continuous decline, the figure for annual inflation increased in August to 3.87%. The acceleration of inflation was mainly explained by the higher rate of the yearly increase of the food CPI due to a low basis for comparison. The average of core inflation indicators continued descending, standing at 4.74%. Analysts' inflation expectations to December 2017 and 2018 are 4.18% and 3.58%, respectively. Those embedded in public debt bonds recorded slight changes. The direct effects of the strong transitory supply shocks that deviated yearly inflation from its target would have already faded. However, core inflation indicators remain above the target as a result of the indexation of prices, the persistence of inflation, and the transitory effect of the increase in indirect taxes at the beginning of the year. External demand remains weak, but it is recovering, driven mainly by developed economies. Oil prices increased, and it is likely that the terms of trade will post above the average level recorded in 2016 at the end of the year. In the United States, the Fed announced that it will slowly reduce its level of financial assets; also, the likelihood that this year the Fed would increase its policy interest rate increased. In Colombia, the new figures for economic activity suggest that economic growth in the third quarter would be low, but higher than in the first half of the year. Thus, higher growth is projected for the second half of the year, in line with expectations. Based on this information, the Board considered the following factors for its decision. Weakness in economic activity and the risk of a slowdown beyond what is compatible with the deterioration in the dynamics of income due to the fall in oil prices. Recent indicators confirm there is an excess capacity of the economy. Uncertainty about the pace of convergence of inflation to its 3.0% target. Indexation mechanisms and the persistence of inflation continue to be reflected on core inflation indicators, which exceed the inflation target (3.0%), as well as inflation expectations to one year and more. After the reductions of the benchmark interest rate along the year, some indicators suggest that the real value of the reference rate is close to its neutral level, although there is uncertainty over such level. Henceforth, reaching an expansionary monetary policy stance will depend on the forecasts for inflation, the output gap, and the current account deficit. The decision to maintain the benchmark interest rate unchanged was approved by five members of the Board. The two remaining Board Members voted for a 25 bp reduction."
Pakistan,2017-09-29,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement September 29, 2017 Macroeconomic environment remains conducive to growth without impacting headline inflation. Favorable initial estimates of major crops, healthy growth in credit to private sector and growing productive imports all indicate solid gains in the real sector. On the back of adequate food supplies and stable international commodity prices, headline inflation decelerated in the first two months of FY18. The pursuit of higher economic growth however poses growing challenges partly enunciated at the start of FY18. These include those arising from pressures on the external front and an expansionary fiscal policy. Expounding the real sector, full year LSM data indicates healthy and broad-based growth of. percent for FY17 as compared to its earlier estimates of. percent. In fact. LSM for July 2017 posted growth of 13. percent. Delving deeper into FY18, manufacturing activity is expected to benefit from higher development spending, growing investments in CPEC-related projects, improvement in security condition, and the continued trend of stable and low cost of borrowing. Furthermore an upbeat industrial outlook and promising assessment of major crops are going to have positive spillovers on the services sector. Based on current projections of agriculture sector growth. GDP growth is likely to reach the annual target of. percent for FY18 leading to an improved capacity to accommodate rising domestic demand. Turning to inflation, average CPI inflation eased to. percent in Jul-Aug FY18 compared to. percent during the same period last year. With comfortable wheat and sugar stocks, no major disruption is expected from supply side in the coming months of FY18. However the core inflation (non-food-non-energy), reflecting the underlying demand pressures in the economy, continues to maintain its higher level of. percent in the initial two months of the fiscal year. This is also visible from IBA-SBP's Consumer Confidence Survey of September 2017, which shows modest rise in expected inflation during the next six months. Thus with these demand and supply side dynamics, average CPI inflation is expected to remain well below FY18 target of. percent. As depicted by core inflation, changes in monetary aggregates also indicate growing demand in the economy. Although credit to private sector recorded net seasonal retirement of Rs 80. billion during 1st July to 15th September FY18, its year-on-year growth has edged up to 21. percent on 15th September 2017- as compared to. percent on 16th September 2016, reflecting an increase of Rs 892 billion during the year. Led by historic low interest rates on the one hand and growing construction activity and consumer durables on the other, demand for credit picked up. At the same time, healthy deposit growth has improved supply of loanable funds with the banking sector and market rates remained stable. These favorable conditions at the beginning of upcoming credit cycle bode well for healthy credit off take for yet another year. The higher trajectory of economic growth has generated complementary external sector pressures. The current account deficit for the first two months of FY18 has widened to US$. billion. This is primarily driven by higher imports of productive goods, especially of machinery, metal and petroleum products. The increase in import of these three groups was strong enough Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN to offset the combined impact of healthy growth in exports and workers' remittances during Jul-Aug FY18. On the financial account front, foreign direct investments recorded net inflow of US$ 456 million in Jul-Aug FY18, which is more than double the level of inflows in the corresponding period last year. This together with other financial flows, was however not enough to manage the higher current account deficit. Going forward, there are anticipations of gain in exports on account of favorable global economic conditions, improvement in domestic energy supplies, and incentives given to exporting industry. Compared with information in July 2017, exports present an encouraging picture. However imports are also expected to rise due to ongoing CPEC related investments and domestic economic activities, although at slower pace than in FY17. Amid declining number of workers proceeding abroad there are prospects of sluggish growth in workers' remittances. Hence an improvement in the country's external account and its foreign exchange reserve relies upon timely realization of official financial inflows along with thoughtful adoption of structural reforms to improve trade competitiveness in the medium term. Following detailed deliberations and taking into consideration the above mentioned developments, the Monetary Policy Committee has decided to keep the policy rate at.75%. Page."
Romania,2017-10-03," Video: Press briefing, 3 October 2017 (Romanian only)  Board meeting minutes. In its meeting of 3 October 2017, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided the following:. The annual inflation rate continued to rise in the first two months of Q3 as a whole, posting a significant increase in July (to 1.42 percent from 0.85 percent in the previous month), before slowing down to 1.15 percent in August, slightly lower than forecasted. The rise was driven by administered prices, following the electricity price hike, while also being supported by fuel price developments amid the pick-up in international oil prices, as well as by faster core inflation. The mentioned effects were partly offset by the impact of declining volatile food prices. The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate exceeded marginally the forecasted level, to 1.60 percent in August from 1.42 percent in June, on account of a faster pick-up in services prices and, to a lower extent, in processed food prices. In July 2017, the average annual CPI inflation rate entered positive territory (from -0.1 percent in June), rising further from 0.1 percent in July to 0.2 percent in August; calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, the annual average consolidated in positive territory at 0.3 percent in August, against 0.2 percent in June 2017. Statistical data on economic growth in 2017 Q2 show a faster-than-expected pick-up in the annual dynamics of real GDP  5.9 percent compared to 5.7 percent in the previous quarter. The evolution owed entirely to domestic demand  private consumption expanded by 7.4 percent (contributing 5.3 percentage points to GDP growth), under the impact of fiscal and wage measures and the improvement in employment, whereas gross fixed capital formation returned to positive territory (2.4 percent, making a 0.6 percentage point contribution). In this quarter, the change in inventories had a significant impact on GDP growth (1.3 percentage points). In the context of a more pronounced deceleration in the annual growth rate of exports of goods and services than in that of imports thereof, the contribution of net exports to GDP dynamics turned again negative (-1.4 percentage points). Moreover, the current account deficit almost trebled compared to 2017 Q1 and its coverage by direct investment and capital transfers fell below 100 percent. On the supply side, the main driver of the stronger advance in economic activity in 2017 Q2 was industrial activity, whose annual pace of increase of 7.7 percent was the highest since 2008 Q3. The services sector continued to make the largest contribution to GDP formation (3.8 percentage points). The latest statistical data show a slowdown in the annual dynamics of industrial output in July (to 7.4 percent from 9.2 percent in the previous month) and a halt in the decline in the construction sector, whereas the turnover volumes of trade and services to households posted faster annual growth rates. Real monetary conditions were highly accommodative in Q3 as well. Towards the quarter-end, interbank money market rates saw a pronounced upward trend, nearing the policy rate, in the context of the significant upward revision of inflation expectations, stronger expectations on the calibration of the monetary policy stance, as well as amid liquidity fluctuations, under the influence of the autonomous liquidity factors. The annual dynamics of credit to the private sector gained substantial momentum, reaching a five-year high of 6.5 percent in August, amid stronger new loan flows, alongside a contraction in the sales of non-performing loans. The share of leu-denominated credit in total private sector loans continued to widen to 61 percent, certifying the improvement in monetary policy transmission. The latest assessments reconfirm the outlook for a further increase in the annual inflation rate over the months ahead, yet at a slightly quicker pace than that in the medium-term forecast published in the August 2017 Inflation Report, against the background of some risks related to developments in certain exogenous CPI components materialising. The uncertainties and risks associated with this outlook are, however, influenced by the domestic and external environment. Domestically, they are compounded by the fiscal and income policy stance, as well as by the prospects of administered prices (of natural gas, electricity) and volatile food prices. Turning to the external environment, further relevant are the uncertainties and risks regarding economic growth in the euro area and worldwide, the escalation of some geopolitical tensions, but also the decisions made by major central banks (ECB. Fed). Moreover, a reconfiguration of central banks' policies is underway, entailing a change in the path of interest rates on international financial markets. In light of the information available at present, the Board of the National Bank of Romania, which convened in an ordinary meeting, decided to keep unchanged the monetary policy rate at 1.75 percent per annum, maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios and further pursue adequate liquidity management in the banking system. The Board decided to narrow the symmetrical corridor of interest rates on the NBR's standing facilities around the policy rate to Â±1.25 percentage points from Â±1.50 percentage points. Accordingly, starting 4 October 2017, the deposit facility rate increases to 0.50 percent per annum, while the interest rate on the NBR's lending facility (Lombard rate) is lowered to an annual 3.00 percent. The Board decisions aim to ensure and preserve price stability over the medium term in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth. The NBR Board underlines that a balanced macroeconomic policy mix and progress in structural reforms are of the essence in preserving a stable macroeconomic framework and strengthening the capacity of the Romanian economy to withstand potential adverse developments. The NBR is closely monitoring domestic and external developments and stands ready to use all its available tools. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR website on 10 October 2017, at 3:00 p.m. In line with the announced calendar, the next monetary policy meeting of the NBR Board is scheduled for 7 November 2017, when a new quarterly Inflation Report is to be examined."
India,2017-10-04,"Fourth Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2017-18 Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) Reserve Bank of India On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation at its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 6.0 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains at 5.75 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 6.25 per cent. The decision of the MPC is consistent with a neutral stance of monetary policy in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Assessment 2. Since the MPC's meeting in August 2017, global economic activity has strengthened further and become broad-based. Among advanced economies (AEs), the US has continued to expand with revised Q2 GDP growing at its strongest pace in more than two years, supported by robust consumer spending and business fixed investment. Recent hurricanes could, however, weigh on economic activity in the near-term. In the Euro area, the economic recovery gained further traction and spread, underpinned by domestic demand. While private consumption benefited from employment gains, investment rose on the back of favourable financing conditions. The Euro area purchasing managers' index (PMI) for manufacturing soared to its highest reading in more than six years. The Japanese economy continued on a path of healthy expansion despite a downward revision in growth since March 2017 on weaker than expected capital expenditure. Among the major emerging market economies (EMEs), strong growth in Q2 in China was powered by retail sales, and imports grew at a rapid pace, suggesting robust domestic demand; investment activity, however, slowed down. The Brazilian economy expanded for two consecutive quarters in Q2 on improving terms of trade, even as the impact of recession persists on the labour market. Economic activity in Russia recovered further, supported by strengthening global demand, firming up of oil prices and accommodative monetary policy. Although South Africa has emerged out of recession in Q2, the economy faces economic and political challenges.2017 over the lacklustre growth in 2016, backed by a resurgence of Asian trade flows and rising imports by North America. Crude oil prices hit a two-year high in September on account of the combined effect of a pick-up in demand, tightening supplies due to production cuts by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and declining crude oil inventories in the US. Metal prices have eased since mid-September on weaker than expected Chinese industrial production data. Bullion prices touched a year's high in early September on account of safe-haven demand due to geo-political tensions, before weakening somewhat in the second half. Weak non-oil commodity prices and low wage growth kept inflation pressures low in most AEs and subdued in several EMEs, largely reflecting country-specific factors. Global financial markets have been driven mainly by the changing course of monetary policy in AEs, generally improving economic prospects and oscillating geo-political factors. Equity markets in most AEs have continued to rise. In EMEs, equities generally gained on improved global risk appetite, supported by upbeat economic data and expectations of a slower pace of monetary tightening in major AEs. While bond yields in major AEs moved sideways, they showed wider variation in EMEs. In currency markets, the US dollar weakened further and fell to a multi-month low in September on weak inflation, though it recovered some lost ground in the last week of September on a hawkish US Fed stance and tensions around North Korea. The euro surged to a two and a half year high against the US dollar towards end-August on positive economic data, whereas the Japanese yen experienced sporadic bouts of volatility triggered by geo-political risks. Emerging market currencies showed divergent movements and remained highly sensitive to monetary policies of key AEs. Capital flows to EMEs have continued, but appear increasingly vulnerable to the normalisation of monetary policy by the US Fed. On the domestic front, real gross value added (GVA) growth slowed significantly in Q1 of 2017-18, cushioned partly by the extensive front-loading of expenditure by the central government. GVA growth in agriculture and allied activities slackened quarter-on-quarter in the usual first quarter moderation, partly reflecting deceleration in the growth of livestock products, forestry and fisheries. Industrial sector GVA growth fell sequentially as well as on a y-o-y basis. The manufacturing sector  the dominant component of industrial GVA  grew by 1.2 per cent, the lowest in the last 20 quarters. The mining sector, which showed signs of improvement in the second half of 2016-17, entered into contraction mode again in Q1 of 2017-18, on account of a decline in coal production and subdued crude oil production. Services sector performance, however, improved markedly, supported mainly by trade, hotels, transport and communication, which bounced back after a persistent slowdown throughout 2016-17. Construction picked up pace after contracting in Q4 of 2016-17. Financial, real estate and professional services turned around from their lacklustre performance in the second half of 2016-17. Of the constituents of aggregate demand, growth in private consumption expenditure was at a six-quarter low in Q1 of 2017-18. Gross fixed capital formation exhibited a modest recovery in Q1 in contrast to a contraction in the preceding quarter. Turning to Q2, the south-west monsoon, which arrived early and progressed well till the first week of July, lost momentum from mid-July to August  the crucial period for kharif sowing. By end-September, the cumulative rainfall was deficient by around 5 per cent relative to the long period average, with 17 per cent of the geographical area of the country receiving deficient rainfall. The live storage in reservoirs fell to 66 per cent of the full capacity as compared with 74 per cent a year ago. The uneven spatial distribution of the monsoon was reflected in the first advance estimates of kharif production by the Ministry of Agriculture, which were below the level of the previous year due to lower area sown under major crops including rice, coarse cereals, pulses, oilseeds, jute and mesta. The index of industrial production (IIP) recovered marginally in July 2017 from the contraction in June on the back of a recovery in mining, quarrying and electricity generation. However, manufacturing remained weak. In terms of the use-based classification, contraction in capital goods, intermediate goods and consumer durables pulled down overall IIP growth. In August, however, the output of core industries posted robust growth on the back of an uptick in coal production and electricity generation. The manufacturing PMI moved into expansion zone in August and September 2017 on the strength of new orders.312 days to 329 days) under the market stabilisation scheme (MSS) during April and May of 1 trillion. As a result, net average absorption of liquidity under the LAF declined from 3 trillion in July to 1.6 trillion in the second half of September. The weighted average call rate (WACR), which on an average, traded below the repo rate by 18 basis points (bps) during July, firmed up by 5 bps in September on account of higher demand for liquidity around mid-September in response to advance tax outflows. Reflecting improving global demand, merchandise export growth picked up in August 2017 after decelerating in the preceding three months. Engineering goods, petroleum products and chemicals were the major contributors to export growth in August 2017; growth in exports of readymade garments and drugs & pharmaceuticals too returned to positive territory. However. India's export growth continued to be lower than that of other emerging economies such as Brazil. Indonesia. South Korea. Turkey and Vietnam, some of which have benefited from the global commodity price rebound. Import growth remained in double-digits for the eighth successive month in August and was fairly broad-based. While the surge in imports of crude oil and coal largely reflected a rise in international prices, imports of machinery, machine tools, iron and steel also picked up. Gold import volume has declined sequentially since June 2017, though the level in August was more than twice that of a year ago. The sharper increase in imports relative to exports resulted in a widening of the current account deficit in Q1 of 2017-18, even as net services exports and remittances picked up. Net foreign direct investment at US$ 10.6 billion in April-July 2017 was 24 per cent higher than during the same period of last year. While the debt segment of the domestic capital market attracted foreign portfolio investment of US$ 14.4 billion, there were significant outflows in the equity segment in August-September on account of geo-political uncertainties and expected4. In August, headline inflation was projected at 3 per cent in Q2 and 4.0-4.5 per cent in the second half of 2017-18. Actual inflation outcomes so far have been broadly in line with projections, though the extent of the rise in inflation excluding food and fuel has been somewhat higher than expected. The inflation path for the rest of 2017-18 is expected to be shaped by several factors. First, the assessment of food prices going forward is largely favourable, though the first advance estimates of kharif production pose some uncertainty. Early indicators show that prices of pulses which had declined significantly to undershoot trend levels in recent months, have now begun to stabilise. Second, some price revisions pending the goods and services tax (GST) implementation have been taking place. Third, there has been a broad-based increase in CPI inflation excluding food and fuel. Finally, international crude prices, which had started rising from early July, have firmed up further in September. Taking into account these factors, inflation is expected to rise from its current level and range between 4.2-4.6 per cent in the second half of this year, including the house rent allowance by the Centre (Chart 1). As noted in the August policy, there are factors that continue to impart upside risks to this baseline inflation trajectory: (a) implementation of farm loan waivers by States may result in possible fiscal slippages and undermine the quality of public spending, thereby exerting pressure on prices; and (b) States' implementation of the salary and allowances award is not yet considered in the baseline projection; an increase by States similar to that by the Centre could push up headline inflation by about 100 basis points above the baseline over 18-24 months, a statistical effect that could have potential second round effects. However, adequate food stocks and effective supply management by the Government may keep food inflation more benign than assumed in the baseline. Turning to growth projections, the loss of momentum in Q1 of 2017-18 and the first advance estimates of kharif foodgrains production are early setbacks that impart a downside to the outlook. The implementation of the GST so far also appears to have had an adverse impact, rendering prospects for the manufacturing sector uncertain in the short term. This may further delay the revival of investment activity, which is already hampered by stressed balance sheets of banks and corporates. Consumer confidence and overall business assessment of the manufacturing and services sectors surveyed by the Reserve Bank weakened in Q2 of 2017-18; on the positive side, firms expect a significant improvement in business sentiment in Q3. Taking into account the above factors, the projection of real GVA growth for 2017-18 has been revised down to 6.7 per cent from the August 2017 projection of 7.3 per cent, with risks evenly balanced (Chart 2).5 basis points. The minutes of the MPC's meeting will be published by October 18, 2017. The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled on December 5 and 6, 2017. Jose J.

Poland,2017-10-04,"Warsaw, 4 October 2017 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 3-4 October 2017 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: â–ª reference rate at 1.50%, â–ª lombard rate at 2.50%, â–ª deposit rate at 0.50%, â–ª rediscount rate at 1.75%. Global economy continues to recover. Available data indicate that GDP growth in the euro area stabilised in 2017 Q3, after picking up in previous quarters. In the United States, economic conditions are strong, although adverse weather factors could have had a negative impact on economic activity in recent months. In China, monthly indicators suggest that GDP growth may slow down slightly in 2017 Q3. Despite ongoing global recovery, inflation abroad remains moderate, on the back of persistently low domestic inflationary pressure in many countries. Prices of some commodities, including oil, have risen somewhat of late. The European Central Bank keeps interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero, and continues its asset purchase programme. At the same time, the US Federal Reserve gradually tightens its monetary policy, embarking on a reduction of its balance sheet. In Poland, incoming data confirm continued stable growth in economic activity. Growth is still driven primarily by consumer demand, supported by rising employment and wages, disbursement of benefits and very good consumer sentiment. At the same time, a marked rise in construction and assembly output growth points to a probable recovery in investment. The annual growth in prices of consumer goods and services remains at a moderate level. At the same time, while wage growth in the economy has picked up, core inflation is still low. In the Council's opinion, in the following quarters inflation will remain moderate. This will result from moderate price growth in the external environment of the Polish economy, alongside a gradual rise in domestic inflationary pressure stemming from improving domestic economic conditions. In consequence, the risk of inflation running persistently above the target in the medium term is limited. The Council confirms its assessment that, given the present data and forecasts, the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on the sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic balance."
Peru,2017-10-12,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR OCTOBER 2017 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 3.50% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 3.50 percent. This decision takes into account the following factors: Inflation returned to the target range due to the reversal of the supply shocks. Moreover, the measurements of inflation trends are also within the inflation target range and inflation is projected to continue declining in the following months; Expectations of inflation in 12 months continue to be within the inflation target range; The pace of growth of domestic economic activity continues to be below its potential growth level, although it is expected to show greater dynamism due to the increase of government and private expenditure, and The world economy continues to show a gradual recovery, although there is still some uncertainty associated with an eventual reversal of central banks' monetary stimulus in the advanced economies. The Board gives close attention to new data on inflation and inflation determinants and stands ready to make additional adjustments in the Central Bank's monetary policy stance should this be necessary. Inflation in September recorded a rate of -0.02 percent, as a result of which the year-to-year rate of inflation fell from 3.17 percent in August to 2.94 percent in September, within the target range (between 1 and 3 percent). Inflation is expected to remain within this range in during 2017 and 2018. Inflation without food and energy showed a rate of -0.01 percent, as a result of which the year-to-year rate fell from 2.57 percent in August to 2.45 percent in September, also within the target range. The indicators of business expectations have continued to improve in September and remain on the optimistic side. Expectations of GDP growth for 2017 show rates between 2.5 and 2.9 percent. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 2.25 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 4.05 percent for the first 15 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 15 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.05 percent. The Board of BCRP will approve the Monetary Program for November on its meeting of November 9, 2017."
Chile,2017-10-19,"Thursday, 19 October 2017 Monetary Policy Meeting  October 2017 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 2.5%. On the external front, global activity and prospects brought no big news, and the signs of stronger dynamism remain. Global financial conditions remain favorable. The main development of the month was the increase in some commodity prices, especially copper and oil. On the domestic front. September's CPI inflation was surprisingly low, pulling its y-o-y change to 1.5%. While inflation expectations at shorter terms declined significantly, at longer terms they saw limited adjustments. Third-quarter data at hand show activity and demand behaving in line with the latest Monetary Policy Report's baseline scenario, and the better performance of consumer-related sectors relative to investment-related ones continues to stand out. The behavior of private consumption reflects the evolution of the labor market and expectations becoming less pessimistic. Activity figures made available after the September Report are consistent with the baseline scenario and the monetary impulse depicted therein. However, incoming inflation figures point to it falling short of expectations in the short term. This could delay its convergence to the target within the two-year horizon. The Board will pay special attention to this riskâ€”already identified in the Reportâ€”as it could require adjusting the policy rate. At the same time, the Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the two-year horizon. ___ * The Spanish original prevails."
Israel,2017-10-19,"The inflation environment remains very low. The increase in annual inflation resumed, but inflation remains lower than the target range, and there has been no significant change in expectations. Short-term expectations are below the target range, while long-term expectations are anchored within the range. Indicators of realeconomic activity support the assessment that the economy will continue growing at a rate that is in line with potential growth, after some slowdown in the first half of the year. The economy is apparently returning to more balanced growth in terms of the composition ofuses. The picture of global economic activity continues to improve. The International Monetary Fund raised its growth forecast for all major economies and for world trade. Inflation remains lower than the central bank targets. In the US, the federal funds rate is expected to increase one more time this year, and the ECB is expected to announce a gradual reduction of quantitative easing. In recent months, the appreciation of the shekel has resumed. Since the last monetary policy discussion the shekel strengthened by about 3 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. Over the past 12 months, the appreciation in termsof the effective exchange rate was 6.1 percent. The increase in home prices resumed, although at a more moderate rate than in the past. Most indicators point to a slowdown in activity in the housing market. The Monetary Committee intends to maintain the accommodative policy as long as necessaryin order to entrench the inflation environment within the target range. The Bank of Israel continues to monitor developments in inflation, the real economy,the financial markets, and the global economy, and will act to attain the monetary policy targets in accordance with such developments. For the file of data accompanyingthis notice, click here. Graphs anddata (Hebrew). Following a sharp decline in inflation in previous months, the change in the CPI readings for August and September was positive. As a result, inflation over the past 12 months has increased, to 0.1 percent (Figure 1 in the data file). Although the pace of increase in the housing component moderated, that component remains the main contributor to positive inflation. In recent months, energy prices have also made a positive contribution. A variety of other components have made negative contributions to inflation, which supports the assessment that the inflation rate reflects the increasing competition in some industries and changes in consumer behavior, and, to a lesser extent than in the past, the price reductions initiated bythe government (Figure 2). The cumulative appreciation of the shekel in the past year, as well as moderation of inflation abroad, are reflected in the negative level of inflation in the prices of tradable goods (Figure 3). Wage increases in the economy have, in the past year, started to be reflected inan increase in unit labor cost, and are expected to contribute to a return of inflation to within the target range. The low inflation environment is also reflected in the stability of short-term expectations from the various sources below the target range (Figure 4), while long-term expectations are anchored within the target range (Figure 5). The Research Department's assessment is that inflation is expected to be 1 percent in the coming year (ending in the third quarter of 2018). Since the previous interest rate decision, there was no significant change in nominallong-term government bond yields, so that the spread between them and the parallel US government bonds remained at a negative low (Figure 6), although real yields in Israel are similar to US yields and higher than those in Europe. Yield spreads between corporate and government bonds remained very low. Indicators of economic activity remain positive and indicate solid growth in the third quarter, according to initial data from the Companies Survey (Figure 11), and the high levels of the Consumer Confidence Index and the Purchasing Managers Index, despite some moderation in private consumption relative to the rapid increase it showed in 2016. The slowdown in goods exports end data is a result of volatile factors (Figure 12), and a recovery of exports is apparent over time, with an emphasis on services exports. Labor market data continueto support the assessment of full employment, which is what led to moderation in growth relative to 2016. The participation and employment rates are high, and there was a further decline in the unemployment rate (Figure 13) which, itis worth noting, encompasses all levels of education (Figure 14), with stability at a high level in the number of work hours per employee and a record high level in the job vacancy rate. Wage increases moderated slightly in recent months, after accelerating in previous months. According to the Research Department's updated staff forecast. GDP is expected to grow by 3.1 percent in 2017 and by 3.3 percent in 2018. Housing market data continue to indicate moderate demand and a slowing of activity, but home prices continue to increase at a relatively moderate rate (Figure 8). The number of transactions remains moderate. In recent months, the pace of new mortgages taken out stabilized following a prolonged decline, with a moderate decline in the mortgage interest rate (Figure 9). Global economic activity is improving, and world trade is growing at a stronger pace (Figure 17). The IMF raised its growth forecast for all of the major economies and for world trade (Figure 16), but noted that while the short-term risks of a deviation from the forecast are balanced, medium-term risks are towarda worsening of growth, with an emphasis on financial and geopolitical risks. Inflation in most major economies remains below target (Figure 19). In the US, the positive trend in economic activity apparently continued in the third quarter, despite interruptions in activity, which are apparently temporary and limited in scope, as a result of extreme weather. The administration presented a detailed plan for reducing taxes, but there is still uncertainty regarding the format and timing in which it will be realized. The Fed announced that it would begin to reduce its balance sheet this month, and assessmentsare that the federal funds rate will be raised once more in December. In Europe, the entrenchment of growth is continuing, with the improvement encompassing both core and peripheral economies. At this stage, political developments in Spain are not undermining stability. Assessments are that when the ECB extends its bond purchasing program, it will announce a gradual reduction in its volume. In Japan, growth figures for the second quarter were revised downward, but they remain significantly higher than the potential growth rate, and the positive momentum apparently continued into the third quarter. In China there was a slight slowdown in growth in the third quarter. Oil prices increased by about 10 percent since the end of August. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on November 2, 2017. Thenext decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Monday.

South Korea,2017-10-19,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period. (English translation prepared by the Bank of Korea staff) The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 1.25% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Board considers that the global economic recovery has continued to expand. The global financial markets have shown generally stable movements, with the trend of rising stock prices continuing for example, although government bond rates have risen in line mainly with changes in expectations related to the monetary policy normalizations of major countries. Looking ahead the Board sees the global economic recovery as likely to be affected by factors such as the paces of monetary policy normalization in major countries, the directions of the US government's economic policies, and the movements toward spreading trade protectionism. The Board judges that the solid trend of domestic economic growth has continued, as exports and facilities investment have sustained their high rates of increase and private consumption has also picked up moderately. Employment conditions appear to be sustaining their trend of moderate improvement, although the pace of increase in the number of persons employed has slowed somewhat owing to temporary factors. Going forward it is forecast that the domestic economy will maintain its solid trend of growth. The GDP growth rate for this year is expected to be higher than the July projection (2.8%), and that for next year also to show its potential level. Exports seem likely to sustain their buoyancy, thanks largely to the global economic recovery, and domestic demand activities will also recover moderately due to the expansion in fiscal spending for instance. Consumer price inflation has continued at the 2% level, in line mainly with increases in the prices of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products. Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has stayed in the mid-1% range, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public at the mid-2% level. Looking ahead the Board expects that consumer price inflation will be in the upper-1% range for some time, in line chiefly with the disappearance of the base effect from the reduction of electricity fees last year, and then gradually approach the target level. Core inflation will meanwhile remain in the mid-1% range for the time being, before gradually rising from next year. In the domestic financial markets price variable volatility has expanded. Long-term market interest rates have risen and the Korean won-US dollar exchange rate fluctuated, due mainly to changes in expectations concerning monetary policies at home and abroad and to geopolitical risks. Stock prices have risen, on expectations of improvements in corporate performances for example. Household lending has sustained its higher rate of increase than in past years, but the amount of increase has lessened somewhat. Although housing sales prices have shown signs of rebounding slightly in some parts of Seoul and its surrounding areas, their uptrend has in general slowed since the government's announcement of housing market stabilization measures. Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As the inflationary pressures on the demand side are forecast to not be high for the time being, while the domestic economy is expected to continue its solid growth, the Board will maintain its accommodative policy stance while closely checking future economic growth and inflation trends. In this process it will also carefully monitor any changes in the monetary policies of major countries, conditions related to trade with major countries, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks."
Hungary,2017-10-24,"At its meeting on 24 October 2017, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 25 October 2017:. In the Council's assessment. Hungarian economic growth picks up over the forecast horizon. Some degree of unused capacity has remained in the economy, but this is likely to be gradually absorbed as output grows dynamically. The inflation target is expected to be achieved in a sustainable manner by the middle of 2019. In September 2017, inflation stood at 2.5 percent and core inflation at 2.9 percent. Headline inflation fell slightly short of our expectation, with the decline in volatile unprocessed food prices accounting for the difference. Core inflation was in line with the September Inflation Report projection. The Bank's measures of underlying inflation rose slightly compared with the previous month, but continued to be significantly below the level of core inflation. The expansion in domestic employment, the tight labour market as well as increases in the minimum wage and the guaranteed minimum wage have led to a general, dynamic rise in whole-economy wages. The upward effect of this on costs is being offset by the reduction in employers' social contributions and in the corporate income tax rate early this year. In line with the Bank's expectations, there has still not yet been any significant upward pressure on inflation from wages. The rise in global inflation which started at the beginning of the year has stalled, and consumer price indices in some economies have fallen. External inflation, particularly in the euro area, is likely to remain low for a prolonged period. In the coming months, the consumer price index is likely to decline again from its current level to the bottom of the tolerance band by the end of 2017. Core inflation is expected to decrease in the second half of next year as the temporary effects related to changes in tobacco and dairy product prices fade. Looking ahead, the Bank's measures of underlying inflation are expected to be around 2 percent. Moderate imported inflation and historically low inflation expectations as well as the VAT rate cuts, announced for next year, have been slowing the rise in domestic prices. In the September projection, the inflation target can be achieved sustainably by the middle of 2019. According to monthly data. Hungarian economic growth continued in the third quarter of 2017. Industrial production increased in August. Fluctuations in industrial output in the summer months has mainly reflected the different timing of factory shutdowns compared with last year. Robust growth in construction and the expansion in the performance of the service sector are likely to continue in the coming months. Labour demand is still strong: employment was at historically high levels in the summer of 2017. The unemployment rate remained at a low level. The general increase in domestic demand will continue to play a central role in economic growth. Hungary's current account surplus is expected to fall over the forecast horizon in response to rising domestic demand. Economic growth this year will also be supported by the fiscal budget and the stimulating effects on investment of EU funding. The Monetary Council expects annual economic growth of 3.6 percent in 2017 and stable growth of between 3-4 percent over the coming years. The Bank's and the Government's stimulating measures contribute substantially to economic growth. Sentiment in international financial markets has, on the whole, been positive in the period since the Council's previous interest rate decision. Expectations about the monetary policy of the world's leading central banks were the main factor influencing investors' appetite for risk. The Fed's interest rate path expected by the market did not change significantly. The European Central Bank is still likely to maintain loose monetary conditions for an extended period. Market participants expect the first interest rate rise to occur later than previously thought. Investors' perceptions about the Central and Eastern European region continued to be positive. Due to the different inflation paths expected in the countries of the region and the different characteristics of inflation targeting regimes, market pricing suggests that the timing of central bank actions will differ. The amount of liquidity crowded out due to the introduction of an upper limit on the stock of three-month deposits continued to have a marked influence on domestic money market rates. In addition, the stock of central bank swap instruments providing forint liquidity continued to increase and the average maturity of outstanding swap contracts lengthened, in line with the Council's aim. The three-month BUBOR fell to a new historic low. The yield curves for the interbank and government securities markets shifted downwards. Overall, yields on long-term government securities have fallen since the previous interest rate decision. However, the steepness of the yield curve continued to be high in international comparison, which signs there is still room for reducing long-term yields further. In the Council's assessment, the gradual limitation on the stock of three-month deposits has fulfilled its role and the HUF 75 billion year-end upper limit on the stock will not be reduced further. Therefore, the importance of the stock and maturity structure of central bank swap instruments providing forint liquidity will increase, the objective of which is to provide the loosening effect up to the longest possible section of the yield curve. In the future, the Council decides on the amount of liquidity crowded out on a regular frequency and adjusts the stock of central bank swap instruments accordingly. In the Council's assessment, some degree of unused capacity has remained in the economy, but this is likely to be absorbed gradually as output grows dynamically. The inflation target is expected to be achieved in a sustainable manner by the middle of 2019. In the Council's assessment, maintaining the base rate and loose monetary conditions for an extended period are necessary to achieve the inflation target in a sustainable manner. However, the September Inflation Report indicated downside risks to inflation. The Council judges that the likelihood of these materialising has increased recently. It is important for the Council to ensure that the low interest rate environment exerts its favourable effect as long as possible. To achieve this, it is necessary to reduce long-term yields and as a result the steepness of the yield curve, which will also promote the expansion of loans with long interest rate fixation. The Council will stand ready to ease monetary conditions further and is considering unconventional instruments to be used accordingly."
Brazil,2017-10-25,"The Copom unanimously decided to reduce the Selic rate by 0.75 percentage point, to 7.50 percent per year, without bias. The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario:. The set of indicators of economic activity released since the last Copom meeting is consistent with a gradual recovery of the Brazilian economy. The global outlook has been favorable, as global economic activity remains on a gradual recovery path, without exerting excessive pressure on financial conditions in advanced economies. This supports risk appetite towards emerging economies. The Committee judges that its baseline inflation scenario has evolved as expected. Inflation developments remain favorable, with various measures of underlying inflation running at comfortable levels. This includes the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy. Inflation expectations collected by the Focus survey retreated to around 3.1% for 2017 and 4.0% for 2018. Expectations for 2019 and 2020 are around 4.25% and 4.0%, respectively; and. The Copom's inflation projections in the scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the Focus survey stand around 3.3% for 2017, 4.3% for 2018, and 4.2% for 2019. This scenario assumes a path for the policy interest rate that ends 2017 and 2018 at 7.0%, and increases to 8.0% during the course of 2019. The Committee emphasizes that its baseline scenario involves risks in both directions. On the one hand, the combination of possible second-round effects of the favorable food price shock and of low current levels of industrial goods inflation, and the possible propagation through inertial mechanisms of low inflation levels may lead to a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory. On the other hand, frustration of expectations regarding the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy may affect risk premia and increase the path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy. This risk intensifies in the case of a reversal of the current benign global outlook for emerging economies. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the wide array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to reduce the Selic rate by 0.75 percentage point, to 7.50 percent per year, without bias. The Committee judges that convergence of inflation to the target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, which includes 2018 and 2019, is compatible with the monetary easing process. The Committee judges that economic conditions prescribe accommodative monetary policy, i.e., interest rates below the structural level. The Copom emphasizes that the evolution of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy contributes to the reduction of its structural interest rate. The Committee will continue to reassess estimates of this rate over time. The evolution of the baseline scenario, in line with expectations, and the stage of the monetary easing cycle made it appropriate to reduce the Selic rate by 0.75 percentage point at this Copom meeting. Regarding the next meeting, provided the Committee's baseline scenario evolves as expected, and taking into account the stage of the monetary easing cycle, at this time the Copom views a moderate reduction of the pace of easing as appropriate. The Copom emphasizes that the monetary easing process will continue to depend on the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, possible reassessments of the extension of the cycle, and on inflation forecasts and expectations. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Ilan Goldfajn (Governor). Carlos Viana de Carvalho. Isaac Sidney Menezes Ferreira. Mauricio Costa de Moura. Otavio Ribeiro Damaso. Paulo Srgio Neves de Souza. Reinaldo Le Grazie. Sidnei Corr=AAa Marques e Tiago Couto Berriel."
Georgia,2017-10-25,"25.10.2017 NBG Keeps Its Policy Rate Unchanged at 7%. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on October 25 2017 and decided to keep the refinancing rate unchanged at 7 percent. The annual inflation in September was 6.2%, although during the third quarter the inflation rates were slightly lower than forecast. According to the current prognosis the inflation will remain above the target until the end of the year, whereas in the beginning of 2018, once the temporary factors will have petered out, the inflation will get close to the 3% target level. At the same time the inflation expectations have not changed in the recent periods and therefore do not create additional pressure on inflation. Hence, the Monetary Policy Committee has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at the current stage. In case of no additional shocks the policy rate in the medium term will gradually decrease to its neutral level. Since the beginning of 2017 the economic performance has improved, hence the National Bank of Georgia decided to upgrade the growth forecast for the current year to 4.5%. According to preliminary estimates the economy of Georgia has grown by 4.7% in the first eight months of the year. However, both domestic demand and economic activity in general are still below the potential and as such do not create additional pressure on inflation. The improvement in economic activity was largely due to the positive development in the external sector which started in the beginning of the year and the trend has been maintained since then. Both the goods exports and tourism incomes have been growing at a high rate, whereas the volume of remittances has been rising as well, although it's still below its levels preceding the external shock. At the same time the growth in imports has been moderate. The increase in external demand is due both to the improvement in the trading partner economies and the competitive real effective exchange rate. All this is reflected in the reduction of the current account deficit. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all means and instruments at its disposal in order to ensure the price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on December 13, 2017."
Euroarea,2017-10-26,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Vice-President. Mr Dombrovskis. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, today we conducted a thorough assessment of the outlook for inflation, the risks surrounding this outlook and our monetary policy stance. As a result, the Governing Council took the following decisions in pursuit of its price stability objective. First, the key ECB interest rates were kept unchanged and we continue to expect them to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases. Second, as regards non-standard monetary policy measures, we will continue to make purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) at the current monthly pace of â‚¬60 billion until the end of December 2017. From January 2018 our net asset purchases are intended to continue at a monthly pace of â‚¬30 billion until the end of September 2018, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, we stand ready to increase the APP in terms of size and/or duration. Third, the Eurosystem will reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time after the end of its net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary. This will contribute both to favourable liquidity conditions and to an appropriate monetary policy stance. And fourth, we also decided to continue to conduct the main refinancing operations and three-month longer-term refinancing operations as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of the last reserve maintenance period of 2019. Today's monetary policy decisions were taken to preserve the very favourable financing conditions that are still needed for a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2%. The recalibration of our asset purchases reflects growing confidence in the gradual convergence of inflation rates towards our inflation aim, on account of the increasingly robust and broad-based economic expansion, an uptick in measures of underlying inflation and the continued effective pass-through of our policy measures to the financing conditions of the real economy. At the same time, domestic price pressures are still muted overall and the economic outlook and the path of inflation remain conditional on continued support from monetary policy. Therefore, an ample degree of monetary stimulus remains necessary for underlying inflation pressures to continue to build up and support headline inflation developments over the medium term. This continued monetary support is provided by the additional net asset purchases, by the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the forthcoming reinvestments, and by our forward guidance on interest rates. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. The economic expansion in the euro area continues to be solid and broad-based. Real GDP increased by 0.7%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2017, after 0.6% in the first quarter. The latest data and survey results point to unabated growth momentum in the second half of this year. Our monetary policy measures have facilitated the deleveraging process and continue to support domestic demand. Private consumption is underpinned by rising employment, which is also benefiting from past labour market reforms, and by increasing household wealth. The upswing in business investment continues to benefit from very favourable financing conditions and improvements in corporate profitability. In addition, the broad-based global recovery is supporting euro area exports. Risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain broadly balanced. On the one hand, the strong cyclical momentum, as evidenced in recent developments in sentiment indicators, could lead to further positive growth surprises. On the other hand, downside risks continue to relate primarily to global factors and developments in foreign exchange markets. Euro area annual HICP inflation remained unchanged at 1.5% in September. Looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for oil, annual rates of headline inflation are likely to temporarily decline towards the turn of the year, mainly reflecting base effects in energy prices. At the same time, measures of underlying inflation have ticked up moderately since early 2017, but have yet to show more convincing signs of a sustained upward trend. Wage growth has increased somewhat, but domestic cost pressures still remain subdued overall. Underlying inflation in the euro area is expected to continue to rise gradually over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the continuing economic expansion, the corresponding gradual absorption of economic slack and rising wage growth. Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) continues to expand at a robust pace, with an annual rate of growth of 5.1% in September 2017, after 5.0% in August. As in previous months, annual growth in M3 was mainly supported by its most liquid components, with the narrow monetary aggregate M1 expanding at an annual rate of 9.7% in September 2017, up from 9.5% in August. The recovery in the growth of loans to the private sector observed since the beginning of 2014 is proceeding. The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations increased to 2.5% in September 2017, after 2.4% in August, while the annual growth rate of loans to households remained stable at 2.7%. The euro area bank lending survey for the third quarter of 2017 indicates that net loan demand has continued to increase for all loan categories. Credit standards have further eased for loans to households, while they remained broadly unchanged for loans to enterprises. Banks' overall terms and conditions on new loans have continued to ease for all categories of loans. The pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014 continues to significantly support borrowing conditions for firms and households, access to financing â€’ notably for small and medium-sized enterprises â€’ and credit flows across the euro area. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed the need to recalibrate the policy instruments to ensure the degree of monetary accommodation necessary to secure a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2%. In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute decisively to strengthening the longer-term growth potential and reducing vulnerabilities. The implementation of structural reforms in all euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up to increase resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost euro area productivity and growth potential. Regarding fiscal policies, all countries would benefit from intensifying efforts towards achieving a more growth-friendly composition of public finances. A full, transparent and consistent implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact and of the macroeconomic imbalance procedure over time and across countries remains essential to increase the resilience of the euro area economy. The Governing Council welcomes the ongoing discussions on further enhancing the institutional architecture of our Economic and Monetary Union."
Turkiye,2017-10-26,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels:. a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate at 9.25 percent and borrowing rate at 7.25 percent,. b) One-week repo rate at 8 percent,. c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, and lending rate at 12.25 percent. Recently released data indicate a strong economic activity. Domestic demand conditions keep improving and demand from the European Union economies continues to contribute positively to exports. The Committee assesses that the implementation of the structural reforms would contribute to the potential growth significantly. Current elevated levels of inflation and the developments on core inflation outlook continue to pose risks on the pricing behavior. Accordingly, the Committee decided to maintain the tight stance of monetary policy. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. Tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained decisively until inflation outlook displays a significant improvement and becomes consistent with the targets. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Ukraine,2017-10-26,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine decided to hike its key policy rate to 13.5% per annum, effective from 27 October 2017. A tighter monetary policy will contribute to lowering headline inflation and bringing it closer to the target in 2018. In September 2017, headline inflation accelerated to 16.4% yoy, which exceeded the NBU forecast published in the July Inflation Report. This was primarily driven by a quicker growth in raw food prices, higher production costs, and a revival of consumer demand. Same as previous months, supply factors contributed to rising domestic prices for fruit and vegetables, meat and dairy products at fast paces. By influencing the cost of highly processed foods, the growth in raw food prices had an indirect impact on core inflation (7.7% yoy), which also exceeded expectations. In addition, higher service prices also contributed to a rise in core inflation as a result of cost increases, including due to bringing wages out of the shadow as the minimum wage was doubled early this year. An anticipated pickup in consumer demand also contributed to the core inflation acceleration. This was primarily driven by increased household incomes as wages in the private sector were raised on the back of high demand for labor. Another reason was the consumer confidence gradually improving thanks to the social initiatives announced by the government. Rather prudent fiscal and monetary policies curbed core inflation. The FX market also put no pressure on the inflation levels. In general, the fundamental factors (namely, the external conditions favorable for Ukrainian exports) remained in force, having contributed to the hryvnia strengthening against the US dollar during most of the year. The SeptemberOctober weakening of the exchange rate was mostly driven by situational factors and the impact that previous years' seasonality had on economic agents. Apart from that, the NBU smoothed out sharp fluctuations. After a lasting trend for improvement, inflation expectations deteriorated over the recent months. Based on surveys conducted among households, banks, and financial analysts in September-October, the NBU observes an increase in the expected price growth rates for the following 12 months. The deterioration of expectations is driven by the current high growth rates of prices and the announced substantial increase in social standards. Inflation will decelerate and approach its target levels. However, this process will be slower than forecasted earlier. The NBU has revised the inflation forecast for 2017 and 2018 as inflation accelerated over the recent months and new inflation factors appeared (in particular, a stronger pickup in consumer demand, a rapid growth in pension payments, the minimum wage, excise taxes on tobacco products, etc.). Inflation is projected to decelerate to 12.2% by the end of 2017 (9.1% according to the previous forecast). It will continue to slow down and will be close to the central point of the target range in Q3 2018. Inflation is projected to reach 7.3% at the end of 2018 (6.0% according to the previous forecast). Inflation projections for 2019, at 5.0%, have remained unchanged. Inflation is expected to decelerate in 2018 - 2019, due to the NBU conducting a relatively tight monetary policy, the effect of a sharp consumer price rise fading away, and the exchange rate being only moderately volatile. Both raw food price growth and core inflation, which significantly depends on the former, will slow down. Overall, fundamental inflation pressure will be modest on the forecast horizon. The largest increase in inflation components in 2018 - 2019 will be in administrated prices, which are expected to rise by over 10% a year. This will be mainly due to the expected gradual growth in global energy prices, which will pass through to domestic prices, and harmonization of the Ukrainian tobacco excise taxes with the EU rate. Ukrainian economic growth in 2017 will be stronger than expected. The NBU has revised its 2017 economic forecast upward (from 1.6% to 2.2%). This was the result of a more favorable than expected effect from both internal and external factors on the economic performance of most sectors in Q2 and Q3 of the current year. GDP growth is expected to speed up to 3.2% and 3.5% in 2018 and 2019 respectively. Private consumption will continue to be the main driver of economic growth in these years, thanks to higher wages and pensions, better consumer sentiment, and a pick-up in consumer lending. Imports will rise further, driven by a pick-up in consumer demand, higher investment and an increased need for imported energy carriers. Exports will also grow, due to, among other things, the expected return of metallurgical companies to their previous production levels, favorable external conditions, and the large output of the food industry. In this light, the current account deficit will continue to hover around USD 4 billion in 2017 - 2019. It will be fully offset by financial account inflows. A key assumption of this forecast is that Ukraine will continue to cooperate with the IMF. An overall balance of payments surplus, together with other tranches received under the EFF, will push up international reserves further. The NBU expects that next EFF tranche will be received in Q1 2018. Along with a surplus of the overall balance of payments, this is expected to drive international reserves up to USD 22.2 billion or 4.2 months of future imports by the end of 2018. The NBU, however, sees a number of risks to this forecast. The temporary supply factors that drove up raw food prices this year and caused consumption to pick up further amid higher social standards could increase fundamental pressure on inflation. In addition, the Ukrainian economy could become more vulnerable if external official financing under the EFF is delayed. With the aim of bringing inflation to the inflation targets and taking into account the above risks the NBU deems it necessary to hike the key policy rate, up to 13.5% per annum. Tighter monetary policy is primarily aimed at preventing inflation expectations from further deterioration. Moreover, tighter monetary stance is a response to higher risks of delays in resumption of cooperation with the IMF and faster expansion of consumer demand owing to rising social standards. Tighter monetary policy will help curb inflation through several channels. A rise in key police rate will facilitate an inflow of savings into the banking sector and, therefore, restrain consumer demand. Also, higher interest rates make financial instruments in domestic currency more attractive than those in foreign currency, which will have a positive effect on inflation via the exchange rate channel. The tight monetary policy will bring inflation close to the central point of the target range in Q3 2018. The NBU Board is confident that the achievement of price stability is key to sustainable economic growth. Steady improvement of inflation expectations is a major factor in reducing banks' interest rates in the medium term. In the event of realization of the above inflation risks, the NBU may further raise the key policy rate to offset their effects and return inflation to its target path. However, in case of deceleration of inflation according to the forecast, further cooperation with the IMF, and pursuing prudent fiscal policy, the NBU may return to the easing cycle of monetary policy at the end of 2018. The decision to raise the key policy rate to 13.5% is approved by NBU Board Decision On the Key Policy Rate No. 688-D, dated 26 October 2017. The next meeting of the NBU Board on monetary policy issues will be held on 14 December 2017."
Colombia,2017-10-27,"The Board of Directors of the Central Bank of Colombia, at today's meeting, decided to reduce the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp to 5.0%. For this decision, the Board mainly took into account the following aspects. In September, inflation increased, reaching 3.97%. The acceleration of inflation was mainly explained by the higher rate of the yearly increase of the food CPI due to a low basis for comparison. The average of core inflation indicators continued descending, standing at 4.58%. In the past three months, inflation was lower than expected by the market and by the Central Bank's technical staff. In this sense, the technical staff reduced the inflation forecasts for this year and the next. Inflation expectations recorded slight changes. Those by analysts to December 2017 and 2018 stand, on average, at 4.07% and 3.58%, respectively. Those embedded in public debt bonds remain above 3.0%. The direct effects of the strong transitory supply shocks that deviated yearly inflation from its target have faded, and core inflation indicators continue reducing. The effects of the indexation of prices and of the increases in indirect taxes at the beginning of the year are expected to reduce, and with this, that inflation and core inflation measures converge to the target. External demand continues recovering, driven mainly by developed economies. Oil prices increased, and the terms of trade are expected to end the year above the average level recorded in 2016. In the United States, the Federal Reserve is likely to increase its policy rate during the rest of the year. In this environment, the peso has depreciated vis--visem> the US dollar. In Colombia, the technical staff maintained growth estimations for 2017 at 1.6%, and increased its growth projection for 2018 from 2.4% to 2.7%. However, this growth is below its potential; for this reason, the underuse of the installed capacity of the economy is expected to continue expanding. New data suggests that the current account deficit in 2017 would be 3.7% as a percentage of GDP, decreasing vis--vis 2016 (4.4 %). For 2018, this adjustment in the current account is expected to continue. Based on this information, the Board considered the following factors for its decision. Weakness in economic activity and the risk of a slowdown beyond what is compatible with the deterioration in the income dynamics due to the fall in oil prices. Despite the fact that the forecast of the technical staff for GDP growth increased for the coming year, the output gap would continue to expand. The lower results of inflation versus the forecast from the last quarter and the lower projections of the technical staff in the policy horizon. This behavior has been registered in several of the sub-groups of the CPI, especially food, and tradable goods excluding food and regulated items. These results suggest that convergence of inflation to its 3.0% target could be faster, although uncertainty in this regard remains high. Although the orderly adjustment of the current account deficit is expected to continue, there are risks in the international environment that may affect such adjustment. In this context, when evaluating the risk balance, the Board of Directors deemed appropriate to reduce the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp, using the space associated with the lower inflation projections for 2018. However, the international environment poses risks that limit the countercyclical capacity of monetary policy in the future. Accordingly, this reduction should not be understood as part of a continuous path of cuts.The decision to reduce the benchmark interest rate was approved by five members of the Board. The two remaining Board Members voted to maintain the policy rate unaltered.Bogot. The decision to reduce the benchmark interest rate was approved by five members of the Board.

Russia,2017-10-27,"On 27 October 2017, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to reduce the key rate by 25 bp to 8.25% per annum. The Board notes that inflation holds close to 4%. Its downward deviation against the forecast is driven mainly by temporary factors. The economy continues to grow. Inflation expectations remain elevated. Their decline has yet to become sustainable and consistent. Medium-term risks of inflation overshooting the target dominate over the risks of its persistent downward deviation. In recognition of this, the Bank of Russia's ongoing transition from moderately tight to neutral monetary policy is gradual. Moving forward, the Bank of Russia's key rate decisions will be based on its assessment on the balance of risks for inflation significantly and persistently deviating in either direction from the target, as well as consumer price movements and economic activity against the forecast. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors leaves open the option of further rate reduction at its upcoming meetings. In making its key rate decision, the Bank of Russia recognised the following factors. Inflation dynamics. Annual inflation holds close to 4%. Estimates as of 23 October 2017 indicate that annual inflation is 2.7%. Its downward deviation against the forecast is driven mainly by temporary factors. In September, food prices showed stronger-than-expected annual price decline, on the back of larger supply of farm produce. This extra supply owes its origin to growing crop productivity and the shortage of warehouse facilities for long-term storage. The slowdown of inflation was also triggered by exchange rate movements. Inflation is projected to be close to 3% by late 2017; going forward, as the temporary factors run their course, it will approach 4%. Inflation expectations remain elevated. Their decline has yet to become sustainable and consistent. Monetary conditions lay the groundwork for inflation holding close to 4% and not constraining economic growth. Nominal rates on banking transactions continue to trend downwards, tracking the key rate path in the expectation of its reduction. Rates in real terms remain in positive territory. Non-price lending conditions are gradually becoming looser for reliable borrowers but are tight nonetheless. The current conditions encourage incentives to save and ensure that consumption growth is balanced. Gradual loosening in monetary policy alongside low risk appetite of both banks and borrowers is bringing about conditions for a gradual transition from a savings behaviour model to consumption growth. Economic activity. According to Bank of Russia estimates. Q3 GDP growth continued in line with the forecast. Farm output increased while mechanical engineering output, freight turnover and the production of durable consumer goods all showed a positive trend. The recovery in consumption is becoming steadier. Consumer demand is shored up by real wage growth driven by inflation slowdown. Unemployment is at a level at which it does not affect inflation. The Bank of Russia's estimate of the economic development path throughout 2017 and in the medium term has remained unchanged. Inflation risks. A number of factors bear the risk of inflation deviating from the target both upwards and downwards. On the short-term horizon, among these factors are food price movements triggered by the supply of farm produce. In the forthcoming months, food price growth will largely depend on crop quality and preservation. Price movements on global commodity markets pose a risk in the medium term if they deviate considerably upwards and downwards from the forecast. The fiscal rule will set off the impact of external economic conditions on inflation and the domestic economic environment as a whole. Medium-term risks of inflation overshooting the target dominate over the risks of its persistent downward deviation. The main risk sources of inflation overshooting the target in the medium term remain unchanged. First, increasing structural labour shortage may cause labour productivity growth to considerably lag behind wage growth. Second, inflationary pressure may stem from households' shrinking propensity to save. Third, inflation expectations remain elevated and subject to fluctuations caused by movements in prices of certain goods and services and the exchange rate. Given the balance of risks for inflation the Bank of Russia's ongoing transition from moderately tight to neutral monetary policy will be gradual. Moving forward, the Bank of Russia's key rate decisions will be based on its assessment on the balance of risks for inflation significantly and persistently deviating in either direction from the target, as well as the dynamics of economic activity against the forecast. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors leaves open the option of further rate reduction at its upcoming meetings. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next rate review meeting on 15 December 2017. The Board decision press release is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time. (% p.a.).

United States,2017-11-01,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a solid rate despite hurricane-related disruptions. Although the hurricanes caused a drop in payroll employment in September, the unemployment rate declined further. Household spending has been expanding at a moderate rate, and growth in business fixed investment has picked up in recent quarters. Gasoline prices rose in the aftermath of the hurricanes, boosting overall inflation in September; however, inflation for items other than food and energy remained soft. On a 12-month basis, both inflation measures have declined this year and are running below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. Hurricane-related disruptions and rebuilding will continue to affect economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, but past experience suggests that the storms are unlikely to materially alter the course of the national economy over the medium term. Consequently, the Committee continues to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further. Inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to remain somewhat below 2 percent in the near term but to stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1 to 1-1/4 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. The balance sheet normalization program initiated in October 2017 is proceeding. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Janet L Yellen. Chair; William C Dudley.

Czech Republic,2017-11-02,"<At its meeting today, the CNB Bank Board decided unanimously to increase the two-week repo rate by 25 basis points to 0.50%. At the same time, it increased the Lombard rate by 50 basis points to 1.00% and kept the discount rate unchanged at 0.05%.. The decision adopted by the Bank Board is underpinned by a new macroeconomic forecast of the Czech National Bank. Consistent with the forecast is a continuing rise in domestic market interest rates. According to the forecast, inflation will stay above the 2% target for most of 2018. It will then return to the target at the monetary policy horizon, i.e. in late 2018 and early 2019. According to the assumptions of the new forecast, economic growth in the effective euro area will accelerate further over the rest of this year. It will maintain a faster pace in the next two years. Growth in industrial producer prices will weaken in the months ahead, due mainly to a stronger euro-dollar exchange rate and an unwinding of the previous increase in commodity prices. However, it will then accelerate again. Consumer price inflation will follow a similar pattern, falling initially and then approaching 2% only gradually from below. 3M EURIBOR market rates are negative over almost the entire outlook on account of the European Central Bank's still easy monetary policy. The outlook for the euro-dollar exchange rate lies close to the current levels, i.e. just below USD 1.2 to the euro, until the end of 2019. The price of Brent crude oil should be close to USD 55 a barrel. Domestic inflation will stay above the 2% target, but within its tolerance band, for most of 2018. The overall inflation pressures reflect accelerating wage growth amid robust growth of the domestic economy. Growth in domestic costs will record a further short-term increase owing to labour market tightness. Domestic inflation pressures will then moderate, aided by a stabilising effect of monetary policy. However, they will continue to outweigh the anti-inflationary effect of import prices, whose decrease will reflect a strengthening koruna and a temporary weakening of foreign producer price inflation. At the same time, the one-off factors that increased inflation at the start of this year will subside. Inflation will thus return to the 2% target from above over the monetary policy horizon. The growth of the Czech economy will reach 4.5% this year. It will slow in the following two years. The increase in domestic economic activity will be driven mainly by robust growth in household consumption in an environment of high growth in household income. Investment will recover further, especially in the government sector as a result of higher drawdown of EU funds. To a lesser extent, fiscal policy will contribute to domestic demand growth in 2018 via a significant rise in public sector pay and increasing pensions and social benefits. The economy will continue to benefit from stable demand growth in the Czech Republic's main trading partner countries. An increasing shortage of available labour force will cause employment growth to slow and wage growth to accelerate further. There is little room for unemployment to decrease further. According to the forecast, the return of inflation to the target will be fostered by further growth in domestic market interest rates in addition to appreciation of the koruna. Roughly until mid-2018, growth in interest rates will be slowed by continuing quantitative easing by the European Central Bank. According to the forecast, the koruna will appreciate further against the euro, owing mainly to monetary policy being tightened sooner in the Czech Republic than in the euro area. The appreciation will also be fostered by continued real convergence. Starting with Inflation Report I/2018, the Czech National Bank will renew publication of the forecast-consistent path of the koruna-euro exchange rate, which was suspended temporarily in November 2013. Compared to the previous forecast, the inflation outlook is slightly higher over the monetary policy horizon. The forecast for economic growth has also shifted higher for this year and to a lesser extent also for next year. The interest rate outlook for next year has been revised slightly upwards."
Romania,2017-11-07,"In its meeting of 7 November 2017, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided the following:. The annual inflation rate rose to 1.77 percent in September, from 1.15 percent in August, slightly above the forecasted level, and re-entered the variation band of the flat target, in line with expectations. The increase owed primarily to the advance in volatile food prices and to higher fuel prices driven by the rise in international oil prices and in the excise duty on motor fuels, as well as to the faster core inflation. The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate went up to 1.8 percent in September, from 1.6 percent in August, also higher than the forecast. The pick-up was due to both processed food prices and services prices, while non-food items had a marginal influence. In September 2017, the average annual CPI inflation rate consolidated in positive territory at 0.4 percent, against 0.2 percent in August; calculated based on the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, the annual average increased to 0.5 percent versus 0.3 percent a month earlier. Revised economic growth data for 2017 Q2 reconfirm the step-up in the annual dynamics of real GDP to 6.1 percent (compared with the previously-estimated 5.9 percent and with 5.7 percent in Q1). The pick-up in growth was almost entirely attributable to the change in inventories and to private consumption. The latter saw its prevailing contribution to GDP growth consolidate at 5.4 percentage points, as its annual dynamics increased to 7.5 percent under the impact of fiscal and wage measures. The contribution of net exports to the advance in GDP turned negative again, amid a deceleration in the annual growth rate of exports of goods and services and a slight acceleration in that of imports. The trade balance worsening led to a protracted widening trend of the current account deficit, whose cumulated eight-month level stood above EUR 4 billion, exceeding as early as July the full-year figure for 2016. Statistical data for August indicate the consolidation of the uptrend in industrial output, a stepped-up activity in trade and services, as well as the return to positive territory of the annual dynamics of construction works. In October, monetary conditions were less accommodative, given the significant upward adjustment in the relevant interbank money market rates, as well as the slight appreciation of the domestic currency versus the euro. The annual dynamics of credit to the private sector continued to gain momentum in September, reaching 7.3 percent, mainly on the back of the leu-denominated component (17.1 percent) and of developments in loans to non-financial corporations. The share of leu-denominated credit in total private sector loans widened to 61.4 percent, certifying and ensuring an improvement in monetary policy transmission. In today's meeting, the NBR Board examined and approved the November 2017 Inflation Report, which incorporates the most recent data and information available. The new scenario of the projection points to prospects for a significant pick-up in inflation over the short time horizon, followed by its slowdown starting with the final quarter of 2018. Thus, compared to the previous Inflation Report, the path of the forecasted annual inflation rate has been revised markedly upwards in the short run, almost exclusively due to the recent and anticipated action of some supply-side factors, and slightly downwards over the second segment of the projection horizon. The uncertainties and risks associated with this outlook stem from the domestic and external environment. Domestically, they are compounded by the fiscal and income policy stance, also in the context of the uncertainties surrounding the construction of the 2018 budget, as well as by the prospects for administered prices (of natural gas, electricity) and volatile food prices. Looking at the external environment, further relevant are the uncertainties and risks regarding economic growth in the euro area and worldwide, the escalation of some geopolitical tensions, but also the decisions of the major central banks (ECB. Fed). Given the current assessments, the information available at present, as well as the new sources of uncertainty, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided to continue the adjustment of the monetary policy stance by narrowing the symmetrical corridor of interest rates on the NBR's standing facilities around the policy rate to Â±1.00 percentage points from Â±1.25 percentage points and by ensuring firm liquidity management in the banking system. Starting 8 November 2017, the deposit facility rate rises to 0.75 percent per annum, while the interest rate on the NBR's lending facility (Lombard rate) is lowered to an annual 2.75 percent. The NBR Board also decided to keep unchanged the monetary policy rate at 1.75 percent per annum and to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The decisions of the NBR Board aim to ensure and preserve price stability over the medium term in a manner conducive to achieving sustainable economic growth. The NBR Board underlines that the balanced macroeconomic policy mix and progress in structural reforms are of the essence in preserving a stable macroeconomic framework and strengthening the capacity of the Romanian economy to withstand potential adverse developments. The NBR is closely monitoring domestic and external developments and stands ready to use all its available tools. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be presented to the public in a press conference on 9 November 2017. The account (minutes) of discussions underlying the adoption of the monetary policy decision during today's meeting will be posted on the NBR website on 14 November 2017, at 3:00 p.m. In line with the announced calendar, the next monetary policy meeting of the NBR Board is scheduled for 8 January 2018."
Poland,2017-11-08,"Warsaw, 8 November 2017 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 7-8 November 2017 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: â–ª reference rate at 1.50%; â–ª lombard rate at 2.50%; â–ª deposit rate at 0.50%; â–ª rediscount rate at 1.75%. Global economy continues to recover. Economic growth in the euro area remains higher than in the previous year, driven by an improvement in the labour market conditions, favourable sentiment of economic agents, and a recovery in international trade. In the United States GDP growth in 2017 Q3 was close to that observed in the previous quarter, despite the negative impact of adverse weather factors on economic activity. In China economic growth in 2017 Q3 slowed down slightly. Despite ongoing global recovery, inflation abroad remains moderate, on the back of persistently low domestic inflationary pressure in many countries. At the same time, prices of certain commodities, including oil, have risen somewhat of late. The European Central Bank keeps interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero. At the same time, the ECB has extended the duration of the asset purchase programme at least until September 2018, cutting the amount of monthly purchases as of next year by half. The US Federal Reserve, in turn, has started reducing its balance sheet. In Poland, monthly data indicate that GDP growth in 2017 Q3 was probably higher than in the previous quarter. Growth was still driven primarily by consumer demand, supported by rising employment and wages, disbursement of benefits and very good consumer sentiment. At the same time, faster construction and assembly output growth than in the first half of the year points to a probable recovery in investment. The annual growth in prices of consumer goods and services remains at a moderate level. All core inflation measures have risen, though still remain moderate. The Council became acquainted with the results of the November projection of inflation and GDP, prepared under the assumption of unchanged NBP interest rates. In line with the November projection based on the NECMOD model, there is a 50-percent probability that the annual price growth will be in the range of 1.9-2.0% in 2017 (against 1.6-2.3% in the July 2017 projection), 1.6-2.9% in 2018 (compared to 1.1-2.9%) and 1.7-3.7% in 2019 (compared to 1.3-3.6%). At the same time, the annual GDP growth  in line with this projection  will be with a 50-percent probability in the range of 3.8-4.6% in 2017 (against 3.4-4.7% in the July 2017 projection), 2.8-4.5% in 2018 (compared to 2.5-4.5%) and 2.3-4.3% in 2019 (compared to 2.3-4.3%). 1/2 Taking into account the present information, including the results of the November projection, the Council judges that in the coming years inflation will run close to the inflation target. As a result, the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on the sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability. The Council adopted a resolution on the required reserve ratios. In line with this resolution the required reserve ratio on funds received for at least a two-year period will stand at 0%. The resolution comes into force on 1 March 2018 and applies since the required reserve maintenance period starting on 30 April 2018. The Council adopted the Opinion on the 2018 Draft Budget Act. The Council adopted Inflation Report  November 2017."
Thailand,2017-11-08,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 7/2017 Mr. Jaturong Jantarangs. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 8 November 2017 as follows. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 150 percent. In deliberating their policy decision, the Committee assessed that the Thai economy would grow at a faster pace than the previous assessment driven by growth in merchandise exports as well as continued improvement in domestic demand. Headline inflation was projected to edge up in line with the previous assessment. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative and conducive to economic growth. Financial stability remained sound overall, but there remained pockets of risks that might lead to the build-up of vulnerabilities in the period ahead. The Committee viewed that the current accommodative monetary policy stance remained conducive to the continuation of economic growth and should foster the return of headline inflation to target although this could take some time. Thus the Committee decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at this meeting. The Thai economy gained further traction from the previous assessment on account of stronger growth in merchandise exports and tourism driven by a stronger global economic recovery. Private consumption continued to expand, but earnings of low-income households had yet to sufficiently recover. In addition, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) might not fully benefit from the economic recovery. Private investment in machinery and equipment continued to pick up. Meanwhile public investment remained an important growth driver despite some slowdown following decelerated disbursement. Nevertheless the improved growth outlook was still subject to both domestic and external risks that warranted close monitoring such as impacts from regulations on immigrant workers, uncertainties pertaining to US economic and foreign trade policies, and geopolitical risks. Headline inflation slightly increased following a gradual rise in fresh food as well as energy prices. Meanwhile demand-pull inflationary pressures remained low and would be subject to structural changes that might lead to a slower pace of inflation than in the past. Headline inflation was projected to slowly rise from the recovery in domestic demand, an increase in excise tax, and regulations on immigrant workers that might affect wages going forward. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative and conductive to economic growth with ample liquidity in the financial system. Government bond yields and real interest rates remained low. Business financing through both credit and capital markets continued to expand. With regard to exchange rate developments since the previous meeting, the baht remained stable against the US dollar, and was largely unchanged relative to those of trading partners. In the period ahead, exchange rates might experience high volatilities due to uncertainties pertaining to US economic policies, and monetary policy conducts of major advanced economies. Thus the Committee would continue to closely monitor developments in the foreign exchange market. 2 The Committee viewed that financial stability remained sound but would continue to monitor pockets of risks that might pose vulnerabilities to financial stability in the future. These included, in particular, the search-for-yield behavior in the prolonged low interest rate environment that might lead to underpricing of risks, and the deterioration in debt serviceability of households and SMEs especially those affected by changes in structural factors and business models. Looking ahead. Thailand's growth outlook improved further particularly on the back of external demand while strength in the recovery of domestic demand and inflation developments must be monitored. Hence the Committee viewed that monetary policy should remain accommodative and would stand ready to utilize available policy tools to sustain economic growth while also ensuring financial stability."
Malaysia,2017-11-09,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.00 percent. The global economy continues to strengthen. Growth has become more entrenched and synchronised across regions. Global trade has picked up significantly. Amid the sustained growth performance, economic slack is diminishing in the advanced economies. In Asia, growth is driven by sustained domestic activity and strong external demand. Financial markets have also been relatively calm in the recent period. For 2018, the global economy is projected to experience sustained growth. While there are risks arising from geopolitical and policy developments in major economies, economic prospects are expected to remain favourable. For Malaysia, economic growth has become more entrenched. Both the domestic and external sectors continue to register strong performance. Growth momentum has been lifted by stronger spillovers from the external sector to the domestic economy as firms invest in productive capacity, raise wages and hire more workers. For 2018, domestic demand is expected to remain the key source of growth. Private consumption will remain the largest driver of growth, supported by continued improvements in income and overall labour market conditions. Investment will be sustained by infrastructure projects and higher capital investment in the manufacturing and services sectors. The external sector will provide additional impetus to the economy. Overall, the assessment is for growth to remain strong in 2018. Domestic inflation has been driven mostly by movements in global oil prices. Consequently, headline inflation increased to 4.3% in September, arising from higher global prices of refined oil caused by disruptions in the global supply. For 2017 as a whole, headline inflation is expected to be at the upper end of the forecast range. Moving into 2018, headline inflation is projected to moderate on expectations of a smaller effect from global cost factors. Nevertheless, the trend of headline inflation will be dependent on future global oil prices which remain highly uncertain. Underlying inflation, as measured by core inflation, will be sustained by robust domestic demand. The domestic financial markets have been resilient. The ringgit has strengthened to better reflect the economic fundamentals. Banking system liquidity remains sufficient with financial institutions continuing to operate with strong capital and liquidity buffers. The growth of financing to the private sector has been sustained and is supportive of economic activity. At the current level of the OPR, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative. Given the strength of the global and domestic macroeconomic conditions, the Monetary Policy Committee may consider reviewing the current degree of monetary accommodation. This is to ensure the sustainability of the growth prospects of the Malaysian economy. The meeting also approved the schedule of MPC meetings for 2018. In accordance with the Central Bank of Malaysia Act 2009, the MPC will convene six times during the year. The meetings will be held over two days, with the Monetary Policy Statement released at 3 p.m. on the second day of the MPC meeting. Schedule of Monetary Policy Committee Meetings for 2018. 24 and 25 January 2018 (Wednesday and Thursday). 6 and 7 March 2018 (Tuesday and Wednesday). 9 and 10 May 2018 (Wednesday and Thursday). 10 and 11 July 2018 (Tuesday and Wednesday). 4 and 5 September 2018 (Tuesday and Wednesday). 7 and 8 November 2018 (Wednesday and Thursday).

Peru,2017-11-09,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR NOVEMBER 2017 BCRP LOWERED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE TO 3.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to lower the monetary policy interest rate from 3.50 to 3.25 percent. This decision takes into account the following factors: Inflation in October continued decreasing and reached the middle of the inflation target range. The measurements of inflation trends continue declining and are within the target range as well. Moreover, both measurements of inflation are forecast to remain within the target range in 2017 and 2018; Expectations of inflation in 12 months continued to be within the target range and are expected to continue declining in the following months; The pace of growth of economic activity is recovering rapidly although it continues to be below its potential growth level in a context of low inflation, and The world economy continues recovering gradually, although there is some uncertainty associated with an eventual reversal of monetary stimulus in the advanced economies. The Board gives close attention to new data on inflation and inflation determinants to consider the convenience of making additional adjustments in the Central Bank's monetary policy stance should it be necessary. Recent indicators of inflation and activity reflect the following: Inflation in October recorded a rate of -0.47 percent, as a result of which the year-to-year rate of inflation fell from 2.94 percent in September to 2.04 percent in October. Inflation is expected to remain within this range during 2017 and 2018. Inflation without food and energy showed a rate of 0.02 percent, as a result of which the year-to-year rate fell from 2.45 percent in September to 2.35 percent in October, also within the target range. The indicators of business expectations have continued to improve in October and remain on the optimistic side, although economic growth remains below its potential level. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to lower the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 2.00 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 3.80 percent for the first 15 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 15 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 3.80 percent. The Board of BCRP will approve the Monetary Program for December on its meeting of December 14, 2017."
Armenia,2017-11-14,"PRESS RELEASE 14.11.2017 At the November 14th of 2017 meeting the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia decided to leave the refinancing rate unchanged, at the 6.0% level. There was 0.8% inflation in October of 2017 against that of 0.5% registered in the same month of the previous year, and the 12â€month inflation rate amounted to 1.2% in the end of the month. Meanwhile, acceleration of the 12â€month core inflation, observable in the last months, continues, from 0.7% in July to 2.4% in October. Headline inflation, the CBA Board estimates, remains low owing to slowerâ€thanâ€ expected pace in price inflation on fruits and vegetables, the impact of which will, however, phase out in the upcoming months, and the inflation will be within the confidence band. In the external environment, the global economic growth outlook further followed a positive track while inflationary patterns persisted in world commodity markets. In view of such developments, the CBA Board expects certain inflationary effects from the external sector, as external demand recovers. The CBA Board notes that based on the results of the first nine months of 2017, compared to the same reference period last year, economic activity remained strong mainly due to high growth in services sector. Domestic demand continues recovering faster than expected, which is attributable to an implemented expansionary monetary policy and somewhat recovered growth in remittances from abroad. Strong growth in imports as well as the way core inflation behaves also points to the recovering domestic demand. In the meantime, inflation expectations of households are growing slightly faster, deriving from the rise in international prices in individual food product markets and supplyâ€driven price increases. Although certain expanding of the inflation environment and higher inflation expectations are possible, the CBA Board still finds it reasonable to keep monetary conditions expansionary. At the same time, the Board believes that in light of predicted developments a gradual offsetting of expansionary monetary conditions would be needed in the near future to fulfil the inflation target in the medium run. Should there emerge risks to the economic growth outlook and inflation deviating from its recovery path, the Central Bank would react by adjusting its monetary policy directions accordingly, while fulfilling the inflation target in the medium run. Detailed information on setting of the interest rate will be available in Inflation Report (Monetary Policy Program, 4th quarter 2017), to be published by November 24, 2017.

Chile,2017-11-14,"Tuesday, 14 November 2017 Monetary Policy Meeting  November 2017 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 2.5%. On the external front, third-quarter activity figures are consistent with a more dynamic scenario. Global financial conditions show no major changes. The oil price increased in recent weeks, while the copper price declined slightly, but it is still above expectations. At home. October's CPI inflation of 0.6% exceeded the forecast, partly undoing the negative surprise of September, and placing annual inflation at 1.9%. Inflation expectations at short terms remain low, and medium-term expectations have remained constant. Third-quarter data at hand show the evolution of activity and demand in line with the latest Monetary Policy Report's baseline scenario. Private consumption has performed in line with the labor market's evolution and with not-so-pessimistic expectations. Investment is still weak, affected by construction activity. Activity figures made available after the September Report are consistent with the baseline scenario and the monetary impulse depicted therein. However, inflation will remain low in the short term. This could delay its convergence to the target within the two-year horizon. The Board will pay special attention to this riskâ€”already identified in the Reportâ€”as it could require adjusting the policy rate. At the same time, the Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the two-year horizon. ___ * The Spanish original prevails."
Egypt,2017-11-16,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release November 16, 2017 In its meeting held on November 16, 2017, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) main operation unchanged at 1875 percent, 1975 percent, and 1925 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 1925 percen. During October 2017, annual headline and core inflation declined for the third consecutive month to record 308 percent and 305 percent, after peaking in July 2017 at 330 percent and 353 percent, respectivel. This comes as a result of the moderation of monthly headline inflation rates between August and October 2017 to around 11 percent, compared to an average of 16 percent in the corresponding months in 201. Inflation in October was almost entirely driven by the seasonal effect of higher prices of education service. Accordingly monthly core inflation recorded 07 percent in October 2017 compared to an average of 03 percent in August and Septembe. Meanwhile prices of retail items remained roughly unchanged while food inflation continued to drop, supported by the continued decline of core food prices for the second consecutive mont. Real GDP growth continued to increase for the third consecutive quarter to record 50 percent at market prices in 2016/17 Q4, thereby averaging 46 percent in the second half of 2016/17, growing at the fastest pace since 2009/201. This coincided with the continued narrowing of the unemployment rate to record 119 percent in 2017/18 Q1, the lowest rate since 2011/1. Leading indicators suggest a continued improvement of economic activit. Meanwhile the sustainability of economic growth improved with declining contribution of consumption and increasing contribution of net export. The growth of private investment continued to expand in 2016/17 for the third consecutive year, while public investment maintained its double digit growt. Trade real estate, construction and tourism were the main sectors driving economic activit. Real monetary conditions continued to tighten, a necessary requirement to achieve the CBE's inflation targe. This process was supported by the combination of previous policy rate increases and the recent appreciation of the Egyptian pound against trading-partner currencie. The baseline inflation outlook remains consistent with achieving the CBE's inflation targets of 13 percent (+/- 3 percent) in 2018 Q4 and single digits thereafte. Against this background, the MPC decided that current policy rates remain appropriat. The MPC continues to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust its stance to achieve its mandate of price stability over the medium-ter.

Hungary,2017-11-21,"At its meeting on 21 November 2017, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 22 November 2017:. In the Council's assessment. Hungarian economic growth picks up over the forecast horizon. Some degree of unused capacity has remained in the economy, but this is likely to be gradually absorbed as output grows dynamically. The inflation target is expected to be achieved in a sustainable manner by the middle of 2019. In October 2017, inflation decreased to 2.2 percent and core inflation to 2.7 percent. Both headline and core inflation came in somewhat below the Bank's and the market's expectations, with the moderate dynamics of services and tradables prices accounting for most of the difference. The Bank's measures of underlying inflation declined compared with the previous month and continued to be significantly below the level of core inflation. The expansion in domestic employment, the tight labour market as well as increases in the minimum wage and the guaranteed minimum wage have led to a general, dynamic rise in whole-economy wages. The upward effect of this on costs is being offset by the reduction in employers' social contributions and in the corporate income tax rate early this year. In line with the Bank's expectations, there has still not yet been any significant upward pressure on inflation from wages. Global underlying inflation continues to be moderate. External inflation, particularly in the euro area, is likely to remain low for a prolonged period. Following a temporary rise, the consumer price index is likely to decline again to the bottom of the tolerance band by the end of 2017. Core inflation is expected to decrease in the second half of next year as the temporary effects related to changes in tobacco and dairy product prices fade. Looking ahead, the Bank's measures of underlying inflation are expected to be around 2 percent. Moderate imported inflation and historically low inflation expectations as well as the VAT rate cuts, announced for next year, have been slowing the rise in domestic prices. In the September projection, the inflation target can be achieved sustainably by the middle of 2019. The Hungarian economy grew by 3.6 percent in the third quarter of 2017. In September, industrial production increased relative to a year earlier at a rate similar to those in previous months, the volume of retail sales picked up. Labour demand remained strong: employment was at historically high levels in the third quarter of 2017. The general increase in domestic demand will continue to play a central role in economic growth. Robust growth in construction and the expansion in the performance of the service sector are likely to continue in the coming months. Hungary's current account surplus is expected to fall over the forecast horizon in response to rising domestic demand. Economic growth this year will also be supported by the fiscal budget and the stimulating effects on investment of EU funding. The Monetary Council expects annual economic growth of 3.6 percent in 2017 and stable growth of between 3-4 percent over the coming years. The Bank's and the Government's stimulating measures contribute substantially to economic growth. Sentiment in international financial markets has, on the whole, been positive in the period since the Council's previous interest rate decision. Monetary policy decisions by the world's leading central banks and the latest macroeconomic data were the main factors influencing investors' appetite for risk. The balance sheet reduction programme of the Fed has started in October 2017; however, market prices suggest no major change in interest rate expectations. In October, the European Central Bank announced that it would slow the pace of its asset purchases from January 2018. Nevertheless, persistently loose monetary conditions are expected in the period ahead. Market participants anticipate the ECB's first interest rate hike to occur even later than previously thought, in the middle of 2019. Investors' perceptions about the Central and Eastern European region continued to be positive. Due to the different inflation paths expected in the countries of the region and the different characteristics of inflation targeting regimes, market pricing suggests that the timing of central bank actions will differ. In the Council's assessment, the gradual limitation on the stock of three-month deposits has fulfilled its role and the HUF 75 billion year-end upper limit on the stock will not be reduced further. Therefore, the importance of the stock and maturity structure of central bank swap instruments providing forint liquidity will increase. In the future, the Council will decide on the amount of liquidity crowded out on a regular frequency and will adjust the stock of central bank swap instruments accordingly. The reduction in the overnight deposit rate in September, the amount of liquidity crowded out due to the introduction of an upper limit on the stock of three-month deposits and central bank communication addressing longer-term yields had a marked influence on domestic money market rates. In addition, the stock of central bank swap instruments providing forint liquidity continued to increase and the average maturity of outstanding swap contracts lengthened, in line with the Council's aim. The three-month BUBOR was at its historic low. Long-term yields have declined in the government securities and interbank markets since the previous interest rate decision, and therefore the difference between short and long-term yields has narrowed. However, the yield curve is still steep in international comparison. The Council considers it important that the loose monetary conditions have their effect not only at the short but also at the longer end of the yield curve. To ensure this, the Council decided to introduce two unconventional instruments from January 2018, which will constitute an integral part of the Bank's set of monetary policy instruments. Accordingly, the Council will introduce unconditional interest rate swap (IRS) facilities with five and ten-year maturities, the allocation amount of which has been set at HUF 300 billion for the first quarter of 2018. The IRS facilities will be available for counterparty banks at regular tenders from the beginning of January 2018. In addition, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank will launch a targeted programme aimed at purchasing mortgage bonds with maturities of three years or more. Both programmes will also contribute to an increase in the share of loans with long periods of interest rate fixation. The Magyar Nemzeti Bank will make a decision on the operational details of the programmes in December 2017. In the Council's assessment, some degree of unused capacity has remained in the economy, but this is likely to be absorbed gradually as output grows dynamically. The inflation target is expected to be achieved in a sustainable manner by the middle of 2019. In the Council's assessment, maintaining the base rate and loose monetary conditions for an extended period are necessary to achieve the inflation target in a sustainable manner. The Council will closely monitor developments in monetary conditions and will ensure the persistence of loose monetary conditions over a prolonged period by using the extended set of monetary policy instruments."
Nigeria,2017-11-21,"CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO 116 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEETING OF MONDAY 20th AND TUESDAY 21st NOVEMBER, 2017 Background The Monetary Policy Committee met on the 20th and 21st of November, 2017 against the backdrop of a relatively optimistic global economic outlook. The Committee reviewed key developments in the global and domestic economies during the first ten months of 2017 and assessed the risks to price and financial stability in the short- to-medium term as well as outlook for the first half of 2018. Nine members of the MPC were present at the meeting. External Developments Global output is projected to improve to 36 per cent in 2017 from 32 per cent in 2016. The revised growth forecast reflects the uptick in global economic activity, strengthened by the recovery in oil and other commodity prices and leading to improved aggregate demand. Growth in the advanced economies is projected to improve to 22 per cent in 2017 from 17 per cent in 2016. Similarly emerging markets and developing economies are forecast to 1 grow at 46 per cent in 2017 up from 43 per cent in 2016. The MPC, however, noted some risks to the outlook for global growth to include: continued tension in the Korean Peninsula, complexities arising from the BREXIT negotiations and financial market uncertainties due to monetary policy normalization in the US. The Committee noted that the pace of increase in inflation in the advanced economies, with the exception of the UK, is expected to be considerably slow towards the end of 2017. In the emerging market economies, inflationary pressures have abated as key economies exit recession and their currencies stabilize. Inflation is projected at 17 and 42 per cent in 2017 in the advanced and developing economies, respectively. The Committee observed that the outlook for global monetary policy remains largely accommodative, in support of economic recovery and growth. Domestic Output Developments Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) indicate that real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 140 per cent in the third quarter of 2017, up from 072 per cent, and contraction of 091 per cent in the second and first quarter of 2017, respectively. The major drivers of real GDP growth were agriculture (088%) and industry (183%). Some subsectors contracted, including: construction (001%), trade (029%) and services (102%). Overall non-oil real GDP contracted by 076 per cent in Q3 2017, giving 2 credence to the argument that more work is required to consolidate the recovery process; by putting in place policies that will boost growth through the non-oil sector. The Committee also noted the continuous positive outlook based on the Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), which stood at 550 index points in October 2017, indicating expansion in the manufacturing sector for the seventh consecutive month. Eleven of the sixteen sub-sectors reported growth in the review period. Also the composite PMI for the non-manufacturing sector stood at 553 index points in October 2017, indicating growth for the sixth consecutive month. The Committee hopes that, while the economic recovery appears to remain fragile, a tenacious implementation of the 2017 budget and quick passage of the 2018 budget would boost aggregate demand and confidence in the economy. Developments in Money and Prices The Committee noted that money supply (M2) contracted by 554 per cent in October 2017 (annualised), in contrast to the provisional growth benchmark of 1029 per cent for 2017. The development in M2 is largely due to the contraction of 3750 per cent in other assets net (OAN). Similarly. M1 contracted by 779 per cent (annualised to -935 per cent). Net domestic credit (NDC) expanded by 118 per cent, annualized to 142 per cent, driven primarily by net credit to government, which also expanded by 3 760 per cent against the programmed growth of 3312 per cent. Credit to the private sector, however, contracted by 024 per cent in October 2017, compared with the provisional benchmark of 1488 per cent. The MPC also noted the structural constraints in the transmission of credit to the real sector of the economy as well as the rising unemployment level. The Committee urged the Management of the Bank to continue to encourage the deposit money banks to accelerate the rate of credit growth to the real sector of the economy. Inflationary pressures in the economy continued to moderate with headline inflation (year-on-year) receding for the ninth consecutive month to 1591 per cent in October 2017 from 1598 per cent in September 2017. Food inflation fell marginally to 2031 per cent from 2032 per cent in September, while core inflation increased slightly to 1214 per cent from 1212 per cent during the same period. These developments were attributable to the contraction in money supply, favourable but dwindling base effects, and the relatively stable naira exchange rate. In spite of the marginal decline in food inflation in October, the Committee noted that the rate remained high, traceable to cross border sales, distribution bottlenecks, high prices of farm inputs and supply shortages. Money market interest rates oscillated in tandem with the level of liquidity in the banking system as the average inter-bank call rate, 4 which opened at 1200 per cent on October 3, 2017, closed at 538 per cent on November 16, 2017. The OBB rates opened at 1041 per cent and closed lower at 602 per cent in the same period. However the average inter-bank call and OBB rates for the period stood at 1094 and 1015 per cent, respectively. The development in net liquidity positions and flows reflected the effects of Federation Account payments to states and local governments; remittances by the Nigerian Customs. Federal Inland Revenue Services; OMO sales; foreign exchange interventions and maturing CBN Bills. The Committee noted the continuing improvement in the level of external reserves and the equities segment of the capital market. External reserves grew to US$349 billion at the close of business on November 16, 2017. Market Capitalization (MC) improved by 435 per cent to N1277 trillion from N1224 trillion during the same period. Relative to end-December 2016, capital market indices rose by 3657 and 3810 per cent, respectively, indicating rising investor confidence, due to improvements in foreign exchange supply. Total foreign exchange inflow through the central bank declined by 661 per cent in October 2017, compared with the previous month and attributable to the decline in crude oil and gas 5 receipts as well as revenues from petroleum profit tax (PPT) and royalty payments. Total outflows, however, increased by 1877 per cent during the same period, as a result of interbank sales, direct payments and JVC calls. The Committee noted the gradual convergence between the rates at the bureau-de-change (BDC) and the Nigeria Autonomous Foreign Exchange (NAFEX) market segments, as well as the stability of the exchange rate at the inter-bank segments of the foreign exchange market during the review period. Similarly the Committee viewed with satisfaction, the growing patronage at the Investors' and Exporters' (I&E) window of the foreign exchange market and attributed the development to increased confidence by foreign investors and the preference of Nigerian investors' and exporters' for the window compared with all other windows. The MPC noted that the I&E window had increased liquidity and boosted confidence in the market with over US$1870 billion in transactions since its introduction in April 2017. Overall Outlook and Risks Forecasts of key macroeconomic variables indicate a positive outlook for the economy up to Q1 2018. This is predicated on continued implementation of the 2017 budget into early 2018, anticipated improvements in government revenue from the implementation of the Voluntary Asset and Income Declaration Scheme (VAIDS) as well as favourable crude oil prices. The 6 development finance initiatives by the CBN in the real sector, particularly in agriculture, are expected to continue to yield positive results in terms of output expansion and job creation. Focusing on the downside risks to the outlook, the Committee noted the low fiscal buffers and weak aggregate domestic demand. On the external front, widening global imbalances, and rising geo-political tensions were some of the crucial risks identified. The Considerations of the Committee The Committee noted with satisfaction the second consecutive quarterly growth in real GDP following five quarters of contraction. In addition. Members welcomed the relative stability in the exchange rate, particularly the narrowing premia and the very slow deceleration in consumer price inflation, largely attributable to base effects. Overall the economy has begun to show strong signs of recovery as public investment has picked up with increased housing construction at the Federal and state levels, as well as shipping activities at the ports. The Committee was, however, of the view that policy makers must not relent in their aggressive policy initiatives aimed at continuing the positive growth trajectory. The Committee was also concerned about potential adverse external developments and the cautious approach to lending and financial intermediation by domestic deposit money banks. The Committee similarly evaluated other concerns in the domestic economy and the opportunities for strengthening output recovery, noting that some highly critical subsectors were yet to resume growth. The Committee noted the significant contribution of food prices to headline inflation and observed that the benefit of base effect on overall headline inflation had substantially dwindled. Members however, expressed confidence that the tight stance of monetary policy and the stability in the exchange rate of the naira should continue to positively weigh in on price developments. The Committee reaffirmed its commitment to maintaining price stability, which is crucial to sustainable economic growth and development. The Committee welcomed the review of the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP), in an effort to realise the objectives of the plan. In the same vein, the Committee urges a quick passage of the 2018 Appropriation Bill by the National Assembly, so as to keep fiscal policy on track and deliver the urgently needed reliefs in terms of employment and growth of the economy. On financial stability, the Committee noted the concentration of non-performing loans in a few sectors but observed that the overall condition and outlook for the banking system was stable as deposit money banks' balance sheets remained strong. This assessment is strengthened by developments in the national accounts and the expectations that the affected sectors are 8 returning to growth. Nonetheless the Committee urged further strengthening of supervisory oversight and deployment of early warning systems in order to promptly identify vulnerabilities and proactively manage emerging risks in the banking system. The Committee further observed that government was increasing debt, both domestically and externally, thus crowding out the private sector. The Committee's Decisions In arriving at its decision, the Committee appraised potential policy options in terms of the balance of risks. The Committee also took note of the gains made so far as a result of its earlier decisions; including the stability in the foreign exchange market and the moderate reduction in inflation and thus extensively deliberated the options regarding whether to hold , tighten or ease the policy stance. While tightening would strengthen the impact of monetary policy on inflation with complementary effects on capital inflows and exchange rate stability, it nevertheless could also potentially dampen the positive outlook for growth and financial stability. On the other hand, whereas loosening would strengthen the outlook for growth by stimulating domestic aggregate demand through reduced cost of borrowing, it could aggravate upward trend in consumer prices and generate exchange rate pressures. The Committee also feels that loosening would worsen the current 9 account balance through increased importation. On the argument to hold, the Committee believes that key variables have continued to evolve in line with the current stance of macroeconomic policy and should be allowed to fully manifest. Members noted that the developments in output and inflation in particular required effective close monitoring in order to gain clarity on the medium term optimal path of monetary policy. In consideration of the foregoing, the Committee decided by a vote of 8 to 1 to retain the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) at 140 per cent alongside all other policy parameters. One member voted to reduce the MPR by 100 basis points. Consequently the MPC voted to: Retain the MPR at 140 per cent; Retain the CRR at 225 per cent; Retain the Liquidity Ratio at 300 per cent; and Retain the Asymmetric corridor at +200 and -500 basis points around the MPR.

South Africa,2017-11-23,"South African Reserve Bank PRESS STATEMENT EMBARGO DELIVERY 23 November 2017 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Lesetja Kganyago. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee upside risks to the inflation outlook have increased, mainly due to higher international oil prices and a weaker rand exchange rate. Despite a deterioration in the forecast, inflation is expected to remain within the target range for the rest of the forecast period. Domestic event risks, including rating agency reviews and the economic policy implications of the ANC electoral conference, are likely to dominate rand movements over the coming weeks. The domestic growth outlook remains weak, continuing its deviation from the generally more favourable global pattern. Stronger world growth has contributed to a further increase in international oil prices, which could, in turn, provide a boost to global inflation. This may increase the pace of monetary policy tightening in the advanced economies, with possible implications for capital flows to emerging markets. MPC Statement November 23rd, 2017 Page 1. MPC Statement November 23rd, 2017 Page 1 The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 4.8% in October, down from 5.1% previously, marginally below the Bank's short-term forecast. Food and non-alcoholic beverage inflation continued to moderate, measuring 5.3% in October, down from 5.5% in September, but meat price inflation remained elevated at 15.5%. The Bank's measure of core inflation, which excludes food, fuel and electricity, measured 4.5% in October compared with 4.6% previously. Year-on-year producer price inflation for final manufactured goods increased in August and September, to 4.2% and 5.2% respectively, having recorded a low of 3.6% in July. The higher trend was driven to a large extent by higher international oil prices and a weaker exchange rate. Food products price inflation moderated further, to 1.3% in September, but manufactured meat price inflation remained elevated at 16.5%. At the agricultural level, prices of live animals increased by 26.7%, suggesting that it may take some time for meat price inflation to normalise. The inflation forecast generated by the Bank's Quarterly Projection Model (QPM) shows a deterioration since September. The average forecast for 2017 is unchanged at 5.3%, but has been revised upward for 2018 and 2019 to 5.2% and 5.5%, from 5.1% and 5.4% previously. The lower turning point, which is expected in the first quarter of 2018, increased from 4.5% to 4.7%. The main upside drivers of these changes are a weaker exchange rate path in 2018 in particular, a higher international oil price, and higher average wage growth. These pressures are offset to some extent by a more favourable food price forecast in 2018 in particular. Following a number of downside surprises, food price inflation is now expected to reach a low turning point of 3.8% in the first quarter of 2018, compared MPC Statement November 23rd, 2017 Page 2. Following a number of downside surprises, food price inflation is now expected to reach a low turning point of 3.8% in the first quarter of 2018, compared MPC Statement November 23rd, 2017 Page 2 with 4.7% previously. Average increases of 4.5% and 5.9% are now expected in 2018 and 2019, compared with previous forecasts of 5.3% and 5.9%. Furthermore, the endogenously determined path of the repo rate in the QPM also provides an offsetting effect. This path implies three interest rate increases of 25 basis points each by the end of 2019, compared with one increase previously. As we elaborate later, this does not imply an unconditional commitment to this policy path. The forecast for core inflation, which is unchanged at 4.8% for 2017, has been adjusted up by 0.2 percentage points in both 2018 and 2019 to 5.1% and 5.3% respectively. A low turning point of 4.6% is expected in the final two quarters of 2017. The expectations of market analysts, as reflected in the Reuters econometer survey, are similar to those of the Bank's forecasts, with a slight deterioration since September. The survey conducted in November shows median forecasts of 5.2% for 2018 and 5.5% for 2019. Inflation expectations implicit in the inflation linked bond yields have increased, with the 5-year break-even inflation rates now close to the upper end of the target range. The global growth outlook remains positive despite some geopolitical risks. Confidence indices in a number of countries have reached their highest levels since the global financial crisis. Nevertheless the expectation is that world growth will remain below the levels seen before the crisis. The recovery in the advanced economies appears to be most sustained in the euro area, the US and Japan, but the outlook for the UK remains constrained by the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit process. The extent to which this positive prognosis for some advanced economies is predicated on continued monetary accommodation is still unclear. MPC Statement November 23rd, 2017 Page 3. MPC Statement November 23rd, 2017 Page 3 The outlook for emerging markets remains mixed but generally favourable, with prospects for oil producers boosted by higher oil prices. There are, however, some concerns about possible headwinds from slowing momentum in the Chinese economy. Inflation pressures are mostly benign in the advanced economies although there are some incipient near-term risks from higher international oil prices. Low wage growth is seen as a brake on core inflation pressures, despite relatively tight labour market conditions. The US Fed is expected to maintain a gradual pace of monetary policy tightening, with a further policy rate increase widely expected in December. The ECB has signalled a reduction in the pace of net asset purchases from next year, but expects interest rates to remain low for an extended period of time. The Bank of Japan has also maintained a highly accommodative policy stance. By contrast, the Bank of England raised its Bank rate in November in response to inflation pressures driven by the depreciation of the pound. The outlook for continued capital flows to emerging markets therefore remains relatively favourable despite the slowdown in bond flows in the past few weeks. However, the risk of a faster pace of monetary tightening in the US in particular, in the event of upside inflation or growth surprises, could reduce capital flows further. Since the previous meeting of the MPC the rand has depreciated by 3.6% against the US dollar, by 3.0% against the euro, and by 3.3% on a trade-weighted basis. The rand recorded a weak point of around R14.55 against the US dollar in mid- November, but has recovered somewhat since then. Factors that impacted on the rand during the period included the ongoing uncertainty with regard to the outcome of the ANC electoral conference in December; concerns about a faster pace of MPC Statement November 23rd, 2017 Page 4. Factors that impacted on the rand during the period included the ongoing uncertainty with regard to the outcome of the ANC electoral conference in December; concerns about a faster pace of MPC Statement November 23rd, 2017 Page 4 monetary tightening in the US; the negative reaction to the Medium Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS); and speculation regarding the introduction of free higher education in South Africa. These latter two factors have raised the risk of sovereign ratings downgrades, a risk that has been hanging over the rand for some time. Downgrades of domestic currency debt to sub-investment grade could lead to South African government bonds falling out of key indices which require investment grade. Such an event could trigger significant sales of domestic bonds by non-residents. Ratings reviews are expected imminently, but the extent to which any possible downgrades may already be priced in remains uncertain. The lead-up to the ANC national elective conference and its uncertain outcome, is also likely to continue to weigh on the currency. Aside from these negative factors, the rand has been given some support by the continued surpluses on the trade account of the balance of payments. The Bank's forecasts for the current account deficit as a percentage of GDP have been revised down by about half a percentage point in all three years of the forecast period, to 2.2% in 2017, and 2.9% and 3.2% in 2018 and 2019. Furthermore, the generally positive sentiment towards emerging markets remains supportive of the rand. The domestic economic growth outlook remains subdued but positive. Both consumer and business confidence remain low and are also likely to be affected by political developments in December. The forecast for GDP growth generated by the QPM has been revised up marginally to 0.7% for 2017, but revised down to 1.2% and 1.5% for 2018 and 2019, from 1.3% and 1.7% previously. The output gap is expected to remain negative over the forecast period. The SARB's composite MPC Statement November 23rd, 2017 Page 5. The SARB's composite MPC Statement November 23rd, 2017 Page 5 leading business cycle indicator increased further in September, consistent with a mild recovery. High frequency data suggest that the main production sectors have again contributed positively to economic growth in the third quarter. However, both the mining and manufacturing sectors experienced sharp month-on-month contractions in September. The Absa PMI has increased for three consecutive months, but at 47.8 index points remains in contractionary territory. The construction sector, which recorded negative growth in the second quarter, remains weak. Of particular concern is the sharp decline in the FNB/BER civil construction index to 15 index points in the third quarter, its lowest level since 2000. This is indicative of the poor outlook for infrastructure expenditure. According to the Quarterly Labour Force Survey (QLFS) conducted by Statistics South Africa, year-on-year growth of total employment measured 2.3% in the third quarter of 2017. Despite this increase, the official unemployment rate was unchanged at 27.7% for the third successive quarter. Fiscal constraints point to further job losses in the public sector. The outlook for consumption expenditure by households has improved moderately, following stronger retail trade sales in the second and third quarters. Retail trade sales recorded growth of 1.4% in the third quarter, despite month-on-month contractions in July and September. New motor vehicle sales also held up relatively well during the quarter. By contrast, wholesale trade sales contracted. The â€œBlack Fridayâ€ effect is likely to boost sales in the fourth quarter as well. Nevertheless consumption expenditure is expected to remain relatively subdued over the forecast period. MPC Statement November 23rd, 2017 Page 6. MPC Statement November 23rd, 2017 Page 6 Favourable drivers of real consumption expenditure include positive real income and wage growth, and some positive wealth effects from higher equity prices. Although growth in credit extension to households remains negative in real terms, it has increased in recent months. Constraining factors include higher tax burdens, low employment growth and weak consumer confidence. Wage growth continues to contribute to the persistence of inflation at higher levels. Although the year-on-year pace of increase in nominal remuneration per worker in the formal non-agricultural sector of the economy declined in the second quarter of this year, at 6.1% it was still positive in real terms. Adjusting for labour productivity, growth in nominal unit labour costs measured 6.0% in the second quarter. Unit labour cost increases are forecast to remain above the 6% level over the forecast period. According to Andrew Levy Employment Publications, the average wage settlement rate in collective bargaining agreements amounted to 7.6% in the first 9 months of 2017. The Medium Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS) published in October revealed a rapidly deteriorating fiscal position. Significant revisions were made to the expected deficits and government debt-to-GDP ratio over the medium term. This deterioration was mainly a result of significantly lower tax revenues, although there was also a provision for a moderate breach of the expenditure ceiling. The less favourable path of fiscal consolidation could potentially reduce the scope for further monetary policy accommodation. International oil prices have re-emerged as an upside risk to domestic and global inflation. Having reached recent lows of around US$45 per barrel in June, the price of Brent crude oil has fluctuated in the US$60-US$65 per barrel range since late MPC Statement November 23rd, 2017 Page 7. Having reached recent lows of around US$45 per barrel in June, the price of Brent crude oil has fluctuated in the US$60-US$65 per barrel range since late MPC Statement November 23rd, 2017 Page 7 October. This is in response to increased demand, and reportedly high compliance with the output restriction agreement brokered by OPEC. While we still expect the flexibility of the shale oil producers in the US to limit the further upside potential, oil prices are expected to remain at these elevated levels for some time. The oil price assumptions in the Bank's models have accordingly been increased moderately for both 2018 and 2019. The combination of a weaker exchange rate and higher product prices has resulted in a cumulative increase in domestic petrol prices by R1.00 per litre since September. The current under-recovery suggests a further increase in the region of 70 cents per litre is likely in December. The latest inflation outcomes show that headline inflation remains close to the midpoint of the target range, while core inflation has reached its lowest level in five years. However, the forecasts suggest that both measures are close to their lower turning points, and an upward trajectory is expected to begin early next year. Although inflation is expected to remain within the target range over the forecast period, the risks to the outlook are assessed to be on the upside at a time when imminent key event risks contribute to an environment of particularly elevated uncertainty. These event risks affect monetary policy primarily through the exchange rate channel. Since the previous meeting of the MPC the deterioration in the fiscal stance has increased the risk of a sovereign ratings downgrade of domestic currency bonds to sub-investment grade. As noted, this could precipitate a significant sell-off of domestic government bonds by non-residents, with implications for the exchange rate and long-term bond yields. Should this occur, there is the possibility of a short- MPC Statement November 23rd, 2017 Page 8. Should this occur, there is the possibility of a short- MPC Statement November 23rd, 2017 Page 8 term overreaction, and a possible partial recovery later on. The precise path and duration is highly uncertain. International oil prices have become an increasing concern. While we have adjusted our assumptions in this regard upward, a persistence of oil prices at current levels or higher pose an upside risk to the forecast. As before, a sizeable electricity tariff increase also remains a risk. We should have clarity on Eskom's tariff application by the time of the next MPC meeting. There are very few signs of domestic demand pressures, as reflected in core inflation outcomes. Although retail sales have surprised on the upside, household consumption expenditure is expected to remain relatively subdued. The economic growth outlook remains constrained, as weak confidence continues to weigh on investment expenditure. Business and consumer confidence are likely to be sensitive to the political outcomes in December. The MPC assesses the risks to the growth outlook to be on the downside. In light of the high degree of uncertainty prevailing in the economy and the balance of risks, the MPC has decided that it would be prudent to maintain the current stance of monetary policy at this stage. Accordingly, the repurchase rate remains unchanged at 6.75% per annum. The QPM generates an endogenous interest path that implies an increase in the repo rate of 75 basis points by the end of 2019. We need to stress that this does not mean an unconditional commitment to change policy rates in line with this path. The forecasts and implied path are a broad guide to policy and not necessarily prescriptive. Depending on economic conditions, the MPC may choose to diverge from the suggested path and alternative paths could be generated that are still MPC Statement November 23rd, 2017 Page 9. Depending on economic conditions, the MPC may choose to diverge from the suggested path and alternative paths could be generated that are still MPC Statement November 23rd, 2017 Page 9 consistent with achieving the inflation target. As always. MPC members needs to weigh the risks to the forecasts and assess the trade-offs. It is also the case that the implied path can change from meeting to meeting as the data and risks change.

Colombia,2017-11-24,"The Board of Directors of the Central Bank of Colombia reiterates the 3.0% inflation target, in a range of 2.0% to 4.0%. The monetary policy action will continue to be directed to reaching the 3.0% target. The inflation result may oscillate around this level depending on macroeconomic or sectorial shocks and on the dynamics of the inflationary process. The Board, at today's meeting, decided to reduce the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp to 4.75%. For this decision, the Board mainly took into account the following aspects. In October, inflation increased, reaching 4.05%. The acceleration of inflation was mainly explained by the behavior of the food CPI. The average of core inflation indicators continued descending, standing at 4.5%. The observed inflation continued to be inferior to the expected by the market and by the Central BankÂ´s technical staff, mainly because of the good behavior of the groups of food, and tradable goods excluding food and regulated items. Inflation expectations recorded slight changes. Those by analysts to December 2017 and 2018 decreased and stand, on average, at 3.95% and 3.49%, respectively. Those embedded in public debt bonds remain above 3.0%. The direct effects of the strong transitory supply shocks that deviated yearly inflation from its target have faded. The effects of the indexation of prices and of the increases in indirect taxes at the beginning of the year are expected to reduce, and with this, that inflation and core inflation measures converge to the target. In Colombia, the output growth of the third quarter (2.0%) was lower than the forecast by the technical staff of the Central Bank (2.3%). The dynamics of the domestic demand was weaker than expected. The behavior of exports contributed to the growth. These figures confirm the persistence of economic growth below its potential; for this reason, the underuse of the installed capacity of the economy is expected to continue expanding. External demand continues recovering, driven mainly by developed economies. Oil prices increased, and the terms of trade are expected to end the year above the average level recorded in 2016. In the United States, the Federal Reserve is likely to increase its policy rate during the rest of the year. The exchange rate has been volatile and, on average, the peso has depreciated vis-Ã -vis the US dollar in the last month. Based on this information, the Board considered the following factors for its decision. The lower level of inflation versus the forecast from the last months and the lower projections of the technical staff in the policy horizon. This behavior has been registered in several of the sub-groups of the CPI, especially food and tradable goods excluding food and regulated items. These results suggest that convergence of inflation to its 3.0% target could be faster, although uncertainty in this regard remains high. A weaker-than-expected economic activity and the risk of a slowdown beyond what is compatible with the deterioration in the income dynamics due to the fall in oil prices. Recent indicators point to larger excesses of capacity of the economy, although the uncertainty in terms of their size is high. Although the orderly adjustment of the current account deficit is expected to continue, there are risks in the international environment that may affect such adjustment. In this context, given the greater weakness of the economic activity and the lower inflation forecasts for 2018, the Board of Directors deemed appropriate the reduction of the benchmark interest rate by 25 bp. However, the international environment poses risks that limit the countercyclical capacity of monetary policy in the future. Therefore, new reductions will depend on the speed of the convergence of inflation to its target, on the evolution of the excess of productive capacity, and on the behavior of external variables. The decision to reduce the benchmark interest rate was approved by five members of the Board. The two remaining Board Members voted to maintain the policy rate at 5.0%."
Pakistan,2017-11-24,"MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Monetary Policy Statement November 24, 2017 The latest information reveals that economic activity is strong as corroborated by broad-based pick up in industrial output, gains in factors supporting production of major crops, and growth in private sector credit. This implies that the prospects of achieving. percent target of real GDP growth continue to be strong. Model-based projections for inflation and survey-based measures of inflation expectations show that in FY18 overall inflation is expected to remain well below the target of. percent. On the fiscal front, healthy growth in tax revenue collection by FBR during Q1-FY18, 2. percent compared to the modest. percent during Q1-FY17, is welcome development. Near-term balance-of-payments challenges continue to persist. However visible improvements in export growth, notable increase in foreign direct investments and expected other financial inflows will help contain these pressures. review of latest developments in the real sector show that during Q1-FY18 LSM growth has surpassed its earlier expectations as it has been recorded at. percent compared to. percent in the corresponding period of FY17. This is explained by improved security conditions and power supply, transformation of fixed investment into enhancements of productive capacity on the ground, low inflation and stable interest rates. Further support comes from the continuation of CPEC projects. Barring any extreme seasonal events, agriculture sector is expected to perform better for the second consecutive year. This is explained by increase in both cultivated area and fertilizer off-take during the Kharif season, on-going trend of investment in mechanization, higher uptick in agricultural credit and unchanged support price for wheat at the time of its sowing. Accordingly demand for services is also expected to rise in FY18 given its inter-connectivity with the other two sectors. Taking all the evidence together, real GDP growth is expected to meet its target level of FY18. Turning to inflation. CPI inflation averaged. percent during Jul-Oct FY18 well below the annual inflation target. Higher international oil prices along with pass-through to domestic petroleum prices and the imposition of regulatory duty on non-essential import items are expected to increase inflation in the coming months. However while taking into account these effects, inflation is still expected to fall inside the range of.5-5. percent projected at the start of FY18. Indeed supply side dynamics, both for food and non-food items, are improving given the gains in agricultural yields and investment in manufacturing. The current growth momentum is being translated into upward pressure in the services component of the CPI basket. Consequently NFNE measure of core inflation remains relatively high although stable around its current level of. percent (YoY) since November FY17. An important development in the monetary sector is visible change in the pattern of government borrowing for budgetary financing. Instead of relying heavily on Central Bank financing like last year. Government is securing funds both from SBP and scheduled banks. Alongside active liquidity management by the Central Bank kept the overnight repo rate close to the policy rate and is supporting the availability of credit. Indeed the stock of credit to the private sector grew on YoY basis by Rs. 814. billion in October FY18 (a growth of 18. percent) as compared to Rs. 436. billion (11. percent growth) in the corresponding period last year. Looking into the break-up of this credit expansion, the already buoyant growth in fixed investment gained further traction at slightly higher level relative to FY17, while both working capital loans and consumer financing showed encouraging trends. These developments are further supported by the improvement in capacity utilization of major sectors which indicates growing demand. Page MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN The current account deficit widened to US$. billion during Jul-Oct FY18 as compared to US$. billion during the corresponding period in FY17. Delving deeper. Pakistan's exports have seen an improvement during Jul-Oct FY18, growing at 1. percent as compared to the decline of. percent in the comparable period last year. Similarly remittances recorded modest increase of. percent during Jul-Oct FY18. Nonetheless the impact of these positive developments on the overall current account was more than offset by growth in imports on account of rising domestic demand for consumption as well as investment and due to recent rise in international oil prices. However the introduction of regulatory duties is expected to help curb some growth in imports during the coming months. Finally the financial account perspective shows that FDI inflows have risen, reaching US$ 940 million by the end of October FY18 as compared to US$ 539 million during the same period last year, indicating improving sentiments regarding the economy. Despite this positive development. SBP's foreign exchange reserves stand at US$ 13. billion on November 17, 2017 down from US$ 16. billion at end- June 2017. Going forward, progress on CPEC related projects and other official proceeds will be instrumental in managing the overall balance-of-payments deficit. Following detailed deliberations, the Committee has decided to maintain the policy rate at.75 percent. Page."
Israel,2017-11-27,"In recent months, there has been a slight increase in the inflation environment, though it remains below the target. Annual inflation increased, and short-term expectations rose slightly. Long-term expectations are anchored within the target range. The economy continues to expand at a pace that is consistent with its potential growth. However, the first estimate of third quarter National Accounts shows a halt in the recovery of exports,due to a decline in goods exports, while private consumption returned to being the main component of growth. All indicators from the labor market continue to point toward its strength, and to show that it hovers around full employment. The positive momentum in the global economy continues to gain traction. Despite the improvement in activity and the increase in oil prices, inflation in most major economies remains below target. Some of the major central banks shifted their monetary policy to a less accommodative direction, but the monetary environment remained very expansionary. The exchange rate has stabilized since the last monetary discussion. In the past 12 months, the shekel has appreciated by 5.0 percent in effective exchange rate terms. Housing market data continue to indicate some slowdown in activity, with the continued increasein home prices at a relatively moderate rate. For the file of data accompanying this notice, click here. The Monetary Committee intends to maintain the accommodative policy as long as necessaryin order to entrench the inflation environment within the target range. The Bank of Israel continues to monitor developments in inflation, the real economy,the financial markets, and the global economy, and will act to attain the monetary policy targets in accordance with such developments. In recent months there has been a slight increase in the inflation environment, though it remains below the target. Inflation measured over the preceding 12 months has increased since August, and reached 0.2 percent in October (Figure 1 in the attached data file). The price reductions initiated by the government renewed their impact, though to a lesser extent than previously (Figure 2). The rate of inflation in tradable goods is increasing but remains negative, in view of the development of the exchange rate (Figure 6) and changes in consumer behavior, and despite the moderate positive contribution of energy prices. Inflation in nontradable goods is increasing, primarily due to the continued rise in the housing component, as well as by the increase in purchasing power resulting from rising real wages. Inflation forecasts and expectations increased for most ranges following the publication of the October CPI, though short term expectations for up to two years remain below the target (Figures 4, 5). Long-term expectations remain anchored within the target range. In recent months, there has been no significant change in nominal long-term government bond yields, which are low relative to the yield in the US and markedly higher than those in Europe (Figure 7). Real yields in Israel are similar to those in the US and higher than those in Europe. Yield spreads between corporate and government bonds remain very low. According to the first estimate of National Accounts data, growth accelerated in the third quarter to a rate of 4.1 percent, so that the average growth rate in the past year is in line with the economy's potential growth rate (Figure 10). In the third quarter, current private consumption returned to being a major component of growth, while growth of exports (excluding diamonds and startups) halted (Figure 12). Goods exports contracted: against the background of the appreciation of the shekel, and despite the continued rapid rate of growth in world trade, while services exports grew at a strong pace. Labor market data continue to indicate a high level of activity. Wages continue to increase at a rapid pace, the number of job vacancies grew, and the unemployment rate is on a downward trend: all these support the assessment that the labor market is at full employment. Housing market data continue to indicate some slowing of activity, with home prices continuing to increase at a relatively moderate rate (Figure 8). The volume of transactions continues to decline, apparently due to uncertainty regarding the effect that government programs in the housing area will have. The volume of new mortgages has been relatively stable for the past nine months, and in the past three months, the interest rate on mortgages has also stabilized (Figure 9). The positive momentum in global economic activity continues to gain traction. Analysts increased their growth forecasts, and are projecting continued improvement in 2018 (Figure 16). Despite the improvement in activity: which is reflected in a decline in the unemployment rate and a reduction in the output gap in the various economies: and the increase in oil prices (Figure 19), inflation in most major economies remains below target (Figure 18). Some major central banks shifted their monetary policies to a less accommodative direction. The US Federal Reserve is expected to increase the federal funds rate in December;the ECB announced, as expected, that its bond purchases will continue in 2018, but at a reduced volume; and the Bank of England raised its interest rate. With that, the monetary environment remains very accommodative (Figure 20). The policy measures in Europe and the UK were accompanied by dovish messages, and in Japan, the central bank repeated its commitment to accommodative policy. The US economy grew rapidly in the third quarter, and according to preliminary assessments, similar growth is expected in the fourth quarter as well. The tax reform should get underway at the beginning of 2018, and support growth in the short term, while increasing the deficit and government debt. In the eurozone, rapid growth continued in the third quarter, with a continued decline in political risk,and forecasts were revised upward. In Japan, positive growth has continued for nearly two years, and the election results strengthen the assessments that the accommodative policy will continue. In China, the slowdown in the growth rate continues, and concerns over the government's ability to deal with the high leverage in the Chinese economy remain high. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to this interest rate decision will be published on December 11, 2017. The next decision regarding the interest rate will be published at 16:00 on Wednesday. January 10, 2018, following which the Governor will hold a press briefing."
Kazakhstan,2017-11-27,"Press-release – 38 The base rate unchanged at 10.25% November 27, 2017 Almaty The National Bank of Kazakhstan has decided to keep the base rate at 10.25% with a corridor of +/-1%. The annual inflation rate has accelerated in October; however it remains within the target range and matches the forecasted estimates of the National Bank. The inflationary risk from the external sector still exists. Additionally, it is favored to keep the neutrality of the monetary policy conditions. The inflationary processes have accelerated to the level of 7.7% in the annual terms in October (7.1% in September), yet the annual inflation continues to remain within the target range of 6-8% in 2017. The dynamics of inflation mainly derive from the short-term factors  the rise of energy fuel prices (gasoline, diesel, coal) due to temporary supply reduction and of vegetables prices (seasonal increase of the prices), as evidenced by insignificant increase of the core inflation (by 0.2 p.p.). The risks of the secondary effect of the increase in the energy prices may persist in the short-run period and may cause the rise of the inflationary expectations. Nevertheless, the annual inflation rate according to the estimates of the National Bank will remain within the target range of 2017. Inflationary expectations of the households demonstrated the signs of the increased volatility that reflects the high share of the adaptive component. Thus, the quantitative assessment of the inflation for a year ahead has risen to 6.9% following the increase of the energy and food prices. At the same time inflationary expectations remained within the target range of inflation, which is set at the lower level for the next year  5-7% at the end of 2018. The situation in the external commodity markets shows a pattern of stability. The growth and inflation rates in the countries-main trading partners along with the level of the external food prices are considered as favorable from the point of view of the impact on the demand for export of Kazakhstan and on the inflation. The tendency of the increase is being observed in the dynamics of the oil prices starting June of 2017. However in medium term the risks of the volatility may occur, increasing the uncertainty regarding the future periods. The economic activity continues demonstrating the recovery. The short-term economic indicator, which characterizes the aggregate supply in the country, increased by 5.4% in 10 months of 2017, however the growth remains unsteady in the different sectors of the economy. The decision on the unchanged level of the base rate reflects the reasonability of maintaining the neutrality of the monetary policy conditions and the level of the real interest rate on the level not higher that 4% that corresponds to the long-term potential economic growth rate. The next decision on the base rate will be announced on January 15, 2018 at 17:00 Astana time."
South Korea,2017-11-30,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points, from 1.25% to 1.50%, for the intermeeting period. (English translation prepared by the Bank of Korea staff) The Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points, from 1.25% to 1.50%, for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Board considers that the global economic recovery has continued to expand. The global financial markets have shown stable movements, with stock prices displaying moderate upward trends for example. Looking ahead the Board sees the global economic recovery as likely to be affected by factors such as the paces of monetary policy normalization in major countries, the directions of the US government's economic policies, and the movements toward spreading trade protectionism. The Board judges that the solid trend of domestic economic growth has continued, as private consumption has improved moderately and investment has shown favorable movements, while exports have sustained their high rate of increase. The trend of improvement in employment conditions has shown signs of weakening somewhat, with the pace of increase in the number of persons employed in the service sector having slowed for example. Going forward, the Board expects that domestic economic growth will be slightly above the rate projected in October, as domestic demand activities including consumption and facilities investment continue their trends of moderate improvement, and exports also sustain their buoyancy thanks largely to the pickup in the global economic recovery and the improved conditions related to trade with China. Consumer price inflation has slowed to the upper-1% level, in consequence mainly of declines in the extents of increase in the prices of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products and the disappearance of the base effect from the reduction of electricity fees last year. Core inflation (with food and energy product prices excluded from the CPI) has been rising slightly in the mid-1% range, and the rate of inflation expected by the general public has stayed at the mid-2% level. Looking ahead the Board expects that consumer price inflation will be in the mid-1% range for some time and then gradually approach the target level. Core inflation will also rise gradually. Although long-term market interest rates have risen, due to changes in expectations related to monetary policy, the domestic financial markets have shown generally stable movements, with stock prices continuing to rise in line for example with improvements in corporate performances. The Korean won-US dollar exchange rate has meanwhile fallen, owing chiefly to the strengthening recovery of the domestic economy. The rate of increase in household lending is slowing somewhat, but is still sustaining a high level compared to past years. Housing sales prices have risen faster in some parts of Seoul and its surrounding areas, although their uptrend has in general slowed since the government's announcement of housing market stabilization measures. Looking ahead, the Board will conduct monetary policy so as to ensure that the recovery of economic growth continues and consumer price inflation can be stabilized at the target level over a medium-term horizon, while paying attention to financial stability. As it is forecast that inflationary pressures on the demand side will not be high for the time being, while the domestic economy is expected to continue its solid growth, the Board will maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance. In this process it will judge carefully whether it is necessary to adjust its accommodative monetary policy stance further, while closely checking future economic growth and inflation trends. It will also carefully monitor any changes in the monetary policies of major countries, conditions related to trade with major countries, the trend of increase in household debt, and geopolitical risks."
Poland,2017-12-05,"Warsaw, 5 December 2017 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 4-5 December 2017 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: â–ª reference rate at 1.50%, â–ª lombard rate at 2.50%, â–ª deposit rate at 0.50%, â–ª rediscount rate at 1.75%. Global economy continues to recover. Economic growth in the euro area remains higher than in the previous year, driven by an improvement in the labour market conditions, favourable sentiment of economic agents, and a recovery in international trade. Also in the United States economic conditions remain favourable. At the same time, in China incoming data indicate a slight slowdown in GDP growth. Despite ongoing global recovery, inflation abroad remains moderate, on the back of persistently low domestic inflationary pressure in many countries. At the same time, prices of certain commodities, including oil, have risen in recent months. The European Central Bank keeps interest rates close to zero, including the deposit rate below zero, and continues to purchase financial assets. The US Federal Reserve started reducing its balance sheet in October. In Poland, annual GDP growth accelerated in 2017 Q3 to 4.9%. Growth was still driven primarily by consumer demand, supported by rising employment and wages, disbursement of benefits and very good consumer sentiment. Gross fixed capital formation also picked up in 2017 Q3, mainly on the back of a rise in public investment, while the corporate investment growth rate remained negative. The acceleration in GDP growth was fuelled by a significantly higher export growth rate. Annual consumer price growth rose in November to 2.5%. The main factor behind the rise in inflation is high food price growth and markedly higher than in previous years energy price growth. Core inflation net of food and energy prices remains low. Wage growth in national economy remained stable in 2017 Q3 and the growth in unit labour costs in national economy declined, despite a rise in wage growth in the enterprise sector. In the Council's assessment, favourable economic conditions in the Polish economy will continue in the next quarters. Yet, it may be expected that GDP growth will decelerate slightly in the following years. Taking into account the present information, the Council judges that inflation will remain close to the inflation target over the projection horizon. As a result, the current level of interest rates is conducive to keeping the Polish economy on the sustainable growth path and maintaining macroeconomic stability. 1/2 The Council adopted a resolution on the remuneration on the required reserve. In line with this resolution, the remuneration of the required reserve will amount to 0.50%. The resolution comes into force on 1 January 2018."
Brazil,2017-12-06,"The Copom unanimously decided to reduce the Selic rate by 0.5 percentage point, to 7.0 percent per year, without bias. The following observations provide an update of the Copom's baseline scenario:. The set of indicators of economic activity released since the last Copom meeting is consistent with a gradual recovery of the Brazilian economy. The global outlook has been favorable, as global economic activity remains on a gradual recovery path, without exerting excessive pressure on financial conditions in advanced economies. This supports risk appetite towards emerging economies. The Committee judges that its baseline inflation scenario has evolved, to a large extent, as expected. Inflation developments remain favorable, with various measures of underlying inflation running at comfortable or low levels. This includes the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy. Inflation expectations for 2017 collected by the Focus survey retreated to around 3.0%. The Copom's inflation projections in the scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the Focus survey stand around 2.9% for 2017, 4.2% for 2018, and 4.2% for 2019. This scenario assumes a path for the policy interest rate that ends 2017 and 2018 at 7.0%, and 2019 at 8.0%. The Committee emphasizes that its baseline scenario involves risks in both directions. On the one hand, the combination of possible second-round effects of the favorable food price shock and of low current levels of industrial goods inflation, and the possible propagation through inertial mechanisms of low inflation levels may lead to a lower-than-expected prospective inflation trajectory. On the other hand, frustration of expectations regarding the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy may affect risk premia and increase the path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy. This risk intensifies in the case of a reversal of the current benign global outlook for emerging economies. Taking into account the baseline scenario, the balance of risks, and the wide array of available information, the Copom unanimously decided to reduce the Selic rate by 0.5 percentage point, to 7.0 percent per year, without bias. The Committee judges that convergence of inflation to the target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy, which includes 2018 and 2019, is compatible with the monetary easing process. The Committee judges that economic conditions prescribe accommodative monetary policy, i.e., interest rates below the structural level. The Copom emphasizes that the evolution of reforms and necessary adjustments in the Brazilian economy contributes to the reduction of its structural interest rate. The Committee will continue to reassess estimates of this rate over time. The evolution of the baseline scenario, in line with expectations, and the stage of the monetary easing cycle made it appropriate to reduce the Selic rate by 0.5 percentage point at this Copom meeting. Regarding the next meeting, provided the Committees baseline scenario evolves as expected, and taking into account the stage of the monetary easing cycle, at this time the Copom views an additional moderate reduction of the pace of easing as appropriate. The Committee views this guidance as more susceptible to changes in its baseline scenario and balance of risks than in previous meetings. Going forward, the Committee judges that the current stage of the cycle recommends caution in conducting monetary policy. The Copom emphasizes that the monetary easing process will continue to depend on the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, possible reassessments of the extension of the cycle, and on inflation forecasts and expectations. The following members of the Committee voted for this decision: Ilan Goldfajn (Governor). Carlos Viana de Carvalho. Isaac Sidney Menezes Ferreira. Mauricio Costa de Moura. Otavio Ribeiro Damaso.

India,2017-12-06,"Fifth Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2017-18 Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) Reserve Bank of India On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation at its meeting today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 6.0 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains at 5.75 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 6.25 per cent. The decision of the MPC is consistent with a neutral stance of monetary policy in consonance with the objective of achieving the medium-term target for consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent, while supporting growth. The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below. Assessment 2. Since the last meeting of the MPC in October 2017, global economic activity has been gaining momentum through the final quarter of the year, driven mainly by advanced economies (AEs). US growth remained largely resilient to hurricanes and grew at the highest pace in the past three years in Q3 of 2017, with positive contributions from private consumption, investment activity and net exports. The unemployment rate fell to 4.1 per cent in October, the lowest in the last 17 years. In the Euro area, economic activity expanded, underpinned by accommodative monetary policy and strong job gains. The Japanese economy also continued to grow in Q3, largely supported by external demand, which helped compensate for the slowing of domestic consumption. 12 of 2017-18, after five consecutive quarters of deceleration. It was powered by a sharp acceleration in industrial activity. All the three sub-sectors of industry registered higher growth. GVA growth in the manufacturing sector  the key component of industry  accelerated sharply on improved demand and re-stocking post goods and services tax (GST) implementation. The mining sector expanded in Q2 due to higher coal and natural gas production. GVA growth in the electricity, gas, water supply and other utility services sector also strengthened on higher demand. In contrast, growth in agriculture and allied activities slackened, reflecting the lower than expected kharif harvest. Activity in the services sector decelerated, mainly on account of slowdown in financial, insurance, real estate and professional services, and in public administration, defence and other services (PADO) following the large front-loading of government expenditure in Q1. Despite some improvement, construction sector growth remained tepid due to transitory effects of the RERA and GST implementation. Growth in the trade, hotels, transport and communication sub-group remained resilient, in spite of some slowdown in growth in Q2 as compared with the previous quarter. On the expenditure side, the growth of gross fixed capital formation improved for the second successive quarter. However, growth in private final consumption expenditure  the mainstay of aggregate demand  slowed to an eight-quarter low in Q2. 23 has so far been marginally lagging behind the acreage sown during the comparable period of the previous year. Precipitation since October has remained at around 13 per cent below the long period average (LPA). Major reservoirs, the main source of irrigation during the rabi season, were at 64 per cent of the full reservoir level vis-a-vis 67 per cent in the previous year. On the positive side, pulses sowing increased significantly as compared with a year ago, partly reflecting the impact of lifting of the export ban for all varieties of pulses. Available high-frequency indicators suggest a mixed picture of industrial activity for Q3. Core industries' growth was flat in October as all constituents barring steel and fertilisers slowed down sequentially. Coal mining, which revived strongly in Q2, slowed down too, while cement production contracted. In contrast, the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing, which fell in October, rebounded in November, driven by output and new orders. Also, according to the Reserve Bank's Industrial Outlook Survey (IOS), production is expected to pick up in Q3 as order books are rising. Services sector activity has remained mixed in October. In the transportation sector, sales of commercial vehicles decelerated; those of passenger vehicles and two- wheeler turned into contraction mode. By contrast, domestic and international air passenger and freight traffic, and railway freight expanded robustly. The Reserve Bank's survey suggests that sentiments on service sector activity for Q3 are upbeat and auto sales have rebounded in November. On the other hand. PMI for services moved into contraction zone in November. Retail inflation measured by year-on-year change in the consumer price index (CPI) recorded a seven-month high in October, driven by a sharp uptick in momentum, tempered partly by some favourable base effects. Food inflation was volatile in the last two months  declining sharply in September and bouncing back in October  due mainly to vegetables and fruits. Milk and eggs inflation has shown an uptick, while pulses inflation remained negative for the eleventh successive month in October. Cereal inflation remained stable. Fuel group inflation, which has been on an upward trajectory since July, accelerated further due to a sharp pick-up in inflation in liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), kerosene, coke and electricity. CPI inflation excluding food and fuel, which increased from July to September, remained steady in October. This reflected the softening of petroleum product prices on account of the reversal of taxes on petroleum products by the central and state governments. However, there was a hardening of housing inflation following the implementation of higher house rent allowances for central government employees under the 7th central pay commission award. The Reserve Bank's survey of households showed inflation expectations firming up in the latest round for both three months ahead and one year ahead horizons. Farm and industrial raw material costs rose in October. Firms responding to the Reserve Bank's Industrial Outlook Survey expect to pass on the increase in input prices to their output prices. Turning to other costs, wage growth in the organised sector edged up, while rural wage growth weakened, particularly in agriculture. 3400 billion in October 2017 and further to 718 billion in November. The Reserve Bank conducted open market sales of 300 billion in October-November, taking the total absorption of durable liquidity during the financial year so far to 1.9 trillion, comprising 900 billion in the form of open market sales and 1 trillion of long-term treasury bills under the market stabilisation scheme. The weighted average call rate (WACR) traded 12 bps and 15 bps below the repo rate during October and November, respectively, as against 13 bps in September. Merchandise exports declined by 1.1 per cent in October 2017 after showing positive growth for 14 consecutive months. A sustained increase in exports of engineering goods, petroleum products and chemicals during the month was outweighed by a sharp fall in shipments of gems and jewellery, ready-made garments, and drugs and pharmaceuticals. Imports continued to expand, though at a modest pace. Although gold imports rose sequentially in October, they moderated from their level a year ago. Consequently, the trade deficit widened again in October. Despite moderation in September, net foreign direct investment in H1 of 2017-18 was at the same level as a year ago. With the announcement of the recapitalisation plan for public sector banks, foreign portfolio inflows into equities resumed sharply in October, after recording outflows in the preceding month. India's foreign exchange reserves were at US$ 401.94 billion on November 30, 2017. Outlook 15. The October bi-monthly statement projected inflation to rise and range between 4.2-4.6 per cent in the second half of this year, including the impact of increase in house rent allowance (HRA) by the Centre. The headline inflation outcomes have evolved broadly in line with projections. Going forward, the inflation path will be influenced by several factors. First, moderation in inflation excluding food and fuel observed in Q1 of 2017-18 has, by and large, reversed. There is a risk that this upward trajectory may continue in the near-term. Second, the impact of HRA by the Central Government is expected to peak in December. The staggered impact of HRA increases by various state governments may push up housing inflation further in 2018, with attendant second order effects. Third, the recent rise in international crude oil prices may sustain, especially on account of the OPEC's decision to maintain production cuts through next year. In such a scenario, any adverse supply shock due to geo-political developments could push up prices even further. Despite recent increase in prices of vegetables, some seasonal moderation is expected in near months as winter arrivals kick in. Prices of pulses have continued to show a downward bias. The GST Council in its last meeting has brought several retail goods and services to lower tax brackets, which should translate into lower retail prices, going forward. On the whole, inflation is estimated in 45 basis points, with risks evenly balanced (Chart 1). Turning to GVA projections. Q2 growth was lower than that projected in the October resolution. The recent increase in oil prices may have a negative impact on margins of firms and GVA growth. Shortfalls in kharif production and rabi sowing pose downside risks to the outlook for agriculture. On the positive side, there has been some pick up in credit growth in recent months. Recapitalisation of public sector banks may help improve credit flows further. While there has been weakness in some components of the services sector such as real estate, the Reserve Bank's survey indicates that the services and infrastructure sectors are expecting an improvement in demand, financial conditions and the overall business situation in Q4. Taking into account the above factors, the projection of real GVA growth for 2017-18 of the October resolution at 6.7 per cent has been retained, with risks evenly balanced (Chart 2). The MPC notes that the evolving trajectory needs to be carefully monitored. First, two of the key factors determining the cost of living conditions and inflation expectations, i.e., food and fuel inflation, edged up in November. Inflation expectations of households surveyed by the Reserve Bank have already firmed up and any increase in food and fuel prices may further harden these expectations. Second, rising input cost conditions as reflected in various surveys point towards higher risk of pass-through to retail prices in the near term. Third, implementation of farm loan waivers by select states, partial roll back of excise duty and VAT in the case of petroleum products, and decrease in revenue on account of reduction in GST rates for several goods and services may result in fiscal slippage with attendant implications for inflation. Fourth, global financial instability on account of the pace of/uncertainty over monetary policy normalisation in AEs and fiscal expansion in the US carry risks for inflation. The expected seasonal moderation in prices of vegetables, and fruits and the recent 56 and 7, 2018. Jose J. Kattoor Press Release: 2017-2018/1542 Chief General Manager 6."
Georgia,2017-12-13,"13.12.2017 NBG Increases Its Policy Rate by 0.25 Percentage Points to 7.25%. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on December 13, 2017 and decided to increase the refinancing rate by 25 basis points to 7.25 percent. According to the current forecast from the beginning of 2018, once the temporary factors will have petered out, the inflation will start decreasing. The nominal effective exchange rate has noticeably depreciated since the last meeting of the committee, increasing the inflation pressure relative to the previous forecast (such scenario was discussed in the Monetary Policy Report of November 2017). At the same time the market surveys of the past two months indicate the increase in inflation expectations, whereas the larger than expected improvement in economic activity decreased the downside pressure on inflation coming from demand-side. Based on the aforementioned, a monetary policy action is needed in order to reduce inflation in the medium term. At present the Committee decided to increase the policy rate by 25 basis point. The magnitude and duration of further monetary policy tightening will depend on how fast the pressure on prices coming from the nominal effective exchange rate will decrease. The annual inflation in November was 6.9%, which, among other factors, was caused by the approximately 40% increase in global oil prices in the second half of the year. The effect of one-time factors, including the increase in excise taxes, on the inflation rate is around 3 percentage points. Once the impact of these factors has faded out, ceteris paribus the inflation is expected to decrease in the beginning of 2018. The economic growth indicators show the improvement in the demand. The preliminary estimate of the economic growth in October is 5.7%, whereas the growth in the first ten months of the year is 4.9%, exceeding the growth forecast of the National Bank of Georgia. The positive dynamics is observed in the goods export and tourism and the remittances from abroad have increased as well. However the goods import growth rate has also increased in the recent months. Despite this growth in imports, the significant improvement in the current account deficit is expected compared to the previous year. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will use all means and instruments at its disposal in order to ensure the price stability. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on January 31, 2018."
Philippines,2017-12-13,"At its last meeting on monetary policy for 2017, the Monetary Board decided today to maintain the interest rate on the BSP's overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) facility at 3.0 percent. The corresponding interest rates on the overnight lending and deposit facilities were also kept steady. The reserve requirement ratios were likewise left unchanged. The Monetary Board's decision is based on its assessment that the outlook for the inflation environment has been broadly unchanged. This is indicated by the latest baseline forecasts remaining within the target range of 3.0 percent Â± 1 percentage point for 2018-2019. Inflation expectations also continue to be firmly anchored to the target over the policy horizon. At the same time, the overall balance of risks to the inflation outlook remains tilted toward the upside due in part to possible higher crude oil prices. While there may be potential transitory effects on consumer prices from the proposed tax reform program, various mitigation measures and the resulting improvement in output and productivity are also expected to temper the impact on inflation over the medium term. Meanwhile, the proposed reforms in the rice industry involving the replacement of quantitative restrictions with tariffs and the deregulation of rice imports could serve to reduce inflation. The Monetary Board also observed that geopolitical tensions and lingering uncertainty over macroeconomic policies in advanced economies continue to pose downside risks to the near-term prospects for global economic growth. Nonetheless, the Monetary Board emphasized that prospects for domestic economic activity are likely to remain firm owing to buoyant consumer and business sentiment and ample liquidity. Moreover, as credit continues to expand in line with output growth, the Monetary Board remains watchful over evolving liquidity and credit conditions and their implications for price and financial stability. Based on these considerations, the Monetary Board believes that prevailing monetary policy settings should be kept. Nevertheless, the BSP will remain vigilant against any risks to the inflation outlook and will adjust its policy settings as needed to ensure that future inflation remains consistent with the medium-term target while being supportive of sustainable economic growth."
United States,2017-12-13,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in November indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a solid rate. Averaging through hurricane-related fluctuations, job gains have been solid, and the unemployment rate declined further. Household spending has been expanding at a moderate rate, and growth in business fixed investment has picked up in recent quarters. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have declined this year and are running below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. Hurricane-related disruptions and rebuilding have affected economic activity, employment, and inflation in recent months but have not materially altered the outlook for the national economy. Consequently, the Committee continues to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will remain strong. Inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to remain somewhat below 2 percent in the near term but to stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were Janet L Yellen. Chair; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Lael Brainard; Patrick Harker; Robert S Kaplan; Jerome H Powell; and Randal K Quarles. Voting against the action were Charles L Evans and Neel Kashkari, who preferred at this meeting to maintain the existing target range for the federal funds rate.

Chile,2017-12-14,"Thursday, 14 December 2017 Monetary Policy Meeting  December 2017 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to keep the monetary policy interest rate at 2.5%. On the external front, activity figures in the developed world continue to point to a synchronized recovery, although inflation rates that reamin low. Monetary policies have evolved as expected. In this context global financial conditions show no major changes. Commodity prices have evolved along dissimilar paths. The copper price, with ups and downs, is a little below its month-ago level. At home, in November the CPI rose 0.1%, keeping annual inflation at 1.9%. Meanwhile, the CPIEFE dropped 0.1% to 1.8% in annual terms. Inflation expectations stayed fairly unchanged. Activity and demand data for the beginning of the fourth quarter are in line with the Monetary Policy Report's baseline scenario and continue to reflect the weak activity of non-mining industries and particularly of sectors relating to construction investment. Expectations of consumers and business are stable. The labor market continues to show dynamism of self-employment and weakness of salaried work. The peso and other financial variables have shown important movements in the last month. Economic data made available after the December Report are consistent with the baseline scenario. However, the risks of a delay in the convergence of inflation associated to its current persistently low level are still present, so, if deemed necessary, the Board will promptly adjust the monetary impulse. Accordingly, it reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the two-year horizon. ___ * The Spanish original prevails."
Colombia,2017-12-14,"The Board of Directors of Banco de la Republica, during its session today, decided to maintain the intervention interest rate at 4.75%. In making this decision, the board primarily considered the following aspects. In November, inflation increased more than expected and stood at 4.12%. With the exception of the regulated items group, all the large CPI components registered somewhat higher annual variations than projected. The average of the four core inflation indicators stopped descending and stood at 4.54%. Inflation expectations registered slight changes. Analysts=C2=B4 expectations for December of 2017 and of 2018, on average, stand at 4.01% and 3.46%, respectively. Those derived from public debt bonds remain above 3.0%. The direct effects of the strong transitory supply shocks that diverted annual inflation from its target have been diluted. The effects of indexation of prices and the increase of indirect taxes from the beginning of the year are expected to diminish, and with that, inflation and the core inflation indicators to converge towards the target. The current account has continued its gradual and orderly adjustment. For the third quarter the current account deficit was 3.4% of GDP. External demand continues recovering, driven mainly by developed economies. Oil prices are maintaining levels above the averages registered in the last two years. Should this trend continue, the terms of trade would keep improving, and along with the greater dynamics expected from external demand, these would continue favoring the recovery of the country=C2=B4s external income. In the United States, the Fed increased its policy interest rate. In Colombia, one of the risk rating agencies reduced the sovereign debt credit rating. Neither of these decisions has had significant effects on the country=C2=B4s risk measures, the TES interest rates or the exchange rate. The country=C2=B4s economic activity remains weak. Further, new data confirm the persistence of the economic growth below the potential, reason why the underutilization of the installed capacity of the economy is expected to continue expanding. The Board of Directors noted that the risk balance is similar to that considered in the previous meeting and highlighted that, with the reductions undertaken in previous months, the space to continue lowering the benchmark interest rate has been reduced. As a result, the board deemed it appropriate to wait for more information and maintain the benchmark interest rate unaltered at 4.75%. The decision to maintain the interest at 4.75% was unanimous."
Euroarea,2017-12-14,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup. Mr Dijsselbloem, and by the Commission Vice-President. Mr Dombrovskis. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We continue to expect them to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases. Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, we confirm that from January 2018 we intend to continue to make net asset purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP), at a monthly pace of â‚¬30 billion, until the end of September 2018, or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim. If the outlook becomes less favourable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, we stand ready to increase the APP in terms of size and/or duration. The Eurosystem will reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time after the end of its net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary. This will contribute both to favourable liquidity conditions and to an appropriate monetary policy stance. Our monetary policy decisions have preserved the very favourable financing conditions that are still needed for a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2%. The incoming information, including our new staff projections, indicates a strong pace of economic expansion and a significant improvement in the growth outlook. The strong cyclical momentum and the significant reduction of economic slack give grounds for greater confidence that inflation will converge towards our inflation aim. At the same time, domestic price pressures remain muted overall and have yet to show convincing signs of a sustained upward trend. An ample degree of monetary stimulus therefore remains necessary for underlying inflation pressures to continue to build up and support headline inflation developments over the medium term. This continued monetary support is provided by the additional net asset purchases that we decided on at our October monetary policy meeting, by the sizeable stock of acquired assets and the forthcoming reinvestments, and by our forward guidance on interest rates. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. The economic expansion in the euro area continued in the third quarter of 2017, when real GDP increased by 0.6% quarter on quarter, after 0.7% in the second quarter. The latest data and survey results point to solid and broad-based growth momentum. Our monetary policy measures, which have facilitated the deleveraging process, continue to support domestic demand. Private consumption is underpinned by ongoing employment gains, which are also benefiting from past labour market reforms, and by rising household wealth. Business investment continues to strengthen on the back of very favourable financing conditions, rising corporate profitability and strengthening demand. Housing investment has also risen further over recent quarters. In addition, euro area exports are being supported by the broad-based global expansion. This assessment is broadly reflected in the December 2017 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area. Compared with the September 2017 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for real GDP growth has been revised up substantially. Risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain broadly balanced. On the one hand, the strong cyclical momentum, underpinned by continued positive developments in sentiment indicators, could lead to further positive growth surprises in the near term. On the other hand, downside risks continue to relate primarily to global factors and developments in foreign exchange markets. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.5% in November, up from 1.4% in October. At the same time, measures of underlying inflation have moderated somewhat recently, in part owing to special factors. Looking ahead, on the basis of current futures prices for oil, annual rates of headline inflation are likely to moderate in the coming months, mainly reflecting base effects in energy prices, before increasing again. Underlying inflation is expected to rise gradually over the medium term, supported by our monetary policy measures, the continuing economic expansion, the corresponding absorption of economic slack and rising wage growth. This assessment is also broadly reflected in the December 2017 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation at 1.5% in 2017, 1.4% in 2018, 1.5% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020. Compared with the September 2017 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the outlook for headline HICP inflation has been revised up, mainly reflecting higher oil and food prices. Turning to the monetary analysis, broad money (M3) continues to expand at a robust pace, with an annual rate of growth of 5.0% in October 2017, from 5.2% in September, reflecting the impact of the ECB's monetary policy measures and the low opportunity cost of holding the most liquid deposits. Accordingly, the narrow monetary aggregate M1 continued to be the main contributor to broad money growth, expanding at an annual rate of 9.4% in October, after 9.8% in September. The recovery in the growth of loans to the private sector observed since the beginning of 2014 is proceeding. The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations increased to 2.9% in October 2017, after 2.4% in September, while the annual growth rate of loans to households remained stable at 2.7%. The pass-through of the monetary policy measures put in place since June 2014 continues to significantly support borrowing conditions for firms and households, access to financing â€’ notably for small and medium-sized enterprises â€’ and credit flows across the euro area. To sum up, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with the signals coming from the monetary analysis confirmed the need for an ample degree of monetary accommodation to secure a sustained return of inflation rates towards levels that are below, but close to, 2%. In order to reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute decisively to strengthening the longer-term growth potential and reducing vulnerabilities. The implementation of structural reforms in all euro area countries needs to be substantially stepped up to increase resilience, reduce structural unemployment and boost euro area productivity and growth potential. Regarding fiscal policies, the increasingly solid and broad-based expansion strengthens the case for rebuilding fiscal buffers. This is particularly important in countries where government debt remains high. All countries would benefit from intensifying efforts towards achieving a more growth-friendly composition of public finances. A full, transparent and consistent implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact and of the macroeconomic imbalance procedure over time and across countries remains essential to increase the resilience of the euro area economy. The Governing Council welcomes the ongoing discussions on completing the banking union and the capital markets union, and on further enhancing the institutional architecture of our Economic and Monetary Union."
Turkiye,2017-12-14,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term interest rates at the following levels:. a) Overnight Interest Rates: Marginal Funding Rate has been kept at 9.25 percent and borrowing rate has been kept at 7.25 percent, b) One-week repo rate has been kept at 8 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent, while lending rate has been increased from 12.25 percent to 12.75 percent. During year 2017, aggregate demand conditions have displayed a strong course and credit has shown rapid growth. Recently released data indicate that economic activity maintains its strength. Domestic demand conditions keep improving and external demand continues to contribute positively to exports. Current elevated levels of inflation and recent developments in cost factors have increased the risks on expectations and the pricing behavior. Accordingly, the Committee decided to tighten the monetary policy stance. The Central Bank will continue to use all available instruments in pursuit of the price stability objective. Tight stance in monetary policy will be maintained decisively until inflation outlook displays a significant improvement and becomes consistent with the targets. Inflation expectations, pricing behavior and other factors affecting inflation will be closely monitored and, if needed, further monetary tightening will be delivered. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Ukraine,2017-12-14,"The Board of the National Bank of Ukraine has decided to hike its key policy rate to 14.5% per annum, effective from 15 December 2017. In light of heightened inflation risks, the tightening of monetary policy is necessary to bring inflation down to its target in the mid-term. Over the past two months headline inflation rates were declining, although at a slower pace than the NBU has projected. In November 2017, headline inflation stood at 13.6%. The deviation of inflation from its target has been driven by faster than expected rates of core inflation due to higher production costs and buyoant consumer demand, as well as higher than expected growth rates of prices for raw foods and fuels. Headline inflation slowed down mostly due to exhaustion of the factors which were drivers behind a steep mid-year increase in prices for raw foods in the middle of the year, namely, of milk, meat and vegetables. Prices of highly processed foods went up much higher than expected due to increased prices for respective raw foods in previous months. Moreover, prices for services were increasing at a faster pace driven by rising production costs and buoyant consumer demand. Against this background, core inflation accelerated to 8.6% reflecting the strengthening of underlying pressure on consumer prices. Fuel prices also grew bolstered by higher global oil prices and depreciation of the hryvnia against the euro (as fuel excise taxes are set in euro). Less than prompt decline in inflation shows a more significant deviation of inflation from its target by the end of 2017 than has been earlier projected. Moreover, since the previous decision on key policy rate and the publication of the recent NBU's macroeconomic forecast, risks that may restrain a decline in inflation next year have become more likely to materialize. State budget spending in 2018 is planned at a significantly higher level than that on which the NBU's October forecast has been based. Social standards may also be raised further, which may propel both household consumer demand and costs of products and services. Risks of postponing the disbursement of the next IMF tranche under the EFF program have increased. Growing raw food prices may further exert a significant impact on highly processed food prices, as was the case in the second half of 2017. The global economic growth may prove more significant than previously estimated, which may stimulate labor migration that may further translate into growing wages. These factors have contributed to the deterioration of inflation expectations, mainly of businesses and households, in recent months. When making its key rate decision in October 2017, the NBU Board said that it might raise the key policy rate further if these risks materialized. In view if the need to offset the influence of these risks and to bring the inflation rate back to the target, the NBU has decided to hike the key policy rate to 14.5% per annum. The NBU Board is convinced that achieving price stability is a precondition for sustainable economic growth. In particular, a sustained improvement in inflation expectations is the main factor of an interest rate cut in the mid-term. If fundamental inflation risks increase further, the NBU may resort to further key rate hikes to bring inflation back to the target range. The next key rate decision, which will be taken in January 2018, will factor in new macroeconomic projections, inflation projections in particular. The decision to raise the key policy rate to 14.5% has been approved by NBU Board Key Policy rate Decision No. 793-D, dated 14 December 2017. The next meeting of the NBU Board on monetary policy issues will be held on 25 January 2018 as scheduled."
Peru,2017-12-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR DECEMBER 2017 BCRP MAINTAINED THE POLICY INTEREST RATE AT 3.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 3.25 percent. This decision takes into account the following factors: Inflation in November continued decreasing within the inflation target range due to the reversal of supply shocks. Inflation is projected to continue declining in the next months and to converge thereafter to 2.0 percent by the end of 2018. Moreover, the measurements of inflation trends continue decreasing and are expected to remain within the target range in 2017 and 2018; Expectations of inflation in 12 months fell within the target range and are forecast to continue declining in the following months to 2.0 percent; Economic activity is showing a faster pace of growth as a result of increased public and private expenditure, although it continues to be below its potential growth level, and The world economy continues recovering gradually, although there is some uncertainty associated with an eventual reversal of monetary stimulus in the advanced economies. The Board gives close attention to new data on inflation and inflation determinants to consider the convenience of making additional adjustments in the Central Bank's monetary policy stance should it be necessary. Recent indicators of inflation and activity reflect the following: Inflation in November recorded a rate of -0.20 percent, as a result of which the year-to- year rate of inflation fell from 2.04 percent in October to 1.54 percent in November. Inflation without food and energy showed a rate of 0.03 percent, as a result of which the year-to-year rate fell from 2.35 percent in October to 2.23 percent in November, also within the target range. The indicators of business expectations remain on the optimistic side, although economic growth remains below its potential level. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between BCRP and the financial system, as specified below: Overnight deposits: 2.00 percent. Direct repos and rediscount operations: 3.80 percent for the first 15 operations carried out by a financial institution in the last 12 months, and the interest rate set by the Committee of Monetary and Foreign Exchange Operations for additional operations to the 15 first operations carried out in the last 12 months. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 3.80 percent. The Monetary Program for the following 12 months will be approved on the Board meetings to be held on the following dates: January 11 February 8 March 8 April 12 May 10 June 7 July 12 August 9 September 13 October 11 November 8 December 13 Moreover, in 2018 BCRP will publish its Inflation Reports on the following dates: March 23 June 15 September 21 December 21."
Russia,2017-12-15,"On 15 December 2017, the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to cut the key rate from 8.25% to 7.75% per annum. Inflation holds at 2.5% and will gradually draw near 4% by late 2018. The extension of the agreement to reduce oil production brings pro-inflationary risks down over a one-year horizon. In recognition of this, the Bank of Russia cut its key rate by 50 basis points. Medium-term pro-inflationary risks still prevail over the risks of inflation's sustainable deviation downward from the target. The Bank of Russia will continue its gradual transition from moderately tight to neutral monetary policy. Moving forward, the Bank of Russia's key rate decisions will be based on its assessment of the balance of risks of inflation's material and sustainable deviation in either direction from the target, as well as the dynamics of economic activity against the forecast. The Bank of Russia holds open the prospect of some key rate reduction in the first half of 2018. In making its key rate decision, the Bank of Russia recognised the following factors. Inflation dynamics. Under the impact of temporary factors annual inflation holds below 3%. It is estimated at 2.5% as of 11 December 2017. In 2017 Q4, increased supply of farm produce on the back of growing crop productivity and the shortage of long-term storage facilities continued to exert a downward pressure on consumer price growth. As a result, annual food inflation fell to 1.1% in November 2017. The majority of factors associated with the 2017 harvest will cease to have a disinflationary influence in the first half of 2018. The contribution of the exchange rate dynamics to annual inflation slowdown diminishes and will be exhausted in 2018 Q1. Annual growth in prices of non-food products, which stood at 2.7% in November, is observed to decline, while services prices went up by 4.2% over the year. According to Bank of Russia estimates, the majority of annual inflation indicators reflecting the most sustainable price movements are somewhat below 4%. The slowdown of inflation was conducive to a decline in inflation expectations, which nevertheless remains unstable and uneven. The anchoring of inflation close to 4% will require both further decrease in inflation expectations and making them less susceptible to price changes. Annual inflation is expected to be under 3% in late 2017 and come close to 4% by late 2018 as the impact of temporary factors is exhausted. Monetary conditions. The key rate decision and the potential for its decrease in the future will contribute to further easing of monetary conditions, thus creating prerequisites for inflation to approach 4%. While nominal bank rates keep declining, real bank rates remain in the positive territory. Non-price lending conditions are gradually becoming looser for the most reliable borrowers but are still restrictive. In the course of the transition to neutral monetary policy, the shape of the yield curve will continue to change from inverted to normal. Given the situation, the potential for lowering the short-term rates is greater than for the long-term ones. The current conditions continue to encourage savings and ensure that consumption growth is balanced. These trends will persist amid further gradual easing of the monetary policy and low risk appetite of lenders and borrowers. Economic activity. According to Bank of Russia estimates, at the end of 2017, the economy's growth rate will be close to the potential at 1.7-2.2%. Therefore, monetary conditions generate low inflationary pressure without restricting economic growth. Although October saw inconsistent trends in the dynamics of economic activity, producer sentiment remains at a relatively high level. It will be further supported by growing domestic demand amid higher real wages as well as by the recovery of the global economy. Unemployment does not generate any excessive inflationary pressure. In view of the extension of the agreement to reduce oil production, the Bank of Russia has raised its GDP growth forecast for 2018 in comparison to the previous baseline scenario. However, the medium-term prospects of the Russian economy saw no changes. Over the forecast horizon, economic growth will not exceed 1.5-2.0%, which corresponds to the current estimates of its potential level. Inflation risks. Depending on the situation, a number of factors may cause inflation to deviate from the target both upwards and downwards. They include the dynamics of food and oil prices, which are characterised by high volatility. The fiscal rule will set off the impact of the oil market conditions on inflation and the domestic economic environment as a whole. At the same time, certain factors generate mostly pro-inflationary risks: this includes the situation in the labour market, potential changes in the consumer behaviour, and the nature of inflation expectations. The extension of the agreement between oil-exporting countries lowers the uncertainty of energy prices' dynamics and related pro-inflationary risks over a one-year horizon. However, the risks of upward deviation of inflation from the forecast in the medium term still prevail. First, increased structural labour shortage may cause labour productivity growth to considerably lag behind wage growth. Second, inflationary pressure may stem from changes in households' behaviour as the propensity to save becomes much lower. Third, inflation expectations remain elevated and subject to fluctuations caused by movements in prices of certain goods and services and the exchange rate. Besides, the medium-term balance of risks for inflation dynamics will depend on potential budgetary and tariff decisions in 20192020. The Bank of Russia will also monitor risks posed by external factors all over the forecast horizon. Moving forward, the Bank of Russia's key rate decisions will be based on its assessment of the balance of risks of inflation's material and sustainable deviation in either direction from the target, as well as the dynamics of economic activity against the forecast. The Bank of Russia will continue its gradual transition from moderately tight to neutral monetary policy and holds open the prospect of some key rate reduction in the first half of 2018. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors will hold its next rate review meeting on 9 February 2018. The Board decision press release is to be published at 13:30 Moscow time. (% p.a.).

Hungary,2017-12-19,"At its meeting on 19 December 2017, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and decided on the following structure of central bank interest rates with effect from 20 December 2017:. In the Council's assessment, in parallel with the pick-up in domestic demand Hungarian economic output is close to its potential level. Growth of the Hungarian economy will continue to be dynamic in 2018, then it will slow down. The inflation target is expected to be achieved in a sustainable manner by the middle of 2019. In November 2017, inflation stood at 2.5 percent and core inflation at 2.7 percent. In the autumn months, inflation was basically in line with the September Inflation Report projection; however, core inflation fell short of the forecast. The difference was mainly attributable to the price dynamics of market services. The Bank's measures of underlying inflation remained unchanged compared with the summer months and continued to be significantly below core inflation. The expansion in domestic employment, the tight labour market as well as increases in the minimum wage and the guaranteed minimum wage have led to a general, dynamic rise in whole-economy wages. The upward effect of this on costs is being offset by the reduction in employers' social contributions and in the corporate income tax rate early this year. In line with the Bank's expectations, there has still not yet been any significant upward pressure on inflation from wages. In the euro area, underlying inflation will continue to be moderate in the coming years as well. According to our current projection, following a temporary rise in November, the consumer price index is likely to decline again to close to 2 per cent at the end of 2017, then in the first months of 2018 it will level off at the bottom edge of the tolerance band. Over the medium term the second-round effects resulting from buoyant domestic demand, increase in wage costs, as well as higher commodity prices will point to the increase in domestic core inflation. However, moderate external inflation and inflation expectations stabilising at historically low levels, as well as subsequent reductions in employers' social contributions, the VAT rate cuts, announced for next year, are slowing the rise in prices. In our projection, the inflation target can be achieved sustainably by the middle of 2019. The Hungarian economy grew by 3.9 percent in the third quarter of 2017. Industrial production and the volume of retail sales picked up in October. Labour demand remained strong: employment was close to historically high levels in August-October 2017. Looking ahead, the general strengthening of domestic demand will continue to play a central role in economic growth. Robust growth in construction and the expansion in the performance of the service sector are likely to continue in the coming months. Hungary's current account surplus is expected to fall in 2017-2018, driven by rising domestic demand. Economic growth this year will also be supported by the fiscal budget and the stimulating effects on investment of European Union funding. In the Council's assessment. GDP growth will approach 4 per cent in 2017 and 2018, then it will slow down from 2019 onwards according to the current projection. The Bank's and the Government's stimulating measures contribute substantially to economic growth. Sentiment in international financial markets has, on the whole, been positive in the period since the Council's previous interest rate decision. News of negotiations between the EU and the United Kingdom, favourable projections for global growth and the European political events were the main factors influencing investors' appetite for risk. In December, the Fed decided to further increase the base rate; however, market prices suggested no major change in interest rate expectations. Looking ahead, the European Central Bank is likely to maintain loose monetary conditions for an extended period. Investors' perceptions about the Central and Eastern European region continue to be positive. Due to the different inflation paths expected in the countries of the region and the different characteristics of inflation targeting regimes, market prices suggest that the timing of central bank actions will differ. Yields in the domestic money and capital markets declined to their historic low. Short-term yields are at a level close to or below zero. The liquidity crowded out due to the introduction of an upper limit on the stock of three-month deposits, the reduction in the overnight central bank deposit rate, as well as the increase in the size and the average original maturity of the stock of central bank swap instruments providing forint liquidity have had a marked influence on short-term yields. Long-term yields have decreased significantly in the last three months, which is mostly the result of the MNB's forward guidance and the announcement of the central bank interest rate swap instruments and the mortgage bond purchase programme in November. The Hungarian yield curve shifted downwards markedly in a regional comparison as well; however, it is still steep in international comparison. In the Council's assessment, maintaining the loose monetary conditions for an extended period are necessary to achieve the inflation target in a sustainable manner. To this end, the Monetary Council maintained the base rate, the overnight collateralised lending rate, the one-week collateralised lending rate at 0.9 per cent, and the overnight deposit rate at -0.15 per cent. In the Council's assessment, the gradual limitation on the stock of three-month deposits has fulfilled its role and the HUF 75 billion year-end upper limit on the stock will not be reduced further. In line with maintaining monetary conditions, the Council set a HUF 400-600 billion band for the targeted average liquidity crowded-out for the first quarter of 2018, which is equal to that of the fourth quarter of 2017. On the next occasion, the Council will decide on the amount of liquidity crowded out in March 2018 and will adjust the stock of central bank swap instruments accordingly. The Council's aim is that the loose monetary conditions have their effect not only at the short but also at the longer end of the yield curve. To ensure this, in November, the Council decided to introduce two unconventional instruments from January 2018, which will constitute an integral part of the Bank's set of monetary policy instruments. In harmony with the Council's forward guidance the new instruments contribute efficiently to the maintenance of loose monetary conditions over a prolonged period. Accordingly, the Council will introduce unconditional interest rate swap (IRS) facilities with five and ten-year maturities, the maximum allotted amount of which has been set at HUF 300 billion for the first quarter of 2018. In addition, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank will launch a targeted programme aimed at purchasing mortgage bonds with maturities of three years or more. The Council expects an increase in mortgage bond issuance and an improvement of market activity due to the measure. The maximum allotted amount for the security purchase programme amounts to 50 per cent of the ever-prevailing mortgage-bond stock on the market. Both programmes will contribute to an increase in the share of loans with long periods of interest rate fixation, thereby improving financial stability. After several rounds of consultation with banks, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank will make a decision on the operational details of the programmes until 22 December 2017, and will inform market participants about this in a release. The inflation target is expected to be achieved in a sustainable manner by the middle of 2019. In the Council's assessment, maintaining the base rate and the loose monetary conditions at both short and long ends for an extended period is necessary to achieve the inflation target in a sustainable manner. The Council will closely monitor developments in monetary conditions and will ensure the persistence of loose monetary conditions over a prolonged period by using the extended set of monetary policy instruments."
Thailand,2017-12-20,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision 8/2017 Mr. Jaturong Jantarangs. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 20 December 2017 as follows. The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 150 percent. One MPC member was unable to attend this meeting. In deliberating their policy decision, the Committee assessed that the Thai economy gained further traction and would achieve faster growth than the previous assessment, driven by growth in the external sector as well as the gradual recovery in domestic demand. Headline inflation was still projected to rise at gradual pace as previously assessed. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative and conducive to economic growth. Financial stability remained sound overall, but there were pockets of risks that might lead to the build-up of vulnerabilities in the financial system going forward. The Committee viewed that the current accommodative monetary policy stance remained conducive to the continuation of economic growth and should foster the return of headline inflation to target, although the process could take some time. Thus the Committee decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at this meeting. The Thai economy as a whole was projected to achieve higher growth than previously assessed on account of continued improvements in merchandise exports and tourism that were driven by a stronger global economic recovery. Private consumption continued to expand albeit at a gradual pace, given that improvements in income growth were not yet sufficiently broad-based and that household debt remained high. Private investment in machinery and equipment continued to pick up. Meanwhile public expenditure remained an important growth driver despite some delayed disbursement for investment spending. Nevertheless Thailand's growth outlook was still subject to risks that warranted close monitoring, namely uncertainties pertaining to US economic and foreign trade policies as well as geopolitical risks. Headline inflation edged up on account of rising energy prices. Meanwhile demand- pull inflationary pressures picked up somewhat but remained low overall. In addition, structural changes also contributed to more persistent inflation than in the past. On the whole, headline inflation was projected to slowly rise from the recovery in domestic demand. Overall financial conditions remained accommodative and conducive to economic growth with ample liquidity in the financial system as well as low government bond yields and real interest rates. Such conditions allowed financing by the private sector to continue expanding, with recent improvements seen in credits extended to SMEs across business sectors. On exchange rates, the baht's movements relative to those of trading partner currencies were largely unchanged. In the period ahead, exchange rates might experience high volatilities due to uncertainties on the external front. Thus the Committee would continue to closely monitor developments in the foreign exchange market. The Committee viewed that financial stability remained sound but would continue to monitor pockets of risks that might pose vulnerabilities to financial stability in the future. These included, in particular, the search-for-yield behavior in the prolonged low interest rate environment that might lead to underpricing of risks, and the deterioration in debt 2 serviceability of households and SMEs especially those affected by changes in structural factors and business models. Looking ahead. Thailand's growth outlook improved further particularly on the back of external demand while the strength of the domestic demand recovery and inflation developments must be monitored. Hence the Committee viewed that monetary policy should remain accommodative and would stand ready to utilize available policy tools to sustain economic growth while also ensuring financial stability."
Czech Republic,2017-12-21,"<At its meeting today, the Bank Board of the Czech National Bank left interest rates unchanged. The two-week repo rate thus remains at 0.50%, the discount rate at 0.05% and the Lombard rate at 1%. Five members voted in favour of this decision. Two members voted for raising the two-week repo rate to 0.75%.. According to the current forecast, inflation will stay above the 2% target for most of 2018. It will then return to the target at the monetary policy horizon, i.e. in late 2018 and early 2019. Following the November rise in interest rates, a continued increase in domestic market interest rates towards their assumed long-run level of 3% is consistent with the forecast. The rates are expected to approach this level at the end of 2019. The Bank Board assessed the risks to the current inflation forecast as being balanced and insignificant. The outlook for growth in foreign economic activity this year and the next has increased compared to the assumption of the current forecast. This shift, coupled with a higher oil price outlook, has led to an upward revision of expected producer price inflation in the euro area this year and the next. By contrast, the increase in producer prices expected for 2019 has declined. The outlook for euro interest rates has shifted slightly lower in reaction to the European Central Bank's October decision to extend the asset purchase programme. The market outlook for Brent crude oil prices has increased compared to the forecast assumptions as a result of the extension of the agreement of oil producers to curb production until 2018. The outlook for the euro-dollar exchange rate is almost unchanged. In Q4 so far, domestic inflation has been in the upper half of the tolerance band around the Czech National Bank's 2% target. In October and November, the inflation forecast materialised in terms of both the recorded figures and their structure. Core inflation and food prices are still the biggest contributors to inflation. The annual growth of the Czech economy accelerated further to 5% in Q3, also in line with the forecast. All expenditure components contributed to the rise in domestic economic activity, in particular household consumption. Its continued robust increase reflects solid wage growth and ongoing employment growth. A higher contribution of investment, especially in machinery and equipment, was also recorded. This may have a favourable effect on future productivity growth. According to monthly indicators, industrial production and retail sales continued to rise apace. In addition, construction output recorded a slight recovery. The previous long-running decrease in civil engineering output dissipated. The economic sentiment of both households and corporations remains high. These indicators suggest continued robust economic growth at the close of this year. Labour market indicators remain very strong. Employment rose further in Q3 in connection with the ongoing increase in labour demand. Unemployment continued to fall to new historical lows. In Q4 so far, the same has been true of the share of unemployed persons. A shortage of available labour force coupled with high labour demand led to a further sizeable increase in job vacancies. However, the increase in average wages moderated somewhat compared to the previous quarter. To sum up the important facts about recent developments in the Czech economy. GDP growth in Q3 and inflation in both October and November were in line with the forecast. The share of unemployed persons in Q4 so far has also been very close to the forecast. By contrast, the average wage rose more slowly in Q3 compared to the forecast."
Thailand,2017-12-22,"Summary Conclusion of the Joint Meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) and the Financial Institutions Policy Committee (FIPC) on 18 December 2017 The Bank of Thailand announced the summary conclusion of the joint meeting of the MPC and the FIPC on 18 December 2017 to assess the risks to Thailand's financial stability as follows. The committees concluded that Thailand's overall financial stability remained sound, based on risk assessments in two key areas. First on recent developments in Thailand's economic recovery and their implications on financial stability, the committees assessed that financial stability risks have moderated from the previous assessment, as economic growth gained traction and helped improve businesses' overall financial health. Nonetheless debt serviceability of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and households, as well as excess supply of real estate in certain areas, need to be monitored going forward. Second the search-for-yield behavior was assessed to continue in the prolonged low interest rate environment. This could lead to underpricing of risks, as reflected in high volume of investment in foreign investment funds (FIFs), which exhibited a substantial degree of concentration in some countries. The search for yield was also reflected in saving cooperatives' assets that continued to grow at a high rate, though decelerating mildly from the previous assessment. Thailand's financial stability remained sound overall. Continued global and domestic recovery helped strengthen businesses' overall financial health, particularly for large corporates; at the same time, commercial banks and insurance companies maintained high capital buffers. Thailand's external financial stability remained solid, supported by high level of international reserves, low external debts, and continued current account surplus. These positive factors could provide cushion for uncertainties from macro-financial conditions abroad, which could heighten in the periods ahead. Despite clearer signs of domestic recovery, debt serviceability continued to deteriorate for certain business sectors and SMEs. This, in part, reflected these businesses' competitiveness issues due to both structural challenges and changes in business models. For the real estate sector, excess supply of condominiums remained in some areas, while office and retail space supply could pick up in the periods ahead due to new mixed-use development projects. In the recent periods, households remained fragile due to debt burden that was elevated compared to households' income and financial assets, despite some deceleration in debt accumulation. In light of this, the Bank of Thailand enhanced regulations on credit card and personal loan under supervision, and also initiated the setup of the Debt Clinic, in an attempt to ensure that household debts would no longer be impinging on financial stability going forward. The search-for-yield behavior remained, which could potentially lead to underpricing of risks. Investment in risky assets continued to increase, with high volume of investment in FIFs. While most FIFs invested primarily in countries with investment-grade sovereign credit ratings, their investment was concentrated in some countries. On the other hand, recent corporate debt defaults by certain issuers resulted in a slowdown in new issuances of debt securities, particularly unrated bonds. This partly reflected investors' heightened risk awareness and caution. The Office of the Securities and Exchange Commission continues to monitor the situation closely and is currently in the process of enhancing related regulations. These improvements include revising regulations on the issuances and sales of debt securities and strengthening the operational standards of arrangers, with an aim to ensure that investors are well protected and their investment decisions are suitable with their risk appetite. Saving cooperatives continued to be a venue for the search-for-yield behavior. Growth in deposits remained elevated, despite some deceleration in the recent periods. Moreover during the periods when deposits grew faster than loans, some cooperatives invested more of their surplus liquidity in risky assets. Although some progress has been made on the implementation of the cooperatives' prudential measures, further enhancements of the supervisory framework would be needed to ensure proper risk management, corporate governance, as well as alignment with the underlying philosophy of cooperatives. In the periods ahead. Thailand's financial system could still face several risk factors. Chief among them are uncertainties in G3 countries' macro-financial policies, risks to China's financial and macroeconomic stability, geopolitical risks as well as uneven domestic economic recovery. Close monitoring is warranted for debt serviceability of SMEs as well as low income households, and excess supply of real estate in certain areas. Furthermore the committees will continue to monitor search-for-yield behavior, which could potentially lead to widespread underpricing of risks. This could also include underpricing of risks associated with large business conglomerates' funding and investment activities. The relevant regulators, including the Bank of Thailand, the Office of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Office of Insurance Commission have together been assessing and monitoring financial stability risks on a regular basis. The three regulators have also been enhancing and enforcing regulations to cope with and mitigate emerging risks appropriately. These efforts are aimed at preventing the build-up of vulnerabilities that could potentially affect Thailand's overall financial stability."
Armenia,2017-12-26,"PRESS RELEASE 26.12.2017 At the December 26th of 2017 meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Armenia decided to leave the refinancing rate unchanged, at the level of 6.0%. There was 2.0% inflation in November of 2017 against that of 1.0% registered in the same month of the previous year. During the month, the 12â€month inflation rate accelerated and it amounted to 2.2% at the end of the month. The CBA Board anticipates that by the end of year 2017 the 12â€month inflation rate will be within the lower bound of the confidence band, as was expected. Actual developments in the external environment have been largely in line with the CBA's predictions, that is, the global economic growth kept on improving and inflationary patterns in world commodity markets persisted. In view of such developments, the CBA Board further anticipates certain inflationary effects from the external sector, as external demand recovers. The CBA Board notes that in the period Januaryâ€September of 2017, relative to the same period of the previous year, economic growth has been close to the prediction. In the meantime, the economic activity indicator for Januaryâ€November has been well beyond expectations, driven primarily by high growths reported in services and industry. Domestic private demand is also expected to be higher than anticipated, as an expansionary monetary policy and low inflation environment further contribute to it. The increase of domestic demand continues to be reflected in high growths in trade and imports, as well as in the behavior of core inflation and inflation expectations. The CBA Board finds it reasonable to leave the monetary conditions expansionary, taking into account the need to maintain a sustained recovery of demand and the overestimation of the effects of change in excise and customs duties on the inflation expectations. At the same time, the Board believes that, in light of predicted developments, a gradual offsetting of expansionary monetary conditions would be needed in the near future to fulfil the inflation target in the medium run. The Board also admits that upside risks to the inflation deviating from the current quarter's monetary policy program are increasing and, should such risks emerge, it would take action to adjust the monetary policy directions accordingly, while fulfilling the inflation target in the medium run. Detailed information on setting of the interest rate will be available in Press Release (Minutes on Interest Rate), to be published by January 16, 2018. Press Service of the Central Bank of Armenia."
Egypt,2017-12-28,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release December 28, 2017 In its meeting held on December 28, 2017, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) main operation unchanged at 1875 percent, 1975 percent, and 1925 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 1925 percen. Annual headline and core inflation continued to decline in November 2017 for the fourth consecutive month to record 260 percent and 255 percent, after peaking in July 2017 at 330 percent and 353 percent, respectivel. Tighter real monetary conditions supported the decline, which accelerated in November due to a favorable base effec. Nevertheless inflation was affected during this period by continuous supply shocks related to fiscal consolidation measures, leading regulated price adjustments to account on average for 44 percent of monthly headline inflation, in addition to indirect effects on core CPI item. Real GDP growth continued to increase for the fourth consecutive quarter in September 2017 to record 52 percent, thereby growing on average by 48 percent over the first nine months of 2017 which records the fastest pace since 201. This coincided with the continued narrowing of the unemployment rate to record 119 percent in September 2017, the lowest rate since 201. Leading indicators generally suggest a continued improvement of economic activity, despite weaker momentum in non-hydrocarbon sector. Available data up to June 2017 confirm that increasing economic growth over the previous three quarters was initially mainly driven by the industrial sector, due to non-petroleum and petroleum manufacturing as well as natural gas extractions, in addition to the tourism secto. Thereafter the pickup of economic growth was led by real estate, trade and construction sector. Meanwhile the expenditure structure continued to rebalance with a moderating contribution from consumption and a rising contribution from net export. The growth of private investment continued to expand in 2016/17 for the third consecutive year, while public investment maintained its double digit growt. Real monetary conditions continued to tighten, a necessary requirement for disinflatio. This process was supported by previous policy rate increases as well as receding inflationary pressure. The baseline inflation outlook remains consistent with achieving the CBE's inflation target of 13 percent (Â±3 percent) in 2018 Q4 and single digits thereafte. Consequently the MPC decided that current policy rates remain appropriat. Given its mandate of achieving price stability over the medium-term, the MPC will only reconsider its stance conditional upon data confirming the moderation of underlying inflationary pressure.
