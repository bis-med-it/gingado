Romania,2011-01-05,"In its meeting of January 5, 2011, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided the following:. The NBR will vigilantly monitor domestic and global economic developments so as, via an adequate use of its available instruments, to ensure the fulfilment of its objectives of achieving and maintaining price stability in the medium term as well as financial stability. The annual inflation rate fell marginally to 7.73 percent in November 2010. The analysis of the latest developments in macroeconomic indicators reveals that the annual inflation rate will be close to 8.0 percent at the end of 2010, in line with the NBR forecasts. As the first-round effects of the VAT rate hike fade out, a gradual reduction of the annual inflation rate is expected this year, when it is forecast to reach 3.4 percent. In order to prevent second-round effects of the VAT rate hike, the monetary policy stance aims to firmly anchor inflation expectations. The prolonged real negative annual dynamics of credit to the private sector is worth noting, despite a persistent improvement of liquidity in the banking sector and given the persistence of a significant spread between interbank rates and lending rates for companies and households, also amid uncertainties related to the legal framework of banking activities. These developments and uncertainties, along with the risks related to the second-round effects of VAT rate hike, whose impact may be heightened by public debates on a seasonal increase in food prices, remain worrying. From this perspective, the maintenance of a prudent monetary policy stance is needed in order to preserve the prospects of a return of the annual inflation rate towards the medium-term targets. In this context, in a bid to firmly anchor inflation expectations, the NBR Board decided to leave unchanged the monetary policy rate at an annual 6.25 percent and to continue to pursue an adequate management of liquidity in the banking system. Moreover, the NBR Board decided to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu-denominated and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. These decisions are aimed at strengthening the prospects of a sustainable return to disinflation, which will pave the way for a sound economic recovery. In this context, with a view to ensuring sustainable nominal and real convergence, the implementation of objectives set under financial accords with international institutions, especially those regarding the ongoing fiscal consolidation and structural reforms, is essential. These objectives are seen enhancing credibility given that the adjustments so far have helped correct macroeconomic imbalances, particularly the external deficit. The NBR Board is restating that the central bank will vigilantly monitor domestic and global economic developments so as, via an adequate use of its available instruments, to ensure the fulfilment of its objectives of achieving and maintaining price stability in the medium term as well as financial stability. These will pave the way for a resumption of sustainable economic growth. In line with the announced calendar the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for February 3, 2011, when a new quarterly Inflation Report is to be examined."
Chile,2011-01-13,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 13 January 2011 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 3.25% (annual). Internationally, signs of moderate growth in developed countries have continued, which contrasts with the dynamism of emerging economies. Concerns regarding financial risk in some European economies persist. Difficulties in the recovery of developed countries are still an important risk factor for emerging economies. Meanwhile, international prices of commodities, including foodstuffs and energy, are still on the rise, which is having an inflationary impact on several economies. Domestically, output, demand and employment figures continue on a positive trend, in line with projections in the latest Monetary Policy Report. Core inflation measures remain bounded. After the announcement of the foreign currency purchase program, the peso has depreciated. Private inflation expectations show an increase in the monetary policy horizon, although stronger in the short term due to increases in some specific prices. The Board reiterates that it will be necessary to continue to reduce the monetary stimulus in the coming months, in line with the last Report. The pace of this process will depend on the unfolding of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions. Accordingly, the Board will continue to use its policies with flexibility so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. * The Spanish original prevails."
Euroarea,2011-01-13,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome Estonia as the seventeenth country to adopt the euro as its currency. Accordingly. Mr Lipstok, the Governor of Eesti Pank, became a member of the Governing Council on 1 January 2011. Following the adoption of the euro by Estonia there are now 331 million citizens using the euro as their currency. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting, which was also attended by Commissioner Rehn. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council confirmed that the current key ECB interest rates still remain appropriate. Taking into account all the new information and analyses which have become available since our meeting on 2 December 2010, we see evidence of short-term upward pressure on overall inflation, mainly owing to energy prices, but this has not so far affected our assessment that price developments will remain in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon. Recent economic data are consistent with a positive underlying momentum of economic activity, while uncertainty remains elevated. Our monetary analysis indicates that inflationary pressures over the medium term should remain contained. Overall, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The firm anchoring of inflation expectations is of the essence. Overall, the current monetary policy stance remains accommodative. The stance, the provision of liquidity and the allotment modes will be adjusted as appropriate, taking into account the fact that all the non-standard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions are, by construction, temporary in nature. Accordingly, the Governing Council will continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Following the 0.3% quarter-on-quarter increase in euro area real GDP in the third quarter of 2010, recent statistical releases and survey-based evidence confirm that the positive underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area remained in place towards the end of 2010. Looking ahead at 2011, euro area exports should benefit from a continued recovery in the world economy. At the same time, and particularly taking into account the relatively high level of business confidence in the euro area, private sector domestic demand should increasingly contribute to growth, supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system. However, the recovery in activity is expected to be dampened by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors. In the Governing Council's assessment, the risks to this economic outlook are still slightly tilted to the downside, with uncertainty remaining elevated. On the one hand, global trade may continue to grow more rapidly than expected, thereby supporting euro area exports. Moreover, strong business confidence could provide more support to domestic economic activity in the euro area than is currently expected. On the other hand, downside risks relate to the tensions in some segments of the financial markets and their potential spillover to the euro area real economy. Further downside risks relate to renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation was 2.2% in December, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, after 1.9% in November. This was somewhat higher than expected and largely reflects higher energy prices. Looking ahead to the next few months, inflation rates could temporarily increase further. They are likely to stay slightly above 2%, largely owing to commodity price developments, before moderating again towards the end of the year. Overall, we see evidence of short-term upward pressure on overall inflation, stemming largely from global commodity prices. While this has not so far affected our assessment that price developments will remain in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon, very close monitoring of price developments is warranted. Inflation expectations over the medium to longer term continue to be firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments are still broadly balanced but could move to the upside. Upside risks relate, in particular, to developments in energy and non-energy commodity prices. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxes and administered prices may be greater than currently expected, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years, and price pressures in the production chain could rise further. On the downside, risks relate mainly to the impact on inflation of potentially lower growth, given the prevailing uncertainties. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 increased to 1.9% in November 2010, after 0.9% in October. This strong increase is in part related to base effects and volatile factors. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector also increased, rising to 2.0% in November from 1.5% in October. Looking beyond the special factors that operated in November, broad money and loan growth is still low, corroborating the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that inflationary pressures over the medium term should remain contained. The interest rate constellation continued to exert a significant impact on the growth of monetary aggregates. Looking at M3 components, the interest rates paid on short-term time deposits remained higher than those paid on overnight deposits. As a result, annual M1 growth continued to moderate, standing at 4.6% in November 2010, while the annual growth rate of other short-term deposits continued to become less negative. At the same time, the yield curve has lately become steeper again, implying that the attractiveness of short-term deposits included in M3 has declined somewhat compared with more highly remunerated longer-term assets outside M3. The annual growth rate of bank loans to the private sector continued to increase in November, partly owing to special factors. At the sectoral level, this strengthening increasingly reflects the upward movement in the growth of loans to non-financial corporations, which stood at -0.1% in November, after -0.5% in October, thereby further confirming that a turning point was reached in the course of 2010. The growth of loans to households remained stronger, at 2.7% in November after 2.9% in October, but the latest data point to some signs of a levelling-off. Over the past few months banks have expanded the provision of credit to the private sector in an environment in which the overall size of their balance sheets has remained broadly stable. The challenge remains to expand the availability of such credit when demand picks up further. To address this challenge, where necessary, it is essential for banks to retain earnings, to turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or to take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. To sum up, the current key ECB interest rates still remain appropriate. Taking into account all the new information and analyses which have become available since our meeting on 2 December 2010, we see evidence of short-term upward pressure on overall inflation, mainly owing to energy prices, but this has not so far affected our assessment that price developments will remain in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon. Recent economic data are consistent with a positive underlying momentum of economic activity, while uncertainty remains elevated. A cross-check of the outcome of our economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis indicates that inflationary pressures over the medium term should remain contained. Overall, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The firm anchoring of inflation expectations is of the essence. Turning to fiscal policies, in view of the ongoing vulnerability to adverse market reactions, countries need to do their utmost to meet their deficit targets and put government debt-to-GDP ratios firmly on a downward trajectory. In this regard, the Governing Council takes note of the recently announced measures in some euro area countries to reduce their very large fiscal imbalances. Where necessary, additional corrective measures – preferably on the expenditure side – need to be swiftly defined and implemented. At the same time, all euro area countries should pursue ambitious and credible multi-year consolidation strategies. This will help to strengthen confidence in the sustainability of public finances, reduce risk premia in interest rates and improve the conditions for sound and sustainable growth. Any positive fiscal developments that may emerge, reflecting factors such as a more favourable than expected economic environment, should be exploited to make faster progress with fiscal consolidation. Substantial and far-reaching structural reforms, complementing fiscal adjustment, should be rapidly implemented to enhance the prospects for higher sustainable growth. Major reforms are particularly necessary in those countries that have experienced a loss of competitiveness in the past or that are suffering from high fiscal and external deficits. The removal of labour market rigidities would further support the adjustment process of these economies. Increasing product market competition, particularly in the services sectors, would also facilitate the restructuring of the economy and encourage innovation. Such measures are crucial for enhancing productivity growth, which is one of the main drivers of long-term growth. All these structural reforms should be supported by the necessary improvements in the structure of the banking sector. Sound balance sheets, effective risk management and transparent, robust business models remain key to strengthening banks' resilience to shocks and to ensuring adequate access to finance, thereby laying the foundations for sustainable growth and financial stability."
South Korea,2011-01-13,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points to 2.75%. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points to 2.75%. Based on currently available information, the Committee considers emerging market economies to have sustained their favorable performances, while the major advanced economies have kept up their moderate paces of recovery. Going forward, the Committee forecasts the global economy to sustain its pace of recovery; nevertheless, the Committee does not rule out the possibility of future developments, for example international financial market unrest arising from the sovereign debt concerns in some euro area countries and heightened volatility of international commodity prices, posing a risk to the global economy. For Korea, the Committee judges the domestic economy to have maintained its underlying upward trend; although facilities investment has declined, exports have continued their buoyancy and consumption has steadily increased. Labor market conditions have also shown ongoing improvement, led by the private sector. Going forward, the Committee anticipates that the domestic economy will keep up its underlying trend, even in the presence of external risks. Consumer price inflation in Korea reached the 3.5% level in December, driven mainly by rises in the prices of petroleum products and farm products. In the coming months, the Committee expects inflationary pressures to persist and inflation expectations to increase as the economic upswing continues and international commodity prices rise. In the real estate market, upward movements in housing prices have emerged in Seoul and its surrounding areas, and those in the rest of the country have sustained their upward trend, while leasehold deposits have continued to rise. In the financial markets, stock prices have risen significantly and the Korean won has appreciated, due mostly to the increased inflows of foreign stock investment funds and to expectations for geopolitical risks around the Korean Peninsula to ease. Long-term market interest rates have increased, in response chiefly to inflation expectations and to foreign investors' net sales of bonds. Mortgage lending has grown on a large scale, amid an increase in housing transactions. Looking ahead, the Committee will conduct monetary policy in such a way as to firmly anchor the basis for price stability while the economy continues its sound growth. In carrying out policy, the Committee will take overall account of financial and economic conditions both at home and abroad."
Peru,2011-01-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JANUARY 2011 BCRP RAISES THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE FROM 3.0% TO 3.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to raise the monetary policy reference rate from 3.0 percent to 3.25 percent. The nature of this rise in the reference rate is mainly preventive given the current growth of domestic demand in a context of rising international food and energy prices. This measure is aimed at preventing that inflation expectations will be influenced by these supply factors. Future adjustments in the reference rate will depend on new information on the evolution of inflation and its determinants. Current and advanced indicators of activity continue showing a rapid growth of economic activity. In December the production of electricity grew 9.3 percent and local dispatches of cement recorded a growth rate of 14 percent. Moreover, indicators of global economic activity confirm an improvement in the global growth outlook. Inflation in December recorded a rate of 0.18 percent, as a result of which annual inflation registered a rate of 2.08 percent. Core inflation, which showed a rate of 0.23 percent, accumulated an annual growth of 2.12 percent and remains around the 2 percent target. The Board continues to oversee the projection of inflation and its determinants and stands ready to adopt future adjustments in monetary policy instruments in order to ensure that inflation falls within the target range. The Board also approved to raise the following annual interest rates on active and passive operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system as detailed below: Direct repo and rediscount operations: 4.05 percent. Overnight deposits: 2.45 percent. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.05 percent. In 2011, the Board will approve the Monetary Program for each month on the sessions to be held on the following dates: February 10 March 10 April 7 May 12 June 9 July 7 August 11 September 8 October 6 November 10 December 7 In 2011 the BCRP will publish its Inflation Report on the following dates: March 18 June 17 September 16 December 16."
Georgia,2011-01-18,"18.01.11 The NBG will increase the reserve requirements for the foreign exchange liabilities The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on January 18th, 2011 and decided to increase to 15 percent the reserve requirements for the foreign currency liabilities starting on February 17th. As for its Main Policy Rate (the refinancing rate), the NBG decided to keep it unchanged at 7.5 percent. Annual inflation reached 11.2 percent by the end of 2010. The contribution of food in total CPI growth was around 9.5 percentage points. Despite high inflation, there is low inflationary pressure from the demand side. At the same time the food inflation feeds to higher inflation expectations. According to the forecasts, high inflation will hold during first months of the year and then start decreasing. The annual growth rate of monetary aggregates has declined. It is expected that during the year the annual growth rate of broad money will be within 20-25 percent, thus supporting in the medium term the decrease of the inflation rate down to the target value. During 2010 the bank loans extended to the economy have increased by 20%. This happened mostly through local currency loans, although in the recent period the foreign exchange loans have grown as well. At the previous meeting the Monetary Policy Committee decided to increase the reserve requirements for foreign currency liabilities gradually up to 15%. The first stage involved the increase of the ratio to 10% starting on January 20th, 2011. As mentioned before at present the inflation rate is quite high, mostly because of the exogenous factors. In order to avoid the risk of demand side inflationary pressure, it is advisable to continue the tightening policy. To that end the reserve requirement for the foreign exchange liabilities will be increased to 15% starting on February 17th. The NBG will closely monitor developments in the economy and financial markets and will in due course act accordingly. In case of continued inflationary pressure the NBG is ready to further tighten monetary policy. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will take place on February 16th, 2011."
Poland,2011-01-19,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 19 January 2011 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 18-19 January 2011 The Council decided to increase the NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage points: (cid:131) reference rate to 3.75% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate to 5.25% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate to 2.25% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate to 4.00% on an annual basis. The recovery in the world economy is continuing. Data from the United States and the euro area point to stable moderate economic growth. New data on Germany. Poland's main trading partner, confirm positive economic developments in that country. Yet, economic growth in the majority of developed countries is still being curbed by high unemployment and ongoing adjustments in the balance sheets of households, enterprises and financial institutions. Major emerging economies have witnessed the tightening of monetary policy aimed at limiting growing macroeconomic imbalances, including rising inflation. The effects of high fiscal imbalance and its planned reduction in the developed economies, as well as the effects of monetary expansion, including non-standard measures undertaken by major central banks, continue to be an uncertainty factor for the global economic growth. The recent period has witnessed some improvement of sentiment in the international financial markets. Yet, uncertainty about the fiscal situation in some euro area countries has continued. For a few quarters now world prices of commodities, including the prices of crude oil and food, have again been rising strongly, which has triggered an acceleration in inflation in most countries. Data on the Polish economy, including strong growth in industrial output, construction and retail sales in October and November 2010, as well as favourable business sentiment suggest that economic growth in Q4 has continued at the level close to the one in 2010 Q3. Lending to enterprises remains limited, mainly due to reasons related to the demand for credit. On the other hand, loans to households continue to grow. In December 2010 the annual CPI inflation rose to 3.1%, remaining above the NBP's inflation target of 2.5%. The inflation increase was primarily connected with a strong rise in fuel prices driven by growing prices of energy commodities in the global markets. According to preliminary estimates, also core inflation increased. The inflation rise was accompanied by an increase in inflation expectations. In the months to come. CPI inflation may be expected to continue above the inflation target due to previous strong rises of food prices, high growth in fuel prices and the effected increase in the majority of VAT rates in 2011. ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51. In the Council's assessment, the acceleration of economic growth in Poland supporting the improvement in the labour market may lead to a gradual rise in wage and inflationary pressure in the medium term. At the same time, a strong rise in commodity prices in the global markets  amid economic recovery  creates a risk that heightened inflation expectations persist. In order to curb the risk of inflation remaining above the inflation target in the medium term, the Council decided to raise the NBP's interest rates. At the same time the Council will continue to analyse the signs of a possible rise in inflationary pressure. An important factor affecting the monetary policy is the situation of public finances. An implementation of decisive measures aimed at permanently reducing the deficit of the general government sector and at curbing the increase of the public debt is necessary for macroeconomic stability and will allow the meeting of euro adoption criteria. In the opinion of the Council, introducing measures aimed at preventing fast growth in foreign currency lending to households is important for macroeconomic stability. Such measures can also contribute to increasing the effectiveness of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Therefore, the Council expects that measures aimed at curbing the supply of new foreign currency loans to households will be introduced. The Council maintains its view that Poland should join the ERM II and the euro area at the earliest possible date, after meeting the necessary legal, economic and organisational conditions."
Turkiye,2011-01-20,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term interest rates as follows: a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) is reduced from 6.5 percent to 6.25 percent, b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing and lending rates are kept constant at 1.50 percent and 9 percent, respectively. The interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions is kept constant at 8 percent. c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate is kept constant at 0 percent, while lending rate is kept constant at 12 percent. Recent releases have been consistent with the outlook presented in the October Inflation Report. Economic activity continues to recover amid strong domestic demand, yet, industrial capacity utilization rates remain below their pre-crisis levels due to weak external demand. Although employment conditions continue to improve, unemployment rates remain at high levels. Therefore, aggregate demand conditions do not exert upside pressures on inflation. Inflation is expected to decline significantly in January, remain below the end-year target of 5.5 percent during the first quarter, and reach the year-end target after displaying some fluctuations starting with the second quarter. The impact of the measures taken in December to contain credit supply will be seen in the forthcoming days. Additional macroprudential measures to restrict credit expansion, to be taken before the next meeting, will provide more flexibility for monetary policy. In this respect, additional hikes in required reserve ratios for short term liabilities will be necessary. In order to preserve both financial stability and price stability, a policy mix of a lower policy rate coupled with higher reserve requirements emerges as an optimal policy mix under the current conditions. In this respect, the Committee assesses that, the net impact of the measures taken—and to be taken in the future—will be restrictive. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
South Africa,2011-01-20,"Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, there have been more convincing signs that the recovery in the global economy will be sustained. However growth in the advanced economies is expected to be slow and is subject to a number of downside risks, including the sovereign debt crisis that continues to beset the Eurozone. The more promising global growth outlook, as well as the unfavourable weather conditions, has implications for commodity prices, particularly those of food and energy. These pressures are likely to pose an increasing risk to both the global and domestic inflation outlook. Nevertheless, domestic inflation is expected to remain within the target range for the forecast period. Domestically, the output gap remains negative and GDP growth is expected to remain below potential over the next two years. However, there are indications that the outlook for output growth, while hesitant, is somewhat more positive. The recovery in household consumption expenditure appears to be sustained. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas moderated to 3,5 per cent in December from 3,6 per cent in November 2010. The average inflation rate for 2010 was 4,3 per cent compared with 7,1 per cent in 2009. Food price inflation in December measured 1,4 per cent, unchanged on a month-on-month basis. The main contributor to the inflation outcome remained housing and utilities, primarily electricity, which contributed 1,5 percentage points to the 3,5 per cent outcome. Administered prices excluding petrol increased at a rate of 9,1 per cent in both November and December. Year-on-year producer price inflation reached a recent peak of 9,4 per cent in June 2010, and has declined moderately since then. In November, the PPI increased by 6,2 per cent, compared with 6,4 per cent the previous month. The impact of the exchange rate on producer prices is still clearly evident, with the prices of imported commodities increasing at a year-on-year rate of 0,5 per cent. Manufactured food prices increased by 0,6 per cent, while agricultural prices declined by 0,3 per cent. The CPI forecast of the Bank has been revised upwards since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee. Nevertheless, the domestic inflation trajectory is still expected to remain within the target range over the entire forecast period to the end of 2012. Inflation is now expected to average 4,6 per cent in 2011 and 5,3 per cent in 2012. The upward adjustment is mainly due to revised assumptions of the international oil price over the forecast period, and we will continue to monitor global inflation trends closely. The Bank's forecast is similar to the Reuters consensus forecast. In the December survey, the mean forecast of CPI inflation was 4,5 per cent for 2011, and 5,4 per cent and 5,6 per cent for 2012 and 2013 respectively. These forecasts were slightly higher than those in the November survey. The break-even inflation rates across all maturities also continue to reflect inflation expectations within the target range. Inflation expectations as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research (BER) at Stellenbosch University in the fourth quarter of 2010 continued to trend downwards. For the first time, average expectations for 2011 are within the inflation target band at 5,5 per cent. The expectations of all categories of respondents declined, with both business executives and trade union officials expecting inflation to average 6,0 per cent, while those of the financial analysts declined to 4,5 per cent. All categories of respondents expect inflation to increase again in 2012 when it is expected to average 6,2 per cent. The global economic outlook remains uncertain but there appears to be increasing optimism that the recovery, albeit relatively weak, will be sustained. Most forecasts have been revised upwards in recent months but indicate that global growth is expected to be slower in 2011 than in 2010. However, the prospects remain uneven across countries and regions, and a number of risks remain. Growth in the US continues to be supported by strong monetary and fiscal intervention, while growth in Japan remains subdued. In the euro area, the recovery is being driven by strong growth in Germany but this is expected to moderate in 2011. In the rest of the euro area, confidence has declined in the wake of the worsening sovereign debt crisis, which remains a major risk to the outlook. Recent coordinated measures appear to have stabilised the sovereign debt markets for now, but significant risks remain and a further escalation of the crisis could impact negatively on global growth prospects. The emerging markets continue to outperform the advanced economies, with strong recoveries in consumption and investment in the major emerging market economies. Inflation developments and prospects also appear to reflect the divergent growth trends. Persistent large negative output gaps in the advanced economies have helped to contain inflation pressures, despite rising international oil and food prices. There is still some risk of deflation in the US, although this risk is declining. By contrast, inflation in the emerging markets has been increasing, partly as a result of stronger demand pressures, but also as a result of the higher weights of energy and food in the consumer price baskets. These trends have resulted in generally tighter monetary policies in emerging markets, but monetary accommodation is expected to persist in most of the major industrialised countries for some time. The exchange rate of the rand has been relatively volatile since the previous meeting of the MPC, when it was around R7,00 against the US dollar. By early January the rand had appreciated to R6,55, but has since retraced to levels prevailing at the time of the previous meeting. During this period, non-residents became net sellers of rand-denominated bonds, as expectations that there would be further interest rate reductions were reversed, but were net buyers of domestic equities. Factors influencing the exchange rate during this period included developments in the euro/dollar exchange rate, further acceleration in commodity prices, and persistent capital flows to emerging markets. In the absence of general risk aversion, or a tightening of the monetary policy stances in the advanced economies, the rand exchange rate is expected to remain relatively strong. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the nominal effective exchange rate of the rand depreciated by 0,4 per cent. During 2010 total direct foreign exchange reserve accumulation by the Bank and the National Treasury amounted to US$7,4 billion, or a spend of just over R53 billion. Despite this, the rand continued to appreciate - 12 per cent against the US dollar during 2010 - and remained strong. Portfolio and foreign direct investment inflows continued and the net purchases of bonds and equities by non-residents amounted to R89,5 billion in 2010. The Bank will continue to accumulate foreign exchange reserves as and when possible. Domestic GDP growth remains subdued, with growth of 2,6 per cent in the third quarter of 2010. Although there are mixed signals about the sustainability of the output recovery, high frequency data indicate a stronger fourth quarter performance, and forecasts for 2011 have generally been subject to moderate upward revision. The Bank's forecast was also adjusted marginally, and growth is now expected to average 3,4 per cent in 2011. The forecast for 2012 is unchanged at 3,6 per cent. The composite leading business cycle indicator of the Bank has been relatively flat in the past few months, and declined moderately in October, reflecting the uneven growth prospects. Gross domestic fixed capital formation is still subdued, having increased by 0,9 per cent in the third quarter of 2010. This rate of investment growth remains too low to meaningfully impact on output growth, and is currently primarily dependent on state-owned enterprises' pipeline commitment to infrastructure, while investment in the manufacturing sector is being constrained by low levels of capacity utilisation. The labour market appears to have stabilised in the third quarter when employment levels were more or less unchanged, although unemployment remains stubbornly high at 25,3 per cent. The recovery in the manufacturing sector remains hesitant. Manufacturing output increased by 4,6 per cent on a year-on-year basis in November, compared with 2,3 per cent in October. Production of motor vehicles, parts and accessories in particular have exhibited robust growth, including vehicle exports which increased by 52,8 per cent quarter-on-quarter in the final quarter of 2010. The Kagiso Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) confirms the uncertain outlook. Following a strong improvement in the index in November to a level in excess of the neutral level of 50, it declined again in December, although still indicating an expansion of the sector. The mining sector has also been improving and grew at a year-on-year rate of 9,6 per cent in November. The RMB/BER Business Confidence Indicator remained relatively unchanged throughout 2010, but with a negative outlook. The recovery in domestic consumption expenditure appears to be sustained. Real final consumption expenditure by households increased at an annualised rate of 5,9 per cent in the third quarter of 2010. Strong expenditure growth was observed in all components of consumption. Real retail trade sales increased at a year-on-year rate of 7,8 per cent in November 2010. New vehicle sales also continued their strong performance, having increased by almost 30 per cent in December. Consumer confidence as reflected in the FNB/BER consumer confidence index has been at a relatively high level during the past year. Credit extension maintained its moderate upward trend during 2010. Total loans and advances to the private sector increased by 4,4 per cent in November. Growth over twelve months in mortgage advances has fluctuated around 4,8 per cent since August 2010, reflecting a loss of momentum in the real estate market. House prices increased somewhat in the first half of 2010, but since then the rate of increase has declined, with some house price indexes indicating that prices have been falling. Growth in instalment sale and leasing finance, and other loans and advances, maintained a positive trend. Within the latter category, growth in credit card advances were positive for the first time since the end of 2008. Bank overdrafts were the only major category that continued to contract, although at a slower rate. Household debt remains high at 78,5 per cent of disposable income. However lower interest rates have reduced the ratio of debt service costs to disposable income to 7,8 per cent, compared with 12,6 per cent in the third quarter of 2008. Expenditure has been positively affected by growth in real disposable income, lower interest rates and some favourable wealth effects. Share prices on the JSE have reached levels in line with the peaks reached before the onset of the global financial crisis. In 2010 the all-share index increased by 16,1 per cent. Risks to the inflation outlook emanating from global commodity price increases have become more evident. These risks relate mainly to oil and food price developments. Having fluctuated in the range of US$70 - US$80 per barrel for much of 2010, the price of Brent crude oil began to increase in late November and is currently at around US$98 per barrel. The surge in oil prices is due in part to stronger global oil demand and the exceptionally cold weather in the Northern Hemisphere. These price trends were also affected by US dollar developments, particularly following the announcement of additional quantitative easing by the US Federal Reserve in November. The domestic petrol price, which has been cushioned to some extent by exchange rate developments, has increased by 66 cents per litre since September 2010, and by 11 per cent over the past year. Since September, the rand exchange rate has offset the petrol price increase by a cumulative 45 cents per litre. Global food prices have also continued to increase, driven by tight food supplies, changing weather patterns and rising demand in emerging market economies. To date South Africa has been shielded to some degree from these increases by the exchange rate and the bumper maize crop. Domestic maize prices have been increasing since the middle of 2010, but in January this year were still about 11 per cent lower than a year ago. By contrast. South Africa is a net importer of wheat, which has increased in price by almost 40 per cent over the past year. Although producer price developments suggest that domestic food price inflation will remain low in the short term, these global developments, unless reversed, will inevitably impact on consumer food price inflation. Administered prices and wage settlements remain upside risks to the inflation outlook. Although wage increases have moderated slightly over the past months, they are still significantly in excess of the current and expected inflation outcomes. According to Statistics South Africa, the year-on-year rate of increase in average nominal remuneration per worker in the formal non-agricultural sector declined from 15,8 per cent in the second quarter of 2010 to 12,6 per cent in the third quarter. Once labour productivity developments are accounted for, unit labour cost increases amounted to 10,9 per cent and 9,3 per cent in these two quarters respectively. According to Andrew Levy Employment publications, the average wage settlement in the first nine months of 2010 amounted to 8,3 per cent compared with 9,3 per cent in 2009. The current level of the repurchase rate is at its lowest level in nominal terms in over 30 years, while the real interest rate is at a level below 1 per cent. This has helped with the recovery in consumption expenditure and should also stimulate domestic investment and growth by reducing the cost of borrowing. However, low interest rates on their own cannot ensure sustainably higher long-run trend growth and employment creation. The MPC has taken note of the improving growth outlook for the economy, and is of the view that the recovery in domestic consumption expenditure will be sustained. While there are increasing risks to the inflation outlook, these emanate primarily from external cost-push factors, and inflation is expected to remain within the target range until the end of the forecast period. The MPC has therefore decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 5,5 per cent per annum. At this stage there are no signs of incipient excess demand in the economy, and unless there are significant unexpected changes in the global or domestic outlook the monetary policy stance is expected to remain relatively stable for some time. The MPC will continue to monitor developments closely and stands ready to act should the need arise. Gill Marcus GOVERNOR Contact person: Brian Hoga +27 12 313 4448 Brian."
Israel,2011-01-24,"24.01.2011 The Bank of Israel increases the interest rate for February 2011 by 0.25 percentage points to 2.25 percent Background conditions Inflation data: The December CPI rose by 0.4 percent, the upper bound of the range of forecasters' predictions. Inflation in 2010 was 2.7 percent, within the range of the price stability target. Excluding the housing component, the CPI increased by 1.9 percent in 2010. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: The average of forecasters' inflation expectations for the next twelve monthly CPIs increased slightly to 3 percent, the upper limit of the target inflation range. Expectationscalculated from the capital market also increased, and since the beginningof January this year have averaged 3.2 percent, above the upper limit of the inflation target range. Inflation measured over the previous twelve months is expected to be above the upper limit of the target inflation range for most of 2011, and to return to within the range towards the end of the year. The average of the forecasters' predictions is that the interest rate in a year's time will be 3.3 percent. Most forecasters expect the Bank of Israel to increase the interest rate for February 2011. Real economic activity: Economic data published this month indicate that the positive trend in most sectors continued. Companies' returns to the Bank of Israel Companies Survey show that business activity continued in the fourth quarter of 2010 at a similar rate to that since the beginning of the year, and the trend was expected to persist in the first quarter of 2011. The estimates of the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) indicate GDP growth of 4.5 percent in 2010. The composite state-of-the-economy index for December increased by a buoyant 0.7 percent, and the indices for the four previous months were all revised upwards. Exports increased by 3.1 percent in December, and imports by 5.0 percent. The Bank of Israel Research Department index of the probability of a slowdown, based on Google searches, shows an acceleration in domestic demand towards the end of 2010, and the probability of a slowdown remains below 50 percent. The Bank of Israel staff forecast is that inflation in 2011 will be 2.6 percent, with a gradual increase in the interest rate to about 3.3 percent in the last quarter of the year. The main risks to real activity andinflation in Israel derive from developments abroad and in the local housing market. The labor market and wages: The labor market continues to be the source of positive data, indicating ongoing improvement in that area. The CBS survey of vacancies shows a drop of 2.1 percent in December from the number in November. The average real wage per employee post increased by 3.3 percent in October compared with the level in September, and the nominal wage by 3.7 percent (both seasonally adjusted); in May-October 2010 the real and nominal wage per employee post increased by 3.8 percent and 1.4 percent respectively compared with their levels in the same six-month period a year earlier. It should be noted that the wage agreements signed recently in the public sector, and those due to be signed during the year, are likely to constitute another factor tending to increase wages. Preliminary data on health tax revenue in December point to a continued rapid increase intotal wage payments. Budget data: The government deficit (excluding credit) in 2010 totaled NIS 30.2 billion, 3.7 percent of GDP. The deficit in December alone was NIS 12.6 billion due to high expenditure in excess of the usual seasonalincrease. Total tax revenues in 2010 were NIS 195.4 billion; after accounting for the effects of legislative changes and nonrecurring receipts this represents a real increase of 7.5 percent from the level in 2009. The foreign exchange market: From the previous monetary policy discussion held on December 26 until January 21, the shekel depreciated by 2.8 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. The measures relating to the foreign currency market announced by the Bank of Israel last week weakened the shekel, and in the period December 26 to January 21 it depreciated by 0.7 percent against the dollar. Against the euro the shekel depreciated by 5 percent, in line with the changes in the major currencies. The capital and money markets: Between the monetary policy discussions of December 26 and January 21, the Tel Aviv 25 index increased by 2.3 percent. In this period stock markets around the world showed a mixed trend. In Israel yields on local currency government bonds increased by between 10 and 15 basis points (b.p.) along the entire curve, similar to the worldwide trend. Yields on CPI-indexed bonds, however, dropped along the whole curve (as the slope steepened), against the background of the increase in inflation expectations. The makam yield curve showed a mixed trend as the curve became steeper, with a decline in yields of up to 20 b.p. for terms up to three months, and increases of up to 10 b.p. in yields for other terms. During the period, renewed activity by nonresidents was evident, with an increase in the daily volume of trade and sharp drops in short yields. Following the Bank of Israel's measures announced last week relating to the foreign currency market, the decline in yields moderated significantly. The yieldgap between Israeli and US unindexed 10-year government bonds widened thismonth to 143 b.p. from 128 b.p. in the previous month, mainly due to the greater increase in yields on Israeli government bonds. In the corporate bond market the Tel-Bond 20 index rose by 2 percent, and the Tel-Bond 40 indexby 2.2 percent. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spread declined slightly this month, to 115 b.p. The money supply: The M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 2.3 percent in December, following its 1.5 percent decline in November. In the whole of 2010 the M 1 aggregate increased by 4.1 percent. The M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 1.9 percent in December, following its 0.9 percent increase in November; in the year 2010 it increased by 3.3 percent. The credit market:Total outstanding business sector credit increased by 0.9 percent in November, to NIS 755 billion; half of the increase derived from the depreciation of the shekel against the dollar. From January to November 2010 this credit grew by 2.5 percent. Outstanding credit to households increased by 9.4 percent in January-November 2010. The outstanding balance of housing loans in November 2010 was 10 percent higher than at the end of 2009. Of the total housing credit advanced in December, 47 percent was unindexed at floating interest rates, compared with the monthlyaverage of 50.4 percent in the whole of 2010. The housing market: House prices--which are presented in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of house prices and which are not included in the CPI--increased in October-November at a rate of 1.4 percent a month, following their increase of 0.4 percent in September-October. In 2010 house prices increased by 17.3 percent. The housing price index, which is based mainly on renewed rental contracts and which is included in the CPI, rose by 0.3 percent in December,after remaining unchanged in November. The housing price index increased by 4.9 percent in 2010 as a whole. The global economy: The most recent macroeconomic data relating to the global economy, and in particular to the US and China, indicate that the recovery from the crisis is becoming firmer. Nevertheless, high rates of unemployment and low rates of growth in the advanced economies continue to temper the general optimism. Concerns related to the European debt crisiseased slightly in light of several successful bond issues by some of the PIIGS countries (Portugal. Ireland. Italy. Greece and Spain). The need to borrow on a large scale in some of those countries in the coming year and theuncertainty in the European markets are expected to keep the situation in Europe the focus of attention in the global economy in the near future. Inflation in the US remained low, while in the eurozone inflation exceeded thetarget this month. In light of that development the expected timing of an increase in the interest rate in Europe was brought forward a little. Inflationary pressures continue to mount in the emerging market economies, deriving from the steep increases in commodity prices in general, and food prices in particular. Those increases give rise to concern over possible contractionary measures that could hold back global growth. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to increase the interest rate for February by 25 basis points to 2.25 percent is consistent with the gradual process of returning the interest rate to a more normal level intended to position inflation firmly within the target range, and to support the further recovery of economic activity, while maintaining financial stability. The rate of increase in the interest rate is not pre-determined, but is set in accordance with the inflation environment, growth in Israel and globally, the monetary policies of the leading central banks, and developments in the exchange rates of the shekel. At the current level of the interest rate, monetary policy continues to be expansionary. Inflation in the last twelve months was within the target range. Inflation expectations of forecasters for one year ahead are at the upper limit of the target range, and those derived from the capital market are above it. The Bank of Israel Research Department staff forecast, however, is that inflation will be 2.6 percent in 2011. These forecasts are based on expectations that the interest rate will be increased. Inflation measured over the previous twelvemonths is expected to be above the upper limit of the target inflation range for most of 2011, and to return to within the range towards the end of the year. The acceleration in house prices was renewed last month, and in the last twelve months they have risen by 17.3 percent. The volume of new housing loans increased steeply in December. The outstanding balance of housing loans in November 2010 was 10 percent higher than that at the end of 2009. Up-to-date economic indicators and data show that the rapid growth in the first three quarters of 2010 continued in the fourth quarter. Growth was evident in most areas of economic activity, and is expected to continue in the first quarter of 2011. Recently published data indicate that the global economy is continuing along the path of recovery from the economic crisis. The decision to increase the interest rate was taken despite the fact that interest rates of the central banks in the major advanced economies are at low levels and are not expected to rise in the near future. Nevertheless, some centralbanks in economies that are already showing relatively fast rates of growth continued the process of raising their interest rates again last month. Against this background, the amendment issued last week by the Bank of Israel to the liquidity directive contributed to a weakening of the shekel and is also expected to moderate the effect of the increase in the interest ratedifferentials on the strengthening of the shekel. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in Israel's economy and the global economy and in the financial markets. The Bank will usethe instruments available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, including keeping a close watch on developmentsin the assets market, and especially in the housing market. The minutes of the discussions prior to the above interest ratedecision will be published on February 7, 2011. The decision regarding the interest rate for March 2011 will bepublished at 17:30 on Monday. February 21, 2011. 24.01.2011 The Bank of Israel increases the interest rate for February 2011 by 0.25 percentage points to 2.25 percent. The Bank of Israel increases the interest rate for February 2011 by 0.25 percentage points to 2.25 percent.

Nigeria,2011-01-24,"Central Bank of Nigeria Communique No. 74 of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting. January 24-25, 2011 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on the 24th and 25th January, 2011 to review domestic and international economic and financial developments in 2010 and the challenges facing the Nigerian economy in the year ahead. On the global scene, the Committee noted the divergence in the economic performance of advanced and emerging economies in 2010. Economic uncertainties contributed to the weak recovery in advanced economies. As a result, growth was sluggish and concerns about inflation were dominant on account of the rising oil and commodity prices in the international markets and fears of fiscal stress in the years ahead. On the other hand, robust economic growth was recorded in emerging markets based essentially on strong domestic demand which offset weak export demand. Financial market conditions in advanced economies were, however, more stable than in the preceding two years while some emerging economies were confronted with challenges posed by large volatile capital inflows. With regard to the domestic economy, the Committee noted with satisfaction the impressive economic growth, the continuing recovery of the capital market and the progress made towards restoring stability in the banking sector. It however, observed that inflation had continued to be relatively high and reiterated the need for it to be reined in and for Government to further strengthen and deepen economic and structural reforms. Key Domestic Macroeconomic and Financial Developments Domestic Output The Committee noted the sustained output growth recorded in 2010. Provisional data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) indicated that real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 829 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2010, up from 786 per cent recorded in the third quarter. The overall GDP growth for 2010 was estimated to be 785 per cent, compared to the revised growth rate of 696 per cent recorded in 2009. The non-oil sector remained the major driver of overall growth, with agriculture, wholesale and retail trade, and services contributing 239, 204 and 208 per cent, respectively. The outlook for 2011 is projected to be generally favourable in view of the continued improvement in the international oil market and emphasis on the development of the non-oil sector. Domestic Prices The year-on-year headline inflation, as measured by the percentage change in the all-items consumer price index (CPI. November 2009=100), trended downwards during most periods of 2010. It declined to 118 per cent in December 2010 from 136 per cent in September. Similarly core inflation declined to 109 per cent in December 2010 from 128 per cent in September. Food inflation also, dropped to 127 per cent in December 2010, from 146 per cent recorded in September. The Committee noted that although inflation has been trending downwards, the single digit benchmark was not achieved in 2010, despite the relatively good harvest, improved supply of petroleum products and lower growth in monetary aggregates. This according to the Committee underscores the need to address both supply and demand side factors that determine inflation dynamics in Nigeria. One of the ways to keep aggregate demand in check is to restrain debt-financed government spending in the medium-term. This calls for a review of subsidies and other recurrent expenditure categories that constitute a drain on the national budget as well as improving the revenue base. However the Committee commended the government for recognizing the existence of these issues in the 2011 budget proposal especially the reduction in the proposed level of total spending. Although there has been a strong emphasis on capital expenditure and infrastructure development, the Committee noted that recurrent expenditure remained high at over 70 per cent of the total budget. For this reason, the MPC believes that the risk to price stability posed by fiscal operations will need to be constantly monitored if inflation is to be brought down to single digit levels in the short to medium term. However the Committee noted that the general thrust of fiscal policy pronouncements is in the desired direction. Monetary Credit and Financial Market Developments Provisional data showed that the growth in broad measure of money supply (M2) was generally below the indicative benchmark throughout 2010 when compared with the level at end-December 2009. Specifically at end-December 2 2010. M2 growth was 670 per cent compared with the indicative benchmark of 29 per cent for 2010. Available data indicated that growth in aggregate credit to the domestic economy (net) was similarly sluggish at 613 per cent in December 2010 compared with 596 per cent recorded in the corresponding period of 2009. This development is connected to the damaged balance sheets of the DMBs in the wake of the global financial and economic crises. However aggregate credit to the Federal, as well as State and local governments grew by 6783 per cent and 1917 per cent, respectively, in 2010. Credit to the private sector contracted by 492 per cent in contrast to the indicative benchmark growth of 3154 per cent for 2010. However this outcome would need to be considered in the context of the purchase of non-performing loans with face value of over N 2 trillion from the DMBs by the Asset Management Company of Nigeria (AMCON) in 2010. These loans were purchased at a discount and paid for by AMCON- issued zero-coupon bonds. Adjusting for this factor, growth in credit to the private sector would appear to be positive, since the loans were transferred to the balance sheet of AMCON. The growth in credit to the three tiers of government against the backdrop of the decline in private sector credit is a reflection of the fact that government borrowing had to some extent crowded out private sector credit. Developments in retail market interest rates indicated that the retail lending rates remained relatively high in 2010. The average maximum lending rate declined from 2318 per cent in January 2010 to 2186 per cent in December 2010. The average prime lending rate also declined consistently from 1838 per cent in January to 1574 per cent in December 2010. Inter-bank and OBB rates moderated to 806 and 686 per cent respectively in December 2010. The weighted average savings rate declined consistently from 333 per cent in January 2010 to 151 per cent in December 2010. The consolidated deposit rate initially declined from 613 per cent in January to 207 per cent in September, 2010 but rose marginally to 224 per cent in December 3 2010. Thus the spread between the average maximum lending rate and the consolidated deposit rate widened from 1705 percentage points in January to 1976 percentage points in December 2010. The Committee noted with concern the extremely low returns paid to savers and depositors as this poses a major dis-intermediation risk and is inconsistent with developmental goals of financial inclusion. The domestic capital market recorded significant recovery in 2010, after the decline associated with the global financial and economic crises in 2008/2009. The All-Share Index (ASI) rose from 20,,82717 points as at end-December 2009 to 24, 77052 points as at end-December 2010, representing a growth of 1893 per cent. Market Capitalization (MC) rose from N498 trillion as at end-December 2009 to N791 trillion as at end-December 2010, representing a growth of 5883 per cent. For the fourth quarter of 2010, the All-Share Index (ASI) increased by 75 per cent from 23,,05059 to 24,,77052 at end-December 2010 while Market Capitalization (MC) increased by 401 per cent from N565 trillion to N791 trillion. However the number of deals, volume and value of shares traded declined as at December. The increase in ASI and MC was partly due to share price recoveries in the Banking. Food/Beverage. Insurance and Oil & Gas sectors. Nonetheless the recovery process needs to be sustained through further strengthening of macroeconomic and structural reforms. The Committee noted the major role being played by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in reforming and improving governance processes in the NSE and encouraged the SEC to continue as this is necessary for restoring confidence in the Nigerian financial system. External Sector Developments The foreign exchange market remained relatively stable. Between end-2009 and end-2010, the Naira/Dollar exchange rate depreciated by N108 or 072 per cent, to N15066/US$ from N14958 /US$ at end-2009, as against 1565 per cent depreciation recorded at the end of 2009. The average premium between the CBN transaction rate and the BDC’s as at end-2010, was 183 per cent, compared with 858 per cent in 2009. The Committee reaffirmed its conviction that a stable exchange rate regime is critical to maintaining price stability but noted that in the absence of complementary policies the regime is only sustainable at the cost of significant attrition in foreign reserves. The MPC, therefore, continues to emphasize that the solution to reserve depletion lies in the implementation of appropriate reforms with regard to industrial and trade policies aimed at reducing import- dependence, which are beyond the scope of monetary policy. Substantial foreign exchange is expended annually on JVC Cash calls and importation of petroleum products due to the delay in implementing much needed reforms in the oil sector. This is in addition to the huge amounts spent on petroleum subsidies which are likely to increase with higher oil prices. The country is also expending foreign exchange on import of food items such as rice whereas what is needed is the implementation of policies that will lead to food security and total self sufficiency. The Committee noted that external reserves stood at US$3232 billion as at end-December 2010. It however, rose to US$33,,26 billion as at 20th January 2011. In the Committee’s view, implementation of these reforms along with the improved outlook for oil price and output should go a long way in reversing the negative trend in our foreign reserves position. The Committee’s Considerations The considerations of the MPC following from the above review suggest that while the general outlook on growth is highly favourable, it is important to be vigilant on prices and financial market developments. The likelihood of improved oil output and rising oil prices in the international market, would contribute to growth and help rebuild external reserves which is vital to sustain consumer and investor confidence in the economy. The Committee noted that the risk of inflation is on the upward side as a result of the liquidity injections from the likely increase in government spending in the run up to the April 2011 elections, and AMCON purchases, as well as rising global energy and food prices and the expected pass-through to the domestic economy. It noted that the existing subsidy regime on petroleum products is not sustainable in view of government’s current finances. In view of these factors, 5 the Committee noted, that inflation remains a major concern that cannot be ignored in the short- to medium-term. The MPC also noted with serious concern the existing low rates of about 10 percent paid on savings deposits and its implications for financial intermediation and the mobilization of long-term funds which is critical for enhancing investment in real sector economic activities, and hence, economic growth. The Committee felt that in preparation for the removal of the CBN guarantee of inter-bank market, banks need to provide reasonable incentives for the mobilization of savings for growth and financial inclusion. The Committee, however, stated its commitment to continue to monitor developments with a view to coming up with appropriate measures to address the issue. With regard to external reserves, the Committee observed that the fundamental structural problem of the country as an import-dependent economy was largely responsible for the continuing depletion of the external reserves. The continuing decline in reserves was accounted for by the payment for JVC cash calls, amounting to US$6,,867 million and US$5,,657 million in 2009, funding of the foreign exchange market to the tune of US$24,,83565 million as against US$25,,070 million in 2009 in the case of WDAS. Sales to BDCs amounting to US$5,,337 million in 2010 compared with US$4,,734 million in 2009, in addition to the payment of subsidies on petroleum product as well as other government external payment obligations. The Committee stressed that a significant portion of the foreign exchange outflow will be stemmed with the Petroleum Industry Bill because JVC Cash Calls alone accounted for a large proportion of the total net outflow in 2010. The Committee observed that if exchange rate had not been managed in a stable manner, inflation would not have moderated. The policy thrust on exchange rate stability is informed by the overwhelming impact of exchange rate pass-through on inflation, given the import-dependent nature of the economy. The MPC identified the greatest challenge facing the economy as the lack of flow of credit to the critical sectors, and the consequent need to unlock the flow of credit for critical investments in agriculture. SMEs and manufacturing sectors. To achieve this, government would need to create the right policy and regulatory environment, including the sustained fight against corruption, 6 strengthening of transparency and institutions, as well as implementing critical reforms. On its part, the CBN will continue to engage banks and take the lead in programmes and interventions to channel credit to the real economy. To this end, the Committee noted the initiatives being pursued by the Bankers’ Committee and urged speedy implementation. The Committee further stated that the economy is affected not only by monetary and fiscal policy measures but also by political risk and concerns about national security which affect investors’ confidence in the economy. In this regard, the Committee stressed the need to pay greater attention to the issue of security and how to manage uncertainty in the political environment. MPC Decisions In the light of the above considerations, the Committee committed to maintaining price stability by pursuing the current policy thrust of monetary tightening in view of the perceived inflation risks in the near term. The Committee took the decision to further tighten monetary policy. This was a decision taken by a majority of 11::1. The following measures were approved: 1. Raise the MPR by 25 basis points from 625 per cent to 650 per cent with immediate effect (a majority vote of 11::1); 2. Maintain the symmetric corridor of +/- 200 basis points by 7-5; 4 members voted for asymmetric corridor by 50 basis points increase in Standing Deposit Facility rate; 3. Raise the Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR) Ratio by 100 basis points from 100 per cent to 200 per cent with effect from February 1, 2011 with a majority vote of 11::1; and 4. With effect from March 1, 2011, raise the Liquidity Ratio (LR) by 500 basis points from 2500 per cent to 3000 per cent with a majority vote of 11::1. Sanusi Lamido Sanusi Governor.

India,2011-01-25,"Third Quarter Review of Monetary Policy 2010-11 Press Statement by Dr.D. Subbarao. Governor ""This morning, the Reserve Bank released its Third Quarter Review of Monetary Policy for 2010-11. Based on an assessment of the current macroeconomic situation, we decided to: increase the repo and reverse repo rates by 25 basis points (bps) each. Accordingly, the repo rate stands at 6.5 per cent and the reverse repo rate at 5.5 per cent; retain the cash reserve ratio (CRR) at 6 per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) of banks. With the increases announced today, since mid-March 2010, the Reserve Bank has cumulatively increased the repo rate by 175 bps and the reverse repo rate by 225 bps. Additionally, the CRR was increased by 100 bps. Banks have responded to this calibrated tightening by raising their deposit and lending rates, suggesting strong monetary policy transmission. In addition to changes in the policy rates, we made some decisions to manage the current liquidity situation. We decided to extend the two special measures currently in operation, viz.: the additional liquidity support to scheduled commercial banks under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) to the extent of up to one per cent of their NDTL; and a daily second LAF up to April 8, 2011. Considerations Behind the Policy Move 4. Let me now explain the considerations that guided our monetary policy stance for the remaining period of 2010-11: Inflation is clearly the dominant concern. Even as the rate itself remains unacceptably high, the reversal in the direction of inflation is striking. Primary food articles inflation has risen again sharply. Non-food articles inflation and fuel inflation are already at elevated levels. Non-food manufacturing inflation has remained sticky. There are signs of food and fuel price increases spilling over into generalised inflation. ii) Second, there has been a sharp rise in global commodity prices which has heightened upside risks to domestic inflation.2 Third, growth has moved close to its pre-crisis trajectory even in the face of an uncertain global recovery. iv) Fourth, the uncertainty with regard to global recovery has reduced. Global Outlook 5. Let me now give you a brief overview of the global economy. Advanced economies are showing firmer signs of sustainable recovery. Although uncertainty continues in the Euro area, there is an overall improvement in global growth prospects. However, inflation has edged up in major advanced economies even as a large slack persists, owing mainly to increase in food and energy prices. Whereas signs of inflation in the advanced countries are only incipient, many emerging market economies have been facing strong inflationary pressures, reflecting higher international commodity prices and rising domestic demand pressures. Significantly, food, energy and commodity prices are widely expected to harden during 2011, driven by a combination of supply constraints and rising global demand, as the advanced economies consolidate their recovery. This suggests that inflation could be a global concern in 2011. The Indian Economy Growth 6. Turning to the domestic macroeconomic situation, the 8.9 per cent GDP growth in the first half of 2010-11 suggests that the economy is operating close to its trend growth rate, powered mainly by domestic factors. The kharif harvest has been good and rabi prospects look promising. Good agricultural growth has boosted rural demand. Export performance in recent months has been encouraging. With the risks to growth in 2010-11 being mainly on the upside, the baseline projection of real GDP growth is retained at 8.5 per cent but with an upside bias. Inflation 8. Moving on to the inflation situation, the moderation in headline inflation observed between August and November 2010 was along the projected trajectory of the Reserve Bank. This trend, however, reversed when WPI inflation (year-on-year) moved up from 7.4 per cent in November 2010 to 8.4 per cent in December 2010, due mainly to sharp increase in the prices of vegetables, mineral oils and minerals. While the current spike in food prices is expected to be transitory, inflation stemming from structural demand-supply mismatches in several non-cereal food items such as pulses, oilseeds, eggs, fish, meat and milk is likely to persist till supply response kicks in. Non-food manufacturing inflation also remains above its medium- term trend of 4 per cent. Going forward, the inflation outlook will be shaped by three factors: on how the food price situation, both domestic and global, evolves; how global commodity prices behave; and the extent to which demand side pressures may manifest. We have raised the baseline projection of WPI inflation for March 2011 from 5.5 per cent to 7.0 per cent. This upward revision was based on several considerations. First, the upside risks to inflation, as mentioned in the mid quarter review of December 2010, have materialised as reflected in the increase in prices of metals and non-administered fuel. Second, there have been some transitory supply shocks which triggered a sharp increase in vegetable prices. Third, petroleum and3 aviation turbine fuel prices went up in early January which will add 9 bps to WPI inflation. While the impact of transitory factors is expected to dissipate, price pressures on account of demand-supply imbalances in respect of some commodities will persist. Monetary and Liquidity Conditions 12. While the year-on-year money supply (M ) growth at 16.5 per cent in 3 December 2010 was close to the indicative projection of 17.0 per cent, non-food credit growth at 24.4 per cent was much above the indicative projection of 20.0 per cent. Credit expansion in the recent period has been rather sharp, far outpacing the expansion in deposits. Rapid credit growth without a commensurate increase in deposits is not sustainable. Tight liquidity conditions persisted throughout the third quarter of 2010-11. While the overall liquidity in the system has remained in deficit consistent with the policy stance, the extent of tightness is beyond the comfort zone of the Reserve Bank, i.e., (+)/(-) one per cent of NDTL of banks. Above-normal government cash balances contributed to the frictional component of liquidity deficit. However, the widening difference between credit and deposit growth rates coupled with high currency growth accentuated the structural liquidity deficit. The Reserve Bank instituted a number of measures to mitigate the liquidity deficit such as: reduction in the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) by one percentage point; conducting open market operation (OMO) purchase of government securities of the order of over 67,000 crore; additional liquidity support to SCBs under the LAF; and introduction of a second LAF window on a daily basis. While the Reserve Bank will endeavour to provide liquidity to meet the productive credit requirements of a growing economy, it is important that credit growth moderates to conform broadly to the indicative projection. This will prevent any further build-up of demand side pressures. Accordingly, the projection for 2010- 11 of M growth has been retained at 17 per cent and that for non-food credit growth 3 at 20 per cent. The Reserve Bank will constantly monitor the credit growth and, if necessary, engage with banks which show an abnormal incremental credit-deposit ratio. External Sector 16. A brief, albeit important, comment about the external sector. In the first half of 2010-11, the current account deficit (CAD) expanded to 3.7 per cent of GDP from 2.2 per cent in the corresponding period of last year. Subsequent trade data indicate that exports have grown faster than imports which will improve the CAD. For the year as a whole, we estimate that the CAD will be close to 3.5 per cent of GDP. Risk Factors 17. Now let me highlight the risks to our growth and inflation projections: Food inflation has remained at an elevated level for about two years and the prospect of it spilling over to the general inflation process is rapidly becoming a reality. Imports as a means to supplement domestic availability for many commodities will become less of an option as global growth consolidates4 and capacity utilisation increases. This may accentuate demand side pressures. The estimated current account deficit of 3.5 per cent of GDP for 2010-11 is not sustainable. On top of the level of CAD which is a risk, the financing of CAD is an additional risk. Should global recovery be faster than expected, it may also have implication for the financing of CAD. The recent improvement in the fiscal situation owes largely to one-off revenues generated from spectrum auctions and disinvestment proceeds. However, the commodity price developments pose significant risks for fiscal consolidation in the year ahead. The efficacy of further fiscal adjustment will be influenced by the firming trend in commodity prices and the extent to which Government will allow this to pass through to consumers. The combined risks from inflation. CAD and fiscal situation contribute to an increase in uncertainty about economic stability that consumers and investors have to deal with. Monetary Policy Stance 18. The current stance of monetary policy is intended to: Contain the spill-over of high food and fuel inflation into generalised inflation and anchor inflationary expectations, while being prepared to respond to any further build-up of inflationary pressures. Maintain an interest rate regime consistent with price, output and financial stability. Manage liquidity to ensure that it remains broadly in balance, with neither a surplus diluting monetary transmission nor a deficit choking off fund flows. Expected Outcomes 19. Today’s policy actions are expected to: Contain the spill-over from rise in food and fuel prices to generalised inflation. Rein in rising inflationary expectations, which may be aggravated by the structural and transitory nature of food price increases. Be moderate enough not to disrupt growth. Continue to provide comfort to banks in their liquidity management operations. Guidance 20. Let me now give you some guidance. Current growth and inflation trends clearly warrant that we persist with the anti-inflationary monetary stance. Looking beyond 2010-11, the Reserve Bank expects the domestic growth momentum to stabilise. Inflation is expected to moderate from the first quarter of 2011-12, but several upside risks are already visible. The monetary stance will be determined by how these factors impact the overall inflationary scenario.5 Discussions with Banks 21. At today’s meeting with bank CEOs where the policy was released, banks welcomed the Reserve Bank’s policy stance. They shared the Reserve Bank’s concerns about inflation and agreed that the monetary measures and guidance about the stance announced by the Reserve Bank today were appropriate in the current domestic growth-inflation scenario. Apart from monetary measures, discussions with banks centred on: inflation dynamics; credit growth and asset liability management; and liquidity management and market borrowing situation. Banks felt that there was a need to step up investment in agricultural infrastructure and focus on better supply chain management. In this context. Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) will prepare a Discussion Paper to examine what banks could do to improve finance to enhance productivity and diversification in the agriculture sector. While welcoming the extension of additional liquidity support facility and the second LAF up to April 8, 2011, banks felt that the liquidity situation was still tight and there was a need to inject primary liquidity by the Reserve Bank. Banks indicated that they would endeavour to align the credit growth rate with that of the deposit growth rate. With a view to addressing asset liability mismatches, banks felt that there was a need to look into innovative solutions for financing the infrastructure sector – a major source of asset liability mismatch. In particular, they suggested that there was a need to incentivise raising of long-term resources by banks through appropriate fiscal measures. The recommendations of the Malegam Sub-Committee on the micro-finance sector were also discussed in the meeting."" R.R. Sinha Press Release : 2010-2011/1065 Deputy General Manager."

In his opening remarks, the Chairman welcomed members to the first meeting of the year and informed them of the intention to publish the names and attendance of members in this year's Annual Report and Statement of Accounts of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). He also announced that the press conference would hold at 230 pm. instead of the usual time of 300 pm. To that effect, the Deputy Governor. Economic Policy (DG (EP) suggested that the following day's meeting should commence at 900 am. to facilitate an early production of the communique. Minutes of the Previous Meeting 2) In reviewing the minutes of the 217th meeting of the MPC held during November 22 - 23, 2010, members felt that the entire section on matters arising should be re-written to reflect the actual concerns expressed by members. The following specific observations were also made: Page 3: last line, “attended” should be replaced with “attend”. Page 6: line 3 from bottom should read “credit classified as sub-standard” instead of “standard”. Page 28: line 10 from bottom should read, 2 “Application for Guarantee Certificate to the tune of N1075 million, made up of N1000 million to First Bank of Nigeria and N75 million to the National Economic Reconstruction Fund (NERFUND) had been approved under the SME Credit Guarantee Scheme, as at end-November, 2010”. Page 34: The Chairman observed that in an attempt to be precise, the minutes were robbed of the robust discussions held during the meeting. It was also pointed out that the decision reached was a “majority decision” and not a “unanimous decision” as reported. Matters Arising from the Minutes of the Last Meeting 3) The Chairman pointed out that the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) had actually purchased some of the banks' toxic assets, and that about N770 billion worth of bonds had been issued in respect of the non-performing loans (NPLs). He however, cautioned that as more money go into the recapitalization of banks, liquidity pressures might arise in the banking system. member noted that the structure of the minutes was such that a greater proportion of it was devoted to the banking system presentation, which was unusual for minutes of a Monetary Policy Committee. Such minutes, he said, should focus more on monetary 3 policy issues. It was also observed that substantial portions of the background paper presentations at the MPC found their way into the minutes, whereas a summary of their relevant sections would suffice. In essence, the minutes were expected to focus more on capturing the discussions of the presentations and the underlying arguments, rather than the details of the papers presented. member observed that the minutes of the 216th MPC meeting had been posted on the Bank's website in line with the decision reached at that meeting. Members welcomed the development and the Chairman directed that the approved minutes should be posted on the Bank's website within two weeks of each MPC meeting, after it had been vetted by the DG (EP) and two volunteers that are not members of the Committee of Governors (COG). In that regard, the DG (EP) suggested that instead of having a committee of three, the minutes should be sent to members and their comments returned promptly. The Chairman then concluded that members must take responsibility for going through the minutes. The whole idea of posting the minutes on the website was to make for openness and provide the public with more information on how the major decisions reached at the MPC were arrived at. In the same vein, the Chairman stated that the 4 minutes should contain a short note of about one paragraph from every member, supporting his or her vote during the MPC meeting. The MPC secretariat was mandated to collate the notes. Presentation by the Monetary Policy Department: 40 Economic Report and Proposals for Monetary Policy Actions The Economic Report covered developments in both the domestic and international economies, and outlook for the near-term. Domestic Economic Developments On the domestic economy, the focus was on developments in output, prices, fiscal, external sector and financial markets. The presentation indicated the following output and price developments: Projections by the National Bureau of Statistics indicated that real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 785 per cent in 2010 compared with the revised figure of 669 per cent in 2009. i The non-oil sector was projected to grow by 892 per cent in 2010 compared to 861 per cent in 2009, largely driven by the agriculture, wholesale/retail trade and services sectors with relative contributions of 239, 204 and 208 per cent, respectively. The oil sector was projected to positively contribute 005 percentage point in the third quarter and 004 percentage point in the fourth quarter of 2010 5 The year-on-year headline inflation decreased to 118 per cent in December, 2010 from 128 per cent in November 2010, and 136 per cent in September, 2010. Of the December inflation rate, food inflation contributed 646 per cent. Similarly core inflation declined to 109 per cent in December, 2010 from 117 per cent in November, 2010. Food inflation also dropped to 127 per cent in December, 2010 from 144 per cent in November, 2010. In terms of financial market developments, the report indicated that: At the inter-bank market, the call and OBB rates rose to averages of 845 and 743 per cent, respectively, in October 2010, in response to the upward review of the MPR and IT challenges experienced in September, 2010. The rates, however, moderated to 806 and 686 per cent in December 2010, while MPR remained at 625 per cent. v) The average maximum lending rate decline from 2220 in September, 2010 to 2184 per cent in November 2010. The average prime lending rate also fell from 1666 in September to 1611 per cent November, 2010. vi) The weighted average savings rate declined consistently from 32 and 195 per cent in March and June, 2010 to 149 and 148 per cent in September and November, 2010, respectively. The consolidated deposit rate which declined from 209 per cent in June to 207 per cent in September rose to 236 per cent in November, 2010. Thus the spread between the average maximum lending rate and the consolidated deposit rate widened from 1994 per cent in June to 2014 per cent September, before narrowing to 1948 per cent in November, 2010. vii) At the foreign exchange market, total demand and sales in 2010 amounted to US$29,,78570 million and US$25,,16781 million, respectively, which were equivalent to an average of US$30710 million and US$25946 million per auction, respectively. This compared with the total demand and sales of US$35,,47113 million and US$24,,20480 million recorded in 2009. The sales/ demand ratio per auction rose from 804 per cent in September to 910 per cent and December, 2010. On the average, 8411 per cent of foreign exchange demand was met in 2010. In December, 2010, the wDAS exchange rate recorded a depreciation of N026 or 017 per cent compared to the preceding month. In the BDC segment, the market recorded a depreciation of N144 or 094 per cent. Similarly at the inter-bank market, the average selling rates in December, 2010 indicated a depreciation of 022 per cent from that recorded in November, 2010. viii) The country's gross external reserves stood at US$3234 billion at end-December 2010, indicating a decline of US$216 billion or 63 per cent compared with US$3450 billion at the end of September 2010. The reserve level fell by US$1104 billion or 2545 per cent when compared with US$4338 billion as at end-December, 2009. However as at January 20, 2011, the external reserves stood at US$3326 billion, representing an increase of US$092 billion or 284 per cent when compared with end-December level. The report also indicated that, total foreign exchange inflows from January to December, 2010 was US$27,,87704 million, representing an increase of US$284077 million or 1135 per cent over the $25,,03627 million recorded in the corresponding period of 2009. Of this inflow, crude oil/gas revenue was US$26,,16669 million or 9386 per cent. Total 7 outflows for the same period amounted to US$37,,92357 million. The CBN funding of the foreign exchange market accounted for US$24, 83627 million or 6549 per cent of the outflows. Thus there was a net outflow amounting to US$10,,04653 million in 2010 compared with $10,,48483 recorded in the corresponding period of 2009 On the fiscal side, total federally-collected revenue for the period January  November 2010 stood at N5,,72576 billion, of which oil revenue accounted for N4,,85740 billion or 8483 per cent. The amount collected was lower by N77262 billion or 1189 per cent relative to the proportionate budget estimate of N6, 49838 billion. The overall fiscal operations of the Federal Government for the period (January to November, 2010) resulted in a deficit of N1, 52933 billion. The deficit was financed through DMO borrowing from the domestic market (N89379 billion). FGN Share of Excess Crude Account (N19954 billion). Privatisation Proceeds (N636 billion). World Bank Loan (N7503 billion) and Loans from Special Accounts (N33756 billion) The monetary analysis indicated that broad money supply (M2) increased by 67 per cent in December, 2010 (on an annualized basis) compared with the indicative benchmark of 2926 per cent for 2010. Net aggregate credit to the economy grew by 134 per cent, on an annualized basis, in December, 2010, compared to 596 per cent recorded in December, 2009. This was driven mainly by the substantial credit to the Government which grew by 6783 per cent, while credit to the private sector fell by 492 per cent (annualized) in December 2010 as against the benchmark of 3154 per cent for 2010. Reserve Money continued to remain below the indicative benchmark in most periods of 2010. As at January 10, 2011, the RM stood at N1, 53567 billion below the 2011 Q1 provisional indicative benchmark of N1,,78494 billion by N24927 billion or 1397 per cent xi) Demand for the Standing Lending Facility (SLF) decreased from N1,,35616 billion in November to N85961 billion in December, 2010. However patronage of the Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) rose from N44371 billion in November to N1,,09928 billion in December, 2010. xii) Nigerian capital market indicators recorded significant improvements during the year 2010. Similarly market capitalisation increased by an annualized growth of 5883 per cent from N498 trillion as at end- December, 2009 to N791 trillion at end-December, 2010. Developments in the Global Economy: xiii) The report noted that the performance of the global economy was mixed. In general, there were continuing signs of global economic recovery as more countries reported signs of rising output, moderating inflation, improving stock market indices and moderating exchange rate depreciation. Monetary policy rates in most countries across the world were reduced or kept low during 2010, in an attempt to enhance liquidity to sustain recovery and growth. Monetary policy innovations using quantitative easing were also adopted to pull some economies out of recession. Despite these developments, the report emphasized the 9 need to monitor developments in the Euro area economies, particularly the PIGS - Portugal. Italy. Greece, and Spain because of the potential adverse impact of recent developments in these economies. Other developments included: political upheavals in North Africa, especially in Tunisia and Algeria; flooding in Australia. Bangladesh and Sri Lanka with implications for food prices and security; and election stalemate in Ivory Coast with its possible adverse effects on the economies in the West African sub-region. Outlook for the Near-term In terms of near-term outlook, the report indicated that real GDP growth in 2011 could be higher than in the preceding year based on the following assumptions: ◦ Resolution of the Niger Delta crisis and government's amnesty programme for militants; ◦ Improved oil prices and output; ◦ Prospects of high agricultural output; ◦ Impact of banking sector reforms and the intervention funds; ◦ Stability in the supply and prices of petroleum products; and ◦ Expected improvement in electricity supply. With regard to prices, staff projections indicated that the year-on-year headline inflation would fluctuate between 111 and 123 percent in the next six months. xiv) Similarly, money market rates were not likely to moderate in the light of government borrowing. Staff forecasts indicate that if the current exchange rate policy stance of liberalizing the foreign 10 exchange market, with a view to enhancing foreign exchange supply was sustained, the exchange rate would likely remain stable in the near-term. Federal Government expenditure was expected to increase in the first quarter of 2011 due to election expenses and concurrent implementation of 2010 and 2011 budgets. Forward prices of oil posted on the New York Mercantile Exchange suggested that crude oil prices would rise during the rest of the year and beyond. xv) A summary of the business expectations survey conducted by Brickfield Road Associates (BRA) Limited indicated that: • All the sectors surveyed expected an improvement in the economy. Employment was expected to rise but manufacturing sector was anticipated to remain unchanged (cid::1) Inflation was generally expected to rise in the next three months (cid::1) Interest rate was generally expected to rise in the next three months (cid::1) Appreciation in the naira exchange rate was expected in the next three months. However some sectors expected some level of depreciation in the next six months. (cid:1) Input Cost was expected to rise (cid::1) Most sectors expected output to rise (cid::1) MPR was expected to remain unchanged for the next three months. However it was expected to be increased in the next six months xvi) Based on the review of economic developments and outlook for the near term, the report identified the following pressure points and policy challenges: 11 Pressure Points: (cid::1) Persisting fluctuations in the interbank call and OBB rates (cid::1) Tight credit conditions and high lending rates (cid::1) Expected high government expenditure in the first quarter of 2011 (cid::1) Depreciating naira exchange rate in the face of declining stock of external reserves Challenges for monetary and credit policy in the next two quarters included: (cid::1) providing adequate liquidity and easing credit conditions in the market; (cid::1) locking-in on lowering inflation expectation; (cid::1) Domestic financing of Federal Government fiscal deficit; and (cid::1) Moderating the declining stock of external reserves. Thus the key thrust of Monetary Policy in 2011 were identified as: - Focus on maintenance of price stability; - Sustenance of monetary tightening to address the emerging signs of inflationary threat; - Maintaining market-driven interest rates - Achieving stable naira exchange rate - Sustenance of output growth - Ensuring a safe, sound and stable banking system Proposals for Monetary Policy Actions In view of the foregoing, the following policy proposals were presented for the consideration of the MPC: Scenario 1: 12 • The MPC may retain the MPR at 625 per cent and the current interest rate corridor Pros: • Maintaining the current monetary policy stance would sustain market expectations at the current level with respect to inflation, interest and exchange rates. There would be no interruption of the current policy measures which would facilitate the achievement of their objectives. Cons • It might signal non-recognition of inflation threats arising from anticipated liquidity injections from election expenses. CBN quantitative easing policy and government expenditure, especially the concurrent implementation of 2010 and 2011 budgets in the first quarter of 2011. Scenario 2. (a) The MPR should be raised by 25 basis points to 650 per cent and the current interest rate corridor be retained; (b) Raise the liquidity ratio from 250 per cent to 300 per cent effective March 1, 2011; (c) Increase the cash reserve ratio from 10 per cent to 20 per cent effective January 31, 2011. selection of (a) to (c) or a combination of any of the three may be considered Pros: • This would signal monetary policy tightening in response to the prospects of inflationary pressures from anticipated liquidity injections from CBN quantitative easing, election expenses. AMCON and Government injections. Cons • Raising MPR. CRR and Liquidity ratio could 13 further increase lending interest rates and slow down the current policy efforts at channelling credit to the real economy. Scenario 3. The MPR should be reduced by 25 basis points with the current interest rate corridor retained. Pros • This would signal monetary policy easing in order to further spur economic growth and employment generation Cons: • Lowering MPR could risk the current moderation in the downward inflationary trend. Discussion of the Report In discussing the report members felt that the outlook for 2011 presented in the report was too optimistic. It was noted that there was likely to be increased spending in the run up to the elections in April 2011, so the risk of inflation would be on the upward side. Other factors that might cause inflation to trend upward were, increasing global food and energy prices, as well as spending by AMCON. Concerning the capital market, the sentiment was that it was in a recovery mood. Going by recent criticisms, a member wondered if the Bank had not abandoned its inflation objective given the consistent focus on financial stability. The Chairman 14 drew the attention of members to the Banks' reform document which clearly stated that the Bank would pursue a hybrid monetary policy that targets inflation and financial stability. On the depletion of the external reserves, members felt that the structural problem of our economy as an import- dependent country was partly responsible for the depletion of the reserves. The depletion of the reserves should be explained in terms of how much was spent on JVC cash calls, subsidies on petroleum products and funding of the WDAS, among others. The public needed to be informed that if we did not expend the reserves, we probably would have had to borrow. Also the point should be made that we perhaps would not have had inflation moderating if we had not expended the reserves to stabilize the exchange rate. However it was emphasized that the expenditure on JVC cash calls needed to be made transparent. In that regard, the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative needed to be revived. It was restated that the depletion of reserves could only be substantially addressed by attending to the fundamental structural problems of the economy. It was presumed inconsistent to preserve reserves simply as an end by itself, in a highly import-dependent economy. It would imply deliberately starving the 15 economy of essential imports where there are no import competing substitutes. Specifically whenever we are able to get the refineries working again, and import of petroleum products considerably reduced, and whenever we are able to boost the production of our import-competing goods, especially food items such as rice, and significantly reducing their imports, we would be back in a strong position that enhances our capacity to conserve and build our foreign reserves. However given the expectation for improved oil output and prices, the MPC was looking forward to the rebuilding of the external reserves and excess crude account that were depleted in 2010. Members welcomed the trend whereby inflation was seen to be declining, but wanted to know the major drivers of the decline. On savings, members expressed concern about the low savings rate which had declined to about 10 per cent. From an economic perspective, and for financial inclusion, it was important to consider small savers by rewarding them reasonably and fairly. They emphasized that if that was not addressed, the banks would face the problem of disintermediation when the CBN guarantee of interbank transactions was eventually removed. There was, therefore, the need 16 to set a minimum savings deposit rate, as was the practice in most developing countries. Accordingly the Committee mandated Dr. Vasudevan Asuri and BSD to conduct a research on minimum savings/deposit rates across countries, as a basis for drawing up policy guidelines on the issue. On capital market analysis, the Committee suggested the need to determine the peaks of market capitalization of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) in 2007/ 2008 and to see how the market had recovered in 2010 when viewed against the peak. The Committee, however, noted the general reduction in the share of the banking sector in the capital market from about 70 per cent during its peak to about 36 per cent. The MPC also sought to know how much foreign exchange was sold by CBN to Class “A” BDCs in 2010. Notwithstanding the economic developments cited above, it was pointed out that there were heightened political risks associated with the build up to the elections and the need to pay attention to security, especially in the volatile regions. It was emphasized that part of the political risk was the failure of policies to provide jobs to stem unemployment. After an exhaustive deliberation of the economic report the Committee agreed that the policy thrust would be to 17 sustain monetary tightening in 2011. At the end of the discussions, the Chairman provided the summary of the key issues, to enable members have a clear direction in preparation for the decisions during the next meeting day. The summary was as follows: Although inflation had moderated for two consecutive months, its outlook, however, pointed to an upward risk because of inflation pass through to the domestic economy, since the country imports petroleum products. There were also increased expenses associated with AMCON, and election spending, all of which would put upward pressure on inflation. He observed that foreign reserves were beginning to show signs of stabilization. He re-emphasized the Committee's commitment to price stability, and in 2011, hoped to see progress on various reform measures that should attract foreign investment and help in moderating the structural problems of the economy. The government was commended for its efforts at reducing overhead 18 expenditure. He further observed that the recovery noticed in the capital market was progressing satisfactorily. The greatest challenge facing the economy he identified was the lack of flow of funds into critical sectors, a development which called for the need to unlock the flow of credit into critical investments in agriculture. SMEs and manufacturing sectors. On the government side, there was the need to enunciate the right policies, as well as create the regulatory and institutional environment, including continued fight against corruption and provision of adequate infrastructure. On the Bank's side, the CBN would continue to engage the banks in reforms/intervention to channel credit to the critical sectors. After the summary, the MPC through Prof. Sam Olofin congratulated the Governor for being conferred with the Man-of- the Year award by the Nigerian Tribune Newspapers, among other awards. The Chairman thanked members for the support and restated that he dedicated the awards to the hardworking staff of the Bank as well as other stakeholders including the 19 Presidency. National Assembly, the Police and EFCC, who made whatever achievement that was recognized, possible. CLOSING The meeting rose at 559 pm with a prayer by Dr. Sanni Doguwa. DAY 2, 25th January, 2011 The meeting commenced with a prayer by Tunde Lemo. Deputy Governor. Operations. The Chairman did a recap of issues discussed at the previous day's meeting stressing that the easing mode in monetary policy action had been exited. He however, remarked that the challenge facing the Committee was to decide on whether to maintain the status quo as at the last MPC or further tighten monetary policy, and if so, the instruments to be used. He argued that inflation had been trending downward since November, 2010 and that could be one of the arguments for not doing anything. However he remarked that with the deregulation of the power sector and rise in crude oil prices, with possible reduction in subsidy or increase in government borrowing/spending, there was bound to be inflationary threats and erosion of reserves. Again from two months thence. AMCON was expected to have recapitalised all banks and that would have implications for system liquidity. The Chairman 20 further observed that Nigeria lost about US$100 billion in reserves in 2009 and 2010, respectively and that if the trend persisted in 2011, the country will either lose its reserves or face exchange rate depreciation, which was counter to the policy stance of exchange rate stability. More importantly, he noted that the continued demand for foreign exchange (and consequent depletion of reserves) was a reflection of the import-dependent nature of our economy. There was, however, the need to sustain the observed increase in external reserves. The above arguments, did not suggest the need for a more accommodating monetary policy stance. Rather the policy choice was clearly whether to continue with the last MPC position or tighten monetary policy. Having provided a synopsis of the policy choices and the arguments for and against each option, the next decision was on the instruments that would be employed. combination of the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR). Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR) and Liquidity Ratio (LR) were suggested. Nevertheless it was acknowledged that the effectiveness of the above measures could be limited by the existing structural problems in the economy. Individual Positions and Arguments for the Policy Choices 21 Having analyzed the issues, the Chairman invited members in turn to make their policy choices and justifications known. John Oshilaja: He agreed with the Chairman's position that monetary easing was no option. He however, argued that the issue of whether the MPC continued with monetary tightening was a more difficult one as we have not seen the inflation drivers working. He therefore, supported the maintenance of the previous position. Adedoyin R Salami He observed that the stance of the MPC at its previous meeting was to leave MPR unchanged and watch the outcome of events. Although he noted that there were some issues around the instruments to be used and also doubted whether low inflation was sustainable, he expressed the need for caution and, therefore, supported the maintenance of the previous position. Chibuike U Uche He held the position that the status quo should be maintained as we were in the middle of a banking reform and would want banking stability. He further stressed that a major objective of monetary policy was to promote real sector growth and that inflation was only anticipated, while available statistics 22 showed that it had not happened, but was actually trending down. He noted that a positive development as contained in the Chairman's statement was that the President himself was leading the campaign for prudent spending and economic management. He therefore, did not think that the benefits of taking a proactive action would outweigh the costs, hence he supported that the status quo be maintained. Shehu Yahaya: In contrast to the previous speakers he argued for monetary tightening. The argument was predicated on the tangible prospects for higher fuel prices, increased spending due to the impending elections, and additional injection of liquidity from AMCON activities. These factors may provoke inflationary pressures and Naira depreciation, which in turn may stroke further inflation and deplete the reserves. Tunde Lemo: Tunde Lemo argued that the Committee could ill-afford to ignore the increased spending that would arise as a result of the fact that we are in an election year. The negative real interest rate and the risk of financial disintermediation as a result of higher inflation were worrisome, if interest rate was not adjusted upward. He therefore, favoured monetary tightening. 23 Sarah Alade: In her submissions, she argued that the declining inflation was not sustainable and that we were losing reserves fast. If monetary policy was not tightened, then pressure from that window would make us to continue to lose reserves and that would have serious implications for the economy. She went further to argue that although there was no information on inflation expectation, the threat of higher inflation was real and would be exacerbated with election spending. She therefore, supported monetary tightening. Kingsley Moghalu: Kingsley Moghalu argued that although inflation was slightly reduced, it was not sustainable and that the reasons already adduced for the need to shore up reserves were quite compelling. He warned that if the Committee did not agree to tighten monetary policy then, it might be too late by the next MPC that would hold in March, 2011. Suleiman Barau: He supported the tightening of monetary policy and observed that it was consistent with the Committee's position during the last MPC meeting. He saw no reasons for a change to that position as the compelling reasons included the need to ensure 24 stability in the foreign exchange market and tame the upsurge in liquidity. Sam O Olofin He argued that given the anticipated liquidity upsurge and de-accumulation of foreign reserves, as well as information available from other indicators, the Committee should have started the process of tightening much earlier. He emphasised that the MPC should not allow the emergence of spikes but rather a smooth adjustment process in their monetary policy actions. He noted that it was better for the MPC to have incremental measures and also pay attention to impact lag of monetary policy. He therefore, favoured monetary policy tightening. Abdul-Ganiyu Garba: Having listened to previous arguments, he remarked that majority of members seemed to support the policy on monetary tightening which was the decision taken at the last MPC meeting in November but the argument remained which instruments to apply. However he suggested that in subsequent meetings, the Committee should spend more time observing the behaviour of the high frequency data, pre and post MPC meetings. Such observations and analysis would help the Committee determine what happened before and after the decisions at the MPC meetings. He observed that even though inflation appeared to be trending down, he was 25 concerned about the dwindling reserves. He further observed that the biggest threat to inflation was the value of the naira and that if the naira depreciated there would be mark up in prices. He therefore, voted for tightening, which was consistent with the position at the last MPC, but remarked that the choice of instruments was key to the outcome of the decisions. Danladi Kifasi: Danladi Kifasi remarked that having listened to the brilliant arguments of the earlier speakers, he was inclined to align himself with the majority opinion. However he was worried about the possible impact of monetary tightening on the treasury. He argued that if the Committee strengthened the naira so much, then the government would have"
United States,2011-01-26,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December confirms that the economic recovery is continuing, though at a rate that has been insufficient to bring about a significant improvement in labor market conditions. Growth in household spending picked up late last year, but remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit. Business spending on equipment and software is rising, while investment in nonresidential structures is still weak. Employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls. The housing sector continues to be depressed. Although commodity prices have risen, longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable, and measures of underlying inflation have been trending downward. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. Currently, the unemployment rate is elevated, and measures of underlying inflation are somewhat low, relative to levels that the Committee judges to be consistent, over the longer run, with its dual mandate. Although the Committee anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability, progress toward its objectives has been disappointingly slow. To promote a stronger pace of economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with its mandate, the Committee decided today to continue expanding its holdings of securities as announced in November. In particular, the Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its securities holdings and intends to purchase $600 billion of longer-term Treasury securities by the end of the second quarter of 2011. The Committee will regularly review the pace of its securities purchases and the overall size of the asset-purchase program in light of incoming information and will adjust the program as needed to best foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period. The Committee will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will employ its policy tools as necessary to support the economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with its mandate.

Egypt,2011-01-27,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release January 27, 2011 In its meeting held on January 27, 2011, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 825 percent and 975 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 85 percen. Headline CPI decelerated by 068 percent (m/m) in December following the 082 percent decline in Novembe. Despite the monthly decline, the annual rate remained broadly unchanged at 1028 percent in December due to unfavorable base effects from last yea. While the supply shortages related to fruits and vegetables in addition to red meat and poultry have largely eased during the past three months, their price increases since the beginning of 2010 continue to explain more than 40 percent of annual headline inflatio. On the other hand, core CPI inched up by 018 percent (m/m) in December compared to 069 percent in November, mainly driven by several food item. The annual rate increased to 965 percent in December from 893 percent registered in the previous month, largely led by unfavorable base effect. Moreover while more than 40 percent of annual core inflation is attributed to the acceleration in the prices of red meat and poultry witnessed during 2010, less than 25 percent is explained by the inch-up in the prices of non-food item. Meanwhile annual real GDP growth for 2010/2011 Q1 registered 55 percent following 54 percent in 2009/2010 Q4. Following the retrenchment in investment witnessed in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, its contribution to the GDP growth continues to be limite. This coupled with increased uncertainty about the nascent global recovery could potentially weigh on domestic economic activity going forwar. Against the above background, underlying inflation pressures arising from the ongoing economic recovery remain containe. Nonetheless the MPC is mindful of the risk of possible propagation of shocks related to food items to other price. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter. Dr Rania Al-Mashat Division Chief.

Malaysia,2011-01-27,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 2.75 percent. The recovery of the global economy is continuing, although the growth performance differs markedly across regions. While the advanced economies continue to register modest growth, most emerging economies have experienced strong growth. For the Asian region, while growth has moderated amid weaker external demand, domestic economic activity continues to provide strong support to the growth momentum. However, shifts in global liquidity have resulted in significant capital flows into the emerging economies, in particular, into the Asian region, and have brought with it risks to macroeconomic and financial stability. The region is also being affected by global inflationary pressures arising from the higher commodity and food prices. In the domestic economy, recent indicators point towards a sustained expansion in private sector activity in the fourth quarter of 2010. External demand, however, was affected by the slower global growth. Going forward, the Malaysian economy is expected to grow at a steady pace in 2011, underpinned by continued firm expansion in domestic demand amid more moderate external demand. Private consumption will be supported by sustained employment and income growth, while the favourable outlook in the domestic-oriented sectors and the expansion of new growth industries will provide support for continued private investment activity. While domestic headline inflation rose towards the end of 2010, it has remained low at 2.2%. The increase was mainly on account of higher food and energy prices. Prices are expected to increase at a modest pace in the coming months, driven primarily by rising global commodity and food prices. The assessment is that inflation will continue to be driven by supply factors with limited evidence of excess demand exerting pressure on prices. At this stage, the MPC considers the current monetary policy stance as appropriate and consistent with the current assessment of the economic growth and inflation prospects. The stance of monetary policy continues to remain accommodative and supportive of economic growth. However, the large and volatile shifts in global liquidity are leading to a build up of liquidity in the domestic financial system. While the liquidity in the financial system has been manageable, going forward, additional policy tools such as the statutory reserve requirement and macroprudential lending measures may be considered to avoid the risks of macroeconomic and financial imbalances.

Czech Republic,2011-02-03,"Press conference of the CNB Bank Board 1st Situation Report on Economic and Monetary Developments 3 February 2011 The monetary policy decision taken and the ratio of the votes cast At the close of the meeting the Bank Board decided by a majority vote to leave the two-week repo rate unchanged at 0.75%. Four board members voted in favour of this decision, and three members voted for increasing rates by 0.25 percentage point. Reasons for the decision Headline and monetary-policy relevant inflation will be close to the inflation target over the monetary policy horizon. Consistent with the forecast is stability of market interest rates close to their current levels initially, followed by a gradual rise in rates as from the end of 2011. Risks to the forecast are significant in both directions, associated with external developments, and balanced overall. The message of the forecast Headline inflation is currently close to the inflation target and will remain at this level over the entire horizon. Monetary-policy relevant inflation will grow at the beginning of this year; thereafter it will be close to the target together with headline inflation. Economic growth will slow this year due to fiscal restriction, fading investment in solar power stations and re-stocking, and a slowdown in external demand. The nominal exchange rate is gradually appreciating over the forecast horizon. Consistent with the forecast is stability of market interest rates close to their current levels initially, followed by a gradual rise in rates as from the end of 2011."
Euroarea,2011-02-03,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council confirmed that the current key ECB interest rates still remain appropriate. Taking into account all the new information and analyses which have become available since our meeting on 13 January 2011, we continue to see evidence of short-term upward pressure on overall inflation, mainly owing to energy and commodity prices. This has not so far affected our assessment that price developments will remain in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon. Recent economic data confirm the positive underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area, while uncertainty remains elevated. Our monetary analysis indicates that inflationary pressures over the medium to long term should remain contained. Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The continued firm anchoring of inflation expectations is of the essence. Overall, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, and the current monetary policy stance remains accommodative. The stance, the provision of liquidity and the allotment modes will be adjusted as appropriate, taking into account the fact that all the non-standard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions are, by construction, temporary in nature. Accordingly, the Governing Council will continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Following the 0.3% quarter-on-quarter increase in euro area real GDP in the third quarter of 2010, recent statistical releases and survey-based evidence for the fourth quarter and the beginning of the year continue to confirm the positive underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area. Looking ahead, euro area exports should benefit from the ongoing recovery in the world economy. At the same time, taking into account the relatively high level of business confidence in the euro area, private sector domestic demand should increasingly contribute to growth, supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to improve the functioning of the financial system. However, the recovery in activity is expected to be dampened by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors. In the Governing Council's assessment, the risks to this economic outlook are still slightly tilted to the downside, while uncertainty remains elevated. On the one hand, global trade may continue to grow more rapidly than expected, thereby supporting euro area exports. Moreover, strong business confidence could provide more support to domestic economic activity in the euro area than is currently expected. On the other hand, downside risks relate to the tensions in some segments of the financial markets and their potential spillover to the euro area real economy. Further downside risks relate to renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation was 2.4% in January 2011, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, after 2.2% in December. This further increase was broadly anticipated and largely reflects higher energy prices. Looking ahead to the next few months, inflation rates could temporarily increase further and are likely to stay slightly above 2% for most of 2011, before moderating again around the turn of the year. Overall, we continue to see evidence of short-term upward pressure on overall inflation, mainly owing to energy and commodity prices. Such pressure is also discernible in the earlier stages of the production process. These developments have not so far affected our assessment that price developments will remain in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon. Inflation expectations over the medium to longer term continue to be firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments are still broadly balanced but, as already indicated in January, could move to the upside. Currently, upside risks relate, in particular, to developments in energy and non-energy commodity prices. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxes and administered prices may be greater than currently expected, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years, and price pressures in the production chain could rise further. On the downside, risks relate mainly to the impact on inflation of potentially lower growth, given the prevailing uncertainties. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 declined to 1.7% in December 2010, from 2.1% in November. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector also declined, albeit marginally, to 1.9% in December, after 2.0% in November. These declines partly reflect the reversal of special factors that operated in November and do not indicate a general weakening of monetary dynamics. Overall, however, broad money and loan growth is still low, confirming the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that inflationary pressures over the medium to long term should remain contained. Looking at M3 components, annual M1 growth moderated further to stand at 4.4% in December 2010, reflecting the prevailing low remuneration of overnight deposits. At the same time, the yield curve has steepened somewhat further, implying that the attractiveness of short-term instruments included in M3 continues to decline compared with more highly remunerated longer-term instruments outside M3. On the counterpart side, the annual growth rate of bank loans to the private sector continued to conceal differences in the magnitude of growth across sectors. The growth of loans to non-financial corporations stood at -0.2% in December, after -0.1% in the previous month, while the growth of loans to households strengthened to 3.0% in December, after 2.8% in November. Taking into account the effect of derecognition of loans from bank balance sheets and looking through short-term volatility, the latest data confirm a continued gradual strengthening in the annual growth of lending to the non-financial private sector. At the same time, the latest data point to the overall size of bank balance sheets having contracted again after expanding for most of 2010, mainly on account of a reduction in lending between banks. It is important that banks continue to expand the provision of credit to the private sector, in an environment of increasing demand. To address this challenge, where necessary, it is essential for banks to retain earnings, to turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or to take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. To sum up, the current key ECB interest rates still remain appropriate. Taking into account all the new information and analyses which have become available since our meeting on 13 January 2011, we continue to see evidence of short-term upward pressure on overall inflation, mainly owing to energy and commodity prices. This has not so far affected our assessment that price developments will remain in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon. Recent economic data confirm the positive underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area, while uncertainty remains elevated. A cross-check of the outcome of our economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis indicates that inflationary pressures over the medium to long term should remain contained. Inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The continued firm anchoring of inflation expectations is of the essence. Turning to fiscal policies, it is now essential that all governments fully implement their fiscal consolidation plans in 2011. Where necessary, additional corrective measures must be implemented swiftly to ensure progress in achieving fiscal sustainability. Beyond 2011, countries need to specify concrete policy measures in their multi-year adjustment programmes so as to underpin the credibility of their fiscal consolidation targets. Experience shows that expenditure restraint is an important step towards achieving and maintaining fiscal soundness, notably when enshrined in binding domestic policy rules. Such a commitment helps to strengthen confidence in the sustainability of public finances, reduces interest rate risk premia and improves the conditions for sound and sustainable growth. The implementation of credible policies is crucial in view of ongoing financial market pressures. Substantial and far-reaching structural reforms, complementing fiscal adjustment, should be urgently implemented to improve the prospects for higher sustainable growth and employment. Major reforms are particularly necessary in those countries that have experienced a loss of competitiveness in the past or that are suffering from high fiscal and external deficits. Increased product market competition and labour market flexibility would further support the necessary adjustment processes in the economy. All these structural reforms should be supported by the necessary improvements in the structure of the banking sector. Sound balance sheets, effective risk management and transparent, robust business models remain key to strengthening banks' resilience to shocks and to ensuring adequate access to finance, thereby laying the foundations for sustainable growth and financial stability."
Romania,2011-02-03,"In its meeting of February 3, 2011, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided the following:. The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled for February 7, 2011, along with a 12-month calendar of NBR Board meetings dedicated to monetary policy issues. The annual inflation rate rose to 7.96 percent in December 2010, in line with the NBR forecasts, although significantly above the upper limit of the variation band around the target. The 2010 rise in the annual inflation rate (from 4.74 percent in 2009) was mainly the result of the standard VAT rate hike, to which the adverse impact of trends in food and fuel prices on international markets also contributed. The analysis of statistical indicators shows the persistence of aggregate demand deficit, of a current account deficit at sustainable levels and of the negative annual real dynamics of credit to the private sector. Meanwhile, it is worth noting the ongoing normalization in the level of bank rates for non-bank customers, along with improved liquidity conditions on the money market. The current forecast reveals the prospects of resumption in disinflation early in 2011 and its quickening once the first-round effects of the VAT hike have begun to dissipate. This implies a configuration of real monetary conditions in order to ensure a firm anchoring of inflation expectations so as to prevent the risks regarding second-round effects related to supply-side shocks. The risks related mainly to factors outside the central bank's influence  administered price adjustments, consistent continuation of the fiscal consolidation and structural reforms as well as future developments in external agri-food and commodity prices as well those arising from the international economic environment - require a further prudent monetary policy stance. In this context, the NBR Board decided to leave unchanged the monetary policy rate at an annual 6.25 percent and to continue to pursue an adequate management of liquidity in the banking system. Moreover, the NBR Board decided to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board is restating that the firm and thorough implementation of commitments agreed under the ongoing as well as upcoming financing agreements with international institutions is essential to further consolidate disinflation at the pace that would ensure the achievement of the medium-term targets and to restore confidence, a key pillar for a sustainable recovery of the Romanian economy. In this context, the NBR will vigilantly monitor domestic and global economic developments so as, via an adequate use of its available instruments, to ensure the fulfilment of its objectives of achieving and maintaining price stability as well as financial stability. The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, a document that assesses developments in the recent macroeconomic environment and the inflation outlook, and identifies the main challenges and risks to monetary policy in the period ahead. The quarterly Inflation Report will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled for February 7, 2011, along with a 12-month calendar of NBR Board meetings dedicated to monetary policy issues."
Philippines,2011-02-09,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the BSP's key policy interest rates at 4 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 6 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs and RPs and special deposit accounts (SDAs) were also left unchanged. The BSP's policy rates have been kept steady since July 2009. In deciding to keep the BSP's key policy rates steady, the Monetary Board noted that prevailing price and output conditions suggest that the stance of monetary policy continues to be appropriate for the time being. Latest baseline forecasts indicate that inflation will likely settle within the target range of 4 ± 1 percent for 2011 and 2012. Core inflation has been stable and inflation expectations have so far remained manageable. Moreover, the growth of credit and liquidity remains moderate and there is thus far limited evidence of spillovers or second-round effects of supply shocks. In particular, while food inflation has recently risen, the Philippines has been the least affected in the region by global food price shocks, mainly due to favorable domestic supply conditions. However, the Monetary Board observed that the balance of risks to the inflation outlook has tilted further to the upside, with more risks expected in the near future. Risks include food supply shocks coming from higher global food prices, the possible increase in domestic rice prices, and the potential impact of weather disturbances on agricultural output. Higher global oil prices and pending petitions for electricity rate increases also pose risks to the inflation outlook. In addition, demand-side price pressures could develop in the near future as actual domestic output continues to expand above historical trend. Meanwhile, a weaker global recovery could dampen external demand while a sustained strengthening of the peso should help temper the impact of imported inflation. In view of these conditions, the Monetary Board agreed that containing inflation remains the BSP's predominant policy thrust. It is prepared to undertake monetary action to arrest a potential build-up in inflation expectations and contain the second-round effects of supply shocks."
South Korea,2011-02-11,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.75% for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.75% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information, the Committee considers emerging market economies to have continued to show favorable performances and the major advanced economies to have also kept up their paces of recovery. Going forward, the Committee forecasts the global economy to sustain its pace of recovery; nevertheless, the Committee recognizes that the possibilities of future developments, for example heightened volatility of international commodity prices and international financial market unrest arising from the sovereign debt concerns in some euro area countries, remain as risk factors. For Korea, the Committee judges the domestic economy to have maintained its underlying upward trend, given for instance that exports have continued on their strong growth track and that domestic demand has steadily increased. Labor market conditions have also shown ongoing improvement, led by the private sector. Going forward, the Committee anticipates that the domestic economy will keep up its underlying trend, even in the presence of external risks. Consumer price inflation in Korea has increased significantly, driven by the prices of petroleum products and farm produce. In the coming months, the Committee expects high inflation expectations to continue and inflationary pressures to also persist as the economic upswing continues. In the real estate market, leasehold deposits have continued to rise, while housing prices in Seoul and its surrounding areas have shown upward movements and those in the rest of the country have sustained their upward trend. In the financial markets, long-term market interest rates have increased by a large margin, in response chiefly to the Base Rate hike in January, to inflation expectations and to the increase in volume of Treasury bonds issued. Stock prices, after having risen steeply boosted mainly by the uptrend in economic activity, have since fallen back and the Korean won has appreciated. Mortgage lending has marked no more than a slight increase, due primarily to seasonal factors. Looking ahead, the Committee will conduct monetary policy in such a way as to firmly anchor the basis for price stability while the economy continues its sound growth. In carrying out policy, the Committee will take overall account of financial and economic conditions both at home and abroad."
Peru,2011-02-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR FEBRUARY 2011 BCRP RAISED THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE FROM 3.25 TO 3.50% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to raise the monetary policy reference rate from 3.25 percent to 3.50 percent. The nature of this rise in the reference rate is mainly preventive given the current growth of rising international food and energy prices. This measure is aimed at preventing that inflation expectations will be influenced by these supply factors in a context of dynamism of the domestic demand. Future adjustments in the reference rate will depend on new information on the evolution of inflation and its determinants. Current and advanced indicators of activity continue showing a rapid growth of economic activity. In January the production of electricity grew 10.9 percent. Moreover, indicators of global economic activity confirm an improvement in the global growth outlook. Inflation in January recorded a rate of 0.39 percent, as a result of which annual inflation registered a rate of 2.2 percent. Core inflation, which showed a rate of 0.19 percent, accumulated an annual growth of 2.1 percent and remains around the 2 percent target. Inflation without food and energy recorded a negative rate of 0.05 percent, acummulated an annual growth of 1.39 percent. This results indicate that inflation in January was explained mainly by supply factors. The Board continues to oversee the projection of inflation and its determinants and stands ready to adopt future adjustments in monetary policy instruments in order to ensure that inflation falls within the target range. The Board also approved to raise the following annual interest rates on active and passive operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system as described below: Direct repo and rediscount operations: 4.30 percent. Overnight deposits: 2.70 percent. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.30 percent. The following session of the Monetary Program will be held on March 10, 2011."
Turkiye,2011-02-15,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the policy rates constant at the following levels: a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) at 6.25 percent, b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 1.50 percent, lending rate at 9 percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 8 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, lending rate at 12 percent. Recent releases on economic activity have been consistent with the outlook presented in the January Inflation Report. Economic activity continues to recover amid increasing domestic demand, while external demand remains relatively weak despite the recent pick up. Employment conditions continue to improve, yet, unemployment rates remain at high levels. Inflation is expected to further decline in February, display some fluctuations starting with the second quarter, and end the year at a level close to the January Inflation Report forecast. The measures taken by the Central Bank since November are reducing macro- financial risks by leading to a more balanced growth path, mainly through a slowdown in import growth. Moreover, the monetary tightening would restrain the demand side pressures on inflation. However, the Committee also notes that rising energy and other commodity prices pose supply side risks on the inflation outlook. In light of these assessments, in order to contain the risks towards price stability and financial stability, the Committee has decided to monitor the tightening impact of the implemented policy mix—a low policy rate, a wide interest corridor and high reserve requirement ratios—until the next meeting, and take additional measures along the same line, if needed. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Georgia,2011-02-16,"16.02.11 The NBG will increase the monetary policy rate to 8 percent. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on February 16th, 2011 and decided to increase to its Main Policy Rate (the refinancing rate) by 50 basis points, to 8 percent. Annual inflation reached 12.3 percent in January 2011. In the month of January consumer prices grew by 2.1 percent. This figure exceeds the target inflation set by the National Bank. It is important to assess correctly the reasons behind the inflation and its impact on future price level in the medium term. In the same way as in other countries of the region in Georgia high inflation is due to the hike in the world market prices of fuel and agricultural goods. Reducing such inflation using the monetary instruments is only possible under the conditions of significant economic tightening. Such exogenous factors affect the inflation only temporarily and central banks usually do not react to it (since the social cost of such reduction in inflation far exceeds its benefit). Although, it should be taken into account that food has a large share in consumers expenditure in Georgia, therefore the growth in food prices creates high inflation expectations. The latter, in turn, negatively affects the medium-term inflation, and keeping the medium-term inflation within the target range is the main task of the National Bank. Based on the aforementioned, the National Bank has been tightening the monetary policy since the summer, according to the actual risks. It should be taken into account that the monetary policy transmission influences consumer prices only after a certain lag. That is why the tightening of the monetary policy in the previous months has not been completely transmitted to the real economy. In January the interest rates on loans in foreign currency have grown up, which is related to the recent monetary tightening. Along with the interest rates' growth, the growth rate in the foreign currency loans has decreased. Since the beginning of the year both the annual growth rate of monetary aggregates and their volume have declined (the latter mostly due to seasonal factors). It is expected that during the year the annual growth rate of broad money will be within 20-25 percent, thus given the forecasted economic growth rate is in line with the inflation target value. It was already mentioned that the decisions reached at the precious meetings of the MPC so far have not been completely transmitted to the real economy. However, in order to control inflation expectations, it is advisable to further tighten the monetary policy  which was reflected in the decision of the Committee. The NBG will closely monitor developments in the economy and financial markets and will in due course act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will take place on March 16th, 2011."
Chile,2011-02-17,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 17 February 2011 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 0.25% to 3.5% (annual). Internationally, the outlook for growth in developed economies has improved, and the dynamism of emerging economies has continued. Concerns regarding financial risk in some European economies persist. Thus, difficulties in the recovery of developed countries are still an important risk factor for emerging economies. Meanwhile, international prices of commodities, especially foodstuffs, are still on the rise. Globally, headline and expected inflation have increased and a growing number of economies have been reducing their monetary stimulus. Domestically, output, demand and employment figures continue on a positive trend, in line with projections in the latest Monetary Policy Report. Inflation has behaved as expected and core inflation measures remain bounded. Private inflation expectations show increases, particularly in the short term. The peso has appreciated since the last meeting. The Board reiterates that it will be necessary to continue to reduce the monetary stimulus in the coming months, in line with forecasts in the last Report. The pace of this process will depend on the unfolding of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions. Accordingly, the Board will continue to use its policies with flexibility so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. * The Spanish original prevails."
Hungary,2011-02-21,"At its meeting on 21 February 2011, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at 6.00%. In the Monetary Council's judgement, the pick-up in economic activity is likely to continue over the next two years; however, the level of output will remain below potential throughout the period. Inflation is expected to be considerably above the Bank's 3% target in the coming quarters, due to the significant cost-push shocks hitting the economy. In terms of the medium-term outlook for inflation, the main risk is that expectations are unanchored due to a prolonged period of above-target inflation, and therefore the adverse cost shocks may have second-round inflationary effects. Strong external demand is expected to remain the main driver of Hungarian economic growth this year, with domestic demand likely to recover only gradually. The easing of tax burdens on personal incomes and the expected slow improvement in employment may stimulate household consumption; however, tight credit conditions and the sustained rise in commodity prices may act to restrain consumption. Large individual investment projects currently underway point to a pick-up in whole-economy fixed investment, but heightened uncertainty about the business environment and weak lending activity may press down on investment growth. The low level of core inflation and moderate earnings growth in the private sector are consistent with the view that weak domestic demand and high unemployment continue to exert discipline on price and wage-setting behaviour. However, the economy has been hit by adverse cost-push shocks. Rises in unprocessed food and fuel prices have led to the build-up of inflationary pressure in the economy. As a result, inflation may remain significantly above the 3% target this year. The extent to which the cost shocks feed through to consumer prices will be an important factor influencing movements in inflation over the medium term. The Council notes that it is important that the price and wage-setting decisions are consistent with significant spare capacity remaining in the economy and loose labour market conditions, despite the temporary upward effects on prices. Potential increases in wages, inconsistent with corporate performance, may pose a threat to meeting the inflation target as well as to job security. Although risk premia on Hungarian financial assets have fallen markedly in the past month, which may reflect lower perceptions of risks associated with some high-debt countries of the euro area and the slight recovery in confidence in domestic economic policy, they continue to be high compared with those in other countries of Central and Eastern Europe. In the coming months, the nature of the long-term structural budget measures to be announced by the Government may be a key factor shaping perceptions of the risks associated with the economy, in addition to global factors. In the Monetary Council's judgement, the policy tightening implemented in the past three months is likely to help bring inflation back close to the target after the first-round effects of the cost shocks wear off. The Council has therefore decided to leave interest rates unchanged. In the coming months, the Council will decide whether to raise interest rates again after considering upside risks to inflation."
Israel,2011-02-21,"21.02.2011 The Bank of Israel increases the interest rate for March 2011 by 0.25 percentage points to 2.5 percent To view this press release as a WORD file - Click here Background conditions Inflation data: The January CPI rose by 0.2 percent, above predictions of the forecasters, who on average expected an increase of 0.1 percent, and above the seasonal path consistent with the achievement of the inflation target, that would require a reduction of at least 0.2 percent. Excluding the effect of government measures introduced in January, the CPI increased by 0.1 percent. Government measures are expected to have a downward effect of 0.05 percent on the February CPI, and 0.06 percent on the March CPI.Inflation in the previous twelve months, excluding housing prices, was 3 percent. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: The average of forecasters' inflation expectations for the next twelve monthly CPIs remained at 3 percent, the upper limit of the target inflation range. Expectations calculated from the capital market increased again this month, and averaged 3.5 percent, above the upper limit of the inflation target range. Inflation expectations for the medium term are also higher than the target range. Inflation measured over the previous twelve months is expected to be above the upper limit of the target inflation range for most of 2011, and to return to within the range towards the end of the year. Based on the Telbor market (Tel Aviv Inter-Bank Offer Rate), the Bank of Israel interest rate in a year's time is expected to be 3.7 percent, and on average, forecasters predictions are that it will be 3.6 percent. Most forecasters expect the Bank of Israel to increase the interest rate for March 2011. Real economic activity: The National Accounts figures for the fourth quarter of 2010 and the latest economic indicators indicate that domestic activity accelerated, led by domestic demand. In the fourth quarter of 2010 growth reached 7.8 percent (annual rate), significantly exceeding the forecasts. That brought growth in 2010 to 4.5 percent. Exports excluding diamonds increased by only 2 percent in that quarter, while civilian imports excluding diamonds, ships and aircraft surged by 20.7 percent. Private consumption increased by a buoyant 9.8 percent, with purchases of durables increasing by about 40 percent. Fixed investment continued along its upward path, and grew by 15.9 percent in the fourth quarter. Investment in residentialconstruction increased by 13.8 percent in the second half of the year. It should be borne in mind, however, that these National Accounts figures are preliminary quarterly estimates that are likely to be updated later. The January composite state-of-the-economy index increased by 0.4 percent, another indication of continued economic growth. Consumer confidence indices remain stable, at a high level. The Bank of Israel Research Department index ofthe probability of a slowdown, based on Google searches, continues to showa probability below 50 percent. The Bank of Israel staff forecast at the end of December was thatinflation in 2011 will be 2.6 percent, with a gradual increase in the interest rate to about 3.3 percent in the last quarter of the year. The depreciation of the shekel and the increase in commodity prices that occurred in January are likely to lead to an upward revision of the inflation forecast to close to the upper limit of the target inflation range, and to a somewhatfaster pace of increases in the interest rate than in the previous forecast. The main risks to real activity and inflation in Israel derive from developments abroad and in the local housing market, and from the realization of geopolitical risks. The labor market and wages: The faster increase in economic activity in the fourth quarter of 2010 was also reflected in the labor market and in expectations of employment growth in the first quarter of 2011. The Central Bureau of Statistics survey of vacancies shows a 17 percent increase in the number of vacancies in the business sector in January, following reductions in November and December. The number of employee posts of Israelis increased by 4 percent in September-November compared with the previous three months, the nominal wage rose by 0.1 percent, and the real wage fell by 0.9 percent. According to trend data, the unemployment rate remained unchanged in December, at 6.8 percent. Health tax revenues in January were 4.5 percent higher, in real terms, than in January 2010. Budget data: The government surplus (excluding credit) in Januaryexceeded the level consistent with the seasonal path, and reached NIS 4.5 billion. This was the result of revenues that were about 2 percent higher than the seasonal path, and expenditure that was 8 percent lower than the path. After accounting for the effects of legislative changes and nonrecurring receipts, revenues in January this year were 6 percent higher than those in January 2010. This month several steps were announced that would cut theprices of a number of controlled-price items and would increase the minimum wage. The annual cost of this package is about NIS 1.1 billion. To ensurethat neither government expenditure nor the deficit increases, the plannedincome tax reductions for the upper two income deciles planned for 2012 are being postponed, and an across-the-board cut is being made. The foreign exchange market: From the previous monetary policy discussion held on January 23 until February 18, the shekel depreciated by 0.2 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. Following the measures relating to the foreign currency market announced by the Bank of Israel andthe Ministry of Finance and in light of the events taking place in Egypt, the shekel weakened at the beginning of the period, but it strengthened again with the announcement of the January CPI and the growth figures for the fourth quarter of 2010 that significantly surpassed expectations. In the period from January 23 to February 18 the shekel appreciated by 0.35 percent against the dollar (similar to the changes in the major currencies), and depreciated by about 0.3 percent against the euro. The capital and money markets: Between the monetary policy discussions of January 23 and February 18, the Tel Aviv 25 index remained steady,after fluctuations in trade that were heavily influenced both by geopolitical developments and by the figures on growth in Israel. In this period stock markets around the world showed a mixed trend--share price indices in the advanced economies performed strongly, while those in emerging market economies declined. In Israel yields on local currency government bonds increased by between 16 and 23 basis points (b.p.) along the entire curve, similar to the worldwide trend. The increase in yields was supported by the geopolitical situation. The CPI-indexed bonds yield curve becamesteeper: long-term yields increased by between 12 b.p. and 18 b.p., while short-term yields dropped by about 20 b.p., reflecting an increase in inflation expectations. The makam yield curve reflected an increase in yields along the entire curve of 16-23 b.p., against the background of the increase in the interest rate last month and expectations that the interest rate would increase sooner than previously expected. The yield gap between Israeli and US unindexed 10-year government bonds did not show any significant change this month, and remained at 140 b.p. In the corporate bond market the Tel-Bond indices reacted to the events in Egypt as did other investment channels--at the beginning of the period (January 23 to February 18) they fell, and then strengthened, so that over the period as awhole they did not change. At the same time, yield spreads narrowed, particularly on low-rated bonds. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spread increased considerably this month, from 115 b.p. to 145 b.p., in light of the developments in Egypt. The money supply: In the last twelve months the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 8.9 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 5.6 percent. The credit market:Total outstanding business sector credit increased by 0.6 percent in December, to NIS 759 billion. In the whole of 2010 this credit grew by 3 percent. Outstanding credit to households decreased by 0.4 percent in December 2010, and in the year as a whole it increased by 8.9 percent. The housing element of this balance increased by 1 percent in December, and in the whole of 2010 it increased by 11.4 percent. Total new mortgages advanced in January declined by 14.5 percent, following their 9 percent increase in December. Despite the decline in January, the monthly uptake rate of new mortgages remains high. The housing market: The high rate of house price increases continued. House prices--which are presented in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of house prices but are not included in the CPI--increased in November-December at a rate of 1.3 percent a month, following their increase of 1.4 percent a month in October-November. House prices continued to increase at a high rate, and in the last twelve months they increased by 17.5 percent. The housing price index, which is based mainly on renewed rental contracts and which is includedin the CPI, rose by 0.3 percent in January, the same as its rise in December. In the last twelve months the housing price index increased by 5.9 percent. The global economy: : Data published this month paint a positive picture of global economic activity. The latest indicators show continued rapid growth in the emerging markets, and an increased rate of growth in theUS. In the eurozone there are firmer expectations of increased demand thisyear, particularly in France and Germany. The UK stood out negatively witha slowdown in growth in the fourth quarter of 2010. The latest global indicators were better than previously expected, resulting in an upward revision of growth forecasts. In January the IMF updated its global growth forecast for 2011 to 4.4 percent (from 4.2 percent), which incorporated a marked increase in the forecast US growth figure from 2.3 percent to 3 percent. Theupheaval in the Arab world continued this month, and increased the level of geopolitical uncertainty regarding the Middle East. The demonstrations that started in Tunisia in December spread to other Arab countries. In Egypt the pressure brought about the resignation of the President. Commodity prices continued to increase this month. Inflation in the US increased last month, but remains low, while in the eurozone it exceeded the target again this month. Inflation in the emerging market economies continues to be high, and in China and India this led to increases in interest rates. The expectedtiming of increased interest rates in the US was brought forward somewhat. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to increase the interest rate for March by 25 basis points to 2. 5 percent is consistent with the gradual process of returning the interest rate to a more normal level intended to position inflation firmly within the target range, and to support the further recovery of economic activity, while maintaining financial stability. The rate of increase in the interest rate is not pre-determined, but is set in accordance with the inflation environment, growth in Israel and globally, the monetary policies of theleading central banks, and developments in the exchange rates of the shekel. At the current level of the interest rate, monetary policy continues to be expansionary. The publication of the January CPI brought the rate of inflation over the previous twelve months to above the upper limit of the target inflation range. Forecasters' inflation expectations for one year forward remained stable, close to the upper limit of the target range, and expectations calculated from the capital market continued to rise and reached an average of 3.5 percent last month. At the same time, the upward trend in inflation expectationsfor the longer term derived from the capital market persists. Economic indicators published this month show that activity expanded at a faster pace,led by domestic demand. The increased activity was reflected by the high growth rate in the fourth quarter, led--according to the National Accounts figures--by manufacturing activity, and was reflected also by the labor market and government tax revenues. Data on global economic activity were also positive, pointing to continued rapid growth in the emerging market economies and a certain acceleration in economic growth in the US economy. The steep increase in house prices continued; in the last twelve months they have risen by 17.5 percent. Although there was a drop in the volume of new mortgagesin January, the volume of housing loans is still expanding rapidly. The decision to increase the interest rate was taken despite the fact that interest rates of the central banks in the major advanced economies are at low levels,and the markets reflect expectations that they will not rise in the near future. Nevertheless, the expected timing of an increase in the Fed interest rate has been brought forward. Furthermore, some central banks in economies that are already showing relatively fast rates of growth continued the process of raising their interest rates again last month. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in Israel's economy and the global economy and in the financial markets. The Bank will usethe instruments available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, including keeping a close watch on developmentsin the assets market, and especially in the housing market. The minutes of the discussions prior to the above interest rate decision will be published on March 7, 2011. The decision regarding the interest rate for April 2011 will be published at 17:30 on Monday. March 28, 2011. 21.02.2011 The Bank of Israel increases the interest rate for March 2011 by 0.25 percentage points to 2.5 percent.

Mongolia,2011-02-23,"MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Ref No: 2011/02 Date: February 23, 2011 Embargo: Not for publication or broadcast before 1100 hours on Thursday, 24 February 2011. February 23, 2011 - At the meeting of the Board of Directors, the required reserve has been raised up by 4 unit percent. According to the statement of the National Statistics Committee, the inflation rate of Ulaanbaatar has reached 14.8% as of January, 2011. In 2011, the domestic demand is expected to rise significantly as the result of budget expansion, distribution of allowances for the citizens and the development of the mining projects. The external factors like the inflation growth in China and the rise in price of food and oil in world market put pressure on monetary policy. After the recession in 2008-2009, the countries have taking the macro prudential measures to lower the bank vulnerability to the crisis and to enhance bank security also necessary for Mongolia to keep up with making this change. Owing to these circumstances of tightening the monetary policy and improving the banking sector's possibility to stand against the risks, the decision to raise the required reserve by 4 unit percent to 9% has been made. The reserve requirement ratio was 14% till 2007 and it was lowered to 5% because of the economic condition of that time. THE BANK OF MONGOLIA."
Poland,2011-03-02,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 2 March 2011 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 1-2 March 2011 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e.: (cid:131) reference rate at 3.75% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate at 5.25% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate at 2.25% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate at 4.00% on an annual basis. Incoming data confirm consolidating recovery of the global economy at the turn of 2010 and 2011. In 2010 Q4 GDP accelerated slightly in the United States and the economic growth in the euro area stabilized at a moderate level. Rising external demand and the recovery in domestic demand have contributed to maintaining favourable economic conditions in Germany. Poland's main trading partner. Yet, economic growth in the majority of developed countries is still being curbed by high unemployment and ongoing adjustments in the balance sheets of households, enterprises and financial institutions. Major emerging economies and some small open developed economies have been tightening monetary policy. The effects of high fiscal imbalance and its planned reduction in the developed economies, as well as the effects of monetary expansion, including non-standard measures undertaken by major central banks, continue to add uncertainty for global economic growth outlook. Favourable macroeconomic data on major developed economies supported an improvement in financial market sentiment, yet, in the recent period, uncertainty about the political situation in the Middle East and Northern Africa has enhanced risk aversion. At the same time it strengthened growth of commodity prices in the global markets. High growth of those prices has triggered a rise in headline inflation in the global economy, especially in emerging economies. Surging commodity prices may also weaken economic activity. Data on GDP in Poland confirm that economic growth in 2010 Q4 stabilized at a level close to the previous quarter. Continuing relatively high economic growth was supported by a strong increase in consumption. The latter was driven by a rise in employment and accelerated growth in wages in the economy. It was also strengthened by a surge in advance purchases by households in anticipation of VAT rates increases in January 2011. Investment growth, on the other hand, remained low. The latest monthly data point to a continuing rapid growth in industrial output at the beginning of 2011 as well as to the absence of clear signals of recovery in investment demand and a decline in retail sales growth. At the same time, wage growth in enterprises remained moderate and employment growth accelerated, whereas unemployment rate (in seasonally adjusted terms) increased again. A further rise in labour force participation is conducive to an increase in unemployment. ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51. Lending to enterprises remains limited mainly due to reasons related to demand for credit. On the other hand, a relatively rapid growth in mortgage lending to households has continued (adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations) whereas consumer loans declined. In January 2011. CPI inflation rose to 3.8%, i.e. considerably above the NBP's inflation target of 2.5%. The rise in CPI inflation resulted largely from the increase in most VAT rates, increases in the prices of agricultural commodities and crude oil in the global markets and a rise in administered prices. According to preliminary estimates, core inflation also increased. The rise in inflation was accompanied by a pick-up in inflation expectations. The Council got acquainted with the projection of inflation and GDP prepared by the Economic Institute of the NBP, which is one of the inputs into the Council's decision-making on the NBP interest rates. In line with the March projection  under the assumption of constant NBP interest rates  there is a 50-percent probability of inflation running in the range of 2.8-3.7% in 2011 (as compared to 2.5-3.5% in the October projection), 2.2-3.4% in 2012 (as compared to 2.4-3.7%) and 2.1- 3.7% in 2013. In turn, the March projection sees the annual GDP growth, with a 50-percent probability, in the range of 3.3-5.1% in 2011 (as compared to 3.3-5.5% in the October projection), 2.3-4.8% in 2012 (as compared to 2.8-5.5%) and 1.7-4.4% in 2013. In the assessment of the Council, continuing economic recovery in Poland, which should support employment growth, may gradually increase wage and inflationary pressures in the medium term. At the same time, a considerable increase of current inflation - amidst economic recovery  creates a risk that heightened inflation expectations persist and may require further tightening of monetary policy. Yet, the Council decided that the January interest rates increase combined with uncertainty about the sustainability of acceleration in consumer demand and no signs of considerable recovery in investment, as well as sustained moderate wage pressure in the corporate sector and continuing rise in unemployment decrease the risk of inflation remaining above the inflation target in the medium term. Therefore, the Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged. An important factor affecting the monetary policy is the situation of public finances. An implementation of decisive measures aimed at permanently reducing the deficit of the general government sector and at curbing the increase of the public debt is necessary for macroeconomic stability and will allow the meeting of euro adoption criteria. In the opinion of the Council, introducing measures aimed at preventing fast growth in foreign currency lending to households is important for macroeconomic stability. Such measures can also contribute to increasing the effectiveness of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Therefore, the Council expects that measures aimed at curbing the supply of new foreign currency loans to households will be introduced. The Council maintains its view that Poland should join the ERM II and the euro area at the earliest possible date, after meeting the necessary legal, economic and organisational conditions. The Council has adopted the Inflation Report  March 2011."
Euroarea,2011-03-03,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting, which was also attended by Commissioner Rehn. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The information which has become available since our meeting on 3 February 2011 indicates a rise in inflation, largely reflecting higher commodity prices. The economic analysis indicates that risks to the outlook for price developments are on the upside, while the underlying pace of monetary expansion remains moderate. Recent economic data confirm that the underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area remains positive; however, uncertainty remains elevated. The current very accommodative stance of monetary policy lends considerable support to economic activity. It is essential that the recent rise in inflation does not give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures over the medium term. Strong vigilance is warranted with a view to containing upside risks to price stability. Overall, the Governing Council remains prepared to act in a firm and timely manner to ensure that upside risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. The continued firm anchoring of inflation expectations is of the essence. The Governing Council today also decided to continue conducting its main refinancing operations (MROs) and the special-term refinancing operations with a maturity of one maintenance period as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of the sixth maintenance period of 2011 on 12 July 2011. Furthermore, the Governing Council decided to conduct the three-month longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) to be allotted on 27 April, 25 May and 29 June 2011 as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment. The rates in these three-month operations will be fixed at the average rate of the MROs over the life of the respective LTRO. As we have stated before, the provision of liquidity and the allotment modes will be adjusted as appropriate, taking into account the fact that all the non-standard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions are, by construction, temporary in nature. Accordingly, the Governing Council will continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Following the 0.3% quarter-on-quarter increase in euro area real GDP in both the third and the fourth quarter of 2010, recent statistical releases and survey-based evidence continue to confirm the positive underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area at the beginning of 2011. Looking ahead, euro area exports should continue to be supported by the ongoing recovery in the world economy. At the same time, taking into account the relatively high level of business confidence in the euro area, private sector domestic demand should increasingly contribute to growth, benefiting from the very accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to improve the functioning of the financial system. However, the recovery in activity is expected to be dampened somewhat by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors. This assessment is also reflected in the March 2011 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real GDP growth in a range between 1.3% and 2.1% in 2011 and between 0.8% and 2.8% in 2012. Compared with the December 2010 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the lower ends of these ranges have been shifted upwards, reflecting better prospects for the global economy  and thus for euro area exports  as well as for domestic demand. The March 2011 ECB staff projections are broadly in line with forecasts by international organisations. In the Governing Council's assessment, the risks to this economic outlook are broadly balanced in a context of elevated uncertainty. On the one hand, global trade may continue to grow more rapidly than expected, thereby supporting euro area exports. Moreover, strong business confidence could provide more support to domestic economic activity in the euro area than is currently expected. On the other hand, downside risks relate to the ongoing tensions in some segments of the financial markets and their potential spillover to the euro area real economy. Downside risks also relate to further increases in commodity prices, in particular in view of renewed geopolitical tensions, and to protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation was 2.4% in February 2011, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, after 2.3% in January. The increase in inflation rates in early 2011 largely reflects higher commodity prices. Pressure stemming from the sharp increases in energy and food prices is also discernible in the earlier stages of the production process. It is paramount that the rise in HICP inflation does not lead to second-round effects and thereby give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures over the medium term. Inflation expectations over the medium to longer term must remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The March 2011 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area foresee annual HICP inflation in a range between 2.0% and 2.6% for 2011 and between 1.0% and 2.4% for 2012. In comparison with the December 2010 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the ranges for HICP inflation have been shifted upwards. This is mainly due to the considerable rise in energy and food prices. It should be stressed that the projections are based on commodity price futures as of mid-February 2011, and therefore do not take into account the most recent oil price increases. Moreover, it needs to be emphasised that the projections assume continued moderate domestic wage and price-setting behaviour. Risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments are on the upside. They relate, in particular, to higher than assumed increases in energy and non-energy commodity prices. Furthermore, increases in indirect taxes and administered prices may be greater than currently assumed, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. Finally, risks also relate to stronger than expected domestic price pressures in the context of the ongoing recovery in activity. Price and wage setters' behaviour should not lead to broadly based second-round effects stemming from higher commodity prices. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 declined to 1.5% in January 2011, from 1.7% in December 2010, while the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector increased to 2.4% in January, from 1.9% in December. Looking beyond the movements in individual months and the effects of special factors, trends in broad money and loan growth confirm the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is still moderate and that inflationary pressures over the medium to longer term should remain contained. At the same time, the low level of money and credit growth has thus far led to only a partial unwinding of the large amounts of monetary liquidity accumulated in the economy prior to the period of financial tensions. This liquidity may facilitate the accommodation of price pressures currently emerging in commodity markets as a result of strong economic growth and ample liquidity at the global level. Looking at M3 components, annual M1 growth moderated further to stand at 3.2% in January 2011, reflecting the prevailing low remuneration of overnight deposits. At the same time, the yield curve steepened somewhat further at the start of the year, implying that the attractiveness of short-term instruments included in M3 continues to decline compared with more highly remunerated longer-term instruments outside M3. On the counterpart side, the rise in the annual growth rate of bank loans to the private sector in January was due to stronger lending to both households and non-financial corporations. The growth of loans to non-financial corporations turned positive, to stand at 0.4% in January, after -0.2% in December, while the growth of loans to households strengthened further to 3.1%, from 2.9% in December. Overall, lending to the non-financial private sector has gradually strengthened over the past few quarters, as the economic recovery gathered momentum. The latest data also confirm that banks have continued to expand their lending to the euro area economy, while at the same time keeping the overall size of their balance sheets broadly unchanged. It is important that banks continue to expand the provision of credit to the private sector, in an environment of increasing demand. To address this challenge, where necessary, it is essential for banks to retain earnings, to turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or to take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. In particular, banks that currently have limited access to market financing urgently need to increase their capital and their efficiency. To sum up, the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The information which has become available since our meeting on 3 February 2011 indicates a rise in inflation, largely reflecting higher commodity prices. The economic analysis indicates that risks to the outlook for price developments are on the upside, while the cross-check with the monetary analysis indicates that the underlying pace of monetary expansion remains moderate. Recent economic data confirm that the underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area remains positive; however, uncertainty remains elevated. The current very accommodative stance of monetary policy lends considerable support to economic activity. It is essential that the recent rise in inflation does not give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures over the medium term. Strong vigilance is warranted with a view to containing upside risks to price stability. Overall, the Governing Council remains prepared to act in a firm and timely manner to ensure that upside risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. The continued firm anchoring of inflation expectations is of the essence. Turning to fiscal policies, all governments need to fully implement their fiscal consolidation plans in 2011. Where necessary, additional corrective measures must be implemented swiftly to ensure progress in achieving fiscal sustainability. Beyond 2011, countries need to specify ambitious and concrete policy measures in their multi-year adjustment programmes, so as to underpin the credibility of their fiscal consolidation targets of ensuring a rapid correction of excessive deficits and returning to a close-to-balance or surplus position. Strengthening confidence in the sustainability of public finances is key, as this will reduce interest rate risk premia and improve the conditions for sound and sustainable growth. At the same time, it is crucial that substantial and far-reaching structural reforms be implemented in the euro area to strengthen its growth potential, competitiveness and flexibility. In the case of product markets, policies that enhance competition and innovation should, in particular, be further pursued. On the labour market, the priority must be to enhance wage flexibility and incentives to work, and to remove labour market rigidities. The current sovereign debt crisis in the euro area has reinforced the need for an ambitious reform of the economic governance framework of the euro area. The Governing Council of the ECB is of the view that the legislative proposals which have been put forward by the European Commission go some way to improving economic and budgetary surveillance in the euro area. However, they fall short of the necessary quantum leap in the surveillance of the euro area which is necessary to ensure the smooth functioning of Economic and Monetary Union. As outlined in the ECB's opinion of 17 February 2011 on these proposals, more stringent requirements, more automaticity in the procedures and a clearer focus on the most vulnerable countries with losses in competitiveness are required to ensure that the new framework will indeed be effective in the long run."
Egypt,2011-03-10,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release March 10, 2011 In its meeting held on March 10, 2011, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 825 percent and 975 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 85 percen. The CBE has decided to launch regular repurchasing agreements (repo) as part of its monetary policy operational framework on every Tuesday starting March 22, 201. The main open market operation will be a 7‐day repo set by the MPC at 925 percen. The political landscape in Egypt has undergone significant transformations since the last MPC meeting with implications on economic activity and financial market. On the one hand, market liquidity conditions have come under pressure, while the balance of risks surrounding the inflation and GDP outlooks has change. In order to ensure that the prevailing short‐term market rates are consistent with the MPCʹs policy rate based on the continuous assessment of macroeconomic developments and the price stability mandate, the CBE has decided to introduce repos as part of its monetary policy operational framewor. Headline CPI inched up by 012 percent (m/m) in February compared to 102 percent in January, while the annual rate declined slightly from 1079 percent to 1071 percent on the back of a favorable base effect from last yea. While the early days in February witnessed a marked increase in food prices driven by disruptions in production lines as well as transportation networks this was largely reversed in recent week. This has been also reflected in core CPI which inched up by 011 percent (m/m) in February compared to 074 percent in January while the annual rate declined to 951 percent compared to 974 percen. It is important to underscore that the pick up in international food prices since late 2010 have had limited spillover effects on domestic food price. Nonetheless if the recent increases in international food prices prove to be persistent this would pose an upside risk to the inflation outloo. The past six weeks have witnessed interruptions in economic activity triggered by the domestic political event. The current political uncertainty will continue to have ramifications on both consumption as well as investment decisions, adversely weighing on key sectors within the econom. Moreover there is heightened uncertainty related to the global recovery on the back of higher international oil prices given political tensions in the regio. These factors, combined, increase the downside risks to domestic GDP going forwar. Against the above background, the expected slowdown in economic growth could largely offset the upside risks on inflation from the rising international food price. Given the balance of risks on the inflation and GDP outlooks and the increased uncertainty at this juncture, the MPC judges that the current key CBE rates are appropriat. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium‐ter. Dr Rania Al‐Mashat Division Chief.

South Korea,2011-03-10,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points to 3.00%. In a related action, the Committee also raised the interest rate on Aggregate Credit Ceiling Loans by 25 basis points from 1.25% to 1.50%. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points to 3.00%. Based on currently available information, the Committee considers emerging market economies to have continued to show favorable performances and the major advanced economies to have also kept up their paces of recovery. Going forward, the Committee recognizes the existence of downside risk factors, including political unrest in North Africa and the Middle East, rising oil and other international commodity prices, and sovereign debt concerns in some euro area countries; nevertheless, the Committee forecasts the global economy to sustain its pace of recovery. For Korea, the Committee judges the domestic economy to have maintained its underlying upward trend, given for instance that exports have continued on their strong growth track and that domestic demand has steadily increased. Labor market conditions have also shown ongoing improvement, led by the private sector. Going forward, the Committee anticipates that the domestic economy will keep up its underlying trend, even in the presence of external risks. Consumer price inflation in Korea rose to 4.5% in February, due mostly to the rises in prices of petroleum products, agricultural, livestock and fisheries products, and personal services. In the coming months, this high rising price trend may persist, driven largely by increased demand pressures from the economic upswing, by instability of international commodity prices, and by elevated inflation expectations. As for housing prices, the upward movements in Seoul and its surrounding areas have continued and the upward trend in the rest of the country has accelerated, while leasehold deposits have continued to rise. In the financial markets, the volatilities of both stock prices and long-term market interest rates have increased, in response chiefly to external risk factors and to the steep uptrend in prices. The pace of growth in mortgage lending has accelerated somewhat compared to last month. Looking ahead, the Committee, while taking overall account of financial and economic conditions both at home and abroad, will conduct monetary policy with an emphasis on ensuring that the basis for price stability is firmly anchored while the economy continues its sound growth."
Malaysia,2011-03-11,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 2.75 percent. The global economy continues to recover, although the growth performance differs markedly across the regions. The advanced economies continue to record modest growth. In the region, while growth has moderated amid weaker external demand, domestic activity remains robust. Global inflation is increasing primarily due to the rising energy and commodity prices. For several countries, this has been exacerbated by domestic demand conditions which have prompted policy responses. Meanwhile, most emerging economies, particularly in Asia, continue to be affected by significant shifts in global liquidity, which have increased the risks to macroeconomic and financial stability. In the domestic economy, latest available indicators suggest continued expansion in private consumption and sustained business spending activity amid more modest growth in external demand. Going forward, economic growth is expected to be moderate in the earlier part of the year and to improve during the course of the year, driven by strong expansion in domestic demand. Private consumption will continue to be an important driver of growth, supported by sustained employment and income growth. Private investment is also projected to strengthen, underpinned by the improving outlook for the domestic economy and further expansion of new growth industries. Domestic headline inflation has increased to 2.4% in January 2011. Driven primarily by the significant increases in global commodity and energy prices, domestic prices are expected to continue to rise. There are, however, some incipient signs that domestic demand factors could result in possible upward pressure on prices in the latter part of the year in line with the sustained expansion in economic activity. Moving forward, while the stance of monetary policy is expected to remain supportive of growth, the degree of monetary accommodation may be reviewed given the sustained growth in the economy and risks to inflation. This is to ensure the sustainability of the growth prospects of the Malaysian economy. Bank Negara Malaysia 11 March 2011."
Peru,2011-03-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR MARCH 2011 BCRP RAISES THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE FROM 3.50% TO 3.75% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to raise the monetary policy reference rate from 3.50 percent to 3.75 percent. The nature of this rise in the reference rate is mainly preventive in a context of rising international food and energy prices. This measure is aimed at offsetting the potential impact of these supply factors on inflation expectations in a context of growth of domestic demand. Future adjustments in the reference rate will depend on new information on the evolution of inflation and its determinants. Current and advanced indicators of activity continue showing a rapid growth of economic activity. In February the production of electricity grew 10.1 percent. On the other hand, even though more favorable indicators of global economic activity are being observed, there are still risks associated with the fiscal situation in some industrialized countries and with the crisis in the Middle East and North Africa. Inflation in February recorded a rate of 0.38 percent, as a result of which annual inflation registered a rate of 2.23 percent. Core inflation, which showed a rate of 0.21 percent, accumulated an annual growth of 2.14 percent and remains around the 2 percent target. Inflation excluding food and energy showed a rate of 0.17 percent and an accumulated annual rate of 1.57 percent. These results would be indicating that the rate of inflation in February is mainly explained by supply factors. The Board continues to oversee the projection of inflation and its determinants and stands ready to adopt future adjustments in monetary policy instruments in order to ensure that inflation falls within the target range. The Board also approved to raise the following annual interest rates on active and passive operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system as detailed below: Overnight deposits: 2.95 percent. Direct repo and rediscount operations: 4.55 percent. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.55 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for April on its session of April 7, 2011."
United States,2011-03-15,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January suggests that the economic recovery is on a firmer footing, and overall conditions in the labor market appear to be improving gradually. Household spending and business investment in equipment and software continue to expand. However, investment in nonresidential structures is still weak, and the housing sector continues to be depressed. Commodity prices have risen significantly since the summer, and concerns about global supplies of crude oil have contributed to a sharp run-up in oil prices in recent weeks. Nonetheless, longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable, and measures of underlying inflation have been subdued. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. Currently, the unemployment rate remains elevated, and measures of underlying inflation continue to be somewhat low, relative to levels that the Committee judges to be consistent, over the longer run, with its dual mandate. The recent increases in the prices of energy and other commodities are currently putting upward pressure on inflation. The Committee expects these effects to be transitory, but it will pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations. The Committee continues to anticipate a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability. To promote a stronger pace of economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with its mandate, the Committee decided today to continue expanding its holdings of securities as announced in November. In particular, the Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its securities holdings and intends to purchase $600 billion of longer-term Treasury securities by the end of the second quarter of 2011. The Committee will regularly review the pace of its securities purchases and the overall size of the asset-purchase program in light of incoming information and will adjust the program as needed to best foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period. The Committee will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will employ its policy tools as necessary to support the economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with its mandate. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; William C Dudley.

Georgia,2011-03-16,"16.03.11 The NBG will keep the monetary policy rate unchanged at 8 percent. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on March 16th, 2011 and decided to keep its Main Policy Rate (the refinancing rate) unchanged at 8 percent. Annual inflation reached 13.7 percent in February 2011. In the month of February consumer prices grew by 2.8 percent. As in the recent months, the inflation in February was caused mainly by the increase in food prices, accounting for the 12.4 percentage points of the total annual inflation. At the same time the prices in the services' sector grew only by 1.9 percent. The inflation caused by the external shocks is a temporary phenomenon and according to the current forecasts it is expected that the inflation rate will start decreasing in several months' time. The monetary tightening pursued recently by the National Bank has already started to influence the economy, which was reflected in the decrease of both GEL and foreign currency loans' growth rates. As a result the seasonally adjusted growth rate of broad money aggregates has been close to zero since the beginning of the year, whereas respective annual growth rates have been decreasing. Recently the prices for certain food products (wheat and sugar) and oil prices on the world markets have been slightly declining. In case such trend will prevail the consumer prices in Georgia are expected to decrease. Based on the aforementioned, the Monetary Policy Committee decided at present not to tighten the monetary policy further. The NBG will closely monitor developments in the economy and financial markets and will in due course act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will take place on April 13th, 2011."
Chile,2011-03-17,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 17 March 2011 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 50 basis points to 4.0% (annual). Internationally, political tension in the Arab countries and the earthquake and tsunami in Japan have provoked increased uncertainty and volatility in financial and commodity markets. While financial risks in some European economies persist, developed economies continue to grow and emerging markets remain dynamic. Globally, headline and expected inflation have increased and a growing number of economies have reduced their monetary stimulus. Domestically, output, demand and employment figures continue on a positive trend. Inflation has behaved as expected and measures of core inflation remain bounded. However, the rise in international commodity prices, in particular that of oil, have caused an increase in private short‐run inflation expectations. The Board reiterates that it will be necessary to continue to reduce the monetary stimulus in the coming months. The pace of this process will depend on the unfolding of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions. Accordingly, the Board will continue to use its policies with flexibility so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. * The Spanish original prevails."
India,2011-03-17,"Mid-Quarter Monetary Policy Review: March 2011 Monetary Measures On the basis of the current macroeconomic assessment, it has been decided to: increase the repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 25 basis points from 6.5 per cent to 6.75 per cent with immediate effect; and increase the reverse repo rate under the LAF by 25 basis points from 5.5 per cent to 5.75 per cent with immediate effect. Global Economy The global scenario presents a mixed picture. While growth in emerging market economies (EMEs) remains strong, that in the US and the Euro area is clearly gaining momentum. However, the sharp increase in oil prices as a result of the turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa is adding uncertainty to the pace of global recovery. Further, coming on top of already elevated food and other commodity prices, the spike in oil prices has engendered inflation concerns. Inflationary pressures in EMEs are already high as output gaps have narrowed, while headline inflation has risen noticeably in a number of advanced economies, especially in the Euro area and the UK. Consequently, an increasing number of EMEs have begun monetary tightening, while the debate on exit from the accommodative monetary stance has come to the fore in the advanced economies. It is as yet too early to assess the macroeconomic consequences of the natural disaster in Japan. As normalcy is restored, expenditure on reconstruction may provide a boost to the economy. However, substitution of thermal for nuclear energy in Japan may exert further pressure on petroleum prices. Domestic Economy Growth Central Statistical Organisation's recently released estimate of GDP growth of 8.6 per cent for 2010-11 is consistent with the Reserve Bank's projection set out in the Third Quarter Review. The area sown under the Rabi crop is higher than in last year which augurs well for agricultural production. Even as the index of industrial production (IIP) continues to be volatile, other indicators, such as the latest Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), direct and indirect tax collections, merchandise exports and bank credit, suggest that the growth momentum persists. Lead indicators2 of services sector activity also remain robust. However, continuing uncertainty about energy and commodity prices may vitiate the investment climate, posing a threat to the current growth trajectory. In particular, the weak performance of capital goods in the IIP suggests that investment momentum may be slowing down. Inflation After a slight moderation in January, headline WPI inflation reversed in February 2011 accompanied by a sharp increase in non-food manufactured products inflation. As expected, the food article prices have declined substantially since January 2011. However, the prices of protein sources such as milk and ‘eggs, meat and fish' continued to remain high reflecting structural demand-supply imbalances. A number of measures contained in the Budget for 2011-12 to improve the agricultural supply response in the medium-term will aid in redressing these imbalances. Fuel prices remain high, reflecting the global trend, with potential for further rise. Significantly, non-food manufactured products inflation, an indicator of demand side pressure, rose sharply from 4.8 per cent in January to 6.1 per cent in February and continues to stay well above its medium-term trend. The acceleration was spread across manufacturing activities, indicating that producers are able to pass on higher input prices to consumers. In its Third Quarter Review, the Reserve Bank had projected year-on-year WPI inflation for March 2011 at 7 per cent. However, further upside risks have stemmed from high international crude prices, their impact on freely priced petroleum products, the increase in administered coal prices and pick-up in non-food manufactured product prices. The March 2011 WPI inflation is now estimated to be higher - around 8 per cent. Fiscal Deficit While the budgeted level of fiscal deficit for 2011-12 gives some comfort on the demand front, a potential increase in the subsidies on petroleum products and fertilizers as a result of high crude prices could put pressure on expenditure. It is critical, therefore, to focus on the quality of expenditure, keeping the aggregate under control without compromising on the delivery of services. Only by doing this can the fiscal situation contribute to demand-side inflation management. Current Account The Reserve Bank had expressed concern about the widening of the current account deficit (CAD) and the nature of its financing in its Third Quarter Review. Going by the recent robust export performance. CAD for 2010-11 is now estimated to come lower than earlier expected, at around 2.5 per cent of GDP. While the CAD this year has been financed comfortably, it is necessary to focus on the quality of capital inflows with greater emphasis on attracting long-term components, including foreign direct investment (FDI), so as to enhance the sustainability of the balance of payments (BoP) over the medium-term. Credit Conditions While the year-on-year non-food credit growth at 23 per cent in February remains above the indicative projection of 20 per cent, the pace of credit expansion has moderated since December 2010. Monetary transmission is increasingly visible as banks continue to raise their lending rates.3 Liquidity Net liquidity injection through LAF declined from an average of around 93,000 crore in January to 79,000 crore in February 2011, and further to 68,000 crore in March (up to March 16) due mainly to increase in government spending and consequent decline in government cash balances with the Reserve Bank. Going forward, the overall liquidity situation is expected to move close to the comfort level of the Reserve Bank (+/- 1 per cent of net demand and time liabilities of banks) although it is likely to come under some temporary pressure in the second half of March due to advance tax collections. Summing Up To sum up, the underlying inflationary pressures have accentuated, even as risks to growth are emerging. Rising global commodity prices, particularly oil, are a major contributor to both developments. As domestic fuel prices are yet to adjust fully to global prices, risks to inflation remain clearly on the upside, reinforced by the persistence of demand-side pressures as reflected in non-food manufacturing inflation. The Union Budget for 2011-12 indicates some easing of demand pressures from the fiscal side, thus creating space for private investment, but this will materialise only if commitments to contain subsidies are adhered to. Measures to increase agricultural productivity, particularly in items facing structural supply-demand imbalances, will contribute to easing food inflation over time. Expected Outcomes The policy action in this Review is expected to: continue to rein in demand-side inflationary pressures while minimising risks to growth; and manage inflationary expectations and contain the spillover of food and commodity prices into more generalised inflation. Guidance Based on the current and evolving growth and inflation scenario, the Reserve Bank is likely to persist with the current anti-inflationary stance.

Nigeria,2011-03-21,"Central Bank of Nigeria Communique No. 75 of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting. March 21-22, 2011 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on the 21st and 22nd March, 2011 to assess the current domestic and international economic and financial developments as well as the challenges that lie ahead of the Nigerian economy in the short to medium term. On the international scene, the Committee noted the continuing recovery in a number of developed economies but observed that unemployment rates continue to be high and threats of inflation strong in the light of the rising global commodity and energy prices. In emerging market economies, growth has been robust but inflationary pressures are strong and on the rise. The negative impact of the political crises in the oil-producing Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region on oil prices and the disruptions and destructions associated with the earthquake and tsunami in Japan have added to uncertainty about the sustainability of global economic recovery and growth. There are also concerns in the European periphery of increasing interest rates. The implications of these developments together with the likelihood of sharp increases in international interest rates for the Nigerian economy need to be kept under continuous watch. With regard to the domestic economy, the Committee noted the continuing good output performance, the rising external reserves, the moderation in the inflation rate and the steady movement towards realization of banking sector stability. Monetary indicators have not picked up sufficiently while money market rates were generally high. The fiscal stance continues to be unduly expansionary. The Committee therefore emphasized the need to pursue sound policies, including exchange rate stability in order to ensure price stability without losing sight of the imperative of maintaining the current growth momentum. Key Domestic Macroeconomic and Financial Developments Domestic Output The Committee noted that the impressive output growth in 2010 was sustained in QI 2011. Provisional data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) indicated that real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was projected to grow by 743 per cent in the first quarter of 2011, compared with the 736 per cent recorded in the corresponding period of 2010. The overall GDP growth for 2010 was estimated to be 785 per cent, higher than the growth rate of 696 per cent recorded in 2009. The non-oil sector remained the major driver of overall growth, with agriculture, wholesale and retail trade, and services contributing 239, 204 and 208 per cent, respectively. The Committee considers the outlook for 2011 to be generally good, given the expected improvement in the oil economy and the growing emphasis on the development of non-oil sector and key infrastructure. Domestic Prices The year-on-year headline inflation in February was 111 per cent compared to 121 per cent recorded in January 2011 and 128 per cent in December 2010. Core inflation was 106 per cent in February 2011, down from 121 per cent in January and 109 per cent in December 2010. Food inflation however, rose to 122 per cent in February from 103 per cent in January but was lower than the 127 per cent in December 2010. The rise in food inflation was consistent with the 2 seasonal pattern. In addition, the increase in the costs of imported food items, transportation and energy prices contributed to food inflation. With the output performance being good, the challenge to inflation control lies, therefore, in containing aggregate expenditure and moderating the impact of imported inflation via exchange rate channel. This is where the role of fiscal prudence becomes very critical. Monetary Credit and Financial Market Developments Provisional data showed that the growth in broad money (M2) in the first two months of 2011 relative to December was moderate. Credit to private sector continued to be sluggish partly because of the delay in the passage of the 2011 Federal budget and ongoing banking sector reforms. Net foreign assets in the first two months have posted positive growth, the first time since January 2009. Pick up in credit to private sector should be possible given the high potential for accelerated growth, the fact that the banking sector stability is largely restored and the intensification of the operations of the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON). The interbank market rates fluctuated at the various segments since the beginning of the year. Key interbank rates moved in tandem with the upward revision of the monetary policy rate (MPR) to 65 per cent from 25th January, 2011. Between January 25 and March 17, 2011, the inter-bank call and open buy-back (OBB) rates showed increases mainly in response to the MPC's increase of the MPR and a more effective implementation of monetary policy decisions. Consequently inter-bank call and OBB rates rose from 493 and 475 per cent on 26th January, 2011 to 844 and 804 per cent, respectively, on March 17, 2011. The Committee noted that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has recently fine- tuned its monetary policy implementation framework using reserve averaging over a reserve maintenance period extended to 4 weeks. The Committee urged continuous monitoring of the developments and taking appropriate measures necessary for improving the implementation framework in the months to come. Retail lending rates remained relatively high in the first two months of 2011 while the spread between the average lending rate and the consolidated deposit rate widened to 1983 percentage points in February 2011 from 1952 percentage points in January. The Committee noted that a policy challenge is to ensure that the interest rate spread is significantly moderated. In 2011 thus far, share prices and market capitalization recorded significant decline due to both domestic and international developments. However with the ongoing reforms by the regulatory authorities and robust growth prospects, the outlook in the medium term appears generally good. External Sector Developments The Committee noted the re-emergence of demand pressures in the foreign exchange markets during the review period. The total supply to the wDAS segment by the CBN amounted to US$5145 billion from January through March 16, 2011, while demand stood at US$6815 billion during the same period. The Committee expressed concern that, of the amount supplied. US$134 billion was spent on importing refined petroleum products alone, which has adverse implications both for the reserves position and government finances as a result of the huge subsidy implications. The wDAS segment of the foreign exchange market, however, remained relatively stable. The Naira/Dollar exchange rate opened on February 1, 2011 at N15185/US$ and closed at N15252/US$ on March 17, 2011, representing a slight depreciation of 044 per cent (or 67 kobo). However the premium between the rates at the WDAS and other segments of the market widened towards the end of the review period, reflecting a sharper depreciation in non-wDAS segments of the foreign exchange market. The Committee, however, observed that given strong oil sector fundamentals, this trend is likely to be temporary. The Committee urged the CBN to continue to pursue the strategy of maintaining exchange rate stability to contain inflation. The Committee welcomed the recent build-up of foreign exchange reserves owing to increase in output and rising crude oil receipts. Foreign exchange reserves increased by US $282 billion to US$3516 billion on March 16, 2011 from US $3234 billion recorded at the end of December 2010. However the Committee welcomed the reserve build up and reiterated that the solution to reserve depletion lies in the implementation of appropriate reforms with regard to industrial and trade policies aimed at reducing import-dependency. The Committee's Considerations The MPC noted the positive growth outlook in the near to medium term but expressed serious concern over the heightened risk of inflation following from the proposed high expenditure outlay of the Federal Government as contained in the 2011 Appropriation Bill recently passed by the National Assembly, especially in the wake of rising global food and energy prices. In this regard, the Committee recalled that in the past few MPC meetings, it had stressed the need for fiscal retrenchment and drawn attention to the unsustainability of the rising 5 trend of domestic debt. However the proposed expenditure outlay negates the initial sentiment for fiscal retrenchment which would have supported monetary policy effectiveness. The current fiscal stance is inconsistent with the objective of maintaining stability in exchange rates, prices and interest rates. The Committee, therefore, believes that unless the fiscal stance is reversed, the economy would have to bear a high cost in terms of pressure on foreign reserves, high interest rates and/or higher level of inflation. Against the foregoing, the MPC is of the view that a further tightening of monetary policy is imperative. This stance needs to be appreciated in the context of the fact that resolution of the problems in the banking sector has not yet been completed. However a number of banks have signed a memorandum of understanding with core investors and public announcement will be made this week. In the light of this, the inter-bank guarantees and guarantees of foreign credit lines will need to be extended beyond the deadline of June 30, 2011. The MPC, however, recognizes that any action that is taken at this point in time should not serve as a disincentive to the current high growth impulses. It however, recognizes that the principal problem is access to finance in critical sectors like agriculture and manufacturing. This should remain the focus of CBN in the short to medium term. Decisions In the light of the foregoing analysis. Members of the Committee voted unanimously for further tightening of monetary policy because of heightened risk of inflation. The Members specifically pointed out the rising international food and energy prices, the impact of import costs on domestic prices, the challenges that fiscal stance posed to the external value of the Naira and the 6 likely front-loading of public expenditure in the election period. Against this background, the following decisions were taken: 1. majority of 9 to 3 Members voted for an increase in MPR by 100 basis points from 650 per cent to 750 per cent. The 3 Members voted for a 50 basis points increase; 2. unanimous decision to, a. Retain the symmetric corridor of +/- 200 basis points; b. Retain the current CRR of 20 per cent and the liquidity ratio of 300 per cent; and c. Extend the CBN guarantee on interbank transactions and guarantee of foreign credit lines by three months from June 30, 2011 to September 30, 2011. Sanusi Lamido Sanusi. CON Governor Central Bank of Nigeria March 22, 2011 7 PERSONAL STATEMENTS BY MPC MEMBERS: 10 ALADE. SARAH Although headline inflation declined from 121 in January 2011 to 111 in February 2011, which could suggest monetary policy easing, however, the sharp rise in global commodity and fuel prices have heightened upside risks to domestic inflation. This would suggest that the balance of risk would be tilted towards intensification of inflation, thus continued monetary tightening is necessary. The surge in global food and fuel prices posses a heightened inflationary risk to the Nigerian economy. As an import dependent economy, the likelihood of the country being affected by the global food and fuel crisis is very high and if action is not taken to mitigate the effect, the inflationary impact could be serious. Food inflation has remained at an elevated level as our major food items such as rice are imported and year-on-year imported food inflation surged to 202 percent in February from -5 percent in the previous month. Many countries are already experiencing high consumer price inflation due to the high global food prices. In Nigeria. Composite Food Index increased by 122 percent year- on-year and by 29 percent between January and February of 2011. The forecast for the current food and fuel price increase is that it will stay for awhile as a result of many factors, the event in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), and the rising global trend in general food prices. As high food prices persists, the prospect of it spilling over to the general inflation process is rapidly becoming a reality. All these will put upward pressure on domestic inflation, thus justifying the tightening of monetary policy to mitigate these risks. The 2011 Federal Government budget of N49 trillion is expansionary and in an election year, the amount could further increase through supplementary budgetary allocation. The Federal Government submitted a budget of N49 trillion which is higher than the N46 trillion for 2010 and 20 percent higher than the initial budget proposed in December of 2010. This expansionary budget poses risk to inflation. In addition, to pre-election expenditure, there is high likelihood of a supplementary budget in the near future. Therefore to mitigate the impact of such expansionary fiscal injection in the economy and to maintain the objective of single digit inflation, continued monetary tightening is necessary. The effect of AMCON BOND Purchase and foreign investment in intervened banks. The liquidity injection to the banks from the transaction will increase money supply and put additional pressure on the inflation dynamics. Reserve money has remained close to target in recent times, but the forecast is that it could rise. In the past two months reserve money has been very close to the target benchmark of N177515 billion, but projection is that it could rise above the benchmark in the short term. Staff estimates suggest an increase compared to indicative benchmark in the short to medium term. Depending in money multiplier, this can result in rapid increase in money supply. Monetary tightening is needed to contain the recent pressure on exchange rate. While the fundamentals do not support depreciation of the naira (high oil prices, increased oil output, high GDP growth rate), the naira has depreciated by 33 percent y-o-y against the dollar. Although a number of factors could be responsible, one of such factor is the supply side effects of fiscal injection. Tightening monetary policy will ease the pressure on the foreign exchange market. Based on the above, monetary policy should tilt towards containing the spill-over of high food and fuel prices into general inflation and anchor inflation expectation, while standing ready to respond to any further build-up of inflationary pressure. Therefore to balance the goal of economic growth and price stability. I will recommend a moderate tightening not more than 100 basis point based on the following: a) The full impact of the 2011 fiscal expansion will not be immediate; therefore. I00 basis point is adequate. b) Although growth in private sector credit is picking up, policy should be geared at nurturing this trend and full tightening could crowd-out private sector growth. Extension of the guarantee is necessary for continued financial stability. also agree with the extension of guarantee till September 30, 2011 to allow for the full and complete resolution of the intervened banks as Mergers and Acquisition (M&A) are still at critical stages. .0 BARAU. SULEIMAN The challenge of monetary policy formulation and implementation in the recent past and indeed since the last MPC has been the continued fiscal dominance. This and a few other factors duly recognized during the last Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) have heightened my perception of sustained inflation risk. The measures taken at the last Monetary Policy Committee have had some salutary effect on this threat as demonstrated by the largely downward trend of some inflation numbers. The Headline Inflation Rate for example trended from 10 118% in December, 2010 to 111% in February 2011. Core Inflation also trended downward from 121% in January 2011 to 106% in February 2011. In spite of this modest success. I'm convinced that sustained inflation remains a threat for the following reasons: • We have not witnessed the complete mop up of liquidity injected into the economy from the year end festive activities of 2010. This is an election year and the sustained spending associated with political activities have complicated the liquidity surfeit. The biggest threat has emerged from the Harmonized Budget passed by the National Assembly. In the first instance, the budget itself is a deficit one and therefore is expansionary. Secondly and more significantly, the recurrent component of N2467 trillion is about 50% of the total budget of N4970 trillion. These factors would aggressively exacerbate the inflationary pressures. Continued threat of imported inflation from increases in food and energy prices in the international market. Being an import dependent economy, this factor has had significant effect on the build-up of inflation numbers in the recent past. Liquidity is manifested by the substantial liquidity position of Deposit Money Banks, the recent increased demand for foreign exchange and the huge spending by the Government. Recommendation In the light of the foregoing. I recommend; 11 • The continuation of tight monetary stance; • The increase in the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) by 100 bps to 750% for the following reasons; (cid::1) Movement in Policy Rates are usually gradual and should be so. But the more radical increase is the right response to the renewed inflation risk. (cid:1) Impact on banking sector reforms and financial stability is responsible for the moderate increase being recommended. We have to be careful not to shock the money markets, yields, the fortunes of banks and ultimately the stability of the financial system. (cid:1) The complementary and perhaps more effective measures already in place which should be continued. These include the increase in CRR to (2%). MPR to (30%) and the corridor of +2% around the MPR which should be maintained. (cid:1) Frequency of MPC meeting provides window for further review (even if through an emergency MPC) for further tightening if current measures are not effective. The CBN Guarantee for interbank lending should be extended to September 30th to cushion the possible effect of the above policy measures on the banking system. 12 30 GARBA. ABDUL GANIYU FOUNDATION 1. Review of the MPD's Economic Report and the BSD/FPR Banking System Stability Review and the discussions that followed. Analysis of the impacts of the decisions of the 218th MPC on (a) discount rates (OBB and Call Rate); (b) Interest Rates; (c) Asset Prices; (d) Inflation Rates and (e) Exchange Rates using available data and, the framework for Monetary Policy in Nigeria. Commitment to (a) reducing inflation rates; (b) a stability in the foreign exchange market in 2011 and a gradual return to normalcy in the financial system as AMCON completes the cleaning up of the Balance Sheets of DMBs. My concerns: a. Inflationary pressured driven by mainly by fiscal operations and rising import prices of food and petroleum product: government remains committed in 2011 to an expansionary fiscal policy that will raise deficits, the public debt and crowd-out private sector investments, employment and growth [for example, the January figured for government spending overshoots budget by 02% and is 97% recurrent. The outlook for prices of imported food and petroleum products point to import price inflation. Major trade-offs either imposed or strengthened by expansionary fiscal policy: credit to government and credit to the private sector; growth and inflation; current expenditure and capital expenditure; 13 exchange rate stability and reserves; assets prices (bonds/stocks and money). Financial System stability effects of movements in bond prices. DECISION I vote to: 1. extend the CBN Guarantee on interbank transaction to September 30, 2011; and 2. an increase in MPR by 50 Basis Point: from 65% to 7%. JUSTIFICATIONS 5. vote to extend the guarantee on interbank transactions (a) to sustain confidence in the financial market and (b) to promote stability of the banking system as AMCON completes its assignment of cleaning up the balance sheets of DMBs. I vote for a 50 basis point rise in interest rate for the following reasons: a. Preference for a gradual path to normalization in the banking system to minimize the risks of volatilities. Analysis of the impacts of the decisions of the 218th MPC on targets (operating, intermediate and goals) indicates that targets were being realized also, in recognition of policy lags and that a 50 basis point can achieve the right amplitude. The need to strike the right balance between key tradeoffs: growth- inflation; exchange rate stability and reserves and assets prices (bonds/stocks and money). To moderate growth in disproportionate impacts on interest rates and to moderate the positive effects of an MPR increase in interest rate spreads. .0 YAHAYA. SHEHU I vote for a tightening of monetary policy. My position is predicated on the evidence of increases in price levels in January and particularly food inflation in February, which, in addition to the continuing increase in election spending, expansionary budget and rising international food and energy prices, threaten to stoke inflationary pressures in the coming months. Furthermore and notwithstanding the high crude oil prices in the international market, there is already significant pressure on the value of the naira in February- March , which can add to the inflationary pressures. The combination of these factors, particularly the risk of significant naira depreciation and its inflationary effects on an import dependent Nigerian economy necessitate a sharper response than envisaged in the last MPC meeting but balanced to avoid an excessive break on lending to the productive sector of the economy. therefore vote for an increase in the MPR of 100 basis points. .0 KIFASI. DANLADI The 2011 Federal Government Budget, which has now been passed, reflects Government's desire to create more jobs, maintain existing infrastructures and finance other capital projects. This would result in increased fiscal deficit, which 15 in turn will lead to excess liquidity in the system. This poses a great challenge to the achievement of low inflation and exchange rate stability. In order to mitigate the attendant inflationary pressure and achieve the objective of exchange rate stability. I support that there is need for a tight monetary policy. The appropriate instrument to use is the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) which should be adjusted upward. therefore support that the MPR be increased by 100 basis points from 65% to 75%. .0 LEMO. TUNDE The fiscal activities in my view are expansionary and not in line with fiscal consolidation advocated by MPC in January 2011. The Federal Government budget of N49 trillion as well as the total budgets of the 36 states may result in significant growth in public debts with the resultant crowding out of the private sector. The benchmark price of USD75 per barrel adopted in the Federal Budget may be too ambitious as oil price is volatile and significant shock may result in increase in government's domestic borrowing. Already staff reports revealed a decline in aggregate credit to the private sector in January 2011 whereas credits to Federal. States and Local Governments grew by almost 60%. The growth plan of 2011 may therefore be impaired. Inflation remains a major threat as a result of the fiscal activities and the problem has been exacerbated by the rising food and energy prices globally. With the present administration having less than 10 weeks to go, money supply resulting from heightened expenditure in the run-up to May 29 is expected to be high. 16 It is also important to check excessive liquidity injection through monetary policy tightening if the objective of building foreign reserve will be realised, given the positive correlation between money supply and demand for foreign exchange. Growth in reserve level should be pursued, especially now that crude oil prices are high in the international market. Furthermore interest rate adjustment is important at this juncture to correct the negative real interest rate which has in the last few years heightened the risk of disintermediation. The sluggish growth of deposits and savings in the past few years is a pointer to the need for significant adjustments in savings/deposit rates. Long-term growth can only be guaranteed with efficient domestic savings mobilization and this can only be done through positive real interest regime. In the light of the foregoing therefore. I am in support of an increase in MPR by 100 basis points from the present level of 65% to 75%. This will restore the MPR rate close to the pre Quantitative Easing period. am also in support of the maintenance of the symmetric corridor as well as the extension of the CBN Guarantee on banks' interbank and foreign obligations to September 30, 2011. .0 MOGHALU. KINGSLEY CHIEDU The Monetary Policy Committee at its last meeting had identified a number of factors that were likely to lead to a rise in inflation in 2011 and voted to raise the Monetary Policy Rate by 25 basis points from 625 percent to 650. Purchases of non-performing loans of CBN-intervened banks by the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON), election-related spending in 2010, and the possibility of a removal of subsidies on imported petroleum products were seen as potential inflationary factors. 17 All these factors remain true today. And a most important additional factor has emerged: the Harmonized 2011 Budget adopted by the National Assembly on March 16, 2011, by which total approved expenditure is 49 trillion naira, just over 50 per cent of it dedicated to recurrent expenditure. The main implication of the 2011 budget is that, at a time when all the indicators call for a tight fiscal stance, the approved budget is bound to markedly increase liquidity and feed inflationary pressures. sharp increase in tightening monetary policy in response is called for, and I believe the Monetary Policy Committee should provide this response. therefore vote for an increase in the Monetary Policy Rate by 100 basis points as opposed to the incremental approach to monetary tightening that the MPC commenced at its last meeting. The transmission corridor should remain symmetric at +/-200 basis points. While a return to higher interest rates has certain potential downsides, mainly that of a negative impact on bank lending, (in particular the availability and management of credit) every economic choice has a consequence, and the consequence of not tightening money supply through monetary policy action would be a lot worse. The potential adverse impact on financial system stability, considering that the CBN-intervened Banks are still returning to stability, should be obviated by the CBN extending its guarantee of deposits and credit lines beyond the deadline of June 30, 2011. depreciation of the naira at this time in response to pressures on the currency – an alternative approach – would in fact increase inflation considering the structural deficiencies of Nigeria's import-dependent economy. Such an approach is not supported by the prevailing economic fundamentals; on the 18 contrary, tightening of monetary policy is essential to protect exchange rate stability by making it more expensive in naira terms to buy dollars and thus reduce speculative demand for dollars and encourage the current increase in foreign reserves. The case for increasing the interest rate is supported not just by the potential inflationary pressures the recurrent expenditure-dominated 2011 budget will likely bring, but also by the results of the Quarter 1 2011 Consumer Expectations and Inflation Attitude Survey Report prepared for the Monetary Policy Committee. Clearly Nigerians do not want increased inflation. majority of the individuals surveyed believed Nigeria's economy would be weakened by fast-rising prices. While they would prefer lower interest rates, confronted with a choice between higher interest rates and high inflation, they would opt for higher interest rates. Lowering expectations about inflation is critical to lowering inflation in fact. marked increase in the MPR will help contain inflationary trends, among other reasons because it will send a strong anti-inflationary signal. In the prevailing circumstances, given the Central Bank of Nigeria's mandate to maintain price stability, a marked increase in the MPR is unavoidable. conclude by noting the intrinsic link between monetary and fiscal policy and the impact of one on the other. It is essential that the formulation of fiscal and monetary policy be well coordinated, and to favour policy stances that stimulate diversified real-sector economic growth over the medium to long term. The MPC at its January 2011 meeting had advocated fiscal tightening and consolidation. It has become imperative that the Central Bank of Nigeria increase its ongoing efforts to advise the Federal Government on economic 19 policy in accordance with its mandate, and that the Government reflect that advice in its formulation of fiscal policy. .0 OLOFIN. SAM From the facts and figures that we have before us at this meeting there is every indication that if anything has changed since our last meeting, it is the fact that inflationary pressure has been further accentuated. This is due largely to rising energy prices and imported food that impact significantly on the CPI despite the prospects of improved harvests that may have ameliorating effects on domestic food prices. On the fiscal front with elections just around the corner, it is a difficult period to preach the virtues of fiscal discipline. It is equally unlikely that there would be any significant adjustment in government expenditure pattern that has been highly inflationary, given the preponderant emphasis on recurrent, rather capital expenditure. In the short to medium term therefore, there is the need to sustain the monetary tightening stance that has been in place since the last two MPC meetings. The most obvious policy instrument available for this purpose would be the upward adjustment of the MPR. The destabilizing effects of alternative policy measures such as adjusting the exchange rate, may be highly destabilizing and counterproductive in a highly import dependent economy like ours; both demand for imports and supply of exports are inelastic. The signaling mechanism of adjusting the MPR and related ancillary measures however need not be such as to suggest panic for two reasons. First it is likely that after the elections in April, the fiscal authorities would be more open to the need for fiscal tightening if not voluntarily, possibly as the consequences of massive inflation inducing deficit spending begin to manifest. Secondly there is need for a gradual adjustment of rates to pre-crisis levels, as opposed to rattling jumps or 20 spikes that may be suggestive of destabilizing panicky measures. slight upward adjustment in the MPR may be all that is needed for now, to signal our continued commitment to combating inflation, as stability gradually returns to the financial sector. There is however an immediate policy challenge, which is that of combating speculative demand for foreign exchange as a way of hedging against the risks and uncertainties surrounding the elections. If this is not tackled immediately, it could accentuate the rate of decumulation of already dwindling foreign reserves. spike in the MPR by 100 basis points from 65 to 75 percent may therefore be justifiable as a way of raising the cost of borrowing to finance the speculative demand for foreign exchange. .0 OSHILAJA. JOHN The origins of today's comparatively loose monetary and pro-cyclical, or complementary, fiscal policies lay in a series of extraordinary economic and financial events that threatened to cripple an already fragile Nigerian economy. Oil export production became increasingly vulnerable to disruptions occasioned by political agitation and outright militancy, in producing regions of the country. Resulting revenue shortfalls undermined the fiscal capacities of Federal and State governments to pursue their respective development imperatives. At about the same time, a global financial systems crisis (of confidence) precipitated stunning reversals, in strategically vital investment flows within and towards the country. This exposed sig"
Philippines,2011-03-23,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to increase by 25 basis points the BSP's key policy interest rates to 4.25 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 6.25 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs, and special deposit accounts (SDAs) were also raised accordingly. The Monetary Board's decision was based on signs of stronger and broadening inflation pressures as well as a further upward shift in the balance of inflation risks. International food and oil prices have continued to escalate due to the combination of sustained strong global demand and supply disruptions and constraints. Reflecting these. Philippine headline and core (or underlying) inflation have started to rise. The latest baseline inflation forecasts now indicate that the 3-5 percent inflation target range in 2011 could be at risk. Given these developments, the Monetary Board decided to act promptly to rein in inflation expectations. The Monetary Board believes that a preemptive response will minimize the overall impact of rising inflation on domestic economic activity by helping to firmly anchor the public's inflation expectations. Well-anchored inflation expectations would safeguard price stability and, therefore, preserve the public's purchasing power. Buoyant domestic demand conditions provide room for a policy interest rate hike without affecting the country's economic growth prospects. The Monetary Board emphasized that it continues to closely watch the evolving global situation, focusing in particular on the macroeconomic risks of protracted political tensions in the Middle East and North African region and the growth and inflation implications of the recent disasters in Japan, where events continue to unfold. The Monetary Board will remain vigilant against emerging inflationary risks and possible second-round effects of commodity price pressures. The Board stands ready to undertake further action as necessary to safeguard price stability."
Turkiye,2011-03-23,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the policy rates constant at the following levels: a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) at 6.25 percent, b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 1.50 percent, lending rate at 9 percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 8 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, lending rate at 12 percent. Recent releases on economic activity have been consistent with the outlook presented in the January Inflation Report. Economic activity continues to strengthen amid increasing domestic demand, while external demand remains relatively weak despite the recent pick up. Employment conditions continue to improve, though, unemployment rates remain at high levels. However, oil and other commodity prices hover above the Inflation Report assumptions. Accordingly, core goods inflation would continue to increase for sometime, while services inflation is expected to display a more benign path. Although the measures taken by the Central Bank since November are expected to have an impact on credit volume and domestic demand starting with the second quarter, some additional increase in reserve requirement is deemed necessary for macroprudential purposes. In this respect, the Committee believes that today's decision on reserve requirements also provides the monetary tightening required for containing the potential second round effects of the recent increases in oil and other commodity prices. In light of these assessments, in order to contain the risks towards price stability and financial stability, the Committee has decided to monitor the tightening impact of the implemented policy mix—a low policy rate, a wide interest corridor and high reserve requirement ratios—and take additional measures along the same lines, if needed. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Czech Republic,2011-03-24,"Press conference of the CNB Bank Board 2nd Situation Report on Economic and Monetary Developments 24 March 2011 The monetary policy decision taken and the ratio of the votes cast At the close of the meeting the Bank Board decided by a majority vote to leave the two-week repo rate unchanged at 0.75%. Five board members voted in favour of this decision and one member voted for increasing interest rates by 0.25 percentage point. Reasons for the decision According to the forecast, headline and monetary-policy relevant inflation will be close to the inflation target over the monetary policy horizon. Consistent with the forecast is stability of market interest rates close to their current levels initially, followed by a gradual rise in rates as from the end of 2011. Risks to the forecast are on the upside for headline inflation (due to VAT increase in 2012) and roughly balanced for monetary-policy relevant inflation.

South Africa,2011-03-24,"The domestic growth prognosis has improved, and the recovery is expected to be sustained, although not at rates sufficient to make appreciable inroads into the unemployment situation in South Africa. Household consumption expenditure has been the main driver of growth, whereas growth in fixed capital formation has remained weak. At this stage there are no discernible inflationary pressures coming from the demand side of the economy. The global recovery appears to have remained on track, but the unresolved European sovereign debt crisis, rising international oil prices, partly a result of geo-political events, and the tragic events in Japan may moderate the pace of recovery in the near-term. Global inflation risks have also increased, particularly in the emerging market economies, a number of which have tightened their monetary policy stances in recent months. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas measured 3,7 per cent in January and February. Food price inflation, while still low, has been increasing. In February it measured 3,5 per cent and contributed 0,6 percentage points to the overall inflation outcome. On a month-on-month basis food price declined by 0,1 per cent. Housing and utilities, primarily electricity, contributed 1,5 percentage points to the outcome. Petrol prices increased at a year-on-year rate of 12,3 per cent, while administered prices excluding petrol increased by 9,1 per cent. CPI inflation excluding administered prices was unchanged at 2,7 per cent while CPI inflation excluding food and petrol measured 3,4 per cent. Year-on-year producer price inflation continued its recent downward trend in January when it measured 5,5 per cent, compared with 5,8 per cent in December 2010. Food price pressures remained relatively subdued in January despite marked increases in global food prices. Manufactured food and agricultural prices increased by 1,5 per cent and 0,5 per cent respectively. This suggests that food price increases at the consumer price level may be moderated in the near term. The trajectory of the CPI forecast of the Bank has changed somewhat since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee. Nevertheless, inflation is still expected to remain within the target range over the entire forecast period. Inflation is now expected to average 4,7 per cent in 2011 and 5,7 per cent in 2012. This represents an upward adjustment of approximately half a percentage point in 2012. Inflation is expected to peak at 5,8 per cent in the first quarter of 2012 before declining to 5,6 per cent in the fourth quarter. The upward adjustment is mainly due to revised assumptions regarding the international oil price over the forecast period. The survey conducted by Reuters also reflects a moderate upward adjustment in the inflation forecasts. In the February survey, the mean forecast of CPI inflation increased by 0,2 percentage points to 4,7 for 2011, and by 0,4 percentage points to 6,0 per cent for 2012. Inflation expectations for 2013 remained more or less unchanged at around 5,7 per cent. The break-even inflation rates have increased to above the 6 per cent level over the longer term maturities. Inflation expectations as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research (BER) at Stellenbosch University in the first quarter of 2011 also indicate a slight deterioration in the expectations of financial analysts. However, there was some improvement in the expectations of business executives and trade unionists. Inflation is now expected to average 5,3 per cent in 2011 and 5,7 per cent in 2012, compared with 5,5 per cent and 6,2 per cent in the previous survey. Inflation is expected to average 6,0 per cent in 2013. While all categories of respondents expect inflation to remain within the target range in 2011 and 2012, business and trade union expectations average 6,2 per cent in 2013, compared with 5,6 per cent for financial analysts. The global economic recovery, although uneven, is expected to continue, led by a strong performance in global manufacturing. However significant downside risks remain, due to the confluence of shocks that have the potential to stall the nascent recovery. These shocks include higher international oil prices, driven in part by events in North Africa and the Middle East, and the recent disasters in Japan which could have a negative impact on the global manufacturing supply chain. The sovereign debt crisis in the euro area remains a concern, with CDS spreads signaling increased risks of sovereign debt defaults. The US outlook appears favourable, but the weak housing market and the ability of the economy to sustain growth once the fiscal stimuli dissipate during the year are some of the risks that persist. Growth in emerging markets remains robust, but Asian economies in particular may be negatively impacted by the recent developments in Japan. The global growth outlook may also be dependent on the extent to which the authorities in China manage to slow their economy down. The global inflation outlook has also deteriorated somewhat in the face of higher oil and food prices, although in some of the advanced economies there is a marked divergence between core and headline inflation. This reflects the relatively weak underlying demand conditions, and the generally accommodative monetary policies in these countries. In the faster growing emerging markets, inflation pressures are more pronounced, and monetary policy tightening has become more widespread. The strong capital inflows to emerging markets that were a feature of most of 2010 have slowed down and in some instances reversed. South Africa has also experienced net sales of bonds since November, and in the year to date, net sales of bonds and equities by non-residents have amounted to R19,2 billion. Despite these net sales and the continued purchase of foreign exchange by the Bank, the rand exchange rate has remained firm but volatile. The rand exchange rate is relatively unchanged since the previous meeting of the MPC, but has fluctuated between R6,80 and R7,33 per US dollar during this period. Part of the recent strength of the rand can be ascribed to US dollar weakness. During this period the US dollar depreciated by almost 5 per cent against the euro, despite rating downgrades in a number of euro area countries. Since the previous meeting the rand has depreciated by over 3,0 per cent against the euro and by about 1,0 per cent on a trade weighted basis. Domestic growth prospects appear to have improved moderately. Real gross domestic product grew by 2,8 per cent in 2010, and at an annualised rate of 4,4 per cent in the fourth quarter. The forecast of the Bank has increased somewhat since the previous meeting of the MPC, with GDP growth now expected to average 3,7 per cent and 3,9 per cent in 2011 and 2012 respectively. These growth rates, while an improvement, are still too low to have a significant impact on the unemployment rate which measured 24,0 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2010. According to Statistics South Africa, formal non-agricultural employment increased by approximately 65,000 jobs in that quarter. The more favourable growth performance was driven mainly by the mining and manufacturing sectors. A number of high frequency indicators suggest that the growth momentum will be sustained. The composite leading business cycle indicator has maintained its positive trend, and the Kagiso/BER Purchasing Managers Index has remained above the neutral level since November 2010, suggesting a favourable outlook for the manufacturing sector. The physical volume of manufacturing production increased at a moderate year-on-year rate of 1,3 per cent in January, but the three-month on three-month rate increased by 2,8 per cent. However output levels are still below those achieved before the crisis, and the sector remains characterised by underutilised capacity. The utilisation of production capacity increased from 79,2 per cent in the third quarter of 2010 to 80,7 per cent in the fourth quarter compared with a pre-crisis average of around 85 per cent. Output in the mining sector has maintained its general upward trend, notwithstanding the 1,9 per cent month-on-month decline in January. Reflecting these developments, the RMB/BER business confidence index increased significantly in the first quarter of 2011 to reach a level above neutral for the first time in three years. The building sector was the only sector in which negative sentiment was recorded. This is consistent with the quarter-on-quarter decline in the real value of new building plans passed in the fourth quarter of 2010, and the persistently low level of the FNB civil construction index. The domestic growth prospects will also be dependent on developments in gross fixed capital formation, which declined by 3,7 per cent in 2010 and made a negative contribution to GDP in that year. In the fourth quarter of 2010 an annualised increase of 1,5 per cent was recorded. Capital expenditure by public corporations increased by 3,3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2010, while private sector investment, which declined by 4,4 per cent over the year, grew at an annualised rate of 1,6 per cent in the same quarter. The relatively weak capital expenditure growth contributed to the decline in imports which, along with improved commodity prices, allowed for a marked decline in the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments to 0,6 per cent of GDP in the fourth quarter of 2010. However, should capital expenditure pick up, as envisaged by the public corporations, the current account deficit is likely to widen. Real final consumption expenditure by households increased by 5,1 per cent in the final quarter of 2010, indicative of continued positive consumer sentiment and positive disposable income growth. This category of expenditure made the largest contribution, 2,8 percentage points, to growth in GDP during the year. There are indications that although consumption expenditure growth will remain relatively robust, it is unlikely to accelerate to excessive levels in the short term. The FNB/BER consumer confidence index declined in the first quarter of 2011, but still remains at a relatively high level. This was consistent with the decline in confidence, albeit from high levels, evident amongst retailers in the business confidence index, and the retail trade sales growth in January which was below market expectations. Expenditure on durable goods, in particular new motor vehicles, has been strong. Consumption expenditure is expected to be constrained to some extent by the continued high levels of household indebtedness, which declined marginally to 77,6 per cent of disposable income in the fourth quarter, and the further increase in the number of consumers with impaired credit records since the implementation of the National Credit Act. The ratio of impaired advances to gross loans and advances of banks has remained relatively unchanged at around 5,8 per cent for some time. Bank credit extension to the private sector has remained subdued. Total loans and advances by banks to the private sector have been growing at an annual rate of around 4 per cent since September 2010, driven largely by mortgage loans and general loans, mainly to the household sector. Growth in mortgage advances, however, declined from 4,8 per cent in November 2010, to 3,8 per cent in January 2011, reflecting the subdued state of the property market. The various house price indices all indicate that house prices are either falling or increasing at very low nominal rates. This, combined with the recent decline in equity prices, may contribute to a moderation of the impact of wealth effects on consumption. The recent national government budget tabled before parliament indicates a moderately looser fiscal policy stance through a slower pace of fiscal deficit reduction compared with that in the October 2010 Medium Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS). The fiscal deficit is now estimated to decline to 3,8 per cent of GDP by the 2013/14 fiscal year compared with 3,2 per cent in the MTBPS. The government debt/GDP ratio is expected to peak at 43,1 per cent in 2013/14, which is much lower than the internationally acceptable norm of around 60 per cent. High real wage settlements have been a significant upside risk to the inflation outlook. However there are indications that nominal wage settlement rates may be moderating. According to Andrew Levy Employment Publications, the overall average wage settlement rate in collective bargaining agreements amounted to 8,2 per cent in 2010, compared with a rate of 9,3 per cent in 2009. Similarly, the downward trend in year-on-year growth in unit labour costs continued into the fourth quarter of 2010 when it measured 7,7 per cent, compared with 9,3 per cent in the previous quarter. This positive trend, if continued, may contribute meaningfully to attaining an environment of low inflation and employment creation. The biggest risks to the inflation outlook remain food and administered prices, in particular oil prices. International oil prices had already accelerated in the latter part of 2010 in response to strong global demand and this upward trend has been reinforced by the geo-political events in North Africa and the Middle East which have raised concerns about the security of oil supplies. Should these political issues be resolved soon, the underlying demand pressures are likely to still keep oil prices at relatively elevated levels. Since the previous meeting of the MPC. Brent crude oil prices have increased by almost US$20 per barrel. Domestic petrol prices have increased by just under R1 per litre since January 2011, and a further upward adjustment is expected in April in addition to the increased fuel levy. The MPC is of the view that the risks to the inflation outlook are on the upside. However, these risks and underlying pressures are mainly of a cost push nature. In light of the above, the MPC has decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 5,5 per cent per annum for the time being. Given the significant upside risks to the inflation outlook, the MPC will closely monitor any indications of second round effects on inflation emanating from these cost pressures."
Pakistan,2011-03-26,"STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN MONETARY POLICY DECISION 26th March 2011 Despite recent improvement in the external current account, restrained government borrowings from SBP and stable financial markets, the focus must remain on addressing the structural fiscal weaknesses and reducing inflation to provide sound platform for sustainable economic recovery in FY12. Although some measures have been announced to contain the fiscal deficit of FY11 and inflation has eased somewhat, more work is required to build on these initial efforts by maintaining progress on comprehensive tax reforms, transparent rationalization of subsidies, and the development of forward-looking debt management strategy. This will require support from across the political divide and from other state and civil society institutions to ensure their smooth implementation. These measures would help check the level of government borrowings from the banking system, creating space for the private sector and lowering their borrowing costs thereby supporting the utilization and expansion of the economy's productive capacity. Initiation of these reforms has become critical since private and public sector investments are falling while total debt is rising sharply and expectations of high inflation are becoming entrenched. The decline in year-on-year inflation from 15. percent in December 2010 to 12. percent in February 2011 can be attributed to three factors. First gradual dissipation of the effect of the flood on food prices; second, an incomplete pass-through of high international oil prices to the domestic market and smaller adjustment in electricity prices than required by the projected size of the power sector subsidy; and, third, reduction and thereafter containment of the stock of government borrowings from SBP to around Rs1290 billion (on cash basis). The future path of inflation would be contingent upon the policy stance adopted with respect to the last two factors. In addition, the impact of the recent removal of General Sales Tax (GST) exemptions could also influence the inflation outlook. The SBP is confident that the government will adhere to the mutually agreed borrowing limits from SBP and, in recognition of the high level of inflation, will aim to lower them further. This should facilitate SBP in aligning monetary expansion with the level of productive economic activity while improving its composition in favour of Net Foreign Assets (NFA). By 12th March 2011, the year-on-year growth in reserve money was 15. percent, which is slightly lower than the growth rate observed at the time of last monetary policy decision in January 2011, and share of NFA of SBP in reserve money has increased to 27. percent compared to 2. percent at the beginning of FY11. continuation of these positive trends can potentially have beneficial effect on inflation in the next fiscal year. However the rise in public debt with considerable short-term maturity profile combined with reduced availability of bank credit for the private sector at higher interest rates has created challenges for monetary management in terms of striking balance between containing inflation and promoting economic growth. By end-December 2010, the year-on-year growth in government's total debt was 14. percent, with 45 percent of the tax revenue being absorbed by interest payments. The year-on-year growth in private sector credit, on the other hand, was only percent up till 12th March 2011. Without increasing the private sector's investment and hence its contribution to economic growth it would become more challenging for the economy to generate Page of STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN sufficient revenues to meet its debt obligations in the future, especially with the terms of trade shifting in favour of sectors with modest contribution to tax revenues. The recently announced tax measures, estimated to raise approximately Rs53 billion in the remaining months of FY11, together with cut in planned development expenditures and postponement of some subsidy payments may help in reducing the fiscal deficit for FY11 to some extent. Given the delayed announcement and temporary nature of some of these measures, the improvement in the fiscal position will require these efforts to be consolidated in the forthcoming budget. Thus implementation of credible medium term budgetary framework and renewed efforts to abide by the principles of the Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation Act (2005), geared towards reducing the revenue deficit, are required to strengthen the fiscal position on sustainable basis. On the financing side, only Rs48 billion were received for external sources to finance the budget during H1-FY11 against the budget estimate of Rs230 billion for the year. If these external flows are not released in timely manner, there is risk of further substantial government borrowings from the banking system, which will make liquidity management more challenging. The government has already borrowed substantial amounts. Rs329 billion during 1st July 12th March. FY11, through various instruments, increasingly in the 3-month Treasury Bills. The incremental requirements of the government for Q4-FY11 and debt plan that focuses on long term borrowings are awaiting announcement. There is growing uncertainty in the global economic environment also. The popular uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and unprecedented damage to the Japanese economy because of an historic earthquake and tsunami have shaken the global economy once again, which has yet to fully recover from the repercussions of the financial and economic crises of advanced economies. One consequence of these uncertain times has been high international commodity prices, especially of oil. So far, the terms of trade shock has been favourable for Pakistan's economy. More than 90 percent of the incremental increase in export earnings during July February. FY11 over the corresponding period of last year has been due to high international prices of Pakistan's exports. The contribution of high import prices, particularly of oil, to the import bill has been relatively low, but is substantial and rising. The turmoil in the MENA region may also influence the flow of remittances to Pakistan. However assuming that the inflow of remittances continue its current trend for the remaining months of FY11, there are no immediate risks to the external current account balance. The financial account inflows such as foreign direct and portfolio investments, on the other hand, have remained fairly modest during July February. FY11; almost half the level of inflows seen in the corresponding period of last year, which was also small compared to historical levels. The overall balance of payments position appears to be strong at the moment with gradual build-up of foreign exchange reserves and stable foreign exchange market. However given the uncertainty with respect to foreign inflows, the developments in the external sector will need to be monitored closely in the coming months. Page of STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN In conclusion, given favourable external current account position and relatively disciplined government borrowings from SBP, the immediate risks to macroeconomic stability seem to have subsided, at least for the next two months. Therefore SBP has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 14 percent. However there is little room for complacency as the risks to the economy may increase if meaningful economic reforms are not initiated to address the structural weaknesses. Inflation persistence still remains high, which is largely formed by recent past levels of inflation and perceptions of economic agents about the credibility and direction of monetary and fiscal policies in controlling inflation and promoting long-term sustainable economic growth. Perceived credibility of monetary policy is also influenced by the behaviour of monetary aggregates. In this respect, while government borrowing from SBP has been contained to end-September 2010 level, growth in public sector borrowing is still very high and that of the private sector low. Further given the financing requirements of fiscal authorities, budgetary as well as non-budgetary borrowings for the procurement of commodities and addressing the circular debt-related issues, the likelihood of an ease in such borrowings is small. This means that risks to macroeconomic stability could increase in the next fiscal year. The current stability in the financial markets provides valuable time to initiate structural reforms. Not only are urgent measures required to address the energy crisis to increase productive activity but the fiscal position also needs considerable strengthening to cope with rising debt obligations and to ease borrowing pressures on the banking system.

Hungary,2011-03-28,"At its meeting on 28 March 2011, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at 6.00%. Members discussed the March issue of the MNB's Quarterly Report on Inflation. In the Council's judgement. Hungarian economic growth is likely to pick up gradually over the forecast horizon; however, the level of output will remain below potential throughout the period. Inflation is expected to be considerably above the Bank's 3% target in the short term, due to the cost-push shocks hitting the economy, but may fall back close to the target by the end of next year even without further monetary tightening. Looking ahead, inflation is likely to continue to be dominated by the balance between two opposing forces. On the one hand, weak domestic demand and high unemployment continue to exert discipline on price and wage-setting behaviour. On the other hand, the economy has been hit by adverse cost-push shocks, the effects of which are expected to feed through to core inflation in the short term. According to the latest available data, however, the extent of this pass-through has been smaller than previously. Loose labour market conditions are allowing firms to restore their profitability by moderating earnings growth, rather than by raising prices. The recent interest rate increases have been successful in reducing possible second-round effects of the cost shocks. On balance, therefore, inflation in 2011 is likely to remain significantly above the Bank's 3% target and then fall back to settle around it towards the end of next year. The Council judges that it may be necessary to maintain interest rates at their current level over a sustained period in order to meet the target for CPI inflation in 2012. The Council's collective view that it is important that administered prices only change to the extent justified by cost increases and welcomes the Government's commitment in this area. Strong external demand is expected to remain the main driver of Hungarian economic growth this year, with domestic demand likely to recover only gradually. Disbursements to members of real returns on their private pension fund contributions are likely to provide a temporary boost to household consumption, with the reduction in the tax burden on personal incomes expected to provide a sustained stimulus. However, the Government's planned fiscal adjustment measures may lead to a sharp fall in household disposable income in 2012. If maintained over a sustained period, current tight credit conditions in the household market may weigh down on consumption demand growth and reinforce the disinflationary effects from the real economy. Increased business uncertainty due to tight lending conditions, the effects of windfall taxes and changes to corporate income tax regulations has been a drag on corporate investment activity recently. There is a significant risk that the productive capacity of the economy will expand more slowly over a prolonged period in response to weaker private sector investment. Perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy changed little in March following the improvement in previous months. The announcement of the Government's fiscal adjustment measures left risk premia broadly unaffected, as it had already been priced in by the market. The Monetary Council has decided to leave interest rates unchanged in light of the above considerations. It is justified to maintain interest rates at their current level, as long as economic developments are consistent with the path outlined in the Report. If incoming data suggest a greater pass-through from the cost shocks, it may be necessary to tighten current monetary conditions in response to upside risks to inflation. However, a slower-than-expected recovery in lending and weaker-than-expected domestic demand may warrant a reduction in interest rates in the medium term."
Israel,2011-03-28,"28.03.2011 The Bank of Israel increases the interest rate for April 2011 by 0.5 percentage points to 3.0 percent To view this press release as a WORD file - Click here Background conditions Inflation data: The February CPI rose by 0.3 percent, more than the average predicted increase, and above the seasonal path consistent with the achievement of the inflation target, which would have required a reduction in the index of 0.1-0.2 percent. The inflation rate, measured over the previous twelve months, continued to increase, and in February reached 4.2 percent. The CPI excluding the housing price component rose by 3.5 percent in the previous twelve months. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: The average of forecasters' inflation expectations for the next twelve monthly CPIs increased from 3 percent to 3.1 percent, slightly above the upper limit of the target inflation range. Expectations calculated from the capital market averaged about 3.7 percent in March, above the upper limit of the target inflation range. Medium- and long-term inflation expectations were steady this month, slightly above the upper limit of the target inflation range. Forecaster'spredictions and the Bank of Israel Research Department staff forecast of inflation in the next twelve months are that it will remain above the targetrange during the rest of 2011, and that it will decline at the beginning of 2012 to the upper limit of the target range. Based on the Telbor market (Tel Aviv Inter-Bank Offer Rate), the Bank of Israel interest rate in a year's time is expected to be 4.1 percent, and on average, forecasters'predictions are that it will be 3.9 percent. Most forecasters expect the Bank of Israel to increase the interest rate for April 2011, and the others expect no change. Real economic activity: Most economic indicators that became available this month show that domestic activity continued to expand. The updated National Accounts estimate for 2010 confirms the original positive estimate published in February: GDP grew by 4.6 percent in 2010, and in the fourth quarter it grew at an annual rate of 7.7 percent. The February compositestate-of-the-economy index rose by 0.4 percent, indicating continued growth, expressed by further increases in domestic demand and demand for exports. Goods exports increased by 4.6 percent in February (seasonally adjusted),following the increase of less than 1 percent in January. Services exportssurged by 7.7 percent in January, after falling by 5.6 percent in December. In the months from November to January total revenue of all industries increased at an annual rate of 4.9 percent, further to the rise of 3.5 percent (annual rate) in the previous three months. In contrast, indices of consumer confidence and the purchasing managers index declined in February, after remaining steady in the four previous months; this was due to the rise ingeopolitical uncertainty and the increase in commodity prices. The Bank ofIsrael Research Department index of the probability of a slowdown in domestic demand, based on Google searches, increased slightly, to 38 percent, still below 50 percent. The Bank of Israel staff forecast which was updated this month, is that inflation in 2011 will be above the upper limit of the target inflation range, with the interest rate increasing gradually to about 4 percent in a year's time. The main risks to real activity and inflation in Israel derive from developments abroad, including the increase in commodity and oil prices, and in the local housing market, and from the realization of geopolitical risks. The labor market and wages: The unemployment rate stayed at 6.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010, with the employment rate and the rateof participation in the labor force increasing marginally, by 0.1 percent.According to trend data, the rate of unemployment dropped to 6.1 percent in January. Another positive indicator from the labor market is the strengthening of the trend from part-time to full-time employment. The nominal wageincreased by 3.7 percent in 2010, and the real wage by 1 percent. Health tax receipts in February 2011, which provide an indication of wage payments in that month, show an increase of 4.7 percent, in real terms, from their level in February 2010. Budget data: Government expenditure in January-February was 7 percent higher in real terms than in January-February 2010, but was lower than the seasonal level consistent with full expenditure of thebudget. Since the beginning of the year, the overall cumulative governmentsurplus in the budget totaled NIS 2.8 billion, about NIS 2 billion higher than the seasonal path consistent with remaining below the deficit ceiling.Tax revenues in January-February, after accounting for the effectsof legislative changes and nonrecurring receipts, were 9 percent higher, in real terms, than in the first two months of 2010. Tax revenues in February were in line with the seasonal path consistent with the budget forecast. The foreign exchange market: From the previous monetary policy discussion held on February 20 until March 25, the shekel appreciated by 1.9 percentagainst the dollar, and depreciated by 2.4 percent against the euro, similar to the changes in other currencies around the world. In terms of the nominal effective exchange rate the shekel remained unchanged. The capital and money markets:Between the monetary policy discussions of February 20 and March 25, the Tel Aviv share price indices fell, asdid most stock market indices around the world. The Tel Aviv 25 index dropped by 3.8 percent, and the Tel Aviv 100 index by 4.6 percent. Yields on government bonds increased in this period, against the background of the latest increase in the interest rate, expectations of faster rates of increase in the interest rate, and geopolitical uncertainty. Over the period the yield on makam increased along the entire curve. The amount of nonresidents' activity in the makam market declined this month. Yields on local currency bonds increased along the entire curve by between 16 b.p. and 26 b.p. Yields on CPI-indexed government bonds also increased, with the curve flattening somewhat. The yield gap between Israeli and US unindexed 10-year government bonds widened this month, and reached 189 b.p. The corporate bond market was affected by an increase in risk aversion, but remained relatively stable, due to the limited supply in this market, a result of the recommendations of the Hodek Committee. The Tel-Bond indices showed only small movement: the Tel-Bond 20 index dropped by 0.2 percent, and the Tel-Bond 40 by 0.1 percent. The gap between the Tel-Bond indices and 10-year CPI-indexed government bonds widened just a little, by about 2 b.p, as yields on government bonds also increased. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spread increased this month, and reached 176 b.p., but then declined to 153 b.p. The money supply: In the twelve months to February the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 7.3 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 6.8 percent. The credit market:Total outstanding housing credit increased by 0.8 percent in February, and in the twelve months to February it increased by 13.1 percent. Total new mortgages advanced in February increased by 0.7 percent, following their 14.3 percent decrease in January. The amount of mortgages granted in the twelve months to January continued to be high--about NIS 50 billion. The rate of interest on mortgages of all types increased again this month, against the background of the increase in the Bank of Israel interest rate, among other things. The housing market:House prices--which are presented in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of house prices but are not included in the CPI--continued to increase, and in December-January they increased at a rate of 0.9 percent a month, followingtheir increase of 1.3 percent a month in November-December. In thelast twelve months house prices increased by 16.3 percent, compared with alevel of 17.5 percent in the previous month. The housing price index, which is based mainly on renewed rental contracts and which is included in the CPI, rose by 0.4 percent in February. In the last twelve months the housingprice index increased by 6.5 percent, a faster rate than in recent months. The global economy: : The latest indicators show continued globaleconomic growth in the first quarter of 2011, with growth becoming more firmly entrenched in the US and improved performance in the major European economies. Nevertheless, a series of shocks, including natural disasters, starting with the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, political turmoil in several Arab countries, and persistent concern over the debt crisis in some European countries, keep raising the level of uncertainty and cast a shadow overthe forecasts of global growth. The general view at this stage is that theeffect of most of these shocks will be temporary. Nonetheless, the implications for the supply of energy resources are likely to be significant and long term, and are likely to impact on future growth. At the same time thereis greater concern regarding the acceleration of inflation around the world against the background of the continued considerable increases in oil andother commodity prices. The ECB (European Central Bank) is expected to increase its interest rate in another month. Inflationary pressures resulted in many central banks, including those of Brazil. Chile. India and Russia, increasing their interest rates this month. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to increase the interest rate for April by half a percentage point to 3.0 percent is consistent with the process of returning the interest rate to a normal range intended to position inflation firmly within the target range, and to support the further recovery of economic activity, while maintaining financial stability. The rate of increase in the interest rate is not pre-determined, but is set in accordance with the inflation environment, growth in Israel and globally, the monetary policies of the leading central banks, and developments in the exchange rates of the shekel. At the current level of the interest rate, monetary policy continues to be expansionary. The CPIs in the last few months exceeded the forecasts. Inflation over the previous twelve months is 4.2 percent, above the target range. Inflation forecasts: of the Bank of Israel, forecasters, and those derived from the capital market: continue to be high. According to those forecasts, inflation over the previous twelve months is expected to remain above the target range throughout 2011 and to return within the target range at the beginningof 2012. In addition, inflation expectations for periods longer than a year as calculated from the capital market are still above the upper limit of the inflation target range. Forecasters' inflation predictions alsotake into consideration an expected increase in the interest rate for April. Economic indicators published this month show that domestic activity continued to expand, converging towards a situation of full utilization of the factors of production. Updated National Accounts figures for 2010 confirm the positive picture painted in February; they showed growth in the fourth quarter of 2010 at an annual rate of 7.7 percent. Economic recovery is continuing world wide, including in the US and in some European countries. Nevertheless, the disaster in Japan, the geopolitical situation in the Middle East, and the debt crisis of some European countries increase uncertainty regarding futureglobal growth. House prices continued to increase this month; in the last twelve months they have risen by 16.3 percent. No decline in the volume of new mortgages is evident. Central bank interest rates in the major advanced economies are still low. At the sametime, the expected timing of an increase in the Fed interest rate has beenbrought forward, and the European Central Bank is expected to increase itsinterest rate soon. In addition, against the background of faster inflation in the emerging market economies, a relatively large number of central banks increased their interest rates this month. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in Israel's economy and the global economy and in the financial markets. The Bank will usethe instruments available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, including keeping a close watch on developmentsin the assets market, and especially in the housing market. The minutes of the discussions prior to the above interest rate decision will be published on April 11, 2011. The decision regarding the interest rate for May 2011 will be published at 14:00 on Sunday. April 24, 2011, due to the Passover festival. 28.03.2011 The Bank of Israel increases the interest rate for April 2011 by 0.5 percentage points to 3.0 percent.

Romania,2011-03-31,"In its meeting of March 31, 2011, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided the following:. The NBR will further vigilantly monitor domestic and global economic developments so as, by using its available instruments, to ensure the fulfillment of its objectives of achieving and maintaining price stability in the medium term as well as financial stability. The annual inflation rate rose to 7.6 percent in February 2011 from 6.99 percent in the previous month, mainly due to ample increases in food and fuel prices. This trend is in line with the balance of risks associated with the baseline scenario as outlined in the most recent medium-term inflation forecast published by the NBR (quarterly Inflation Report). The analysis of macroeconomic developments reveals ongoing positive annual growth in industrial output and exports. At the same time, both real annual dynamics of other leading indicators of domestic demand and the evolution in real terms of credit to the private sector remained in negative territory. Broad monetary conditions remained adequate for fulfilling the medium-term inflation target as the monetary policy stance stayed prudent; commercial banks' interest rates came closer to the monetary policy rate while the leu currency witnessed a mild appreciation in nominal terms amid improvements in Romania's balance of payments and as financial investors' risk perception for the Romanian economy improved. The short-term inflation outlook indicates heightened risks related mainly to factors outside the central bank's sphere of direct influence, especially those induced - similarly to the majority of other emerging economies - by food and fuel price developments on external markets, thereby affecting domestic prices, along with persistent uncertainties related to the calendar and the magnitude of administered price adjustments. In view of the high proportion of these elements in the structure of Romania's consumer basket, such an outlook poses concerns. NBR restating therefore the need to further firmly anchor inflationary expectations. In this context, the NBR Board decided to leave unchanged the monetary policy rate at an annual 6.25 percent and to continue to pursue an adequate management of liquidity in the banking system. Moreover, in order to continue the gradual alignment to the European Central Bank standards in the field, the NBR Board decided to lower the minimum reserve requirements ratio on foreign currency-denominated liabilities with residual maturities of up to two years to 20 percent from 25 percent starting with the April 24-May 23, 2011 maintenance period. The minimum reserve ratio on leu-denominated liabilities was left unchanged at 15 percent. These decisions are aimed at preserving the prospects of a sustainable resumption of disinflation and of sound economic recovery. In this context, a firm and consistent implementation of commitments agreed by the Romanian authorities under the new financing agreements with international institutions is essential to ensure a sustainable nominal and real convergence process of the Romanian economy. Furthermore, a continuous assessment of trends in non-government lending is required in order to secure adequate developments in leu-denominated loans versus foreign currency-denominated credits. The NBR will further vigilantly monitor domestic and global economic developments so as, via an adequate use of its available instruments, to ensure the fulfilment of its objectives of achieving and maintaining price stability as well as financial stability. According to the 12-month calendar of NBR Board meetings dedicated to monetary policy issues, the next meeting is scheduled for May 3, 2011, when a new quarterly Inflation Report will be analysed."
Armenia,2011-04-03,"Press Release 04.03.2011 In the March 4, 2011 meeting the Board of CBA decided to raise the Refinancing Rate of CBA by 0.5 pp, to 8.25 percent. In February of 2011 inflation was 1.9 percent, and the 12-month inflation indicator reached 12.4 percent, greatly contributed by the food prices increases as much as 10.1 pp. The Board is concerned with the inflationary environment expanding as a result of the developments in world markets of food products and primary goods in recent months, still a high level of prices due to reduced supply of agricultural products in 2010 as well as intensified secondary effects coming from the mentioned factors and increased inflationary expectations. The Board considers that the current and future economic development trends are expected to create moderate inflationary pressures in terms of the recovery of aggregate demand in the upcoming period of time. Because the risks, which were outlined in the Q1 2011 Monetary Policy Program, and the program forecasts are actually materializing, the Board decided to further exercise tightening of monetary conditions, thus remaining committed to its February statement. The Board believes that the gradual tightening of monetary conditions, the changes of the reserve requirement mechanism, the support from other public authorities in taking up anti-inflation measures will create serious preconditions for bringing inflation back to its target band starting the second half of 2011.

Poland,2011-04-05,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 5 April 2011 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 4-5 April 2011 The Council decided to increase the NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage points: (cid:131) reference rate to 4.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate to 5.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate to 2.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate to 4.25% on an annual basis. Incoming data confirm strengthening recovery of the global economy at the beginning of 2011. Economic activity has continued to rise in the United States. Economic conditions have been improving in the euro area, in particular, there has been a fast increase in economic activity in Germany. Poland's main trading partner. However, economic growth in the majority of developed countries is still being curbed by high unemployment and ongoing adjustments in the balance sheets of households, enterprises and financial institutions. In response to increasing inflationary pressures, major emerging economies and some small open developed economies have been tightening monetary policy. The effects of high fiscal imbalances in several developed economies as well as strong monetary expansion by major central banks continue to add uncertainty about the global economic outlook. This uncertainty has been heightened by the disaster in Japan and the increased tensions in Northern Africa and the Middle East, as well as by the rise in commodity prices in global markets. Moderately favourable macroeconomic data on major developed economies supported an improvement in financial market sentiment, yet, due to the disaster in Japan the volatility of financial asset and commodity prices has increased in the global markets. Surge in commodity prices has contributed to the rise in inflation across the world. Data on the Polish economy signal that in the first quarter of 2011 the annual growth rate of GDP could be close to that observed in the previous quarter. Strong retail sales growth in February reduces the risk of household consumption growth weakening markedly as a result of the expiration of factors increasing it at the end of 2010. Investment activity remains curbed despite rising capacity utilisation and very good financial situation of enterprises. Uncertainty related to demand prospects remains a factor curbing enterprises' investment activity. The rise in employment in enterprises is still accompanied by a moderate wage growth. At the same time, unemployment has remained at a heightened level. ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51. Lending to enterprises remains limited mainly due to reasons related to demand for credit. On the other hand, a relatively rapid growth in mortgage lending to households has continued (adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations) whereas consumer loans declined. In February 2011 CPI inflation remained at the level of 3.6% (with a downward revision of January data), i.e. above the NBP inflation target of 2.5%. At the same time, core inflation increased further, while inflation expectations rose markedly. The heightened level of inflation is connected primarily with increases in the prices of agricultural commodities and crude oil in the global markets, which have not been offset by changes in the zloty exchange rate, and additionally with a rise in most VAT rates at the beginning of 2011. Recent data show that the risk of a slowdown of economic activity in Poland has decreased. In the assessment of the Council, continuing economic recovery in Poland and further employment growth may gradually increase wage and inflationary pressures in the medium term. At the same time, a rise in inflation expectations combined with a surge in commodity prices across the world create the risk that heightened inflation will persist. To reduce the risk of inflation running above the inflation target in the medium term the Council decided to raise the NBP interest rates, continuing the monetary policy tightening cycle. At the same time, the Council will continue to analyse possible signals of increased inflationary pressures. An important factor affecting the monetary policy is the situation of public finances. An implementation of decisive measures aimed at permanently reducing the deficit of the general government sector and at curbing the increase of public debt is necessary for macroeconomic stability and will allow the meeting of euro adoption criteria. Although the share of foreign currency loans in new mortgage loans to households has decreased, in the opinion of the Council, introducing measures aimed at preventing fast growth in foreign currency lending to households is important for macroeconomic stability. Such measures can contribute to increasing the effectiveness of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Therefore, the Council expects that measures aimed at curbing the supply of new foreign currency loans to households will be introduced. The Council maintains its view that Poland should join the ERM II and the euro area at the earliest possible date, after meeting the necessary legal, economic and organisational conditions."
Euroarea,2011-04-07,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. Before we report on the outcome of today's meeting, we wish to express our sincere sympathy to the people of Japan, after the tragic events and lamentable loss of life. All our thoughts are with those who have suffered directly or indirectly from the natural and nuclear disaster. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to increase the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points, after maintaining them unchanged for almost two years at historically low levels. The adjustment of the current very accommodative monetary policy stance is warranted in the light of upside risks to price stability that we have identified in our economic analysis. While our monetary analysis indicates that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is still moderate, monetary liquidity remains ample and may facilitate the accommodation of price pressures. All in all, it is essential that the recent price developments do not give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures over the medium term. Our decision will contribute to keeping inflation expectations in the euro area firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to contribute to economic growth in the euro area. At the same time, interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum remain low. Thus, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and thereby continues to lend considerable support to economic activity and job creation. Recent economic data confirm that the underlying momentum of economic activity continues to be positive, with uncertainty remaining elevated. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments with respect to upside risks to price stability. As stated on previous occasions, the provision of liquidity and the allotment modes for refinancing operations will also be adjusted when appropriate, taking into account the fact that all the non-standard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions are, by construction, temporary in nature. Accordingly, the Governing Council will continue to monitor all developments over the period ahead very closely. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Following the 0.3% quarter-on-quarter increase in euro area real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2010, recent statistical releases and survey-based indicators point towards a continued positive underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area in early 2011. Looking ahead, euro area exports should be supported by the ongoing recovery in the world economy. At the same time, taking into account the relatively high level of business confidence in the euro area, private sector domestic demand should increasingly contribute to economic growth, benefiting from the accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to improve the functioning of the financial system. However, the recovery in activity is expected to be dampened somewhat by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors. In the Governing Council's assessment, the risks to this economic outlook remain broadly balanced in an environment of elevated uncertainty. On the one hand, global trade may continue to grow more rapidly than expected, thereby supporting euro area exports. Moreover, continued strong business confidence could provide more support to domestic economic activity in the euro area than currently expected. On the other hand, downside risks relate to the ongoing tensions in some segments of the financial markets that may potentially spill over to the euro area real economy. Downside risks also relate to further increases in energy prices, in particular in view of ongoing geopolitical tensions, and to protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. Finally, there are potential risks stemming from the economic impact on the euro area and elsewhere of the recent natural and nuclear disaster in Japan. With regard to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation was 2.6% in March 2011, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, after 2.4 % in February. The increase in inflation rates in early 2011 largely reflects higher commodity prices. Pressure stemming from the sharp increases in energy and food prices is also discernible in the earlier stages of the production process. It is of paramount importance that the rise in HICP inflation does not lead to second-round effects in price and wage-setting behaviour and thereby give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures over the medium term. Inflation expectations must remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments remain on the upside. They relate, in particular, to higher than assumed increases in energy prices, not least owing to ongoing political tensions in North Africa and the Middle East. More generally, strong economic growth in emerging markets, supported by ample liquidity at the global level, may further fuel commodity price rises. Moreover, increases in indirect taxes and administered prices may be greater than currently assumed, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. Finally, risks also relate to stronger than expected domestic price pressures in the context of the ongoing recovery in activity. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 increased to 2.0% in February 2011, from 1.5% in January. Looking through the recent volatility in broad money growth owing to special factors. M3 growth has continued to edge up over recent months. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector also increased further to 2.6% in February, from 2.4% in the previous month. Hence, the underlying pace of monetary expansion is gradually picking up, but remains moderate. At the same time, monetary liquidity accumulated prior to the period of financial market tensions remains ample and may facilitate the accommodation of price pressures in the euro area. Looking at M3 components, annual M1 growth moderated further to 2.9% in February 2011, while the growth of other short-term deposits and marketable instruments has increased. This rebalancing within M3 reflects the impact of the recent steepening of the yield curve on the remuneration of different monetary assets. However, this steeper yield curve also implies a dampening impact on overall M3 growth, as it reduces the attractiveness of monetary assets compared with more highly remunerated longer-term instruments outside M3. On the counterpart side, a further rise in the annual growth rate of bank loans to the private sector in February is due in part to a further slight strengthening in the growth of loans to non-financial corporations, which rose to 0.6% in February, after 0.5% in January. The growth of loans to households was 3.0% in February, compared with 3.1% in January. Overall, in early 2011 the positive flow of lending to the non-financial private sector has become more broadly based across the household and non-financial corporation sectors. The latest data confirm that banks have expanded their lending to the private sector further, while at the same time the overall size of their balance sheets has remained broadly unchanged. It is important that banks continue to expand the provision of credit to the private sector in an environment of increasing demand. To address this challenge, where necessary, it is essential for banks to retain earnings, to turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or to take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. In particular, banks that currently have limited access to market financing urgently need to increase their capital and their efficiency. To sum up, the Governing Council decided to increase the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. The adjustment of the current very accommodative monetary policy stance is warranted in the light of upside risks to price stability that we have identified in our economic analysis. A cross-check with the signals from our monetary analysis indicates that while the underlying pace of monetary expansion is still moderate, monetary liquidity remains ample and may facilitate the accommodation of price pressures. All in all, it is essential that the recent price developments do not give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures over the medium term. Our decision will contribute to keeping inflation expectations in the euro area firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to contribute to economic growth in the euro area. At the same time, interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum remain low. Thus, the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and thereby continues to lend considerable support to economic activity and job creation. Recent economic data confirm that the underlying momentum of economic activity continues to be positive, with uncertainty remaining elevated. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments with respect to upside risks to price stability. Turning to fiscal policies, it is essential that all governments achieve the consolidation targets for 2011 that they have announced. Moreover, the announcement of fully specified consolidation measures for 2012 and beyond would help to convince the general public and market participants that the corrective policies will be sustained. Strengthened confidence in the sustainability of public finances is key, as this will reduce interest rate risk premia and improve the conditions for sound and sustainable growth. At the same time, it is crucial that substantial and far-reaching structural reforms be urgently implemented in the euro area to strengthen its growth potential, competitiveness and flexibility. In the case of product markets, policies that enhance competition and innovation should, in particular, be further pursued to speed up restructuring and to facilitate advances in productivity. On the labour market, the priority must be to enhance wage flexibility and incentives to work, and to remove labour market rigidities. Finally, the Governing Council is of the view that the package of six legislative proposals on economic governance, adopted by the European Council at its summit on 24-25 March 2011, goes some way to improving economic and budgetary surveillance in the euro area. However, in our view, the proposals fall short of the necessary quantum leap in the surveillance of the euro area which is needed to ensure the smooth functioning of Economic and Monetary Union. Therefore, the Governing Council, in line with the ECB's opinion of 17 February 2011 on these proposals, urges the ECOFIN Council, the European Parliament and the Commission to agree, in the context of their “trialogue”, on more stringent requirements, more automaticity in the procedures and a clearer focus on the most vulnerable countries with losses in competitiveness. All this would help to ensure that the new framework is effective in the long run."
Chile,2011-04-12,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 12 April 2011 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 50 basis points, to 4.50% (annual). Internationally, the prices of oil and foodstuffs have remained high. Recent developments in Portugal have not deteriorated confidence in world markets, although financial risks in Europe are still cause for concern. Developed economies continue to grow and emerging markets remain dynamic. Globally, headline and expected inflation have increased and a growing number of economies have reduced their monetary stimulus. Domestically, output, demand and employment continue to show dynamism. Inflation has behaved as expected and measures of core inflation remain bounded. However, the rise in international commodity prices, in particular that of oil, are keeping short-term private inflation expectations high. The Board reiterates that it will be necessary to continue to reduce the monetary stimulus in the coming months. The pace of this process will depend on the unfolding of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions. Accordingly, it will continue to use its policies with flexibility so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. * The Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2011-04-12,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.00% for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.00% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information, the Committee considers emerging market economies to have continued to show favorable performances and the major advanced economies to have also kept up their paces of recovery. Going forward, the Committee forecasts the global economy to sustain its pace of recovery; nevertheless, the Committee recognizes the possibility of such factors as the political unrest in North Africa and the Middle East, the sovereign debt concerns in some euro area countries, and the Great East Japan Earthquake posing downside risks to the global economy. For Korea, the Committee judges the domestic economy to have maintained its underlying upward trend on the strength of high growth shown by exports, even though consumption and facilities investment have faltered. Labor market conditions have also remained on a track of improvement, led by the private sector. Going forward, the Committee anticipates that the domestic economy will keep up its underlying trend, even in the presence of external risks. Consumer price inflation in Korea reached 4.7% in March, due mostly to the rises in prices of petroleum products and personal services. There is a growing possibility of this high rising price trend persisting in the coming months, driven largely by increased demand pressures from the economic upswing, by instability of international commodity prices, and by elevated inflation expectations. As for housing prices, the upward movements in Seoul and its surrounding areas have continued and the upward trend in the rest of the country has accelerated, while leasehold deposits have continued to rise. In the financial markets, stock prices have reached new historic highs and the Korean won appreciated significantly against the US dollar in response chiefly to the uptrend in the domestic economy, amid large fluctuations exhibited by price variables due to external risk factors. Long-term market interest rates have rebounded slightly, after having declined. The pace of growth in mortgage lending has accelerated compared to last month. Looking ahead, the Committee, while taking overall account of financial and economic conditions both at home and abroad, will conduct monetary policy with a greater emphasis on ensuring that the basis for price stability is firmly anchored while the economy continues its sound growth."
Georgia,2011-04-13,"13.04.11 The NBG will keep the monetary policy rate unchanged at 8 percent. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on April 13th, 2011 and decided to keep its Main Policy Rate (the refinancing rate) unchanged at 8 percent. Consumer prices did not change in March 2011 and remained at the February level. Annual inflation reached 13.9 percent in March. The rise in prices of fuel and fruits was compensated by the decline in prices of cheese and vegetables. The effect of higher prices of food and fuel in recent months is still having substantial impact on annual inflation. This is due to the hike in the world market prices. Annual base inflation (excluding food and fuel) was equal to 2.2 percent in March and annual inflation in the service sector  2.1 percent. Existing information does not suggest increasing inflation expectations. The current level of inflation will persist for several months and will decline thereafter. The tightening of the monetary policy in the second half of 2010 and in the beginning of 2011 has already been partially transmitted to the real economy. This is signaled by a steep decline of the broad money growth rates. It should also be mentioned that the Government of Georgia is continuing the policy of fiscal consolidation. According to the last amendment in the state budget, the government decreased its effect on reserve money by 100 million GEL during the year. Having in mind the previous tightening of the monetary policy and the ongoing fiscal consolidation, the MPC deemed it unnecessary to further tighten the monetary policy. The NBG will closely monitor developments in the economy and financial markets and will in due course act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will take place on May 25th, 2011."
Peru,2011-04-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR APRIL 2011 BCRP RAISES THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE FROM 3.75% TO 4.0% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to raise the monetary policy reference rate from 3.75 percent to 4.0 percent. This measure is aimed at offsetting the impact of the rise in the international prices of food and fuels on inflation expectations, in a context of high growth of domestic demand. Future adjustments in the reference rate will depend on new information on the evolution of inflation and its determinants. Current and advanced indicators of activity continue showing a rapid growth of economic activity. In March the production of electricity grew 9.2 percent. On the other hand, even though the indicators of global economic continue to be favorable, there are still risks such as the fiscal situation in some industrialized countries and the crisis in the Middle East and North Africa. Inflation in March showed a rate of 0.7 percent, as a result of which annual inflation recorded a rate of 2.66 percent. Core inflation, which registered 0.60 percent, accumulated an annual growth of 2.41 percent. Inflation excluding food and energy showed a rate of 0.34 percent and an accumulated annual rate of 1.64 percent. These results would be indicating that the rate of inflation in March is mainly explained by supply factors. The Board continues to oversee the projection of inflation and its determinants and stands ready to adopt future adjustments in monetary policy instruments in order to ensure that inflation falls within the target range. The Board also approved to raise the following annual interest rates on active and passive operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system as detailed below: Overnight deposits: 3.20 percent. Direct repo and rediscount operations: 4.8 percent. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.8 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for May on its session of May 12, 2011."
Hungary,2011-04-18,"At its meeting on 18 April 2011, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at 6.00%. In the Council's judgement. Hungarian economic growth is likely to pick up gradually over the next 16 months; however, the level of output will remain below potential throughout the period. Inflation is expected to be considerably above the target in the short term, due to the cost-push shocks hitting the economy, but may fall back close to 3% by the end of next year even without further monetary tightening. Looking ahead, inflation is likely to continue to be dominated by the balance between two opposing forces. On the one hand, the economy has been hit by adverse cost-push shocks, which are expected to feed through to core inflation in the short term. On the other hand, weak domestic demand and high unemployment continue to exert discipline on price and wage-setting behaviour. Loose labour market conditions are allowing firms to restore their profitability by moderating earnings growth, rather than by raising prices. The Council's past interest rate increases may also reduce possible second-round effects of the cost shocks. On balance, therefore, inflation is likely to remain significantly above 3% in 2011, before falling back to around the target towards the end of next year as the first-round effects wear off. The Council judges that it may be necessary to maintain interest rates at their current level over a sustained period in order to meet the target for CPI inflation in 2012. Strong external demand is expected to remain the main driver of Hungarian economic growth, with domestic demand likely to recover only gradually. The rate of household consumption growth is expected to continue to be determined by the slow recovery in employment and subdued real earnings growth. Disbursements to members of real returns on their private pension fund contributions are likely to provide a temporary boost to consumption, with the reduction in the tax burden on personal incomes expected to provide a sustained stimulus. However, the Government's planned fiscal adjustment measures may lead to a sharp fall in disposable income in 2012. If maintained over a sustained period, current tight credit conditions in the household market may continue to hold back the recovery in consumption demand and reinforce the disinflationary effects from the real economy. The significant amount of spare capacity in the economy and uncertainty around the outlook for growth are impeding the recovery in corporate investment. Increased business uncertainty due to tight credit conditions and the effects of windfall taxes also acts as a drag on investment activity. The Monetary Council judges that there is a significant risk that the productive capacity of the economy will expand more slowly over a prolonged period in response to weaker private sector investment activity, which in turn may dampen the disinflationary effects of weak domestic demand. Perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy have fallen recently, as reflected in a decline in risk premia and an increase in demand for forintdenominated assets. In large part, this is likely to have been driven by higher global investor demand for financial assets of countries of the CEE region. However, it is difficult to judge how long this improvement will continue. The Monetary Council has decided to leave interest rates unchanged in light of the above considerations. It is justified to maintain interest rates at their current level, as long as economic developments are consistent with the projection in the Bank's March Quarterly Report on Inflation. If incoming data suggest a greater pass-through from the cost shocks, it may be necessary to tighten current monetary conditions in response to upside risks to inflation. However, a slower-than-expected recovery in lending to households and weaker-than-expected domestic demand may warrant a reduction in interest rates in the medium term."
Turkiye,2011-04-21,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the policy rates constant at the following levels: a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) at 6.25 percent, b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 1.50 percent, lending rate at 9 percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 8 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, lending rate at 12 percent. Recent releases suggest that the economic activity is moderating after a strong print in the last quarter of 2010. However, domestic demand remains strong, while external demand displays a weaker pace. Employment conditions continue to improve, though, unemployment rates remain higher than the pre-crisis levels. Owing to the lagged impact of rising oil prices as well as base effects, inflation is expected to display an increasing trend over the short term and, after hovering around the target throughout the year, it is expected to end the year somewhat above the target of 5.5 percent. Central Bank of Turkey (CBT) will not react to the first round effects of the increases in oil and other commodity prices. However, second round effects will be closely monitored and a deterioration in the pricing behavior will not be tolerated. The effects of the measures taken by the CBT since November on credit volume and domestic demand are expected to be more visible starting with the second quarter. However, the Committee has indicated that raising reserve requirements on short term foreign exchange and Turkish lira liabilities would contribute to containing macro financial risks by rebalancing the external and domestic demand. In light of these assessments, in order to contain the risks towards price stability and financial stability, the Committee has decided to monitor the tightening impact of the implemented policy mix—a low policy rate, a wide interest corridor and high reserve requirement ratios— and take additional measures along the same lines, if needed. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Israel,2011-04-24,"24.04.2011 The Bank of Israel leaves the interest rate unchanged at 3 percent for May 2011 To view this press release as a WORD file - Click here Background conditions Inflation data: The inflation rate, measured over the previous twelve months, continued to increase, and in March reached 4.3 percent. The CPI (Consumer Price Index) excluding the housing price component was unchanged in March, and rose by 3.6 percent in the previous twelve months. The CPIincreased by 0.2 percent in March, slightly less than the average forecast, and in line with the seasonal path consistent with the achievement of theinflation target. This was in contrast to the previous four months in which the CPI change was above the upper limit of the path. However, it is important to note that this is a single figure, and it is too early to tell if it marks a turning point. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: The average of forecasters' inflation expectations for the next twelve monthly CPI readings was unchanged from the previous month at 3.1 percent, slightly above the upper limitof the target inflation range. Inflation expectations calculated from the capital market declined, on average, to 3.1 percent in April. This decline took place against the background, among other things, of the 0.50 percentage point interest rate hike by the Bank of Israel last month. It appears that medium-term and long-term inflation expectations were also impacted by the rate hike last month, and those expectations fell this month, so that most of the curve is now within the inflation target range. Forecasters' predictions and the Bank of Israel Research Department staff forecast are that the CPI rise for April will be high, with an average of 0.8 percent, in line with the seasonal path consistent with the mid-point of the inflation target range. The inflation rate for the preceding twelve months is expected to remain above the target range during the rest of 2011, and it is expectedto decline at the beginning of 2012 to the upper limit of the target range. Based on the Telbor market (Tel Aviv Inter-Bank Offered Rate), the Bank of Israel interest rate in a year's time is expected to be 4.4 percent, and on average, forecasters' predictions are that it will be 4.2 percent. Both figures represent a rise in interest rate forecasts compared with the previous month. Most forecasters expected the Bank of Israel to leave the interest rate unchanged for May 2011. Real economic activity: Economic indicators that became availablethis month show that domestic activity continued to expand, and point to continued expansion in the second quarter. Figures compiled so far from the Bank of Israel's Companies Survey for the first quarter show that in the first quarter company activity continued to grow in most sectors. According to the survey, companies in all sectors expect growth to continue in the second quarter as well. Monthly figures point to continued growth in industrial production and in revenue in the trade and services sector. The March composite state-of-the-economy index rose by a strong 0.5 percent, continuing the strong gains of previous months. With respect to foreign trade, the rapid pace of growth of goods exports and of goods imports continued in the first quarter. Analysis of data on real economic activity points to the fact that growth in the first quarter was led by exports. This, despite the continued appreciation of the shekel. In contrast, however, the Purchasing Managers Index indicates a drop in domestic demand for the second consecutive month, and the Bank of Israel Research Department index of the probability of a slowdown in domestic demand, based on Google searches, increased to about the 50 percent threshold. The Bank of Israel staff forecast which was updated this month, is that inflation in 2011 will be above the upper limit of the target inflation range, and will decline to the upper limit toward mid-2012, with the interest rate increasing gradually to about 4.4 percent in a year's time. This month, the Research Department updated its GDP (Gross Domestic Product) growth forecast for 2011 to 4.5 percent, from an original forecast of 3.8 percent, and the unemployment rate for the year is expected to be 6.1 percent on average. The Research Department also published a forecast of 4 percent growth, with an average unemployment rate of 5.9 percent, for the full year of 2012. The main factors which can change the forecasts for realactivity and inflation in Israel are developments in the global economy, including increases in commodity and oil prices, developments in the local housing market, the realization of geopolitical risks, and a possible increase in wage pressures in the public sector. At the same time, a boost in growth of world trade is likely to contribute to export volume. The recent appreciation of the shekel may help bring inflation to within the target rangeearlier, which may moderate the pace of interest rate hikes. The labor market and wages: The number of claimants for unemployment benefits fell consistently from January to March, and its average levelis lower than the average level in the second half of 2010. The labor force survey for the fourth quarter of 2010 showed that the number of employed persons rose throughout the year in most sectors of the economy. The unemployment rate was 6.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2010, and according totrend figures the unemployment rate in January was 6.1 percent. Nominal wages rose in November-January by 1.9 percent and real wages rose 0.5 percent compared with their levels in August-October. Health tax receipts in February 2011, which provide an indication of wage payments in that month, are 8.6 percent higher, in nominal terms, than their level in February 2010. Budget data: Government expenditure in January-March was 6.8 percent lower than the seasonal level consistent with full expenditure of the budget. Since the beginning of the year, the government's overall cumulative surplus in the budget totaled NIS 2 billion, about NIS 4.5 billionhigher than the seasonal path consistent with remaining below the deficit ceiling. Tax revenues in January-March, after accounting for the effects of legislative changes and nonrecurring receipts, were 9.1 percent higher, in real terms, than in the first three months of 2010-direct tax revenues were 11.6 percent higher, and indirect tax revenues were 7.6 percent higher. The foreign exchange market: From the previous monetary policy discussion held on March 27, through April 20, the shekel appreciated by 3.7 percentagainst the dollar, and appreciated by 1.9 percent against the euro. In nominal effective exchange rate terms, the shekel strengthened 2.5 percent. Despite the interest rate hike in Israel, the shekel's strength was similar to the strength of currencies of other fast growing economies around the world, against a background of continued Bank of Israel intervention in the foreign currency market. The capital and money markets:Between the monetary policy discussions of March 27 and April 20, most Tel Aviv Stock Exchange share price indices rose. This was in contrast to the general trend in developed markets, but in line with developments in several emerging markets. The Tel Aviv 25 Index rose 2.5 percent and is at all-time record high levels, and the Tel Aviv 100 Index rose 1.7 percent. Yields on government bonds increased in this period, against the background of the latest increase in the interest rate, expectations of a faster rate of increase in the interest rate, and geopolitical uncertainty. Over the period, the yield on makam increased along the entire curve by about 20 basis points. The decline in nonresidents' activity in the makam market halted this month, as foreign investors reentered this market. Yields on local currency bonds increased primarily in short-term maturities by about 20 basis points. Yields on CPI-indexed government bonds rose sharply by about 10-50 basis points, as the yield curve flattened somewhat, reflecting a sharp drop in inflation expectationsderived from the capital market. The yield gap between Israeli unindexed 10-year government bonds and US 10-year Treasury notes was unchanged during the period surveyed, and stood at 186 basis points. The corporate bond market saw renewed growth in the pace of issues compared with February and March. The CPI-indexed Tel-Bond indices showed prominent drops of about 1.5%, against the background of the rise in the interest rate in March; the Tel-Bond Shekel Index was little changed. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spread continued to fall this month, and reached 142 basis points, compared with 153 basis points at the end of last month. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in March the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 5.2 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 7.6 percent. Developments in the market for housing credit: The balance of outstanding housing credit increased in the twelve months ending in February by 12.8 percent. Forty-eight percent of housing loans given in March were unindexed, variable rate loans, and in all, about 80 percent of the loans granted were variable rate (indexed and unindexed), similar to previous months. The amount of mortgages granted in the previous twelve months continued to be high--about NIS 50 billion. The rates of interest on mortgages of all types increased again this month, against the background ofthe recent increases in the Bank of Israel interest rate, among other things. The housing market:House prices--which are presented in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of house prices but are not included in the CPI--continued to increase, and in January-February they increased at a rate of 1.7 percent a month, following their increase of 0.8 percent a month in December-January. The annual pace of rises in house prices continues to be high, and in the last twelve months house prices increased by 16.1 percent. The housing price index, which is based mainly on renewed rental contracts and which is included in the CPI, rose by 0.6 percent in March. In the last twelve months the housing price index increased by 6.4 percent, similar to the previous month. The global economy: : The global economic recovery continued in the past month as well, and was based primarily on the strong growth in Asian economies, on the noticeable improvement in major European economies, andon continued growth in US employment and personal consumption. The economic expansion worldwide was reflected as well in the continued rise in global commodities exports in the first quarter, as well as in consecutive increases in industrial production indices in the US. Euro bloc. Japan, and other countries. In addition, a move from government demand to private demand continued, and there was reduced concern that the end of fiscal expansion which followed the crisis will lead the global economy to renewed contraction. On the other hand, the main risks to the global economy are the continuedrise in commodity prices, continued instability in the Middle East, uncertainty regarding the economic consequences of the earthquake in Japan, the debt crisis in some European countries which worsened this month, and increased attention to US debt and deficit levels by one of the credit rating agencies. This month, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) left its growth outlooks unchanged but emphasized its concerns about the downside risks to these forecasts. With an eye to rising prices, and the growing pace of inflation, central banks in emerging markets continued to react with monetary tightening policies, and the ECB (European Central Bank) joined the trend thismonth. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to leave the interest rate for May unchanged at 3 percent is consistent with the process of returning the interest rate to a more normal range intended to position inflation firmly within the target range, andto support the further recovery of economic activity, while maintaining financial stability. The rate of increase in the interest rate is not pre-determined, but is set in accordance with the inflation environment, growth inIsrael and globally, the monetary policies of the leading central banks, and developments in the exchange rates of the shekel. At the current level of the interest rate, monetary policy continues to be expansionary. Inflation expectations for the next twelve months derived from the capital market declined, due in part to the increase in the interest rate for April. However,at 3.1 percent, similar to the average of the forecasters' expectations which did not change this month, the expectations are still above theupper limit of the inflation target range. Inflation expectations for periods longer than a year also declined, and most are now within the target range. The recent appreciation of the shekel and the recent increases in the interest rate are expected to moderate the rate of inflation in the coming months. Indicatorsof economic activity published this month support the assessment that the rapid expansion of activity and demand continued in the first quarter of 2011. The Bank of Israel staff forecast was updated, and now predicts GDP growth of 4.5 percent in 2011, compared with the previous forecast of 3.8 percent. The global economy is continuing along the path of recovery. Nevertheless, there are several risks that are still raising the level of uncertainty regarding future global growth. House prices continued to increase this month, and in the last twelve month have risen by 16.1 percent. The balance of housing credit increased by 12.8 percent in the twelve months to February 2011. About 80 percent of housing loans granted in March were at floating interest rates. Against the background of these developments, the Bank of Israel is considering the introduction in the near future of additional measures in the housing credit field. Central bank interest rates in the major advanced economies are still low. The ECB, however, recently increased its interest rate by 25 basis points, and againstthe background of the acceleration in inflation in emerging market economies, a relatively large number of central banks are continuing to raise their interest rates and are introducing other contractionary measures. The interest rate differential between economies with relatively rapid growth rates, including Israel, and the advanced economies presents policy makers in the former with a serious challenge--how to balance the domestic pressures to increase the interest rate with the effect of such an increase on the appreciation of their currencies and its effect on their exports, and hence on economic activity. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in Israel's economy and the global economy and in the financial markets. The Bank will usethe instruments available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, including keeping a close watch on developmentsin the assets market, and especially in the housing market. The minutes of the discussions prior to the above interest rate decision will be published on May 9, 2011. The decision regarding the interest rate for June 2011 will be published at 17:30 on Monday. May 23, 2011. 24.04.2011 The Bank of Israel leaves the interest rate unchanged at 3 percent for May 2011. The Bank of Israel leaves the interest rate unchanged at 3 percent for May 2011.

Mongolia,2011-04-27,"MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Ref No: 2011/04 Date: April 27, 2011 Embargo: Not for publication or broadcast before 1100 hours on Thursday, 28 April 2011. April 27, 2011  Board of Directors of the Bank of Mongolia decided to increase the policy rate by 0.5 unit percent basing on the below grounds.  Inflation in Ulaanbaatar was decreased 7.4% as of March-2011 owing to the low price of meat. However, the core inflation counted as passing the main food product was 7.9%. The growth of core inflation over the general one shows that the inflation comes out due to the excess money supply.  Year over year the money supply has been raised up by 67% /MNT 1.8 trillion/ as March of 2011 and also there is still some expectation of inflation growth. The amount of money from abroad affected the rise in supply and the prospect of loan rate increase. Also, the loan outstanding of financial system was added by 35% /MNT 962 billion/ YOY. The demand comes from the excess supply would only bring the climb in cost of good and service.  According to the BoM inflation forecast, the inflation would reach 15-20% in December of 2011 if the above process keeps going. Since the economic overheat signs are appeared in our country, it is urgent for the Central Bank to tighten the monetary policy in order not to face the economic instability. The Central Bank is taking the step considering not only the statistic, but also seeing the estimation of the inflation expectation and the real risks. It means that the decision was made by conceiving the far future, not only the recent days. The policy rate growth intends to prevent from the overheating of midterm macro economy and to lessen the high pressure of basic inflation raised by the rapid activation economy.

United States,2011-04-27,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates that the economic recovery is proceeding at a moderate pace and overall conditions in the labor market are improving gradually. Household spending and business investment in equipment and software continue to expand. However, investment in nonresidential structures is still weak, and the housing sector continues to be depressed. Commodity prices have risen significantly since last summer, and concerns about global supplies of crude oil have contributed to a further increase in oil prices since the Committee met in March. Inflation has picked up in recent months, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable and measures of underlying inflation are still subdued. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The unemployment rate remains elevated, and measures of underlying inflation continue to be somewhat low, relative to levels that the Committee judges to be consistent, over the longer run, with its dual mandate. Increases in the prices of energy and other commodities have pushed up inflation in recent months. The Committee expects these effects to be transitory, but it will pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations. The Committee continues to anticipate a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability. To promote a stronger pace of economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with its mandate, the Committee decided today to continue expanding its holdings of securities as announced in November. In particular, the Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its securities holdings and will complete purchases of $600 billion of longer-term Treasury securities by the end of the current quarter. The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings in light of incoming information and is prepared to adjust those holdings as needed to best foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period. The Committee will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will employ its policy tools as necessary to support the economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with its mandate. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; William C Dudley.

India,2011-05-03,"Monetary Policy Statement for 2011-12 Press Statement by Dr.D. Subbarao. Governor ""First of all, on behalf of the Reserve Bank of India. I want to welcome all of you to this announcement of our Annual Monetary Policy. The Annual Policy for 2011-12 is set in conditions significantly different from those a year ago. Last year's policy was made in an environment of incipient domestic recovery and uncertainty about the state of the global economy. While signs of inflation were visible, they were driven primarily by food items. Nonetheless, there was a clear risk of food price pressures spilling over into more generalised inflation, as the recovery consolidated and domestic resource utilisation rose to levels which stretched capacities. Throughout last year, the goal of monetary policy was to nurture the recovery in the face of persistent global uncertainty, while trying to contain the spill-over of supply side inflation. The Reserve Bank followed a policy of calibrated tightening last year. This was justified by the trend of moderating inflation and consolidating growth in the second and third quarters of 2010-11. However, the resurgence of inflation in the last quarter of last year became a matter of concern. Although the trigger for this was the sharp uptrend in international commodity prices, the fact that these have quickly passed through into the entire range of domestic manufactured goods indicates that pricing power is significant. In other words, demand has been strong enough to allow significant pass-through of input price increases. Importantly, this is happening even as there are visible signs of moderating growth, particularly in capital goods production and investment spending, suggesting that cumulative monetary actions are beginning to have an impact on demand. Thus, three factors have shaped the outlook and monetary strategy for 2011-12. First, global commodity prices, which have surged in recent months are, at best, likely to remain firm, and may well increase further over the course of the year. This suggests that higher inflation will persist, and may indeed get worse. Second, headline and core inflation have significantly overshot even the most pessimistic projections over the past few months. This raises concerns about inflation expectations becoming unhinged. The third factor, one countering the above forces, is the likely moderation in demand, which should help reduce pricing power and the extent of pass- through of commodity prices. This contra trend cannot be ignored in the policy calculation. However, a significant factor influencing aggregate demand during the year will be the fiscal situation. The budget estimates offered reassurance of a fiscal rollback. However, the critical assumption, that2 petroleum and fertiliser subsidies would be capped, is bound to be seriously tested at prevailing crude oil prices. Even though an adjustment of domestic retail prices may add to the inflation rate in the short run, the Reserve Bank believes that this needs to be done as soon as possible. Otherwise, the fiscal deficit will widen and will counter the moderating trend in aggregate demand. The monetary policy trajectory that is being initiated in this Annual Statement is based on the following basic premise. Over the long run, high inflation is inimical to sustained growth as it harms investment by creating uncertainty. Current elevated rates of inflation pose significant risks to future growth. Bringing them down, therefore, even at the cost of some growth in the short-run, should take precedence. Monetary Policy Stance 6. Against the above backdrop, the stance of monetary policy of the Reserve Bank will be as follows: First, to maintain an interest rate environment that moderates inflation and anchors inflation expectations. Second, to foster an environment of price stability that is conducive to sustaining growth in the medium-term, coupled with financial stability. Third, to manage liquidity to ensure that it remains broadly in balance, with neither a large surplus diluting monetary transmission nor a large deficit choking off fund flows. Changes in Operating Procedure of Monetary Policy 7. Before announcing our policy measures, let me make a comment on the changes we are making to the operating procedure of monetary policy. Last July, the Reserve Bank constituted a Working Group to Review the Operating Procedure of Monetary Policy. The report of the Group, chaired by our Executive Director. Deepak Mohanty, was put out in the public domain in March 2011 inviting feedback and comments. Based on the Group's recommendations, and in light of the feedback received, it has been decided to make the following changes to the operating procedure of monetary policy: First, the weighted average overnight call money rate will be the operating target of monetary policy of the Reserve Bank. Second, there will henceforth be only one independently varying policy rate, and that will be the repo rate. This transition to a single independently varying policy rate is expected to more accurately signal the monetary policy stance. Third, the reverse repo rate will continue to be operative, but it will be pegged at a fixed 100 basis points below the repo rate. Hence, the reverse repo rate will no longer be an independent variable. Fourth, we will be instituting a new Marginal Standing Facility (MSF). Banks can borrow overnight from the MSF up to one per cent of their respective net demand and time liabilities or NDTL. The rate of interest on amounts accessed from this facility will be 100 basis points above the repo rate. As per the above scheme, the revised corridor will have a fixed width of 200 basis points. The repo rate will be in the middle. The reverse repo rate will be 100 basis points below it, and the MSF rate 100 basis points above it.3 10. These changes in the operating framework, except that pertaining to the MSF, will come into force immediately. The MSF will come into effect from the fortnight beginning 7th May, 2011. Monetary Measures 11. On the basis of the policy stance that I outlined above, and in accordance with changes in operating procedure as set out, we have decided to take the following policy measures: The repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) has been increased by 50 basis points. Accordingly, it goes up from 6.75 per cent to 7.25 per cent. ii) As per the new operating procedure, the reverse repo rate under the LAF, determined with a 100 basis point spread below the repo rate, will stand adjusted at 6.25 per cent. iii) The Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) rate, determined with a spread of 100 basis points above the repo rate, gets calibrated at 8.25 per cent. iv) The Bank Rate remains at 6.0 per cent. v) The cash reserve ratio (CRR) remains unchanged at 6 per cent of NDTL of scheduled banks. Savings Bank Deposit Interest Rate 12. Let me now turn to the savings bank deposit interest rate on which there has been a lot of media comment over the last week. A week ago, the Reserve Bank put out a discussion paper debating the pros and cons of this proposal. We will review the policy of deregulating the savings bank deposit rate based on the feedback that we get. Pending a final decision on that, we have decided to increase the savings bank deposit interest rate from the present 3.5 per cent to 4.0 per cent with immediate effect. Expected Outcomes 14. As regards outcomes, the above monetary policy actions are expected to: First, contain inflation by reining in demand side pressures, and anchor inflation expectations; and Second, the actions are expected to sustain growth in the medium-term by containing inflation. Let me give you some guidance for the period forward. The Reserve Bank's baseline inflation projections are that inflation will remain elevated, close to the March 2011 level over the first half of 2011-12, before declining. These projections factor in an upward revision of petrol and diesel prices. While the persistence of inflation over the next few months has been incorporated into this policy, the Reserve Bank will continue to persevere with its anti-inflationary stance. Overview 16. I now want to give you an overview of the global and domestic macroeconomic developments that guided our monetary policy stance, and our growth and inflation projections. Global Outlook 17. On the global front, recovery is expected to sustain in 2011 even as it is projected to moderate marginally from its 2010 pace due to the phasing out of the fiscal stimulus, and high oil and other commodity prices. Growth in emerging market economies is also expected to decelerate on account of monetary tightening and rising4 commodity prices. The advanced economies are facing inflation pressures from high commodity prices, while inflation pressures for the emerging market economies are stemming from both strong domestic demand and high commodity prices. The Indian Economy Growth 18. Turning to the domestic macroeconomic situation, the Indian economy is estimated to have grown by 8.6 per cent last year. Agricultural growth was above trend, following a good monsoon. The index of industrial production (IIP), which grew by 10.7 per cent during the first half of last year, moderated subsequently, bringing down the overall growth for April-February 2010-11 to 7.8 per cent. Particularly significant were the slowdown in capital goods production and investment spending. Going forward, high oil and other commodity prices and the impact of the Reserve Bank's anti-inflationary monetary stance will moderate growth. Based on the assumption of a normal monsoon, and crude oil prices averaging US$110 a barrel over the full year 2011-12, our baseline projection of real GDP growth for 2011-12, for policy purposes, is around 8 per cent. Inflation 20. Inflation has been, and remains, a primary macroeconomic concern. Last year, inflation was driven by a combination of structural and transitory factors. Based on drivers of inflation, the year gone by, could broadly be divided into three periods. In the first period from April to July 2010. WPI increased by 3.5 per cent, and this was driven largely by food items. During the second period from August to November 2010. WPI increase decelerated to 1.8 per cent, with the major driver being non-food primary articles. In the third period, from December 2010 to March 2011. WPI increased sharply by 3.4 per cent, driven primarily by non-food manufactured products. Inflation pressures, which initially emanated from food, clearly became generalised as the year progressed. Going forward, the inflation outlook will be shaped by the following factors: The first factor is, when administered fuel and power group prices might be revised and by how much. Second, the outlook for crude oil prices in the near future is uncertain given the geopolitical situation in the Middle East and North Africa. In any case, the likelihood of oil prices moderating significantly is low. The third factor that will shape the inflation outlook is the sharp increase in the prices of several important industrial raw materials such as minerals, fibres, rubber, coal and crude oil. In addition, there is also upward pressure on wages. To the extent the increase in input prices translates to output prices, it will have an influence on the inflation path. Finally, the behaviour of the monsoon will be a critical factor in shaping inflation expectations on the way forward. Keeping in view the domestic demand-supply balance, the global trend in commodity prices, and the likely demand scenario, our baseline projection for WPI inflation for March 2012 is 6 per cent with an upward bias.5 23. As regards the trajectory over the year, inflation is expected to remain at an elevated level in the first half of the year, before gradually moderating to 6 per cent by March 2012. This trajectory is conditional on appropriate policy actions over the year. Monetary and Liquidity Conditions 24. Liquidity conditions remained abnormally tight for much of last year owing to a combination of structural and frictional factors. The LAF corridor stayed almost entirely in the injection mode during the year. You will recall that the Reserve Bank had instituted a number of measures to ease the excessive tightness in the system. Liquidity conditions have eased significantly in recent weeks, following a sharp reduction in government cash balances, and moderation in the credit-deposit ratio of banks. The liquidity situation is now within the comfort zone of the Reserve Bank. External Sector 26. A brief, albeit important, comment about the external sector. Exports showed remarkable buoyancy in the last quarter of last fiscal. The current account deficit (CAD) was 3.1 per cent of GDP for the first three quarters. April-December 2010. Factoring in the better performance in the last quarter. CAD is now estimated to have moderated to around 2.5 per cent of GDP for the full year, 2010-11 as compared with 2.8 per cent for the year before, 2009-10. Risk Factors 27. Now let me highlight the risks to our growth and inflation projections: First, there are several downside risks to global growth at this stage such as: (a) sovereign debt problem in the euro area, (b) high commodity prices, especially oil prices, (c) possible abrupt rise in long-term interest rates in advanced economies with implications for fiscal adjustment; and (d) accentuation of inflationary pressures in emerging market economies. Should the global recovery slacken because of any or some of these factors, it will impact our economy through trade, finance and confidence channels. Second, global commodity prices are a significant risk factor for both domestic growth and inflation. The future path of crude oil prices is uncertain. Third, the budgeted fiscal deficit for the current year gives some comfort on the demand front. However, the achievement of the fiscal targets set out in the budget could be challenged by the higher subsidy burden stemming from higher international crude oil prices. Fourth, persistently high food prices are likely to exert sustained upward pressure on wages, thus transmitting through to wider cost pressure on prices. Finally, if oil and commodity prices remain elevated, both the level of current account deficit, and its financing could pose a challenge. Developmental and Regulatory Polices 28. As is the standard practice, this Annual Monetary Policy Statement also includes developmental and regulatory policies. Let me briefly touch upon some of the important initiatives. I will start with the Malegam Committee Report on Regulation of Micro Finance Institutions. The Reserve Bank has broadly accepted the framework of regulations6 recommended by the Malegam Committee. We have, however, adjusted some of the parameters recommended by the Committee. Bank loans to all MFIs, including NBFCs working as MFIs on or after April 1, 2011, will be eligible for classification as priority sector loans if, and only if, they conform to the regulations formulated by the Reserve Bank. As recommended by the Malegam Committee, the Reserve Bank has also decided to appoint a Committee to review the priority sector lending classification. A broad goal driving our financial inclusion initiative is to provide banking access to all villages with population of over 2000 by March 2012. There are 72,800 villages identified as falling into this category. We are asking banks to ensure that at least 25 per cent of the new branches being opened during this year are located in tier 5 and tier 6 centres. In the area of financial markets, there are three important initiatives: First, the Reserve Bank will shortly issue the final guidelines on credit default swaps. Second, the period of short sale in government securities will be extended from the existing five days to a maximum of three months. Third. FIIs will be allowed to cancel and rebook up to 10 per cent of the market value of the portfolio as at the beginning of the financial year. Moving on to regulatory measures for commercial banks. I want to highlight two measures: First, the provisioning requirements on certain categories of non-performing advances and restructured advances will be enhanced. Second, investment by banks in liquid schemes of debt oriented mutual funds will be subject to a prudential cap of 10 per cent of their net worth as on March 31 of the previous year. I invite you to please read the policy document for a full listing of our developmental and regulatory measures. Before I close. I want to reiterate what I said earlier, by making a brief comment on the growth-inflation trade off, an issue that has been widely debated in the run up to this policy. High and persistent inflation undermines growth by creating uncertainty for investors, and driving up inflation expectations. An environment of price stability is a pre-condition for sustaining growth in the medium-term. Reining in inflation should therefore take precedence even if there are some short-term costs by way of lower growth"". Ajit Prasad Press Release : 2010-2011/1592 Assistant General Manager."
Romania,2011-05-03,"In its meeting of May 3, 2011, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided the following:. The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report which will be released to the public in a press conference on May 5, 2011. The recent developments in macroeconomic indicators show an increase in the annual inflation rate to 8.01 percent in March 2011 from 7.6 percent in the previous month as supply-side risks related to the significant hikes in food and fuel prices presented in the February 2011 Inflation Report have materialized in the context of heightening pressures on the international commodities market. Industrial output and exports stayed on an upward trend, but the annual real dynamics of indicators relevant to domestic demand and that of credit to the private sector remained in negative territory. The aggregate demand deficit will persist in the medium term although it is expected to narrow gradually. The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, a document that assesses the recent macroeconomic context, investigates the inflation outlook and identifies the main challenges and constraints to monetary policy in the period ahead. The updated projection of macroeconomic developments envisages a temporary increase in the annual inflation rate in 2011 Q2 following the shocks induced by the factors outside the direct influence of the aggregate demand management ensured via central bank's tools, especially those generated  similarly to most emerging economies  by the evolution of global food and fuel prices. Nevertheless, the baseline scenario of the current projection envisages the resumption of disinflation in 2011 H2, once the first-round effect of the VAT rate hike faded, followed by the return and maintenance of inflation rate inside the variation band around the central target throughout 2012. Moreover, the current forecast highlights the persistence of risks and uncertainties related to the calendar and magnitude of administered price adjustments, but also to global market developments. In this context, the NBR Board decided to leave unchanged the monetary policy rate at an annual 6.25 percent, to continue to pursue an adequate management of liquidity in the banking system and to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The monetary policy stance is aimed at preserving the prospects for resuming disinflation despite the recent inflationary shocks, with broad monetary conditions remaining adequate for fulfilling the medium-term inflation target. At the same time, the improvement in non-resident financial investor sentiment towards the Romanian economy led to an increase in volatile capital inflows, entailing a moderate nominal appreciation of the leu versus the euro. The outlook of continued and growing volatile capital flows triggers constraints on the dosage of the monetary policy tools. These decisions, along with the consistent implementation of commitments agreed by the Romanian authorities under the new financing agreements with international institutions, would ensure the preservation of prospects of a sustainable resumption of disinflation and a robust recovery of the Romanian economy during the nominal and real convergence process. The NBR reiterates that the central bank will vigilantly monitor domestic and global economic developments so as, via an adequate use of its available instruments, to ensure the fulfilment of its objectives of achieving and maintaining price stability in the medium term as well as financial stability. The quarterly Inflation Report will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled for May 5, 2011. According to the calendar of NBR Board meetings dedicated to monetary policy issues, the next meeting is scheduled for June 29, 2011."
Philippines,2011-05-04,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to increase by another 25 basis points the BSP's key policy interest rates to 4.5 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 6.5 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs, and special deposit accounts (SDAs) were also raised accordingly. In deciding to increase policy rates anew, the Monetary Board noted that the latest baseline inflation forecasts continue to suggest that the 3-5 percent inflation target for 2011 remains at risk, mainly as a result of expected pressures from oil prices. International oil prices have remained elevated due to strong global demand as well as concerns about supply gaps. Global non-oil markets also continued to tighten. Upward shifts in the public's inflation expectations remain a major policy consideration for the BSP. Recent surveys, including the Asia Pacific Consensus Forecasts, the Consumer Expectations Survey, and the BSP's survey of private sector economists, show elevated inflation forecasts for 2011 and higher expected inflation for 2012. Sustained price pressures and higher inflationary expectations could influence future wage and price outcomes. With these considerations, the Board deemed it prudent to rein in inflation expectations further and contain second-round effects with a follow-through policy action. At the same time, the Monetary Board noted that the economy is expected to grow above trend. Capacity utilization of the manufacturing sector has remained consistently above 80 percent while lending for production activities continues to expand, indicating the sustained pick-up in private investment. Consumer lending has remained robust while vehicle sales were sustained despite rising fuel costs. The Monetary Board also noted that, while domestic liquidity and credit grew at a reasonable pace, sustained strong foreign capital inflows warrant careful attention to ensure that they do not exacerbate domestic liquidity levels and fan inflationary pressures in the future. The Monetary Board remains prepared to take appropriate actions necessary to ensure the achievement of the BSP's price stability objective."
Czech Republic,2011-05-05,"Press conference of the CNB Bank Board 3rd Situation Report on Economic and Monetary Developments 5 May 2011 The monetary policy decision taken and the ratio of the votes cast At the close of the meeting the Bank Board decided by a majority vote to leave the two-week repo rate unchanged at 0.75%. Five members voted in favour of this decision, and two members voted for increasing rates by 0.25 percentage point. Reasons for the decision Headline and monetary-policy relevant inflation will be close to the inflation target over the monetary policy horizon. Consistent with the forecast is broad stability of market interest rates in the near future and a gradual rise in rates starting in 2011 Q4. The risks to the forecast for monetary-policy relevant inflation are balanced. The message of the forecast No inflation pressures from the domestic economy are apparent. Both headline and monetary-policy relevant inflation will be close to the inflation target over the entire forecast horizon. Economic growth will slow this year due to fiscal restriction, fading investment in inventories and slower growth in economic activity abroad. more robust economic recovery is expected to reappear in 2012. The nominal exchange rate is gradually appreciating over the forecast horizon. Consistent with the forecast is broad stability of market interest rates in the near future and a gradual rise in rates starting in 2011 Q4. Upside risks: less anti-inflationary domestic economic environment Downside risks: debt crisis in some euro area countries 13 Alternative scenario of the forecast The alternative scenario captures the effects of a planned change in the reduced VAT rate (from 10% to 14% with effect from 1 January 2012). The first-round effect on inflation amounts to roughly 1.1 p.p.; the largest part is due to food prices (0.6 p.p.), while the rest is due to administered prices (0.3 p.p.) and adjusted inflation excluding fuels (0.2 p.p.). Monetary policy of the CNB does not respond to the first-round effects of indirect tax changes. In 2012. GDP is roughly 0.4 p.p. lower on average compared to the baseline scenario. Lower economic activity is reflected in slightly lower monetary-policy relevant inflation and consequently in marginally lower interest rates. The exchange rate forecast does not differ noticeably from the baseline scenario. 14 Headline inflation in the alternative scenario of the forecast 4 3 2 1 0 II/0 9 III IV I/1 0 II III IV I/1 1 II III IV I/1 2 II III IV A lte rn a tiv e s c e n a rio B a s e lin e s c e n a rio 15 Thank you for your attention More information about the forecast can be found at and in Inflation Report II/2011, to be published 13 May 2011."
Euroarea,2011-05-05,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference here in Helsinki. I would like to thank Governor Liikanen for his kind hospitality and express our special gratitude to his staff for the excellent organisation of today's meeting of the Governing Council. We will now report on the outcome of the meeting, which was also attended by Commissioner Rehn. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged following the 25-basis point increase on 7 April 2011. The information that has become available since then confirms our assessment that an adjustment of the very accommodative monetary policy stance was warranted. We continue to see upward pressure on overall inflation, mainly owing to energy and commodity prices. While the monetary analysis indicates that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is still moderate, monetary liquidity remains ample and may facilitate the accommodation of price pressures. Furthermore, recent economic data confirm the positive underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area, with uncertainty continuing to be elevated. All in all, it is essential that recent price developments do not give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures. Inflation expectations in the euro area must remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. With interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum remaining low and the monetary policy stance still accommodative, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments with respect to upside risks to price stability. Maintaining price stability over the medium term is our guiding principle, which we apply when assessing new information, forming our judgements and deciding on any further adjustment of the accommodative stance of monetary policy. As stated on previous occasions, the provision of liquidity and the allotment modes for refinancing operations will also be adjusted when appropriate, taking into account the fact that all the non-standard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions are, by construction, temporary in nature. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Following the 0.3% quarter-on-quarter increase in euro area real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2010, recent statistical releases and survey-based indicators point towards a continued positive underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area during the first quarter of 2011 and at the beginning of the second quarter. Looking ahead, euro area exports should be supported by the ongoing expansion in the world economy. At the same time, taking into account the high level of business confidence in the euro area, private sector domestic demand should contribute increasingly to economic growth, benefiting from the accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to improve the functioning of the financial system. However, activity is expected to continue to be dampened somewhat by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors. In the Governing Council's assessment, the risks to this economic outlook remain broadly balanced in an environment of elevated uncertainty. On the one hand, global trade may continue to grow more rapidly than expected, thereby supporting euro area exports. Moreover, strong business confidence could provide more support to domestic economic activity in the euro area than currently expected. On the other hand, downside risks relate to the ongoing tensions in some segments of the financial markets that may potentially spill over to the euro area real economy. Downside risks also relate to further increases in energy prices, particularly in view of ongoing geopolitical tensions in North Africa and the Middle East, and to protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. Finally, there are still potential risks stemming from the economic impact on the euro area and elsewhere of the natural and nuclear disasters in Japan. With regard to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation was 2.8% in April according to Eurostat's flash estimate, after 2.7% in March. The increase in inflation rates during the first four months of 2011 largely reflects higher commodity prices. Looking ahead, inflation rates are likely to stay clearly above 2% over the coming months. Upward pressure on inflation, mainly from energy and commodity prices, is also discernible in the earlier stages of the production process. It is of paramount importance that the rise in HICP inflation does not translate into second-round effects in price and wage-setting behaviour and lead to broad-based inflationary pressures. Inflation expectations must remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments remain on the upside. They relate, in particular, to higher than assumed increases in energy prices, not least on account of the ongoing political tensions in North Africa and the Middle East. More generally, strong economic growth in emerging markets, supported by ample liquidity at the global level, may further fuel commodity price rises. Moreover, increases in indirect taxes and administered prices may be greater than currently assumed, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. Finally, risks also relate to stronger than expected domestic price pressures in the context of the ongoing recovery in activity. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 increased to 2.3% in March 2011, from 2.1% in February. Looking through the recent volatility in broad money growth caused by special factors. M3 growth has continued to edge up over recent months. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector remained broadly unchanged at 2.5% in March, after 2.6% in February. Overall, the underlying pace of monetary expansion is gradually picking up, but it remains moderate. At the same time, monetary liquidity accumulated prior to the period of financial market tensions remains ample and may facilitate the accommodation of price pressures in the euro area. Looking at M3 components, the annual growth rate of M1 remained broadly unchanged in March, while that of other short-term deposits increased. The development partly reflects the gradual increase in the remuneration of these deposits over recent months. At the same time, the steep yield curve implies a dampening impact on overall M3 growth, as it reduces the attractiveness of monetary assets compared with more highly remunerated longer-term instruments outside M3. On the counterpart side, there has been a further slight strengthening in the growth of loans to non-financial corporations, which rose to 0.8% in March, after 0.6% in February. The growth of loans to households was 3.4% in March, compared with 3.0% in February. Looking through short-term volatility, the latest data confirm a continued gradual strengthening in the annual growth of lending to the non-financial private sector. The overall size of bank balance sheets has remained broadly unchanged over the past few months, notwithstanding some volatility. It is important that banks continue to expand the provision of credit to the private sector in an environment of increasing demand. To address this challenge, where necessary, it is essential for banks to retain earnings, to turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or to take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. In particular, banks that currently have limited access to market financing urgently need to increase their capital and their efficiency. To sum up, based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged following the 25-basis point increase on 7 April 2011. The information that has become available since then confirms our assessment that an adjustment of the very accommodative monetary policy stance was warranted. We continue to see upward pressure on overall inflation, mainly owing to energy and commodity prices. A cross-check with the signals coming from our monetary analysis indicates that, while the underlying pace of monetary expansion is still moderate, monetary liquidity remains ample and may facilitate the accommodation of price pressures. Furthermore, recent economic data confirm the positive underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area, with uncertainty continuing to be elevated. All in all, it is essential that recent price developments do not give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures. Inflation expectations in the euro area must remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. With interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum remaining low and the monetary policy stance still accommodative, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments with respect to upside risks to price stability. Maintaining price stability over the medium term is our guiding principle, which we apply when assessing new information, forming our judgements and deciding on any further adjustment of the accommodative stance of monetary policy. Turning to fiscal policies, current information points to uneven developments in countries' adherence to the agreed fiscal consolidation plans. There is a risk that, in some countries, fiscal balances may fall behind the targets agreed by the ECOFIN Council for the necessary and timely correction of excessive deficits. It is essential that all governments meet the fiscal balance targets for 2011 that they have announced. Where necessary, additional corrective measures must be implemented swiftly to ensure progress in achieving fiscal sustainability. The implementation of credible policies is crucial in view of ongoing financial market pressures. At the same time, it is of the utmost importance that substantial and far-reaching structural reforms be implemented urgently in the euro area in order to strengthen its growth potential, competitiveness and flexibility. In particular, countries which have high fiscal and external deficits or which are suffering from a loss of competitiveness should embark on comprehensive economic reforms. In the case of product markets, policies that enhance competition and innovation should, in particular, be further pursued to speed up restructuring and to bring about improvements in productivity. Regarding the labour market, the priority must be to enhance wage flexibility and incentives to work, and to remove labour market rigidities. The Governing Council, in line with the ECB's opinion of 17 February 2011 on the six legislative proposals on economic governance, urges the ECOFIN Council, the European Parliament and the European Commission to agree, in the context of their “trialogue”, on more stringent requirements, more automaticity in the procedures and a clearer focus on the most vulnerable countries with losses in competitiveness. Finally, the Governing Council welcomes the economic and financial adjustment programme which was agreed by the Portuguese government following the successful conclusion of the negotiations with the European Commission, in liaison with the ECB, and the International Monetary Fund. The programme contains the necessary elements to bring about a sustainable stabilisation of the Portuguese economy. It addresses in a decisive manner the economic and financial causes underlying current market concerns and will thereby contribute to restoring confidence and safeguarding financial stability in the euro area. The Governing Council welcomes the commitment of the Portuguese public authorities to take all the necessary measures to achieve the objectives of the programme. It considers very important the broad political support for the adjustment programme, which enhances the overall credibility of the programme."
Malaysia,2011-05-05,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to raise the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) by 25 basis points to 3.00 percent. The floor and ceiling rates of the corridor for the OPR are correspondingly raised to 2.75 percent and 3.25 percent respectively. The global economic recovery has continued in the first quarter of the year, but the growth has been highly uneven across regions. Growth in the advanced economies during this period has remained modest. In the region, despite some moderation, the growth has remained strong, supported by robust domestic economic activity. Global inflation has, however, increased on account of rising energy and commodity prices. In several countries, further upward pressure on inflation has been exerted by domestic demand conditions. Although the global recovery is expected to continue going forward, downside risks have increased, arising from the potential for higher energy and commodity prices, possible supply disruptions following developments in Japan, and the heightened volatility in capital flows to emerging economies. In the domestic economy, the latest indicators point towards the continued strengthening of private investment and sustained private consumption expenditure in the first quarter. The export performance also improved, supported by regional demand. Going forward, the assessment is for the Malaysian economy to remain firmly on a steady growth path, with growth improving gradually during the course of the year. Growth will be underpinned by the firm expansion of domestic demand. Sustained employment conditions and income growth is expected to provide support to private consumption, while private investment is projected to strengthen amidst the improved investment environment. The developments in Japan are expected to have a limited impact on the overall domestic economy. Positive prospects for the region and strong demand for commodities are expected to continue to support the Malaysian economy. Domestic headline inflation has continued to increase, rising to 3% in March to average 2.8% for the first quarter of 2011. The increase was mainly due to higher food and fuel prices. The assessment is that supply factors will continue to be a key determinant affecting consumer prices. Global commodity and energy prices are projected to remain elevated during the year, with inflation in major trading partners also expected to rise further. There are also some signs that domestic demand factors could exert upward pressure on prices in the second half of the year. With the economy firmly on a steady growth path, the MPC decided to adjust the degree of monetary accommodation. At the current OPR level, the stance of monetary policy remains supportive of growth. The future stance of monetary policy will depend on the assessment of the risk to growth and inflation prospects. Bank Negara Malaysia 05 May 2011."
Poland,2011-05-11,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 11 May 2011 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 10-11 May 2011 The Council decided to increase the NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage points: (cid:131) reference rate to 4.25% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate to 5.75% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate to 2.75% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate to 4.50% on an annual basis. Incoming data point to a continuing recovery in the global economy. According to preliminary estimates. GDP growth in the United States slowed down in 2011 Q1, which was probably a temporary phenomenon. Moderate recovery in the euro area has continued, including relatively fast expansion in economic activity in Germany. Poland's main trading partner. Economic growth in most developed countries is still being curbed by high unemployment and ongoing adjustments in the balance sheets of households, enterprises and financial institutions. In response to increasing inflationary pressures, major emerging economies and some developed economies have been tightening monetary policy. The effects of high fiscal imbalances in several developed economies as well as strong monetary expansion by major central banks continue to add to uncertainty about the global economic outlook. This uncertainty has been heightened by the tensions in Northern Africa and the Middle East, the natural disaster in Japan as well as by the growth of commodity prices in the global markets. The recent period has seen further appreciation of currencies of emerging market economies; the Polish zloty has also strengthened following its depreciation in 2011 Q1. Recently released data on the Polish economy confirm the assessment that the annual growth of GDP in Q1 could be close to the one observed in the previous quarter. At the same time, the survey of the economic climate in the enterprise sector points to an improvement in the enterprises' expectations about demand, orders and production in 2011 Q2. Despite rising production capacity utilization and a very good financial situation of enterprises, firms do not declare a significant intensification of investment activity in the nearest future. Labour market data show that relatively fast growth in employment in enterprises has been coupled with moderate wage growth. At the same time, unemployment has remained at a heightened level (in seasonally adjusted terms). Lending to enterprises remains limited mainly due to reasons related to the demand for credit, yet, in the recent period growth in the value of loans to this sector has increased. On the other hand, relatively fast growth in mortgage lending to households has continued (adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations), whereas consumer loans declined. Faster price growth, though stemming mainly from the further increase in food and energy prices, was also observed in most other categories of goods and services. As a result, core inflation increased further. PPI growth accelerated as well. On the other hand. April 2011 saw a slight decline in inflation expectations. In the opinion of the Council, in subsequent months CPI inflation will run at a heightened level, which is connected primarily with increases in the prices of agricultural commodities and crude oil in the global markets, which so far have not been offset by changes in the zloty exchange rate. In the medium term, continuing economic recovery in Poland together with further employment growth may gradually increase the wage pressure, and, in consequence, may cause stronger inflationary pressure to persist. The risk of persistently heightened inflation also stems from increased inflation expectations combined with fast growth in commodity prices in the world markets. In order to curb the risk of inflation running above the inflation target in the medium term, the Council decided to increase the NBP's interest rates, continuing the cycle of monetary policy tightening. At the same time, the Council will continue to analyze any potential signs of growing inflationary pressure. An important factor affecting the monetary policy is the situation of public finances. In order to maintain macroeconomic stability, and comply with the euro adoption criteria, decisive measures need to be implemented, aimed at a lasting reduction of the deficit of the general government sector and at curbing the increase of public debt. Although the share of foreign currency loans in new mortgage loans to households has decreased, undertaking measures aimed at preventing fast growth in foreign currency lending to households is, in the opinion of the Council, important for macroeconomic stability. Such measures can contribute to increasing the effectiveness of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Therefore, the Council expects that measures aimed at curbing the supply of new foreign currency loans to households will be introduced. The Council maintains its view that Poland should join the ERM II and the euro area at the earliest date possible, after meeting the necessary legal, economic and organizational conditions."
Chile,2011-05-12,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 12 May 2011 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 50 basis points, to 5% (annual). Internationally, commodity prices have shown a substantial reversal, although still at high levels. Some indicators suggest a moderation in the pace of growth in developed economies, while concerns persist about financial risks in Europe. Globally, inflation has continued on the rise and several economies have further reduced their monetary impulse. Domestically, output, demand and labor market figures reflect the dynamism of the economy. Annual CPI inflation indicators have hovered around 3%, while measures of core inflation remain bounded. Private inflation expectations show a reversal, but remain above the target. The Board estimates that additional increases in the monetary policy rate will be necessary, the timing and the magnitude depending on the unfolding of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions. Accordingly, it will continue to use its policies with flexibility so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. * The Spanish original prevails."
South Africa,2011-05-12,"Issued by Gill Marcus. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank. Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the inflation outlook has deteriorated further, mainly as a result of external cost-push factors. Underlying demand conditions remain relatively restrained, and are not seen to pose a significant risk to the inflation outlook at this stage. However there are elevated risks that these external price shocks could ultimately feed through to more generalised inflation. The domestic economic recovery has been sustained, although still at relatively moderate rates. Nor are there signs of a significant increase in employment. Moreover, the international outlook remains uncertain, and the economic recovery has become more hesitant in the past weeks, in the wake of renewed concerns about peripheral Europe, the earthquake in Japan and higher commodity prices. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas increased to a higher-than-expected level of 4,1 per cent in March 2011, from 3,7 per cent in February. The main contributions to the inflation outcome came from food, housing and utilities, and transport which together accounted for 2,9 percentage points. Food price inflation increased markedly to a year-on-year rate of 5,1 per cent from 3,5 per cent in February, while petrol and electricity prices increased at rates of 16,9 per cent and 19,3 per cent respectively. Administered price inflation excluding petrol remained unchanged at 9,1 per cent. Underlying inflation pressures remained relatively stable, and in February and March CPI inflation excluding food and petrol measured 3,4 per cent, the lowest rate since September 2006. Year-on-year producer price inflation reversed its recent downward trend and measured 6,7 per cent and 7,3 per cent in February and March respectively. Electricity, mining and quarrying, and products of petroleum and coal were the main contributors to this upward trend. In contrast to developments at the CPI level, food price pressures remained relatively subdued in February and March. Agricultural and manufactured food prices increased by 2,7 per cent and 2,9 per cent respectively in March. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, there has been a further upward revision to the CPI forecast of the Bank. Inflation is now expected to reach the upper limit of the inflation target range during the final quarter of 2011, and to peak at 6,3 per cent in the first quarter of 2012 before returning to within the target range by the second quarter of 2012 and remaining close to the upper limit of the range for the rest of that year. Inflation is expected to average 5,1 per cent in 2011 and 6,0 per cent in 2012, compared with averages of 4,7 per cent and 5,7 per cent forecast at the time of the previous meeting. The upward adjustment is mainly due to revised assumptions regarding administered price increases over the forecast period. The survey of market analysts conducted by Reuters also reflects a further upward adjustment in the inflation forecasts. In the April survey, the mean forecast of CPI inflation measured 5,0 per cent for 2011, and 5,8 per cent for 2012, up from 4,8 per cent and 5,7 per cent respectively in the March survey. Expectations for 2013 were unchanged at 5,7 per cent. The break-even inflation rates, as reflected in the yield differential between conventional government bonds and inflation-linked bonds have also exhibited an upward trend. The global economic environment continues to be characterised by uneven recoveries within and across regions. Growth prospects in a number of the advanced economies, including the United States, the United Kingdom and some European economies remain uncertain in the face of the need for fiscal consolidation and risks posed by higher commodity prices which have the potential to destabilise inflation and growth. Unemployment has also remained persistently high in a number of industrialised countries, notably in the United States and Spain. Spending in Europe in particular has been constrained in part by the undercapitalisation of a significant portion of the banking sector. There are heightened concerns about the ability of some of the peripheral European countries, particularly Greece. Ireland and Portugal, to meet their debt obligations and this poses a systemic risk to the region. Lower growth in Japan and the disruption to the global supply chain caused by the earthquake and its aftermath are also likely to impact negatively on near-term global growth prospects. By contrast, growth in the emerging markets has generally remained strong, with evidence of overheating in some countries particularly in Asia and Latin America. Global headline inflation has increased, driven primarily by higher food and other commodity prices, particularly oil. In the advanced economies core inflation appears to be generally subdued against the backdrop of persistent output gaps. However in a number of the emerging market economies, supply side pressures have been accompanied by strong aggregate demand pressures and above-trend growth, resulting in a generally tighter monetary policy environment. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the exchange rate of the rand against the US dollar has been relatively volatile. During this period the rand fluctuated in a range of R6,95 and R6,54 against the US dollar, and on a trade weighted basis the rand depreciated by 0,9 per cent. These developments were affected to a significant extent by the depreciation of the US dollar against other currencies, driven in part by the expected continuation of the accommodative stance of monetary policy in the US. The relatively strong rand exchange rate persisted despite continued purchases of foreign exchange by the Bank. Other factors underpinning rand strength during this period included strong commodity prices, the narrower current account deficit and a resumption of portfolio flows to South Africa. Since the beginning of April non-residents have purchased around R27,1 billion worth of domestic bonds and equities and net purchases year to date stand at R14,5 billion. This marked a reversal of the negative trend in portfolio capital flows experienced by South Africa and some other emerging markets since the final quarter of 2010. Domestic economic growth is lower than that of our emerging market peers. The Bank's forecast for economic growth is 3,6 per cent (previously 3,7 per cent) and 3,9 per cent for 2011 and 2012 respectively. The composite leading business cycle indicator of the Bank is suggestive of the continued recovery in the economy. Manufacturing sector output growth has improved somewhat against the backdrop of positive business confidence. In March the year-on-year increase in the physical volume of manufacturing output measured 4,6 per cent, compared with 5,7 per cent in February. On a three-month on three-month basis, the increase was 4,0 per cent. Consistent with this recovery, the Kagiso Purchasing Managers Index has remained above the neutral level since November 2010, although the positive trajectory seen in the past few months was reversed marginally in April. Despite these positive developments, the level of output remains below that attained before the global crisis and the sector remains characterised by underutilised capacity. The utilisation of production capacity measured 79,4 per cent in February 2011, compared with 81,6 per cent in November 2010 and 78,4 per cent in February 2010. Mining output has been more subdued in the past months. Mining production declined by 1,4 per cent on a year-on-year basis in March, but when comparing the three months to March with the preceding three months, an increase of 0,4 per cent was recorded. The construction sector also remains under pressure, with the real value of building plans passed declining by 18,2 per cent on a month-to-month basis in February, and by 13,1 per cent on a year-on-year basis. The FNB Civil Construction Index continued the downward trend that has been evident since 2008. The positive momentum observed in the past few quarters in the growth in household consumption expenditure appears to have been sustained. However, these levels are not giving rise to any obvious inflationary pressures and there are tentative signs that this momentum may be leveling off. Year-on-year real retail sales growth moderated from 6,3 per cent in January to 5,6 per cent in February. On a month-on-month basis, real retail sales declined by 1,0 per cent in February, but increased by 2,2 per cent when comparing the three months to February 2011 with the previous three months. Year-on-year growth in new vehicle sales declined to 8,0 per cent in April, from 22,8 per cent in March. This slowdown has been ascribed to the high number of public holidays in that month and to the impact of the disaster in Japan on the sector. Growth in credit extension to the private sector remains relatively subdued. The twelve-month growth rate of total loans and advances to the private sector measured 5,3 per cent in March, but annualised growth in the first quarter of 2011 declined to 4,5 per cent, from 5,4 per cent in the previous quarter. Growth was driven mainly by other loans and advances, particularly general loans, as well as by a recovery in instalment sale and leasing finance, reflecting strong motor vehicle sales. Twelve-month growth in mortgage advances declined from a recent high of 4,8 per cent in November 2010 to 2,9 per cent in March 2011, consistent with the continued weakness in the housing market. Credit extended to the corporate sector increased at a year-on-year rate of 2,3 per in March 2011, compared with 1,3 per cent in January, amid tentative indications that banks may have relaxed their risk premia somewhat. Demand for credit by the household sector remains constrained by high debt levels, and the high number of consumers with impaired debt records. The ratio of impaired advances to gross loans and advances has remained at around 5,8 per cent since December 2010, mainly attributable to retail debt. The fact that this ratio has not declined further over the past six months is cause for concern. According to the Quarterly Labour Force Survey published by Statistics South Africa, the unemployment rate in the first quarter of 2011 stood at 25,0 per cent, marginally lower than the 25,2 per cent measured in the first quarter of 2010. Despite the unfavourable employment environment, wage settlements and unit labour cost increases remain at levels in excess of inflation. According to Andrew Levy Employment Publications, the overall average wage settlement rate in collective bargaining agreements amounted to 8,2 per cent in the first quarter of 2011. Unit labour costs increased by 7,7 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2010, with labour productivity growth declining from 3,1 per cent in the third quarter to 2,2 per cent in the fourth quarter. The main risks to the inflation outlook continue to emanate from cost push pressures, including administered prices. The acceleration in food price inflation is expected to persist for some time, despite indications that global food price inflation may have peaked. The international oil price has also displayed a marked degree of volatility in the past week, when prices fell by as much as US$13 in one day. Having risen sharply over recent weeks the price of oil reached a peak of around US$126 per barrel. The price of Brent crude oil today, 12 May, has fallen and is about US$3 per barrel lower than that prevailing at the time of the previous MPC meeting. While international oil prices are not expected to decline further in the near term, it is unclear if prices will consolidate at current levels, or if they will continue on their upward path. In the past two months the domestic petrol price has increased by 8,8 per cent, and by 17,4 per cent since the beginning of the year. The MPC continues to be of the view that the underlying inflation pressures are mainly of a cost push nature. These developments are expected to result in a temporary breach of the upper limit of the target band during the first quarter of 2012. It is recognised that these pressures have the real potential to generate second round effects which can result in more generalised inflation. In light of the above, the MPC has decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 5,5 per cent per annum, for the time being. Given the upside risks to the inflation outlook, the MPC will monitor closely any indications of second round effects on inflation emanating from these cost pressures. The MPC will not hesitate to respond timeously to signs that threaten to move inflation out of the target range on a sustained basis. In addition, the MPC will remain vigilant with respect to any inflation risks that could emanate from domestic demand developments."
South Korea,2011-05-13,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.00% for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.00% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information, the Committee considers emerging market economies to have continued to show favorable performances and the major advanced economies to have also kept up their paces of recovery. Going forward, the Committee forecasts the global economy to sustain its pace of recovery; nevertheless, the Committee recognizes the possibility of such factors as the sovereign debt concerns in some euro area countries, the political unrest in North Africa and the Middle East, and the impacts of the Great East Japan Earthquake posing downside risks to the global economy. For Korea, the Committee judges the economy to have maintained its underlying upward trend, given for instance that exports show continued buoyancy and that domestic demand is increasing. Labor market conditions have also remained on a track of improvement, led by the private sector. Going forward, the Committee anticipates that the domestic economy will keep up its underlying trend, even in the presence of external risks. Consumer price inflation eased in April compared to the preceding month, due mostly to the declines in prices of vegetables. There is a possibility of the high rising price trend persisting in the coming months, however, driven largely by increased demand pressures from the economic upswing, by instability of international oil prices, and by elevated inflation expectations. As for housing prices, the upward movements in Seoul and its surrounding areas have faltered while the steep upward trend in the rest of the country has been sustained. Leasehold deposits have continued to rise. In the financial markets, stock prices have risen and the Korean won appreciated against the US dollar in response chiefly to the sustained uptrend of economic activity and to the inflows of foreign investment funds. Long-term market interest rates have fluctuated within a narrow range. The pace of growth in mortgage lending has accelerated compared to last month. Looking ahead, the Committee, while taking overall account of financial and economic conditions both at home and abroad, will conduct monetary policy with a greater emphasis on ensuring that the basis for price stability is firmly anchored while the economy continues its sound growth."
Peru,2011-05-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR MAY 2011 BCRP RAISES THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE FROM 4.0% TO 4.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to raise the monetary policy reference rate from 4.0 percent to 4.25 percent. This measure is aimed at offsetting the impact of the rise in the international prices of food and fuels on inflation expectations, in a context of high growth of domestic demand. Future adjustments in the reference rate will depend on new information on the evolution of inflation and its determinants. Current and advanced indicators of activity continue showing a rapid growth of economic activity, although lower than in previous months. In May the production of electricity grew 8.4 percent, lower than the increase of 10 percent in the first quarter. On the other hand, even though the indicators of global economic continue to be favorable, there are still risks such as the fiscal situation in some industrialized countries and the crisis in the Middle East and North Africa. Inflation in April showed a rate of 0.68 percent, as a result of which annual inflation recorded a rate of 3.34 percent. Core inflation, which registered 0.40 percent, accumulated an annual growth of 2.6 percent. Inflation excluding food and energy showed a rate of 0.31 percent and an accumulated annual rate of 1.86 percent. These results would be indicating that the rate of inflation in March is mainly explained by supply factors. The Board continues to oversee the projection of inflation and its determinants and stands ready to adopt future adjustments in monetary policy instruments in order to ensure that inflation falls within the target range The Board also approved to raise the following annual interest rates on active and passive operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system as detailed below: Overnight deposits: 3.45 percent. Direct repo and rediscount operations: 5.05 percent. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.05 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for May on its session of June 9, 2011."
Hungary,2011-05-16,"At its meeting on 16 May 2011, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at 6.00%. In the Council's judgement. Hungarian economic growth is likely to pick up gradually over the next 6 quarters; however, the level of output will remain below potential throughout the period. Inflation is expected to be significantly above the target in the short term, due to the cost-push shocks hitting the economy, but may fall back close to 3% by the end of next year even without further policy tightening. Inflation is likely to continue to be dominated by the balance between two opposing forces. On the one hand, commodity prices, particularly oil and agricultural prices, continued to rise, the upward effect of which was reflected in higher consumer prices. In addition, core inflation picked up more sharply than the Council anticipated, reflecting a stronger-than-expected pass-through of the marked rise in agricultural prices to food prices. On the other hand, developments in services and traded goods prices suggest that weak domestic demand and high unemployment continue to exert discipline on price and wage-setting behaviour. Loose labour market conditions are allowing firms to restore their profitability by moderating earnings growth, rather than by raising prices. The Council's past interest rate increases may reduce possible second-round effects of the cost shocks. As a result of these factors, inflation is likely to be significantly above 3% this year and then to fall back to settle around the target towards the end of next year as the first-round effects wear off. External demand is expected to remain the main driver of Hungarian economic growth in the coming quarters. There is no sign yet of a pick-up in domestic demand. Looking ahead, the rate of household consumption growth is expected to continue to be fundamentally determined by the slow recovery in employment and subdued earnings growth. Disbursements to members of real returns on their private pension fund contributions are likely to provide a temporary boost to household consumption, with the reduction in the tax burden on personal incomes expected to provide a sustained stimulus. However, the Government's planned fiscal adjustment measures may lead to a sharp fall in household disposable income in 2012. If maintained over a sustained period, current tight credit conditions in the household market may hold back the recovery in consumption demand and reinforce the disinflationary effects from the real economy. The significant amount of spare capacity in the economy, and uncertainty around the external economic environment and the recovery in consumption are impeding the recovery in corporate investment. In addition, tight lending conditions and increased business uncertainty continue to act as a drag on investment activity. The Monetary Council judges that there is a significant risk that the productive capacity of the economy will expand more slowly over a prolonged period in response to weaker private sector investment activity, which in turn may dampen the disinflationary effects of weak domestic demand. There has been a reduction recently in perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy, as reflected in a fall in risk premia and increased demand for forint-denominated assets. This may partly be explained by increased global investor demand for financial assets of emerging market economies. The Monetary Council has decided to leave interest rates unchanged in light of the above considerations. There remain both upside and downside risks to inflation."
Pakistan,2011-05-21,"STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN MONETARY POLICY DECISION 21st May 2011 careful analysis of Pakistan's current economic conditions reveals mixed situation. Led by strong export earnings and robust growth in remittances, the external current account position has surpassed all earlier projections. This has helped the SBP in building foreign exchange reserves and accumulating Net Foreign Assets (NFA), which contributed in keeping the foreign exchange market stable and provided rupee liquidity in the system. However key challenges remain in the shape of persistent inflation, weak economic growth and private investment, and large budget deficit. In such circumstances. SBP is endeavouring to strike delicate balance to address the multiplicity of considerations in formulating the monetary policy stance such as containing inflation, promoting private productive economic activity, and keeping financial markets stable. The remarkable improvement in the external current account, surplus of $748 million during July-April. FY11, has been major positive development. Given the turmoil in global economic conditions, especially in the export-destination and remittance-generating economies, there were expectations of an external current account deficit. However spectacular rise in international cotton prices has boosted exports, which are expected to exceed $25 billion in FY11. This together with consistently rising flow of remittances helped neutralize import and other payments. More importantly, despite falling financial account inflows, $0. billion during July-April. FY11 compared to $3. billion in the corresponding period of last year. SBP's foreign exchange reserves have increased to $13. billion by 18th May 2011 and are expected to increase further by end-June 2011. Nevertheless caution needs to be exercised while assessing the outlook of the overall balance of payment position. The main reasons for this prudence include the sharp decline in international cotton prices in the last two months, likely continuation of oil prices at around $100 per barrel, and debt obligations that are due in FY12. Barring any unforeseen developments, these factors together with the continued suspension of IMF's Stand-By Arrangement (SBA), which has implications for other financial inflows, imply that the stellar performance of the external account may be difficult to sustain. Therefore maintaining the current upward trajectory of SBP's foreign exchange reserves would be challenging task. The repercussions of uncertain foreign inflows may not be limited to the external sector. Deviations in the baseline estimates could affect the net external budgetary financing as well as the monetary projections. similar scenario did play out in this fiscal year with implications for monetary management. For instance, government borrowings from the banking system have increased significantly, partly due to the shortfall in external financing and partly due to the increase in the fiscal deficit on account of security spending, the impact of unprecedented floods and the recent one-off adjustment of Rs120 billion to address the issue of ‘old stock' of the circular debt of the power sector. During 1st July 7th May. FY11 incremental government borrowing from the banking system, including SBP, for budgetary support was Rs614 billion; year-on-year growth of 28. percent. The borrowings from SBP explain almost 80 percent of the expansion in reserve money while total banking system budgetary borrowings explain 95 percent of the expansion in M2. Page of STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Demonstrating its commitment the government retired its borrowings from the SBP in Q3-FY11 and by end-March 2011 the stock of these borrowings (on cash basis) had come down to Rs1155 billion. The recent increase in these borrowings is temporary and reflection of the government's efforts to internalize the growing quasi-fiscal expense related to the circular debt of the energy sector. The SBP has already shifted portion of this borrowing. Rs61 billion, to the market through an outright Open Market Operation (OMO) and expects that government borrowing will soon converge to the end-September 2010 level. Rs1290 billion, as committed by the government. The year-on-year growth in both reserve money and M2 remains close to 15. percent and may increase further by the end of FY11, which would be higher than SBP's earlier projections. The magnitude of such borrowings poses challenge for effective liquidity management with implications for inflation in FY12. Though the CPI inflation of 13 percent in April 2011 is lower than the flood-induced peak of 15. percent in September 2010, its persistence is source of concern. The 12-month moving average of 20-percent trimmed measure of core inflation has continued to move between 1. and 12. percent in the last one year. Nonetheless the average CPI inflation for FY11 is likely to remain between 14 and 14. percent, which is lower than SBP's earlier projections. Another consequence of government's growing borrowing needs, both current and expected, is that the private sector credit has been squeezed out in terms of banks' allocation of system's deposits. By 7th May 2011, the year-on-year growth in private sector credit, which was mostly due to working capital needs, was. percent and that of total deposits was 15. percent. The basic intermediation function of scheduled banks is being constrained as the fiscal deficit and the commodity operations of the government are financed by deposits at the cost of declining private sector investment. The recently released provisional National Income Accounts reveal that real private investment expenditure registered decline of. percent while real private consumption growth was percent, leading to growth of. percent in total domestic demand. These developments highlight predicament faced by the economy. The rising total debt. Rs11. trillion by end-March 2011, and its servicing is demanding an increasing portion of fiscal revenues. At the same time, the GDP growth rate of below percent over the past four years appears to be highly correlated with declining real private investment expenditures and driven by consumption demand. This coupled with severe energy shortages is negatively affecting the utilization and expansion of the economy's productive capacity. This implies that the output gap the difference between aggregate domestic demand and the supply is perhaps widening again, making it difficult to bring inflation down. Thus along with rising debt the economy seems to have settled at low-growth-high inflation equilibrium. The solution to these outcomes rests with wide-ranging fiscal reforms that restore the economy back towards the requirements of the Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation Act (2005). In particular, there is an urgent need to address the issue of the falling and single-digit tax to GDP ratio. The Federal Board of Revenue's (FBR) tax collection was Rs1156 billion during July-April. FY11 and it is confident that it will realize additional revenues from the measures announced in March 2011. Plans to consolidate them are being considered along Page of STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN with the announcement of new measures in the forthcoming budget. However because of the recent adjustment of old dues reflected in the stock of the circular debt of the power sector, the fiscal deficit for FY11 is likely to increase by approximately. percent of GDP over the revised deficit target of. percent. The final outcome will depend upon the realization of the targets of FBR revenues and provincial surpluses. For sustainable fiscal path revenue-enhancing measures need to be complemented with renewed efforts to stem the leakages in the tax system, bring wider range of incomes in the tax net, and effective expenditure control measures, especially the removal of untargeted and distortionary subsidies. These initiatives will be critical for reducing the stress on the fiscal position and to encourage entrepreneurship in the economy. In conclusion, for the economy to grow on sustainable basis, the debt burden to become manageable and inflation to come down to single digits, the private productive activity and investment will have to increase considerably and quickly. This will require government borrowings from the banking system to subside to create space for private sector credit, which in turn would need satisfactory implementation of the aforementioned fiscal reforms. The government is mindful of fiscal pressures and has expressed its resolve to address these issues, especially the containment of the fiscal deficit. The budget for FY12 is expected to reflect this commitment. In this context and after incorporating the improved external position SBP has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 14 percent for another two months. Page of."
Israel,2011-05-23,"23.05.2011 The Bank of Israel increases the interest rate for June 2011 by 25 basis points to 3.25 percent To view this press release as a WORD file - Click here Background conditions Inflation data: The inflation rate, measured over the previous 12 months, is currently 4 percent, above the upper limit of the target inflation range (of 1-3 percent a year), despite the fact that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 0.6 percent in April, below forecasts, and below the seasonal path consistent with the achievement of the inflation target. This was the second consecutive month in which the monthly change was below the seasonal path, after four months in which it exceeded it. Thismonth, too, the increase in the CPI was influenced primarily by increases in the prices of food and energy, and by the continued rise in housing prices. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Inflation expectations forthe next twelve months as derived from the capital market were 3.3 percenton average this month, while inflation expectations for the medium and long term remained stable within the target range. The average of forecasters'predictions for the next twelve monthly CPIs remained unchanged from the previous month, at 3.1 percent, slightly above the upper limit of the inflation target range. Based on the Telbor (Tel Aviv Inter-Bank Offered Rate) market, the Bank of Israel interest rate one year from now is expected to be 4.2 percent, and the average of forecasters' predictions is that it will be 4.3 percent. About half of the forecasters predict that the Bank of Israelwill leave the interest rate for June unchanged, and about half predict that the Bank will raise the interest rate for June by 0.25 percentage points. Real economic activity: Economic indicators that became availablethis month show that economic activity continued to expand. The preliminary National Accounts estimate for the first quarter shows an annualized GDP growth rate of 4.7 percent, and business product growth of 5.8 percent. This growth included an increase of 23.7 percent in investment in fixed assets, and of 16 percent in imports and exports (annual rates). First quarter National Accounts data are consistent with a growth rate higher than that in the most recent Research Department forecast (of 4.5 percent GDP growth in 2011). According to monthly figures from a new trends survey by the CentralBureau of Statistics, the improvement in private sector business activity continued in April, and the expectations for the next two months are optimistic. The Globes consumer confidence index and the Bank Hapoalim consumer confidence index rose in April, following their increases in the previous month, and they are at relatively high levels. In contrast, the Research Department index of Google searches, which is currently at 70 percent, indicates an increase in the probability of a slowdown in domestic demand. The Purchasing Managers Index also continues to point to contraction. The Bank of Israel staff forecast which was updated this month, is that inflation in 2011 will be above the upper limit of the target inflation range, and that it will decline to within the range in the first quarter of 2012. (This is sooner than in the previous forecast, in which this wasexpected to occur towards the middle of 2012.) The interest rate is expected to increase gradually to about 4.2 percent in a year's time (compared with 4.4 percent in the previous forecast). The main factors which could change the forecasts for real activity and inflation in Israel are developments in the global economy, including changes in commodity and oil prices, developments in the local housing market, the realization of geopolitical risks, and a possible increase in wage pressures in the public sector. </td> The labor market and wages: Labor market data indicate a continued expansionary trend in employment and a drop in unemployment, with a moderate increase in wages. According to trend figures for February, the percentage of unemployed in the civilian workforce continued to fall, and reached 6 percent. The number of work seekers declined by 1.2 percent in March fromthe February level (seasonally adjusted), and was 7 percent lower than thenumber in March 2010. The nominal wage increased in December-February by 1.2 percent compared with the level in the previous three months, while the real wage dropped by 0.4 percent (seasonally adjusted). Health tax receipts in April, which provide an indication of wage payments in that month, were 7.8 percent higher, in nominal terms, than in April 2010. The government recently approved an increase of NIS 410 in the minimum monthly wage, to NIS 4,300. Budget data: Tax revenues in the first quarter were 2.4 percent higher than the seasonal path consistent with the budget forecast; domestic expenditure in the first four months of the year was 0.6 percent lower thanthe seasonal path consistent with full expenditure of the budget. Based onthese trends, and even assuming full expenditure of the budget, the annualdeficit is expected to be lower than the legally prescribed ceiling (3 percent of GDP). The foreign exchange market: From the previous monetary policy discussion held on April 21, through May 20, the shekel depreciated by 2.4 percent against the dollar, in line with the trend around the world, and remained almost unchanged against the euro. The strengthening of the dollar against the other major currencies resulted from increased concern over the debt crises in Europe and the sharp drop in commodity prices. In terms of the nominal effective exchange rate the shekel weakened by about 0.9 percent. The capital and money markets:Between the monetary policy discussions of April 21 and May 20, most Tel Aviv Stock Exchange share price indices fell, in line with the general trend abroad. The Tel Aviv 25 Index declined by 3.6 percent, and the Tel Aviv 100 Index fell by 3.9 percent. Yields on local currency government bonds declined by 5-10 basis points (b.p.), mainly in the medium term. Yields on CPI-indexed government bonds fell by 7-12 b.p. for most terms. The yield gap between Israeli unindexed 10-year government bonds and US 10-year Treasury notes widened during the period surveyed, and at the end of the period stood at 216 b.p. New corporate bond issues totaled about NIS 4 billion a month in the last few months, compared with the average of about NIS 3 billion a month in 2010, and their average rating rose. The CPI-indexed Tel-Bond indices rose--the Tel-Bond 20 index by 1.4 percent and the Tel-Bond 40 by 1.2 percent--and the Tel-Bond Shekel Index rose by 0.9 percent. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spread remained almost unchanged over the month, at 143 b.p. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in April the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 5 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 6.5 percent. Developments in the market for housing credit: The balance of outstanding credit to the business sector decreased in March by 1.2 percent, to NIS 764 billion. Most of the decline was due to the appreciation of the shekel in March, which affected the shekel value of the balance of credit from abroad. Outstanding credit to households increased by 1.4 percent in March, to NIS 345 billion, which included a 1 percent increase in housing credit, following a similar increase in February. The total amount of mortgagesgranted in the twelve months up to and including April was about NIS 50 billion, some 25 percent higher than the amount in the previous twelve months. About 47 percent of new mortgages in April were not indexed to the CPI, at interest rates indexed to the prime rate. On May 5, 2011, a Bank of Israel directive regarding the maximum permitted share of a housing loan at a floating interest rate went into effect. Interest rates on mortgages of all types increased in April. The housing market:House prices--which are presented in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of house prices but are not included in the CPI--continued to increase, and in February-March they increased at a rate of 1 percent a month, following their increase of 1.4 percent a month in January-February. The annual pace of rises in house prices continues to be high, although it has moderated slightly: in the last twelve months house prices increased by 13.9 percent. In contrast with house prices, the housing price index, which is based mainly on renewed rental contracts and which is included in the CPI, rose by 0.7 percent in April, and in the last twelve months it has increased by 6 percent, slightly below the rolling twelve month increase in March. The trend data indicate some decline in house sales in the last few months, and at the same time the reduction in the stock of new houses for sale is continuing. The global economy: : The global economic recovery continued in the past month as well, although some slowing in its pace was evident, and there was reduced optimism regarding the global economy, and in particular regarding the US and European economies. Macroeconomic data published in thelast month presented a mixed picture. The IMF expects global GDP to grow by 4.4 percent in 2011 and by 4.5 percent in 2012, similar to its forecasts in January, albeit with emphasis on the downside risks to the forecasts. Inthe last few months attention has reverted to the European debt crises, and in particular, that of Greece. Commodity prices, especially food and oil prices, dropped this month, against the background of the global macroeconomic data and the strengthening of the dollar, although it is not yet clear whether this represents a turning point. In any event, it seems that the drop in commodity prices to date is likely to moderate the rising inflation in the emerging market economies. Against this background, the investment houses do not expect an increase in the eurozone interest rate before July, and the timing of an expected increase in the interest rate in the US has also been pushed back. Some emerging economies raised their interest rates again this month. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to increase the interest rate for June to 3.25 percent is consistent with the process of returning the interest rate to a more normal range intended to position inflation firmly within the target range, and tosupport the further recovery of economic activity, while maintaining financial stability. The rate of increase in the interest rate is not pre-determined, but is set in accordance with the inflation environment, growth in Israel and globally, the monetary policies of the leading central banks, and developments in the exchange rates of the shekel. At the current level of the interest rate, monetary policy continues to be expansionary. The inflation environment is still above the upper limit of the target inflation range. Inflation over the previous twelve months was 4 percent. Inflation expectations for the next twelve months derived from the capital market and the average of the forecasters' expectations are still slightly above the upper limit of the range this month. This, despite several background developments that could be expected to moderate inflation, such as the appreciation of the shekel in recent months and the fall in commodity prices. Most economic indicators published this month support the assessment that the rapid expansion of activity continued in the first quarter of 2011 and in April, specifically on the export side, but also in domestic demand and employment. National Accounts data for the first quarter are consistent with a growth rate higher than that in the most recent Research Department forecast (4.5 percent GDP growth in 2011). Employment data indicate continued expansion, with the economy approaching a full employment situation. Nevertheless, there are several risks that are still raising the level of uncertainty regarding future global growth and its implications for Israel's economy. The annual rate of increase in house prices continues to be high, although it has slowed a little--in the last twelve months house prices increased by 13.9 percent. Central bank interest rates in the major advanced economies are still low, and are expected to remain so in the next few months. Against the background of the acceleration in inflation in emerging market economies, several central banksincreased their interest rates again this month. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in Israel's economy and the global economy and in the financial markets. The Bank will usethe instruments available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, including keeping a close watch on developmentsin the assets market, and especially in the housing market. The minutes of the discussions prior to the above interest rate decision will be published on June 6, 2011. The decision regarding the interest rate for July 2011 will be published at 17:30 on Monday. June 27, 2011. 23.05.2011 The Bank of Israel increases the interest rate for June 2011 by 25 basis points to 3.25 percent.

Nigeria,2011-05-23,"Central Bank of Nigeria Communique No. 76 of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting. May 23 - 24, 2011 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on 23rd and 24th May, 2011 to assess current domestic and international economic and financial developments as well as the challenges facing the Nigerian economy in the short- to medium-term. On the international scene, the Committee noted the recovery in some of the major developed economies along with improvements in stock market indices, although unemployment remained high. Inflationary threats, however, still persisted following sharp increases in international oil and commodity prices. In addition, there are serious concerns about debt sustainability in many developed countries, particularly the Euro-zone, requiring strong fiscal adjustment with attendant risk of economic slowdown in the medium-term. Emerging market economies have become the engine of the global economic recovery, with their output levels above those recorded during the crisis years. It is expected that growth in Asia's exports in 2011, though below the very high rates of 2009 and 2010, will be supported by the slow but gradual recovery in the industrial countries. Sub-Saharan African countries are projected to record moderate growth and to face inflation threats. Weak economic recovery in industrialized countries may also affect exports from the region. With regard to the domestic economy, the Committee noted the estimated high output growth in Q1 2011, improvement in stock market indicators, modest accretion to external reserves since the beginning of 2011 reflecting in part the high crude oil prices, stable naira exchange rate and rise in interbank rates in response to the tightening of monetary policy stance. Notwithstanding the 1 recent monetary policy tightening measures implemented since January 2011, the Committee observed that inflation rate remained at the double digit level, indicating the apparent role of structural factors and supply bottlenecks in the elevated inflationary pressures in Nigeria. The Committee, therefore, urged that economic reforms be fast-tracked to ensure that the downside risk of inflation to growth is minimized. Key Domestic Macroeconomic and Financial Developments Domestic Output The Committee noted that the impressive output growth in 2010 was sustained in QI 2011. Provisional data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) indicated that real gross domestic product (GDP) was projected to grow by 743 per cent in the first quarter of 2011, compared with the 736 per cent recorded in the corresponding period of 2010. The non-oil sector grew by 846 per cent while the oil sector output growth was estimated at 290 per cent. Thus the overall output growth was driven mainly by the non-oil sector with significant contributions from services, wholesale and retail trade, and agriculture. The Committee considers the outlook for 2011 to be generally good, underpinned by the favourable conditions for increased agricultural production, encouraging outcomes of the banking sector reforms and measures to channel credit to the real economy, as well as other initiatives by governments to stimulate the economy. Domestic Prices The year-on-year headline inflation rate declined to 113 per cent in April 2011 from 128 per cent in March 2011. Food inflation also declined to 107 per cent in April from 122 per cent in March and February 2011. However core inflation at 129 per cent in April was slightly higher than the 128 per cent in March 2011. The decline in headline inflation rate was primarily due to the decline in the 2 prices of some food items and non-alcoholic beverages, imported food items, transportation, and clothing and footwear. Notwithstanding the decline in the inflation rate in April, inflation expectations remain high owing to the subsisting high fiscal spending, the recent increases in public sector wages, the possible removal of subsidy on petroleum products in the near-term, and further liquidity injection due to AMCON activity. Monetary Credit and Financial Market Developments Provisional data showed that the growth in broad money (M2) during the first four months of 2011 was 324 per cent, or 972 per cent when annualized. Aggregate credit continued to decline largely as a result of reduction in credit to the core private sector, and to state and local governments. Net foreign assets, which posted positive growth in February and March, declined in April 2011. The huge growth in credit to government against the backdrop of continuing decline in private sector credit clearly indicates that government borrowing is crowding-out private sector credit. Besides in the post-crisis period banks in their bid to rebuild their balance sheets have become increasingly risk- averse, and have preferred to channel their funds into the relatively risk-free government sector. The Committee, therefore, urged that efforts be sustained to de-risk the real economy through appropriate reform measures. The interbank market rates fluctuated at the various segments since the beginning of the year. Key interbank rates moved in tandem with the upward revision of the monetary policy rate (MPR) to 75 per cent from 22nd March, 2011. Between March 22 and May 13, 2011, the inter-bank call and open buy-back (OBB) rates fluctuated, increasing to a high interbank call rate of 1195 per cent on April 12, 2011. significant decline in both rates was recorded thereafter, 3 following the enhanced liquidity in the banking system occasioned by the use of AMCON bonds to secure funds and the impact of the new reserve averaging policy. Consequently interbank and OBB rates softened, with the OBB recording a low of 690 per cent on 9th May, 2011. Retail lending rates, however, remained relatively high with the spread between the maximum lending rate and the consolidated deposit rate widening slightly to 1964 percentage points in April 2011, from 1957 percentage points in March. The All-Share Index and market capitalization recorded increases as the capital market began a gradual recovery since the last MPC meeting. This was due largely to share price increases in the Banking. Food/Beverages and Insurance sectors. With the ongoing reforms by the regulatory authorities and robust growth prospects, the outlook in the medium-term remains generally good. External Sector Developments The Committee noted the persisting demand pressure in the foreign exchange market between March 23 and May 18, 2011. The total supply to the wDAS segment by the CBN (including US$16000 million worth of maturities at the wDAS Forwards) amounted to US$432 billion. The foreign exchange market remained relatively stable owing to a deliberate policy on the part of the CBN to increase supply to the market to maintain the exchange rate within a band of ±3 percentage points, complemented by funding from autonomous sources. At the wDAS segment, the Naira/Dollar exchange rate opened at N15263/US$ (including 1% commission) on March 23, 2011 and closed at N15474/US$ on May 18, 2011, representing a slight depreciation of 138 per cent (or N211k). The interbank rates opened at 4 N15597/US$ and closed at N15670/US$, a depreciation of 047 per cent. The premium between the rates at the WDAS and other segments of the market narrowed towards the end of the review period. The Committee noted the modest accretion to the external reserves in recent months. It however, noted that inflow into the CBN is not consistent with the high oil prices and, this underscores the need for tighter fiscal controls around oil revenues as well as first line charges including JVC deductions and subsidies. higher rate of retention of oil revenues should facilitate the efforts at maintaining exchange rate stability as an antidote to imported inflation without excessive reliance on monetary tightening measures. The Committee's Considerations The Committee urged that in a highly import-dependent economy with large pass-through effects of import prices on domestic prices, it is necessary to create a climate conducive to larger foreign capital inflows through appropriate fiscal measures, particularly in the light of the gains that could be made in the current context of high crude oil prices. The MPC, therefore, stressed the importance of continuing structural reforms and infrastructural development to enhance domestic production to reduce the import bill and its pass-through effects on inflation. It also noted the inflationary impact of the likely deregulation of petroleum product prices. The Committee held that it would be prudent to adopt a monetary policy stance that is consistent with the need to address inflationary expectations associated with excessive liquidity and pressure on foreign exchange market. Although the fiscal authorities have declared their intention to fiscal 5 consolidation, the MPC recognizes that time will be required for fiscal adjustment to take place. In the interim, monetary policy will have to bear the burden of adjustment through further tightening in order to rein in inflation to maintain price stability, as well as continuing with the progress toward positive real interest rates. Decisions In the light of the above. Members of the Committee voted as follows: 1. 9::1 in favour of further tightening of monetary policy. All nine in favour of tightening voted for an increase in CRR from 2 per cent to 4 per cent with effect from June 8, 2011 to align with the next reserve averaging maintenance period; Six members voted for 50 basis points increase in MPR from 75 per cent to 80 per cent, three voted for 25 basis points increase while one voted for no change; and 2. Maintain the symmetric corridor of +/- 200 basis points around the MPR. Sanusi Lamido Sanusi. CON Governor Central Bank of Nigeria May 24, 2011 6 PERSONAL STATEMENTS BY MPC MEMBERS: 10 ALADE. SARAH Although headline inflation moderated to 113 in April from 128 in the previous month, a combination of intense pressure on the exchange rate as a result of pass through effect of imported prices, and the anticipation of frontloading of government expenditure in the second quarter calls for a modest tightening of monetary policy rate. In addition, policy tightening is needed to address the negative real interest rate in the economy. While headline inflation has started to trend down, domestic inflation outlook going forward, will be impacted on what happens to global food prices. Global food and energy prices are expected to harden in the coming months, driven by a combination of supply constraints and rising global demand as the advanced economies consolidate their recovery. This suggests that the current downward trend in headline inflation in Nigeria could be short-lived. Although food inflation moderated to 116 percent in April from 122 percent in March, the high international commodity prices could spill over to domestic prices. Core inflation is also increasing. Core inflation which edged up to 129 percent in April was driven mainly by housing and electricity /gas prices. The prices of building materials like cement increased by more than 40 percent from its price in the last quarter of 2010 and all these prices are determined by global prices. These poses risk to the inflation outlook going forward. The risk of expansionary spending in the second quarter is anticipated. Although negotiations are on-going to reduce the exact amount of the 2011 Federal Government budget, the possibility of frontloading expenditure in the second quarter is real. Given that the 2011 budget are yet to be passed, there is 7 a good chance that frontloading of expenditure could occur in the second quarter of 2011for a number of reasons: First to accelerate already budgeted expenditures on critical government projects and, secondly, the implementation of the new minimum wage. These spendings are bound to have some inflationary impact, therefore monetary tightening is needed to mitigate the inflationary impact of such expansionary fiscal injection to the economy. The equity market is benefiting from the return of confidence in the economy after the successful general election. The declining trend that was observed in the equity markets in March and February seems to have stabilized during the month of April. The Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Shares Index (ASI) increased marginally by 17% in April. Foreign investment inflow into the country increased marginally to US$ 18 billion in first quarter as against the US$15 billion in fourth quarter of 2010. Share equity and loans accounted for the bulk of the first quarter inflows. believe containing inflationary pressure and reviewing interest rate will help increase confidence and participation in the market. AMCON bond issue will further inject liquidity in the system. As AMCON tries to conclude the resolution of the troubled banks by bond issues, more liquidity will be injected into the system, putting additional pressure on the inflation dynamics. Monetary tightening is needed to preserve the value of the domestic currency. Despite strong fundamentals (high oil prices, increased oil output, high GDP growth rate), the naira continues to depreciate against the US dollar. Although a number of factors could be responsible, one of such factor is the supply side effects of money supply. Tightening monetary policy will ease the pressure on the foreign exchange market. Based on the above, monetary policy should focus on managing inflation expectation for price stability. Therefore I will recommend a modest tightening of the monetary policy rate to 50 basis points and 2 percent increase in Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR). .0 BARAU. SULEIMAN The modest decline in the year-on-year Headline Inflation from 128 percent in March to 113% in April should ordinarily give MPC the comfort that the inflationary pressure is moderating and this trend may be sustained. The key question for me therefore is that, is this trend sustainable?. In order to take a position, one must look for the factors responsible for this decline, determine their outlook and those of the other key components of the inflation basket. The decline in year-on-year Headline is largely due to the food component of the inflation index. Accordingly Food Inflation over the corresponding period declined sharply from 122% to 107% on account of the fall in farm produce and relative decline in the contribution of the imported food component during the same period. Indeed the outlook for the farm produce looks positive with the harvest season in sight. This is also consistent with Staff Projections. However I do not want to loose sight of the huge demand side issues of the inflation equation which may tilt the balance of risk in favour of an increased inflation rather than a decline, at least on a sustained basis. These factors include: • The deficit nature of the Federal budget. Activity of AMCON and its impact on systemic liquidity • The threat of imported inflation as energy and food prices remained high. Upward review in minimum wage particularly for State employees. Possible withdrawal of petroleum subsidy. I have therefore come to the conclusion after the above review that inflation threat is still real and the arguments for tightening are compelling. However in making my recommendation. I'm very conscious of the fact that radical measures to tighten could hurt growth and financial stability. Growth since any upward adjustment of the MPR would translate into higher lending rates particularly lending to the private sector. Financial Stability; since any upward review of MPR would impact yields on Bonds, lead to huge market to market losses and ultimately the profitability of Banks given their current huge holdings of these Bonds. However inflation remains our enemy number one as it impacts on Nigerians across social groups. On the basis of the above and other factors. I'm compelled to argue for sustained tightening and to make the following specific recommendations; • Upward review of MPR by 05% to 8%. Increase in Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) from 2% - 4% to directly impact liquidity in the banking system. This would also impact directly on liquidity, inflationary pressure and reduce speculative pressure on the Naira exchange rate. .0 GARBA. ABDUL GANIYU Justification 1. The data on Consolidated Balance Sheet of the Banking System (December, 2010 to April, 2011) indicates that liabilities (M2) significantly overshoots assets (NFA and Net Domestic Credit). Further whereas M2 rose at an annualized rate of 927%. NFA and Net Domestic Credit declined by 1071% and 18% respectively. The policy implications of the 10 data are (a) reduce liabilities; grow assets or both until equilibrium is restored. If not, excess liabilities will hurt both exchange rate stability, growth and trigger rapid inflation. The MPC has stated clearly, its commitment to price and exchange stability which reduce risks (inflation and foreign exchange) and promote investment, job creation and growth. Growing assets (NFA) will require both policy and institutional changes that are outside the control of the MPC. Private credit has not responded to the regime of quantitative easing and growing the public debt has both short and long term consequences. This leaves quantitative tightening as the only viable option. A close analysis of the Forex market data reveals patterns of demand consistent with speculative behavior. Tightening can reduce speculative demand and ease pressure on the Naira. The policies of the last MPC (March 2011) and the implementation are producing expected impacts. The 100 basis point increase in MPR raised the short term rates around target levels. However FAAC releases (FAAC Effect) and opportunities to repo AMCON bonds (AMCON Effects) moderated the effects. FAAC Effects increased volatility while AMCON Effect moderated the rates downwards from May 6. Inflation the key policy objective appears to be moderating. However the moderation may not be sustainable given the upward movements in key categories of food inflation and core inflation as well as the rise in global prices. Before I decided. I asked three questions: (a) should we tighten further? (b) what instruments are most effective? (c) what are the cost-benefit of each option. The analysis convinces me that further tightening is necessary especially given expected injections by AMCON, existing dis- 11 equilibrium, inflation concerns and commitment to price and exchange rate stability. The CRR is the most effective tool for tightening of liquidity. Its pass through effects on speculative demand for forex are revealed by data on demand for forex which show significant decline after the CRR was raised by 100 basis point at the January MPC. A 200 basis point increase in CRR is expected to impact significantly on liquidity and speculative forex activities. The increase in MPR by 25 basis point signals commitment to tightening. It also takes notes that MPR effects on short term interest rates are expected to be moderated by FAAC and AMCON Effects. Decision I vote for: 1. quantitative tightening 2. 200 basis point increase in CRR from 2% to 4%. Increase in MPR by 25 basis point. .0 KIFASI. DANLADI The current Federal Government budget under review is expected to be expansionary due to Government's desire to invest massively in infrastructure as well as create employment opportunities through investment in public works and other job- creating schemes. Moreover various Governments' interventions in Agriculture. SMEs and Manufacturing have their liquidity implications. 12 Specifically, these have the tendency to create excess liquidity in the system and exert pressure on foreign exchange demand. Furthermore, inflationary threats could arise from the high energy price in the developed economies coupled with the implementation of the new minimum wage policy. In order to achieve the single-digit inflation objective of the Government; ensure exchange rate stability; as well as sustain the gradual build up in the external reserves, there is need to further tighten monetary policy. In view of the above. I recommend that the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) be further Increased by 50 basis points from 75% to 80%. Furthermore the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) should be increased by 200 basis points from 2% to 4%, while the open market operations should be actively pursued. .0 LEMO. TUNDE The economy continues to face inflationary pressures arising from expansionary fiscal stance as well as the impact of international prices of energy and food on domestic price levels. The inflation expectation remains elevated with possible implementation of new minimum wage and removal of petroleum subsidy. The growth in broad money exceeded the benchmark in the period under review, with the possibility of further expansion through the proposed AMCON injection of about N600b in the next few weeks. Credit to the private sector declined by 462% in the first 4 months of the year while credit to the Federal Government grew substantially by 3582%. The negative credit growth to the 13 private sector is as a result of structural factors as well as high government borrowings. Unlike other major oil producing countries, gross external reserve has remained flat (USD3337b as at May 18, 2011), in spite of very strong international price of crude oil and increase in average daily output of over 2m barrels. The pressure on foreign exchange is as a result of importation of highly subsidized refined product as well as speculative demand due to expectation of future depreciation of the Naira. In addition to this pressure the reserve level may be adversely affected by the likely reduction in production as a result of the recent short-in of Shell Bonga Field. Monetary Policy Rate remains negative in real terms. Thus interest and deposit rates are unlikely to influence savings mobilization for the much needed growth. The negative yield has also had negative impact on the inflow of foreign capital and portfolio funds. The most important challenge remains the reduction of demand pressure on the foreign exchange to maintain healthy foreign reserve and preserve the value of the Naira. This is a necessary condition for the maintenance of price stability in an import dependent economy. The current crowding out of the real sector through increase in government borrowing should also be reversed through the likely adjustment in interest rates to reduce inflation, and stimulate real sector growth and increase the inflow of much needed Foreign capital flows while not losing sight of the potential losses to banks due to correction in the bonds yields. 14 DECISION It is very clear that the pressure on the Naira, driven by excess liquidity as well as cheap Naira (as long as interest rates remain negative, in real terms) require a less accommodative monetary policy stance. In view of the foregoing therefore. I vote for a further monetary tightening with increase in MPR by 50 basis point from 75% to 80%. This will return the policy rate to the pre-crises level. In addition, the Cash Reserve Ratio should be increased from the present 2% to 4% being a blunt instrument should have a more immediate impact on the system's liquidity. .0 MOGHALU. KINGSLEY CHIEDU I vote for an increase in the monetary policy rate by 50 basis points as well as an increase in the cash reserve ratio from the present 2% to 4 % for the following reasons: 1. Despite the recent deceleration in consumer price inflation from 128% to 113%, the medium term outlook for inflation remains significant in light of increases to the minimum wage - the full effects of which are yet to register - and the potential impact of a possible removal of the petroleum subsidy. Such a policy change, in my view, remains necessary in order to address fundamental distortions in fiscal policy. Real interest rates remain negative; it is necessary to bring inflation down into single digits or close the gap between interest rates and inflation. The discountability of bonds issued by the Asset Management Corporation, and increases in money supply over the past two months imply that liquidity clearly remains a continuing concern for the economy. While there still remains some distance to restoring full financial stability in the banking system. Nigerian banks have been stabilized enough to balance out the potential effects of further monetary tightening measures. Weighed against the imperatives of combating inflation, any concerns about the impact on credit growth must be secondary at this time. From a strategic perspective, it is necessary to move, to the extent possible, to improving exchange rate stability by means additional to CBN intervention in the foreign exchange market. Higher interest rates will attract higher levels of foreign investment as a result of expectations of higher yields by foreign investors, and this will have a stabilizing effect on the naira. Higher deposit rates, which in my view require further attention from the Central Bank of Nigeria, will also bring more savers into the banking system and discourage the disintermediation threat that has become a real danger as a result of low deposit rates. Considering that the exchange rate is the dominant channel of inflation in Nigeria, higher interest rates and reducing liquidity through the cash reserve ratio will help reduce speculative demand for the currency. Combating inflation and maintaining price stability is an imperative for the CBN, but the actions of the fiscal authorities over the next several months will influence how easily or quickly this objective can be achieved. 16 70 OLOFIN. SAM There are sufficient indicators at this meeting to warrant a further strengthening of the tight monetary policy stance adopted by this committee over the last two meetings. Inflationary pressure has not abated significantly, and there is no strong evidence that pre-election deficit spending by fiscal authorities would in the short term be reversed, to embrace inflation curbing fiscal restraint in recurrent government expenditure, or to encourage growth enhancing emphasis on capital expenditure. The recently approved wage increases, and more than overdue removal of petroleum subsidies are likely to add to inflationary pressure. Similarly the prospects of good harvests and its likely ameliorating effects on domestic food prices notwithstanding, rising energy costs and imported food prices that currently account for the imported component of inflation are not likely to trend down-wards significantly over the short run. As far as developments in the financial sector are concerned, there appears to be strong indications that the threat to financial system stability, which warranted extraordinary accommodating monetary easing measures that have been sustained since June 2009 is about being resolved. Among other things MPR witnessed a major reduction from an average of 10 percent to 6 percent, going negative in real terms and has remained so, while inflation rate has remained at a two digit level. As stability is restored to the banking sector of the economy, there is sufficient good reason for the Committee to return to its primary responsibility of focusing greater attention on price stability. However if we must sustain our tight monetary policy stance there is the problem of determining what the most appropriate policy instrument(s) should be, and at what magnitudes. Developments at the foreign exchange market have been worrisome. There appears to be a sustained attack on the Naira fuelled by a difficult to justify rise 17 in demand for foreign exchange that is most probably largely speculative. The resultant effect is to produce pressure on the exchange rate with potentials for further fuelling inflation if the excessive demand is not curbed, and supply of foreign exchange increased, to preserve a healthy level of reserves that would ensure a stable exchange rate and reduce the need for devaluation. Given the foregoing, we need to focus on at least two critical elements in our in choice of instruments to tackle inflationary expectation. First we need to work towards a real rate of interest that would encourage net inflow of FDI and portfolio funds that would enhance accretion to foreign reserves, without necessarily endangering credit flows to the real sector. Available data on post- crisis capital inflows by way of FDI and Portfolio investment, show that countries like Ghana. Mauritius. Kenya and Zambia are experiencing strong or moderate recovery in post –crisis net capital inflows, whereas Nigeria continues to experience decline in both net FDI and Portfolio investment inflows. The MPC's current monetary tightening policy stance therefore must be viewed against the backdrop of negative real MPR, and related yield rates, and the need for upward adjustment in rates to stem the speculative demand for foreign exchange, and encourage inflow of FDI and portfolio funds. Secondly there is the need to reduce the speculative hedging against the Naira at the foreign exchange market by increasing the cost of borrowing to finance speculative demand for foreign exchange. As we have argued consistently in the past outright devaluation of the Naira is not a viable option in our present circumstances. This would only accentuate the current run on our reserves and exacerbate the inflationary pressure. The options we are left with therefore is a double pronged approach of raising the MPR, to signal a continuation of our tightening policy stance, and raising the CRR to curtail diversion of loanable funds into speculative demand for foreign exchange, thereby reducing the pressure on the Naira and its potential inflationary 18 consequences. One would therefore vote for a 200 basis point increase in the current level of CRR from 2 percent to 4 percent, and raising the MRR by 50 basis points from the current 75 percent to 8 percent. While the latter may not necessarily be high enough to bring about positive real interest rates, it would be supplemented by upward adjustment of market rates, once the current interbank credit guarantees are removed later in the year. .0 SALAMI. ADEDOYIN The moderation in Headline inflation from 128% in March to 113%. YoY, in April and -054% change in the monthly index in the same period is doubtless welcome. sharp deceleration in food prices – including imported food – provided the impetus for lower pace of price rises recorded. It is however noteworthy that Core Inflation rose faster than that of food. Taken with figures since January, a clear trend is not discernible. With regard to the outlook for inflation, while some factors, for example approaching harvest season, gives a basis for a positive outlook, there are significant upside risks which cannot be ignored. Having noted the likely moderation of inflation by harvests, we must continue to keep an eye on global food prices. In addition to global food prices, the role of the exchange rate in influencing imported food prices cannot be understated. Liquidity especially resulting from fiscal operations remains a source of concern. Q1 2011 outcomes show Federal Government revenues, at NGN54098bn, to be almost 24% below expectation. Notwithstanding lower than ‘budgeted' spending – amounting to NGN874bn (63% of which was recurrent expenditure), the resulting deficit of NGN3334bn in Q1 is only marginally lower than the NGN 34744bn provided for in the ‘budget'. It is thus not surprising that lending to the 19 government continues to surge – growing almost 36% since December 2010 – despite strong oil prices. Notwithstanding encouraging noises from both the Executive and Legislative Arms of government about ‘reshaping' the 2011 budget, it remains to be seen how quickly this can be done to reduce the pressure exerted by rising government borrowing. Whilst deregulation of Petroleum product prices will undoubtedly go a long way towards achieving a more sustainable fiscal environment, it is again not clear how quickly this will be achieved. Minimum wages are also anticipated to add to spending at the sub-national level. It is important that whilst awaiting action to reshape the budget, government must be made aware of the cost implications of its borrowing activities. Unlike the public sector, private sector borrowing has continued to shrink – declining by a further 45% this year. Resolution of the banking sector issues however represents a risk to systemic liquidity. The impending injections into the banks by AMCON – estimated at approximately NGN600bn – represent a clear risk to liquidity. Adde"
Georgia,2011-05-25,"25.05.11 The NBG Maintains Its Main Policy Rate (Refinancing Rate) Unchanged At 8 Percent The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on May 25th, 2011 and decided to keep its Main Policy Rate (the refinancing rate) unchanged at 8 percent Annual inflation reached 13.5 percent in March 2011, out of which 11.8 percentage points was due to the increase in food prices. Annual core inflation (excluding food and fuel prices) has been declining in the recent months and was below 2% in April. Annual inflation in the service sector is still low at 1.3%. Low levels of the core inflation and inflation in the service sector indicate that the demand influence on prices is weak. According to the existing forecasts the inflation will keep decreasing and will be around 8% by the end of the year. The loan activity is in accordance with the expected growth rate of the economy; the risk of possible demand driven inflation is low. In the recent months world prices have the tendency to decline. Namely, the world prices of oil and sugar have decreased. It is expected that this fact will accordingly affect Georgian consumer market. Based on the actual and expected dynamics of loan growth and economic activity and taking into account the price decrease tendency in the world markets, in the medium term the inflation forecast will decrease to its target value. Therefore the MPC decided to keep its policy rate unchanged. The NBG will closely monitor developments in the economy and financial markets and will in due course act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will take place on June 22th, 2011."
Turkiye,2011-05-25,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels: a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) at 6.25 percent, b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 1.50 percent, lending rate at 9 percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 8 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, lending rate at 12 percent. Recent data releases are consistent with the outlook presented in the Inflation Report. Private consumption and investment growth rates are moderating after a strong rebound in 2010, while external demand outlook remains weak. Employment conditions continue to improve and unemployment rates are approaching the pre-crisis levels. Low levels of capacity utilization rates suggest that output gap has not closed yet. However, owing to the lagged impact of rising import prices, inflation is expected to increase at a moderate pace over the short term. Moreover, the Committee notes that inflation may exceed the year-end target of 5.5 percent in May due to base effects arising from unprocessed food prices, and follow a volatile path thereafter in line with the path presented in the Inflation Report. The effects of the tightening measures on credit growth and domestic demand have become more visible in the second quarter. However, both elevated levels of energy and other commodity prices and a weaker external demand outlook postpone the improvement in the current account balance to the last quarter. In light of these assessments and considering the uncertainty regarding the global economy, the Committee has indicated that it would be useful to continue to observe the lagged impacts of the measures taken so far. Overall, in order to contain the risks towards price stability and financial stability, the Committee has decided to monitor the tightening impact of the existing policy mix and take additional measures along the same lines, if needed. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Thailand,2011-06-01,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 1 June 2011 Mr. Paiboon Kittisrikangwan. Assistant Governor. Bank of Thailand, announces the outcome of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today, as follows. The global economy moderated somewhat in the first quarter of 2011 while still maintaining its overall growth momentum. The US economy showed signs that rising inflationary pressure had begun to weigh on consumption. The euro area was expected to maintain its expansion but sovereign debt problems remained a key risk to the economy. The Japanese economy slowed more than expected following the earthquake. However the recovery would occur faster than expected in the previous meeting. Meanwhile the Asian economy expanded well on account of both internal and domestic demand. However risks to global inflation were expected to remain going forward. The Thai economy grew well in the first quarter supported by agricultural production and exports. Latest data in April confirmed continued economic expansion in line with strong employment conditions, robust farm income, and sizeable fiscal spending. However production in the manufacturing sector slowed, particularly in the automobile sector due to the supply shortage stemming from the Japan crisis. Nevertheless latest data showed that production would recover quickly. The MPC assessed that fundamentals remained strong and would support continued economic expansion in 2011. Inflationary pressure increased more than expected following hikes in the prices of prepared foods on the back of rising costs. Inflation expectations continued to edge up. In addition, elevated oil and commodity prices amid robust domestic demand would lead to greater pass-through of high production costs to overall prices. As a result, there is a risk that inflation may continue to accelerate, resulting in core inflation breaching the upper end of the target band. In light of the aforementioned outlook, the MPC deemed it necessary to take action to anchor inflation expectations. The MPC therefore decided unanimously to raise the policy interest rate by 025 per cent, from 275 to 300 per cent, effective immediately. The MPC will closely monitor inflationary pressure going forward and stands ready to take necessary action."
Poland,2011-06-08,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 8 June 2011 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 7-8 June 2011 The Council decided to increase the NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage points: (cid:131) reference rate to 4.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate 6.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate 3.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate 4.75% on an annual basis. In 2011 Q1 activity in the global economy continued at a relatively high level. Particularly strong GDP growth was observed in Germany. Poland's main trading partner. Inflation in most countries continued to run at a heightened level, to a large extent due to high commodity prices. Recently, however, signs of a possible weakening of global economic activity could be observed; the growth in commodity prices in the world markets has also been halted. Furthermore, concerns about the stability of public finances in some peripheral euro area countries have intensified, which has contributed to increased risk aversion in the international financial markets. In Poland, data on GDP in Q1 confirmed that a relatively high economic growth was sustained at the beginning of 2011. GDP growth was mainly driven by growing domestic demand, and stable growth in private consumption was supported by a rise in investment. In turn. April saw a slight deceleration of growth in industrial output and construction, coupled with a continuing upward trend in retail sales. In Q1 economic growth was accompanied by a faster than in the previous quarters rise in the number of employed and by a declining unemployment rate as indicated by LFS data. At the same time, wage pressure did not strengthen, as evident from slower growth of wages in the economy. In April 2011 wage growth accelerated considerably in the corporate sector; yet, it is difficult to assess whether this acceleration will persist. At the same time, the upturn in corporate lending was sustained. The relatively fast growth in mortgage loans to households also continued and a further decline in consumer loans was observed. In April annual CPI inflation rose to 4.5%, remaining significantly above the NBP's inflation target of 2.5%. The acceleration in price growth, although mainly connected with a further rise in food and energy prices, concerned also core inflation, which is reflected in a faster price growth in most of the other categories of goods and services. PPI inflation and inflation expectations of households remained at a relatively high level. In the coming months, the annual CPI inflation rate will continue at a heightened level, mainly due to the previously observed strong growth in global commodity prices. ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51. In the opinion of the Council, the elevated level of current inflation and inflation expectations, as well as the risk of rising wage pressure amidst a considerable growth in employment, justify increasing the NBP interest rates at the present meeting. The Council assesses that the substantial monetary policy tightening implemented since the beginning of 2011 should enable inflation to return to the target in the medium term. The Council does not rule out further adjustment of monetary policy, should the outlook for inflation's return to the target deteriorate. An important factor affecting the monetary policy is the situation of public finances. In order to maintain macroeconomic stability, and comply with the euro adoption criteria, decisive measures need to be implemented, aimed at a lasting reduction of the deficit of the general government sector and at curbing the increase of public debt. Although the share of foreign currency loans in new mortgage loans to households has decreased, undertaking measures aimed at preventing fast growth in foreign currency lending to households is, in the opinion of the Council, important for macroeconomic stability. Such measures can contribute to increasing the effectiveness of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Therefore, the Council expects that measures aimed at curbing the supply of new foreign currency loans to households will be introduced. The Council maintains its view that Poland should join the ERM II and the euro area at the earliest date possible, after meeting the necessary legal, economic and organizational conditions."
Armenia,2011-06-09,"Press Release 06.09.2011 In the September 6, 2011 meeting the Board of CBA decided to lower the Refinancing Rate of CBA by 0.5 pp. to 8.0 percent. In August of 2011 deflation was 0.6 percent. The 12-month inflation indicator went down by 1.5pp. in relation to the previous month and reached 4.8 percent, returning to the 4% ±1.5p.p. confidence band. The Board accepted, that impulses coming from the external sector on the inflationary environment are neutral with downside risks. World economy outlook uncertainties conditioned by the fundamental imbalances of developed countries still remain. The board has a consensus, that domestic demand does not create inflationary environment: the impact of private expenditures is neutral, fiscal policy is restrictive. The impact of labor market is neutral as well. The Board summed up, that inflation developments of last months are in line with the directions outlined in the Monetary programs of 2011. The easing of monetary conditions will make more probable to shape inflation within the confidence band over the forecast horizon and will stimulate economic activity.

Euroarea,2011-06-09,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting, which was also attended by Commissioner Rehn. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The information that has become available since our meeting on 5 May 2011 confirms continued upward pressure on overall inflation, mainly owing to energy and commodity prices. The underlying pace of monetary expansion is gradually recovering. Monetary liquidity remains ample, with the potential to accommodate price pressures in the euro area. Furthermore, the most recent data confirm the positive underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area, while uncertainty remains elevated. Overall, our monetary policy stance remains accommodative, lending support to economic activity. On balance, risks to the outlook for price stability are on the upside. On the basis of our assessment, we will act in a firm and timely manner. We will do all that is needed to prevent recent price developments giving rise to broad-based inflationary pressures. We remain strongly determined to secure a firm anchoring of inflation expectations in the euro area in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. This is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting growth and job creation in the euro area. The Governing Council today also decided to continue conducting its main refinancing operations (MROs) as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of the ninth maintenance period of 2011 on 11 October 2011. This procedure will also remain in use for the Eurosystem's special-term refinancing operations with a maturity of one maintenance period, which will continue to be conducted for as long as needed, and at least until the end of the third quarter of 2011. The fixed rate in these special-term refinancing operations will be the same as the MRO rate prevailing at the time. Furthermore, the Governing Council decided to conduct the three-month longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) to be allotted on 27 July, 31 August and 28 September 2011 as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment. The rates in these three-month operations will be fixed at the average rate of the MROs over the life of the respective LTRO. As stated on previous occasions, the provision of liquidity and the allotment modes for refinancing operations will be adjusted when appropriate, taking into account the fact that all the non-standard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions are, by construction, temporary in nature. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. In the first quarter of 2011, the euro area recorded strong real GDP growth of 0.8% quarter-on-quarter, following the 0.3% increase of the fourth quarter of 2010. Recent statistical releases and survey-based indicators point towards a continued expansion of economic activity in the euro area in the second quarter of this year, albeit at a slower pace. This easing reflects the fact that the strong growth in the first quarter was partly due to special factors, which will cease to play a role in the second quarter. Hence, it is appropriate to look through such short-term volatility and to emphasise the positive underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area. Looking ahead, euro area exports should be supported by the ongoing expansion in the world economy. At the same time, taking into account the favourable level of business confidence in the euro area, private sector domestic demand should contribute increasingly to economic growth, benefiting from the still accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to improve the functioning of the financial system. However, activity is expected to continue to be dampened somewhat by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors. This assessment is also reflected in the June 2011 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real GDP growth in a range between 1.5% and 2.3 % in 2011 and between 0.6 % and 2.8% in 2012. Compared with the March 2011 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the range for 2011 has been revised upwards, while the range for 2012 remains broadly unchanged. The June 2011 Eurosystem staff projections are broadly in line with recent forecasts by international organisations. In the Governing Council's assessment, the risks to this economic outlook remain broadly balanced in an environment of elevated uncertainty. On the one hand, favourable business confidence could provide more support to domestic economic activity in the euro area than currently expected and higher foreign demand could also contribute more strongly to growth than expected. On the other hand, downside risks relate to the ongoing tensions in some segments of the financial markets that may potentially spill over to the euro area real economy. Downside risks also relate to further increases in energy prices, protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation was 2.7% in May according to Eurostat's flash estimate, after 2.8% in April. The relatively high inflation rates seen over the past few months largely reflect higher energy and commodity prices. Looking ahead, inflation rates are likely to stay clearly above 2% over the coming months. Upward pressure on inflation, mainly from energy and commodity prices, is also discernible in the earlier stages of the production process. It remains of paramount importance that the rise in HICP inflation does not translate into second-round effects in price and wage-setting behaviour and lead to broad-based inflationary pressures. Inflation expectations must remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The June 2011 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area foresee annual HICP inflation in a range between 2.5% and 2.7% for 2011 and between 1.1% and 2.3% for 2012. In comparison with the March 2011 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the range for HICP inflation in 2011 has been revised upwards, largely reflecting higher energy prices. It is appropriate to recall that the staff projections are conditional on a number of purely technical assumptions, including oil prices, interest rates and exchange rates. In particular, it is assumed that oil prices will decline somewhat and that short-term interest rates will rise, in accordance with market expectations. Overall the projections embody the view that the recent high rates of inflation do not lead to broader-based inflationary pressure in the euro area. Risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments remain on the upside. They relate, in particular, to higher than assumed increases in energy prices. Furthermore, there is a risk of increases in indirect taxes and administered prices that may be greater than currently assumed, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. Finally, upside risks may come from stronger than expected domestic price pressures in the context of increasing capacity utilisation in the euro area. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 was 2.0% in April 2011, after 2.3% in March. Looking through the recent volatility in broad money growth. M3 growth has continued to edge up over recent months. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector strengthened slightly to 2.6% in April, after 2.5% in March. Overall, the underlying pace of monetary expansion is gradually recovering. At the same time, monetary liquidity accumulated prior to the period of financial market tensions remains ample, with the potential to accommodate price pressures in the euro area. Looking at M3 components, the annual growth rate of M1 decreased in April, while that of other short-term deposits increased. The development partly reflects the gradual increase in the remuneration of these deposits over recent months. At the same time, the steep yield curve implies a dampening impact on overall M3 growth, as it reduces the attractiveness of monetary assets compared with more highly remunerated longer-term instruments outside M3. However, available information suggests that this impact may be waning. On the counterpart side, there has been a further slight strengthening in the growth of loans to non-financial corporations, which rose to 1.0% in April, after 0.8% in March. The growth of loans to households was 3.4% in April, unchanged from the previous month. The latest data confirm a continued gradual strengthening in the annual growth of lending to the non-financial private sector. The overall size of bank balance sheets has remained broadly unchanged over the past few months, notwithstanding some volatility. It is important that banks continue to expand the provision of credit to the private sector in an environment of increasing demand. To address this challenge, where necessary, it is essential for banks to retain earnings, to turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or to take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. In particular, banks that currently have limited access to market financing urgently need to increase their capital and their efficiency. To sum up, based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The information that has become available since our meeting on 5 May 2011 confirms continued upward pressure on overall inflation, mainly owing to energy and commodity prices. A cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis indicates that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is gradually recovering. Monetary liquidity remains ample, with the potential to accommodate price pressures in the euro area. Furthermore, the most recent data confirm the positive underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area, while uncertainty remains elevated. Overall, our monetary policy stance remains accommodative, lending support to economic activity. On balance, risks to the outlook for price stability are on the upside. On the basis of our assessment, we will act in a firm and timely manner. We will do all that is needed to prevent recent price developments giving rise to broad-based inflationary pressures. We remain strongly determined to secure a firm anchoring of inflation expectations in the euro area in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. This is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting growth and job creation in the euro area. Turning to fiscal policies, all parties involved in the preparation of the 2012 national budgets must ensure that they are fully in line with the requirement to support confidence in fiscal policies. A comparison between the latest economic forecasts by the European Commission and the fiscal plans embodied in the stability programmes points to the need for many countries to underpin their budget targets with concrete consolidation measures in order to correct their excessive deficits by the commonly agreed deadlines. The implementation of credible fiscal adjustment strategies is crucial in view of ongoing financial market pressures. At the same time, the implementation of ambitious and far-reaching structural reforms is urgently required in the euro area to strengthen substantially its competitiveness, flexibility and longer-term growth potential. In particular, countries which have high fiscal and external deficits or which are suffering from a loss of competitiveness should rapidly carry out comprehensive economic reforms. In the case of product markets, policies that enhance competition and innovation should be vigorously pursued to facilitate productivity growth. Regarding the labour market, the priority must be to enhance wage flexibility and incentives to work, and to remove labour market rigidities."
South Korea,2011-06-10,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points to 3.25%. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the Base Rate by 25 basis points to 3.25%. Based on currently available information, the Committee considers the recoveries in major advanced economies to have exhibited signs of being somewhat delayed, while emerging market economies continue to show favorable performances. Going forward, the Committee forecasts that the global economy will keep up its pace of recovery; nevertheless, the Committee recognizes the possibility of such factors as the sovereign debt concerns in some euro area countries, the political unrest in North Africa and the Middle East, and the impacts of the Great East Japan Earthquake posing downside risks to the global economy. For Korea, the Committee judges that, despite the temporary sluggishness of domestic demand, the economy has maintained its underlying upward trend on the strength of the sustained high growth of exports. Labor market conditions have also remained on a track of improvement, led by the private sector. Going forward, the Committee anticipates that the domestic economy will keep up this underlying trend, even in the presence of external risks. Consumer price inflation recorded a high level again in May, in the low 4% range. The Committee expects inflationary pressures to continue in the coming months, driven largely by increased demand from the economic upswing and by inflation expectations. Core inflation has risen to the mid-3% range, as the effects of the recent rises in price of oil and farm products are being passed through to the prices of such items as processed food products and personal service fees; there is also a possibility of this uptrend in core inflation persisting in the future. As for housing prices, the upward movements in Seoul and its surrounding areas have come to a halt, while the steep upward trend in the rest of the country has continued. Leasehold deposits have risen at a slower rate than that in the previous month, affected mostly by seasonal slackness. In the financial markets, stock prices and long-term market interest rates have fallen and the Korean won depreciated against the US dollar, influenced mainly by external risk factors. Mortgage lending has posted a steady rise, albeit at a slower pace than during last month. Looking ahead, the Committee, while taking overall account of financial and economic conditions both at home and abroad, will conduct monetary policy with a greater emphasis on ensuring that the basis for price stability is firmly anchored while the economy continues its sound growth."
Armenia,2011-06-12,"Press Release 06.12.2011 In the December 06, 2011 Meeting the Board of CBA decided to leave the Refinancing Rate of CBA unchanged, at 8 percent. In November inflation was 1.2 percent, and the 12-month inflation fell by 0.9 pp against the previous month's indicator and reached 4.8 percent, returning the confidence band of 4%±1.5 pp as a result. The Board admitted that currently no inflationary pressures on the Armenian economy from the world economy are observed. It is expected that prices of raw materials and food products will not change notably in the face of expected slowing of world economic growth, which is congruent with the baseline scenario of world economic growth outlook as described in the Q4, 2011 Monetary Policy Program. In the meantime, uncertainties over debt crisis faced by developed countries are persisting. The Board has consensus that no inflationary risks are expected from the Armenian economy either: an estimation still holds true that the developments existing in and expected from the labor market and aggregate demand will not create significant pressures on the inflation environment. The Board summarized that the domestic economy develops in line with forecast trends as outlined in the Q4, 2011 Monetary Policy Program, and there is great likelihood that inflation in the 12-month horizon will be within the confidence band of 4%±1.5 pp. The Board therefore finds it reasonable to keep up with the baseline scenario's direction mentioned in the Q4, 2011 Monetary Policy Program, which means implementing a neutral policy.

Chile,2011-06-14,"Central Bank of Chile Press Release* Santiago, 14 June 2011 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points, to 5.25% (annual). Internationally, advanced economies have experienced a slowdown in their growth rates. Concerns about financial risk in Europe have intensified. An increase in the risk premiums of various assets is observed. At the global level, inflation figures have increased further, but other indicators point at a moderation of inflation expectations. Expectations regarding the normalization of interest rates in advanced economies have been postponed. Meanwhile, several emerging economies have further reduced their monetary impulse. Commodity prices have remained high. Domestically, output, demand and labor market figures reflect the dynamism of the economy. Annual CPI inflation indicators have hovered around 3% while measures of core inflation remain bounded. Private inflation expectations show a decline, although some of them remain above the target. The Board estimates that, in the most likely scenario, additional increases in the monetary policy rate will be necessary, the timing of which will depend on the unfolding of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions. Accordingly, it will continue to use its policies with flexibility so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. * The Spanish original prevails."
Peru,2011-06-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JUNE 2011 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 4.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference at 4.25 percent. This measure takes into account the moderation of increases in consumer prices and in some indicators of activity. Future adjustments in the reference rate will depend on new information on the evolution of inflation and its determinants. Inflation in May showed a negative rate of 0.02 percent, as a result of which annual inflation recorded a rate of 3.07 percent. Core inflation, which registered 0.34 percent, accumulated an annual growth of 2.8 percent. Inflation excluding food and energy showed a rate of 0.12 percent and an accumulated annual rate of 1.80 percent. Some current and advanced indicators of activity show lower growth compared with previous months. On the other hand, indicators of global activity show signs of weakness in Japan and the United States, and uncertainty is still observed due to the persistence of risks such as those associated with the fiscal situation of some industrialized countries and the crisis in the Middle East and North Africa. The Board continues to oversee the projection of inflation and its determinants and stands ready to adopt future adjustments in monetary policy instruments in order to ensure that inflation falls within the target range. The Board also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as described below: Overnight deposits: 3.45 percent. Direct repo and rediscount operations: 5.05 percent. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.05 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for July on its session of July 7, 2011."
Philippines,2011-06-15,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to keep policy rates steady. At the same time, the Board decided to raise the reserve requirement on deposits and deposit substitutes of all banks and non-banks with quasi-banking functions by one percentage point effective on Friday, 24 June 2011. In deciding to maintain policy rates, the Monetary Board noted that the latest baseline forecasts show a lower path and that inflation expectations have shown some signs of leveling off. These developments suggest that the two previous policy rate adjustments are starting to work their way through the system. Meanwhile, the Monetary Board's decision to raise the reserve requirement is a preemptive move to counter any additional inflationary pressures from excess liquidity. The Monetary Board believes that expectations of continued strong capital inflows, driven by positive market sentiment over the favorable prospects for the Philippine economy, could fuel domestic liquidity growth and contribute to inflation risks. The move to raise the reserve requirement-which will apply to regular reserves-is also part of the normalization of the liquidity-enhancing measures adopted during the global financial crisis. The Monetary Board emphasized that risks to the inflation outlook remain, which will continue to warrant vigilance from the BSP. The BSP therefore remains prepared to implement further monetary measures as necessary to safeguard price stability."
Hungary,2011-06-20,"At its meeting on 20 June 2011, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at 6.00%. The Monetary Council discussed and commented on the June 2011 issue of the MNB's Quarterly Report on Inflation prepared by Bank staff. In the Council's judgement, the recovery of the Hungarian economy is likely to continue over the next two years; however, the level of output will remain below its potential throughout the period. Domestic demand is expected to recover only slowly and gradually. Consequently, inflation may fall back to 3% by the end of 2012 even without policy tightening, despite the cost shocks hitting the economy. Inflation has increasingly been dominated by the balance between two opposing forces. On the one hand, continued rises in commodity prices are feeding through into core inflation in the short term. On the other hand, the disciplining effect on price and wage-setting of the persistent weakness in domestic demand and high unemployment is likely to become the dominant influence as the effects of the cost shocks wear off. Loose labour market conditions are allowing firms to restore their profitability by moderating wage growth. As a result, inflation is likely to be materially above 3% this year and then to fall back to the target towards the end of next year even without policy tightening. It may be necessary to maintain interest rates at their current level over a sustained period in order to meet the target for CPI inflation by the end of 2012. In the Council's judgement, domestic demand growth is expected to recover only slowly. The latest data show little sign yet of a pick-up in household consumption. Indebted households may continue to adjust their balance sheets and maintain their high propensity to save for longer than previously expected. Disbursements to members of real returns on their private pension funds contributions are likely to provide a temporary boost to household consumption. By contrast, the slow recovery in employment and the reduction in government expenditure required to stabilise fiscal balance are likely to lead to a fall in household disposable income in the short term, and are only expected to result in higher income growth over the longer term through a sustained rise in employment. The factors influencing the recovery in private sector investment are weak domestic demand, tight credit conditions and the effect of windfall taxes. Although a couple of large individual investment projects in manufacturing are likely to help bring about a recovery, private sector investment is only expected to increase materially from mid-2012. In the Council's judgement, the decline in private sector investment in the past few years points to a persistently lower output path than previously expected. External demand is expected to remain the main driver of Hungarian economic growth in the short term, due to the slower-than-expected recovery of domestic demand. Global economic activity is expected to slow slightly, but its effect on Hungarian exports may be offset by the implementation of large-scale investment projects, mainly in the car industry. The trade surplus, reflecting strong export growth and weak imports due to subdued domestic demand, is likely to make a significant contribution to economic growth over the next two years. Perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy have recently been shaped by the improvement in sentiment towards emerging market economies. Concerns over the sustainability of public debt in some euro-area periphery countries intensified; however, this had only limited impact on risk premia in countries of Central and Eastern Europe, which was viewed as a positive development. Positive market reactions to the latest update of the Government's Convergence Programme and the interest rate premium on the forint may also have contributed to relative stability. The Monetary Council has decided to leave interest rates unchanged in light of the above considerations. Inflation is likely to be above target in the short term, due to cost-push pressures stemming from the rise in commodity prices. However, owing to the disciplining effect on price and wage-setting of the persistent weakness in domestic demand and high unemployment, the 3% inflation target can be achieved at the end of 2012 by maintaining interest rates at their current level over a sustained period. There are both upside and downside risks to the baseline projection for inflation, with the Council assigning different weights to them. Developments in commodity prices are a main source of uncertainty for the future course of interest rate policy. Further sustained increases in the prices of oil and agricultural products may make it necessary to increase interest rates in order to reduce inflationary pressures. A potential further decline in the risk premium on the forint in response to the fiscal adjustment may ease inflationary pressures through an appreciation of the forint exchange rate, which in turn may provide scope for an easing of monetary conditions in the medium term. However, the protracted debt crisis in the euro-area periphery may have adverse effects on perceptions about the risks associated with forint assets, which in turn may warrant an increase in interest rates."
Georgia,2011-06-22,"22.06.11 National Bank Of Georgia Maintains Its Main Policy Rate Unchanged At 8 Percent The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on June 22th, 2011 and decided to keep its Main Policy Rate (the refinancing rate) unchanged at 8 percent. Annual inflation reached 14.3 percent in May 20011, mostly due to supply-side shocks. The share of food price increase in the annual inflation was 12.6 percentage points. Annual core inflation (excluding food and fuel prices) is still low (1.7%), as is he inflation in the service sector (1%). Hence the demand side inflation risks are low. Since the last MPC meeting the inflation forecast hasn't changed. According to the existing forecasts the inflation will keep decreasing and will be around 8% by the end of the year, whereas in 2012 it will reach the target. The real growth of the economy in the first quarter of 2011 has dropped compared to the previous quarters and is equal to 5.8%, indicating the reduction in the demand growth rates. World oil prices were still decreasing in June. According to existing forecasts, this trend will prevail in coming periods, which, presumably, will be reflected on Georgian consumer market. In case the above mentioned trends will continue the National Bank will consider monetary easing at its further meetings. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will take place on July 20th, 2011."
United States,2011-06-22,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April indicates that the economic recovery is continuing at a moderate pace, though somewhat more slowly than the Committee had expected. Also, recent labor market indicators have been weaker than anticipated. The slower pace of the recovery reflects in part factors that are likely to be temporary, including the damping effect of higher food and energy prices on consumer purchasing power and spending as well as supply chain disruptions associated with the tragic events in Japan. Household spending and business investment in equipment and software continue to expand. However, investment in nonresidential structures is still weak, and the housing sector continues to be depressed. Inflation has picked up in recent months, mainly reflecting higher prices for some commodities and imported goods, as well as the recent supply chain disruptions. However, longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The unemployment rate remains elevated; however, the Committee expects the pace of recovery to pick up over coming quarters and the unemployment rate to resume its gradual decline toward levels that the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate. Inflation has moved up recently, but the Committee anticipates that inflation will subside to levels at or below those consistent with the Committee's dual mandate as the effects of past energy and other commodity price increases dissipate. However, the Committee will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations. To promote the ongoing economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with its mandate, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee continues to anticipate that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period. The Committee will complete its purchases of $600 billion of longer-term Treasury securities by the end of this month and will maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its securities holdings. The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate. The Committee will monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will act as needed to best foster maximum employment and price stability. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Elizabeth A Duke; Charles L Evans; Richard W Fisher; Narayana Kocherlakota; Charles I Plosser; Sarah Bloom Raskin; Daniel K Tarullo; and Janet L Yellen."
Czech Republic,2011-06-23,"Press conference of the CNB Bank Board 4th Situation Report on Economic and Monetary Developments 23 June 2011 The monetary policy decision taken and the ratio of the votes cast At the close of the meeting the Board decided by a majority vote to leave the two-week repo rate unchanged at 0.75%. Five members voted in favour of this decision, and two members voted for increasing rates by 0.25 percentage point. Reasons for the decision Headline and monetary-policy relevant inflation will be close to the inflation target over the monetary policy horizon. Consistent with the forecast is broad stability of market interest rates in the near future and a gradual rise in rates starting in 2011 Q4. Risks to the forecast are balanced for monetary-policy relevant inflation. Its growth was driven mainly by net exports and to a lesser extent by gross capital formation; April industrial production indicates a continuing albeit slowing recovery (4.7% y-o-y; 0.3% in m-o-m s.a. terms); Total employment increased in 2011 Q1 in y-o-y terms (by 0.7%).

Turkiye,2011-06-23,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels: a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) at 6.25 percent, b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 1.50 percent, lending rate at 9 percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 8 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, lending rate at 12 percent. Recent data releases are consistent with the outlook presented in the Inflation Report. Private consumption and investment growth rates are moderating, while external demand outlook remains weak. Employment conditions continue to improve with unemployment rates back to the pre-crisis levels. Meanwhile, unit labor costs decline due to strong productivity gains and low levels of capacity utilization rates persist due to weak external demand. However, given the lagged impact of rising import prices and base effects, core inflation is expected to increase at a moderate pace over the short term. Moreover, the Committee notes that the jump in unprocessed food inflation would largely reverse in June and annual inflation would fall back to the path forecasted in the Inflation Report. The recent measures taken by the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency will contribute to the rebalancing of domestic and external demand. The Committee has reiterated that, owing to the measures taken so far, the current account balance will start to improve in the final quarter of the year. In light of these assessments, combined with the ongoing uncertainty regarding the global economy and the slowdown in domestic economic activity, the Committee has decided to maintain the current policy stance. Overall, in order to contain the risks towards price stability and financial stability, the Committee has decided to monitor the tightening impact of the existing policy mix and take additional measures along the same lines, if needed. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Israel,2011-06-27,"27.06.2011 The Bank of Israel leaves the interest rate for July 2011 unchanged at 3.25 percent To view this press release as a WORD file - Click here Background conditions Inflation data:The inflation rate over the last 12 months was 4.1 percent, above the upper limit of the target inflation range (of 1-3 percent a year). The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.5 percent inMay, in line with the forecasts and at the upper limit of the seasonal path consistent with achieving the inflation target. The continued rapid increase in housing and food prices, which continued this month, contributed to the increase in the index. The index excluding housing rose by 0.2 percent in May. The seasonally adjusted monthly rise in the index, particularly theindex excluding owner-occupied housing, in the last three months was significantly slower than that in the previous three months. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Inflation expectations forthe next twelve months as calculated from the capital market and those of forecasters re-entered the target inflation range, and stood at 2.9 percent, slightly below the upper limit of the range. The decline in expectations is apparently due to several developments that have served to moderate inflation: the appreciation of the shekel in the last few months, the fall in commodity prices, and the last three CPIs published, that are consistent with meeting the inflation target. Medium-term inflation expectations are within the target range. Based on the Telbor (Tel Aviv Inter-Bank Offered Rate)market, the Bank of Israel interest rate one year from now is expected to be 4 percent, and the average of forecasters' predictions is that it will be 4.3 percent. All the forecasters who updated their forecasts following the publication of the May CPI expect the Bank of Israel to leave the interest rate for July unchanged. Real economic activity: Economic indicators that became availablethis month show that economic activity continued to expand in the second quarter, albeit more slowly than in the first quarter. The composite state-of-the-economy index for May increased 0.3 percent, and the average change in the index over the past three months of 0.25 percent is lower than the average monthly change (0.5 percent) in the year and a half that preceded them. Partial data for the second quarter (April and May) point to a 1.5 percent decline in manufactured goods exports in the second quarter compared with the first quarter, in parallel to a decline in the volume of world trade in April. With that, a number of indicators point to continued growth. The second estimate of the National Accounts data for the first quarter shows apicture similar to that shown by the first estimate: an annualized GDP growth rate of 4.8 percent, and business product growth of 5.5 percent.At the beginning of this month the Bank of Israel revised its growth forecast for 2011 upwards, to 5.2 percent (compared with 4.5 percent in the previous forecast). The Central Bureau of Statistics trends survey reflects positive expectations of activity in the principal industries in the next few months. Consumer confidence indices declined a little this month but are still at a high level, expressing an optimistic view of economic activity. The Bank of Israel staff forecast which was updated this month, is that inflation in 2011 will be above the upper limit of the target inflation range, and that it will decline to within the range in the first quarter of 2012. The interest rate is expected to increase gradually to about 4.1 percent in a year's time (the average rate for the second quarter of 2012). Balance of risks: The main factors which could alter the forecasts for real activity and inflation in Israel are developments in the global economy, specifically a possible deterioration of the debt crisis in Europe, the realization of geopolitical risks, and commodity and oil prices. The labor market and wages: Labor market data indicate a continued expansionary trend in employment and a drop in unemployment, with a moderate increase in wages. According to trend figures for April, the percentageof unemployed continued to fall, and reached 5.8 percent of the civilian workforce. The nominal wage increased in January-March by 0.8 percent compared with the level in the previous three months, while the real wagedropped by 0.9 percent (seasonally adjusted). Health tax receipts in May, which provide an indication of wage payments in that month, were 7.6 percent higher, in nominal terms, than in May 2010. The minimum monthly wage is scheduled to increase from NIS 3,900 to NIS 4,100 at the beginning of July.</td> Budget data: Tax revenues in January-May were 7.4 percenthigher, in real terms, than the corresponding period last year. Domestic expenditure in the first five months of the year resulted in a cumulative surplus of 0.1 percent of GDP, compared with a deficit of 0.5 percent of GDP in the corresponding period of 2010. Tax collection is expected to be higher than the forecast on which the budget was based, and the annual deficit is expected to be lower than the legally prescribed ceiling (3 percent of GDP), even assuming full expenditure of the budget. The foreign exchange market: From the previous monetary policy discussion held on May 19, through June 24, the shekel appreciated by 1.3 percent against the dollar, in line with the trend around the world, and by about 1.6 percent against the euro. The strengthening of the dollar against the other major currencies resulted from very weak macroeconomic figures and increased concern over the debt crises in Europe. In terms of the nominal effective exchange rate the shekel strengthened by about 1.2 percent. The capital and money markets:Between the monetary policy discussions of May 19 and June 24, most Tel Aviv Stock Exchange share price indices fell, in line with the general trend abroad. The Tel Aviv 100 Index fell by 6.6 percent. Yields on local currency government bonds declined by 5-12 basis points (b.p.), mainly in the medium term. Yields on CPI-indexed government bonds showed a mixed trend, rising 5-35 basis pointsin the short term while medium- to long-term yields were stable and even declined a little. This came against the background of global weakness and adecline in inflation expectations in Israel. The yield gap between Israeliunindexed 10-year government bonds and US 10-year Treasury notes widened during the period surveyed, and at the end of the period stood at 235 b.p. Short-term makam yields increased by 5-15 b.p. while longer term yields remained stable. New corporate bond issues totaled a gross NIS 2.5 billion in May, and totaled NIS 18 billion for the year to date, compared with NIS 13 billion in the corresponding period of 2010. The Tel-Bond indices ofCPI-indexed bonds continued their downward trend of this year, with the Tel-Bond 40 falling by 0.6 percent. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spread remained almost unchanged over the month, at 144 b.p. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in May the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 4.5 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 8.5 percent. Developments in the market for housing credit: The balance of outstanding credit to the business sector increased in April by 0.5 percent, to NIS 771 billion. Outstanding credit to households increased by 0.3 percent in April, to NIS 347 billion. Housing credit rose 14.1 percent in the twelve months ending in April, to NIS 243 billion. In March, the increase overthe past twelve months was 13.2 percent. The share of new mortgages that were not indexed to the CPI, at variable interest rates, continued to fall, reaching 43.3 percent in May, down from 47 percent in April. On May 5, 2011, a Bank of Israel directive regarding the maximum permitted share of a housing loan at a floating interest rate went into effect. The effect of the directive is not yet fully seen in May mortgage figures, since some of thosemortgages were signed before the directive was given. Interest rates on mortgages of all types increased in May. The housing market:House prices--which are presented in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of house prices but are not included in the CPI--continued to increase, and in March-April they increased at a rate of 1.5 percent a month, following their increase of 0.8 percent a month in February-March. The annual pace of rises in house prices continues to be high. In the twelve months endedin May, house prices increased by 15.3 percent; up from 13.9 percent in the twelve months ended in April. The housing price index, which is based mainly on renewed rental contracts and which is included in the CPI continued to increase, rising 1.1 percent in May. In the last twelve months it has increased by 6.4 percent. In May, the Ministry of Finance decided to abolish the betterment tax on the sale of a second (or additional) home as of the beginning of 2013. This step is expected to slow the rise of house prices in the coming year. The global economy: Most macroeconomic figures published this month continued to point to a slowing in the pace of the global economic recovery. Most of the weakness is focused in the US. Europe (excluding Germany),and several East Asian economies. As a result, investment houses revised downward their forecast of world economic growth. With that, the OECD and IMF emphasize that recent weakness is temporary, and the central scenario in the forecasts of both those institutions is for a slight acceleration in growth. The debt crisis in Europe worsened, primarily against the background of the crisis in Greece. Nonetheless, in recent days, international institutions have authorized the plan proposed by Greece's government. This clearsthe way for additional aid to that country. Despite that, the risk of a banking debt crisis in Europe increased significantly. Commodity prices continue to stabilize and even fall, though despite that, inflation figures in several important economies continue to surprise on the high side, and pose a significant challenge to central banks. The central banks need to deal with weakness in real economic activity, while at the same time dealing with inflation. Against the background of the state of real economic activity and inflation, the widely held estimates are that central banks around the world will continue to raise interest rates, but at a more moderate pace. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to leave the interest rate for July at 3.25 percent is consistent with the process of returning the interest rate to a more normal range intended to position inflation firmly within the target range, and to support further growth, while maintaining financial stability. The rate of increase in the interest rate is not pre-determined, but is set in accordancewith the inflation environment, economic growth in Israel and globally, the monetary policies of the leading central banks, and developments in the exchange rates of the shekel. At the current level of the interest rate, monetary policy continues to be expansionary. Inflation over the previous twelve months continues to be high, at 4.1 percent. However, inflation expectations for the next twelve months derived from the capital market and the average of the forecasters' expectations declined over the past month, and are now slightly below the upper limit of the range. The past three CPI readings have been consistent with achieving the target inflation range. Economic indicators published this month point to continued expansion of economic activity and expectations are that the expansion will continue in the second quarter, even if at a more moderate pace. With that, there is growing concernover slower US economic growth and the worsening risks of debt problems inEurope and their implications for Israel's economy. The annual rate of increase in house prices continues to be high--in the last twelve months house prices increased by 15.3 percent. With that, the effect of interest rate increases, steps by the Bank of Israel in the mortgage market, and steps by the Ministry of Finance regarding real estate taxation, together with the continued growth in building starts, are expectedto affect housing prices over the course of the coming year. Central bank interest rates in the major advanced economies are still low, and are expected to remain so in the next few months. Against the background of the acceleration in inflation in fast growing economies, several central banks increased their interest rates again this month. However, the concern of a slowdown in US growth and the worsening of debt risks in Europe led to expectations of a slowdown in the pace of interest rate increases in other markets. In the first half of the year the Bank of Israel raised the interest rate markedly. At the same time, steps were taken by the Bank of Israel and the Ministry of Finance in the housing market. In addition, the shekel appreciated over recent months and there was a decline in commodity prices. The impact on inflation of these items is expected to be felt in the future. In light of these issues, and the marked increase of risks in the global economy, it was decided to leave the interest rate at its current level at this time. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in Israel's economy and the global economy and in the financial markets. The Bank will usethe instruments available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, including keeping a close watch on developmentsin the assets market, and especially in the housing market. The minutes of the discussions prior to the above interest rate decision will be published on July 11, 2011. The decision regarding the interest rate for August 2011 will be published at 17:30 on Monday. July 25, 2011. 27.06.2011 The Bank of Israel leaves the interest rate for July 2011 unchanged at 3.25 percent. The Bank of Israel leaves the interest rate for July 2011 unchanged at 3.25 percent.

Romania,2011-06-29,"In its meeting of June 29, 2011, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided:. The NBR will further vigilantly monitor domestic and global developments so as to ensure, via an adequate use of its available instruments, the achievement and maintenance of price stability in the medium term and the consolidation of financial stability. In May, annual inflation rate rose marginally to 8.41 percent from 8.34 percent in the previous month against the background of a relative moderation in volatile and administered price growth. This evolution is in line with the latest medium-term inflation forecast presented by the NBR in the May 2011 Inflation Report, according to which disinflation will resume against the backdrop of the fading first-round effects of the VAT rate hike and the persistence of the negative output gap. The most recent statistical data show a slower annual growth rate of industrial output and exports in April, along with the annual dynamics of leading indicators on domestic demand staying in negative territory. At the same time, however, there are incipient signs of a rebound in lending, associated also with a further decrease in bank lending and deposit rates, despite the still negative annual real growth of loans to the private sector, particularly recorded by credit in domestic currency. The inflation outlook continues to feature significant risks. The developments in international commodity prices, the uncertainties related to the calendar and magnitude of administered price adjustments, the movements on global financial markets in the context of the evolution of the sovereign debt crisis, as well as the possible emergence of second-round effects from the supply-side shocks seen in the recent quarters remain a matter of concern. This calls for a further prudent monetary policy stance with a view to ensuring a solid anchoring of inflation expectations. In this context, the NBR Board decided to leave unchanged the monetary policy rate at 6.25 percent per annum and to continue to pursue adequate management of liquidity in the banking system. Furthermore, the NBR Board decided to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. These decisions, along with the consistent implementation of commitments made by the Romanian authorities under the financing agreements with international institutions, will ensure the preservation of prospects of a sustainable resumption of disinflation and a robust recovery of the economy in the context of the nominal and real convergence process. According to the calendar of NBR Board meetings dedicated to monetary policy issues, the next meeting is scheduled for August 3, 2011, when a new quarterly Inflation Report will be examined."
Russia,2011-06-30,"The Bank of Russia External and Public Relations Department informs that on June 30, 2011 the Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia decided to keep unchanged the refinancing rate and interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations. The decision was supported by the assessment of inflationary risks and risks to the sustainability of economic growth, including those associated with increasing uncertainty of the external economic situation development. As of June 27, 2011 the inflation rate in annual terms amounted to 9.4% (9.6% in May). The pace of consumer prices growth moderated in June compared with the previous month that was mainly due to deceleration of growth of certain food prices. In June the strong increase of bank credit to households continued as well as the slowdown in households deposits' growth indicating that the savings rate was likely to decline. This change could result in both an economic activity growth and an increase of inflationary risks. At the same time, the current trend of gradual slowdown in money supply could contribute to the reduction of the inflationary pressure associated with monetary factors. The trends in macroeconomic indicators' dynamics formed in previous months persisted in June indicating the remaining risks to the sustainability of economic growth. The deceleration of industrial production annual growth rate continued as well as the reduction of the real disposable incomes of the households. The unemployment rate decreased significantly, though to a great extent due to the seasonal effects. Meanwhile, the retail sales showed sustainable growth. Investment activity growth in annual terms continued to restore after the sharp drop in the beginning of 2011, however this positive movement could not yet be considered as a consistent trend. Considering current domestic and external economic conditions and the effect of the monetary policy measures, implemented in recent months, the Bank of Russia judged that the current level of interest rates is appropriate for coming months to balance the remaining inflationary risks and the risks of economic growth slowdown. The next meting of the Board of Directors on monetary policy issues is planned to be held in the beginning of August, 2011. The reference to the Press Service is mandatory if you intend to use this material."
Armenia,2011-07-06,"Press Release 07.06.2011 In the June 7, 2011 meeting the Board of CBA decided to leave the Refinancing Rate of CBA unchanged, at 8.5 percent. Inflation in May of 2011 was 0.04 percent, and the 12-month inflation has increased by 0.1 pp and amounted to 9.0 percent, as a result. The Board accepted that inflationary pressures coming from the external sector eased for the upcoming period of time: prices of primary goods fell at the beginning of the month, stabilizing at levels lower than in the previous month. Prices of food products are relatively stable. The Board agreed that impulses from the domestic economy on the inflation environment remained neutral: weak inflationary pressures from the labor market are offset by a slow growth of private spending restrictive nature of the fiscal policy. In the meantime, prices of agricultural products are expected to fall as volumes of production of domestic agro-products increase relative to the previous year. The Board estimates that the likelihood of the inflationary environment to expand is very low and that easing existing inflationary environment through interest rates in the financial market is possible. As a result, inflation in the forecast time horizon will be within a band of 4 % ± 1.5 pp. The Central Bank Public Relations."

Euroarea,2011-07-07,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to increase the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points, after raising rates by 25 basis points in April 2011 from historically low levels. The further adjustment of the current accommodative monetary policy stance is warranted in the light of upside risks to price stability. The underlying pace of monetary expansion is continuing to gradually recover, while monetary liquidity remains ample with the potential to accommodate price pressures in the euro area. All in all, it is essential that the recent price developments do not give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures over the medium term. Our decision will contribute to keeping inflation expectations in the euro area firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to contribute to economic growth in the euro area. At the same time, interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum remain low. Thus, our monetary policy stance remains accommodative, lending support to economic activity and job creation. As expected, recent economic data indicate some deceleration in the pace of economic growth in the second quarter of 2011. While the underlying momentum of economic growth in the euro area continues to be positive, uncertainty remains elevated. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments with respect to upside risks to price stability. The provision of liquidity and the allotment modes for refinancing operations will be adjusted when appropriate, taking into account the fact that all the non-standard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions are, by construction, temporary in nature. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. In the first quarter of 2011 euro area real GDP posted a strong quarter-on-quarter increase of 0.8%, following the 0.3% increase in the last quarter of 2010. Recent statistical releases and survey-based indicators point towards a continued expansion of economic activity in the euro area in the second quarter of this year, albeit at a slower pace. This moderation reflects the fact that the strong growth in the first quarter was in part due to special factors. The positive underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area remains in place. Euro area exports should continue to be supported by the ongoing expansion in the world economy. At the same time, taking into account the present level of business confidence in the euro area, private sector domestic demand should contribute to economic growth. However, activity is expected to continue to be dampened somewhat by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors. In the Governing Council's assessment, the risks to this economic outlook remain broadly balanced in an environment of elevated uncertainty. On the one hand, favourable business confidence could provide more support to domestic economic activity in the euro area than currently expected and higher foreign demand could also contribute more strongly to growth than expected. On the other hand, downside risks relate to the ongoing tensions in some segments of the financial markets that may potentially spill over to the euro area real economy. Downside risks also relate to further increases in energy prices, protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation was 2.7% in June 2011 according to Eurostat's flash estimate  the same rate as in May. The relatively high inflation rates seen over the past few months largely reflect higher energy and commodity prices. Looking ahead, inflation rates are likely to stay clearly above 2% over the coming months. Upward pressure on inflation, mainly from energy and commodity prices, is also still discernible in the earlier stages of the production process. It remains of paramount importance that the rise in HICP inflation does not translate into second-round effects in price and wage-setting behaviour and lead to broad-based inflationary pressures. Inflation expectations must remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments remain on the upside. They relate, in particular, to higher than assumed increases in energy prices. Furthermore, there is a risk of increases in indirect taxes and administered prices that may be greater than currently assumed, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. Finally, upside risks may stem from stronger than expected domestic price pressures in the context of increasing capacity utilisation in the euro area. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 increased to 2.4% in May 2011, from 2.0% in April. Looking through the recent volatility in broad money growth owing to special factors. M3 growth has continued to edge up over recent months. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector continued to strengthen slightly, rising to 2.7% in May after 2.6% in April. Overall, the underlying pace of monetary expansion has continued its gradual recovery. At the same time, monetary liquidity accumulated prior to the period of financial market tensions continues to be ample, with the potential to accommodate price pressures in the euro area. Looking at M3 components, the annual growth rate of M1 moderated further in May, whereas growth in other short-term deposits increased. These developments reflect in part the gradual increase in the remuneration of short-term time and savings deposits over recent months. At the same time, the steep yield curve implies a dampening impact on overall M3 growth, as it reduces the attractiveness of monetary assets compared with more highly remunerated longer-term instruments outside M3. However, recent information suggests that this impact may be waning. On the counterpart side, the annual growth of loans to non-financial corporations and to households remained unchanged from April at 0.9% and 3.4% respectively, confirming the pattern of developments in previous months. The overall size of bank balance sheets has remained broadly unchanged over recent months. It is important that banks continue to expand the provision of credit to the private sector in an environment of increasing demand. To address this challenge, where necessary, it is essential for banks to retain earnings, to turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or to take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. In particular, banks that currently have limited access to market financing urgently need to increase their capital and their efficiency. To sum up, based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to increase the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points, after raising rates by 25 basis points in April 2011 from historically low levels. The further adjustment of the current accommodative monetary policy stance is warranted in the light of upside risks to price stability. A cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis indicates that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is continuing to gradually recover, while monetary liquidity remains ample with the potential to accommodate price pressures in the euro area. All in all, it is essential that the recent price developments do not give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures over the medium term. Our decision will contribute to keeping inflation expectations in the euro area firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to contribute to economic growth in the euro area. At the same time, interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum remain low. Thus, our monetary policy stance remains accommodative, lending support to economic activity and job creation. As expected, recent economic data indicate some deceleration in the pace of economic growth in the second quarter of 2011. While the underlying momentum of economic growth in the euro area continues to be positive, uncertainty remains elevated. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments with respect to upside risks to price stability. Turning to fiscal policies, the current environment is very demanding and requires decisive action. Euro area countries must, as a minimum, comply with their fiscal consolidation commitments for 2011 and beyond, as foreseen under the respective excessive deficit procedures. Adequate and more frontloaded adjustment should ensure that structural fiscal consolidation targets are met, in line with the ECOFIN Council recommendations, and any better than expected economic and fiscal developments should be exploited to achieve faster deficit reduction. The announcement of fully specified consolidation measures for 2012 and beyond is essential to convince the general public and financial market participants that the corrective policies will be sustained and that public debt developments will be put on a sustainable path. At the same time, it remains essential that substantial and comprehensive structural reforms are urgently implemented in the euro area to strengthen competitiveness, flexibility and longer-term growth potential. This is particularly relevant for countries with high fiscal and external deficits or with past losses in competitiveness. We welcome the introduction of the European Semester, including the recent submission of countries' National Reform Programmes that incorporate commitments made under the Euro Plus Pact. We also support the European Council conclusions calling for more ambitious and well-defined reforms that should be frontloaded in order to foster competitiveness. In addition, the removal of labour market rigidities would strongly support the adjustment process. Measures which enhance wage flexibility, such as the elimination of automatic wage indexation, would help to accomplish the necessary adjustment."
Malaysia,2011-07-07,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.00 percent. The global economic recovery in the second quarter of the year was affected by supply disruptions arising from natural disasters and geopolitical developments, the impact of fiscal consolidation measures, the more uncertain conditions in the global financial markets and the higher commodity prices. Going forward, global growth will remain highly uneven across regions, with increased downside risks. For the region, growth is expected to be sustained by robust domestic demand, increased investment activity and intra-regional trade. In the domestic economy, the latest indicators point to a moderation in growth in the second quarter, due primarily to slower external demand, greater than expected disruptions in the global manufacturing supply chain and lower than projected public sector investment. Private consumption and investment have, however, continued to be important drivers of growth. Going forward, growth is expected to improve, underpinned by continued strength in private consumption and private investment. This growth prospect however, could be affected by the heightened external risks. Domestic headline inflation increased to 3.3% in May on account of higher food and fuel prices. Supply factors continue to be the key determinant affecting consumer prices with global commodity and energy prices projected to remain elevated. There are also some signs that domestic demand factors could exert upward pressure on prices in the second half of the year. The MPC's assessment is that the risks to inflation are on the upside. While the outlook for growth remains positive, there are heightened uncertainties arising from global developments that have created higher downside risks to growth. The MPC will assess carefully the evolving economic conditions and to the extent that the growth momentum is sustained, further normalisation of monetary conditions will be considered to safeguard price stability.

Thailand,2011-07-13,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 13 July 2011 Mr. Paiboon Kittisrikangwan. Assistant Governor. Bank of Thailand, announces the outcome of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today, as follows. In the first half of the year, advanced economies expanded more slowly than expected. The US economy was particularly affected by the surge in oil prices and supply disruption in the automobile sector stemming from the Japan crisis which should abate in the latter half of the year. The Japanese economy has been recovering faster than expected. The euro area continued to expand from growth in the core member countries while sovereign debt problems remained a key risk to the economy. Meanwhile the Asian economy continued to grow from both internal demand and exports. However going forward, growth may slow slightly due to tightened monetary policy to contain inflation in many countries. The Thai economy continued to expand in the second quarter primarily from internal and external demand as well as continued fiscal stimulus. The supply disruption in the automobile sector was resolved sooner than expected, paving the way to a manufacturing recovery in the second half of the year. Going forward, consumption and investment will continue to be supported by favorable employment and credit conditions as well as increased fiscal spending. Inflationary pressure remained high due to elevated energy prices and continued upward adjustments in the prices of prepared foods. The extension of price administration and cost-of-living alleviation measures may slow the rise in measured inflation figures, but other measures such as the prospective increases in the minimum wage and fiscal spending amid continued economic growth will likely add to inflationary pressure and may result in heightened inflation expectations. In light of the continued risks to inflation amid robust domestic demand, the MPC deemed it necessary to continue increasing the policy rate to maintain economic stability and anchor inflation expectations. The MPC therefore decided unanimously to raise the policy interest rate by 025 per cent, from 30 to 325 per cent, effective immediately."
Chile,2011-07-14,"Central Bank of Chile Press Release* Santiago, 14 July 2011 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 5.25% (annual). Internationally, economic activity indicators confirm somewhat slower growth in the U.S. and Europe, while concerns about fiscal and financial risks in these economies have intensified, particularly in the Eurozone. The risk premiums of various assets have increased. Globally, medium‐term inflation expectations have moderated. Prospects for interest rate normalization in advanced economies have been postponed again. Meanwhile, several emerging economies have further reduced their monetary impulse. Commodity prices remain high. Domestically, output, demand and labor market figures are progressing with strength, showing signs of moderation in line with the baseline scenario in the last Monetary Policy Report. Annual CPI inflation indicators have hovered around 3%, while measures of core inflation remain bounded. Private inflation expectations show a decline, although some of them remain above the target. The Board estimates that, in the most likely scenario, additional increases in the monetary policy rates will be necessary, the timing of which will depend on the unfolding of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions. Accordingly, it will continue to use its policies with flexibility so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. * The Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2011-07-14,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.25% for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.25% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information, the Committee considers that, while emerging market economies have continued to show favorable performances, the recoveries in major advanced economies including the US have exhibited signs of temporarily faltering. Going forward, the Committee forecasts that the global economy will keep up its pace of recovery; nevertheless, the Committee recognizes the possibility of such factors as the sovereign debt problems in Europe and the heightened volatility of economic activity in major countries posing downside risks to the global economy. For Korea, the Committee judges the economy to have maintained its underlying upward trend, given for instance that exports show robust growth and that domestic demand is increasing modestly. Labor market conditions have also remained on a track of improvement, led by the private sector. Going forward, the Committee anticipates that the domestic economy will keep up this underlying trend, even in the presence of external risks. Consumer price inflation rose to the 4.4% level in June, due mostly to sharp rises in the prices of some agricultural and livestock products. The Committee expects the high level of inflation to continue in the coming months, driven largely by demand-side pressures resulting from the underlying uptrend in economic activity and by inflation expectations. Core inflation meanwhile increased to the 3.7% level, as the prices of processed food products and personal services continued to rise; this uptrend in core inflation is seen persisting for the time being. As for housing prices, those in Seoul and its surrounding areas have weakened, while their pace of increase in the rest of the country has slowed. The rate of increase in leasehold deposits fell in June compared to the previous month, affected mostly by seasonal factors. In the financial markets, the ranges of fluctuation of price variables such as interest rates, stock prices and exchange rates have widened, due mainly to the effects of external risk factors including the sovereign debt problems in Europe. Mortgage lending has posted a steady rise. Looking ahead, the Committee, while taking overall account of financial and economic conditions both at home and abroad, will conduct monetary policy with a greater emphasis on ensuring that the basis for price stability is firmly anchored while the economy continues its sound growth."
Peru,2011-07-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JULY 2011 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 4.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference at 4.25 percent. This pause in the rise of the reference rate takes into account the moderation of inflation and some indicators of activity, as well as increased uncertainty regarding the global economy. Future adjustments in the reference rate will depend on new information on the evolution of inflation and its determinants. Inflation in June showed a rate of 0.1 percent, as a result of which annual inflation recorded a rate of 2.9 percent. Core inflation, which registered 0.32 percent, accumulated an annual growth rate of 3.0 percent. Inflation excluding food and energy showed a rate of 0.26 percent and an accumulated annual rate of 2.0 percent. Some current and advanced indicators of activity show lower growth compared with previous months. On the other hand, indicators of global activity show signs of weakness and increased uncertainty due to the persistence of risks such as those associated with the fiscal situation of some industrialized countries. The Board continues to oversee the projection of inflation and its determinants and stands ready to adopt future adjustments in monetary policy instruments in order to ensure that inflation falls around the target. The Board also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as described below: Overnight deposits: 3.45 percent. Direct repo and rediscount operations: 5.05 percent. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.05 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for August on its session of July 11, 2011."
Georgia,2011-07-20,"20.07.11 The NBG lowers its Policy Rate by 25 basis points to 7.75 percent. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on July 20, 2011 and decided to lower its Main Policy Rate (the refinancing rate) by 25 basis points to 7.75 percent. Consumer Price Index decreased by 4 percent in June, 2011 compared to the previous month. The annual inflation rate stands at 10 percent. The share of food remains high in the annual rate of inflation and amounts to 9.1 percent. The core inflation net of food and energy decreased further to 0.3 percent in the month of June. The inflation in service sector is also low and stands at 1 percent. Reduction in consumer price index was expected, although the recent trend shows faster decrease in inflation than it was expected earlier. According to the existing forecasts, inflation can possibly decrease below the target level at the beginning of next year. Based on the abovementioned. MPC decided it is appropriate to start monetary policy easing on time, in order to maintain the inflation at the target level in the medium term. Lowering the policy rate is the first step towards monetary policy easing. If the reduction in inflation persists due to decreased aggregate demand, the NBG will continue monetary policy easing. Furthermore, the MPC decided to reduce the reserve requirements on long-term borrowings with the intention to stimulate the long-term financing of commercial banks. Borrowings in national currency with the remaining maturity over 1 year and borrowings in foreign currency with the remaining maturity over 2 year will be excluded from reserve requirements. As for the borrowings in foreign currency with maturity from 1 to 2 year, the reserve requirement is reduced to 5 percent. World prices of oil has substantially decreased in recent period. It should be mentioned, that removal of the Russian and Ukrainian bans on exports of wheat in the month of June will contribute to the reduction in prices of wheat products. The influence of exogenous factors, that kept inflation high during the year, is gradually fading away. Consequently, a sharp decrease in inflation is expected in the third quarter. The NBG will closely monitor developments in the economy and financial markets and will act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on August 17, 2011."
Egypt,2011-07-21,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release July 21, 2011 In its meeting held on July 21, 2011, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 825 percent and 975 percent, respectively, and the 7-day repo at 925 percen. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 85 percen. Headline CPI increased by 042 percent (m/m) in June following the 020 percent in May, keeping the annual rate almost unchanged at 1179 percen. On the other hand, core CPI increased by 045 percent in June following the 054 percent in May, while the annual rate inched up to 894 percent from 881 percent recorded the previous mont. The latest monthly developments in both headline and core have been mainly driven by sporadic increases in the prices of food items, largely on the back of supply bottlenecks and distortions in the distribution channel. The continuation of these market imperfections, in addition, to an unanticipated rebound in international food prices pose upside risks to the inflation outloo. Meanwhile real GDP contracted by 42 percent in 2010/2011 Q3 which marks the first negative year-on-year growth rate since the release of quarterly GDP data in 2001/200. It is important to note that while a marked decline in economic activity was expected, the magnitude is larger than anticipated at the outset of the revolutio. This came on the back of significant declines in the tourism, manufacturing and construction sector. In the meantime, given the increased uncertainty that faced market participants early this year, investment witnessed a significant annual retrenchment of 26 percent in the quarter ending March 201. Looking ahead, the current political transformation may continue to have ramifications on both consumption as well as investment decisions, adversely weighing on key sectors within the econom. Moreover there are concerns related to the global recovery on the back of renewed worries regarding fiscal challenges facing the Euro Are. These factors, combined, pose downside risks to domestic GDP going forwar. Against the above background, the slowdown in economic growth should limit upside risks to the inflation outloo. Given the balance of risks on the inflation and GDP outlooks and the increased uncertainty at this juncture, the MPC judges that the current key CBE rates are appropriat. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter.

Turkiye,2011-07-21,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels: a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) at 6.25 percent, b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 1.50 percent, lending rate at 9 percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 8 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, lending rate at 12 percent. Recent data releases are broadly consistent with the outlook presented in the April Inflation Report. Private consumption shows signs of slowdown, investment growth is moderating, and external demand outlook remains weak. Employment conditions continue to improve with unemployment rates back to the pre-crisis levels. Meanwhile, unit labor costs decline due to strong productivity gains, and low levels of capacity utilization rates persist due to weak external demand. Although core inflation is likely display some upward movement over the short term, the increase is expected to be limited due to the slowdown in economic activity. The recent measures taken by the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency and the tight fiscal stance support the policy mix implemented by the Central Bank, and thus contribute to the rebalancing of domestic and external demand. The Committee has indicated that, due to the measures taken so far, the domestic demand is now under control and reiterated that the current account balance will start to improve in the final quarter of the year. In light of these assessments, combined with the heightened uncertainty regarding the global economy and the slowdown in domestic economic activity, the Committee has decided to maintain the current policy mix. The Committee has also stated that it would be appropriate to narrow the interest corridor gradually should the sovereign debt problems regarding some European economies and the concerns on global growth continue to have adverse impact on the risk appetite. The Committee has also stated that all policy instruments may be eased should global economic problems intensify and lead to a contraction in domestic economic activity. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
South Africa,2011-07-21,"Issued by Gill Marcus. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank. Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the global economic outlook has deteriorated. Events in the eurozone appear to have entered a new phase, with the focus moving from the peripheral countries to some of the larger economies in the region. The global systemic risks posed by any failure to overcome the sovereign debt crisis are enormous, and are exacerbated by the potential failure to resolve the debt ceiling crisis in the United States. These events are taking place against the backdrop of a slowdown in growth in many of the advanced economies. The domestic economic recovery has continued, but in a hesitant manner. The strong performance of the economy in the first quarter of the year is unlikely to have been repeated in the second quarter, and growth prospects will also be dependent on global developments. Domestic inflation has been increasing in line with expectations, driven mainly by cost push pressures, but more broad-based pricing pressures are beginning to emerge. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas increased to 5,0 per cent in June 2011, from 4,6 per cent in May. As was the case in the previous few months, the main contributions to the inflation outcome came from food, housing and utilities, and transport categories which together accounted for 3,6 percentage points of the 5,0 per cent outcome in June. Food price inflation continued its marked upward trend, measuring 7,3 per cent in June, from 6,3 per cent in May. Petrol and electricity prices increased at rates of 21,4 per cent and 19,0 per cent respectively in June. Administered price inflation excluding petrol was unchanged in June at 9,3 per cent. The underlying inflation trends have remained relatively moderate. In May and June. CPI excluding food and petrol measured 3,7 per cent and 3,9 per cent respectively, while CPI excluding food, petrol and electricity measured 3,2 per cent and 3,5 per cent in these months. Year-on-year producer price inflation has displayed some volatility in recent months, partly a result of commodity price fluctuations. Producer prices increased by 6,6 per cent and 6,9 per cent in April and May, compared with 7,3 per cent in March. Price increases in electricity and products of petroleum and coal were major contributors to the PPI outcome, but there were also significant increases in food prices which had until recently remained subdued. Agricultural prices increased by 6,8 per cent in May, from 2,1 per cent in April, while manufactured food prices increased at rates of 3,4 per cent and 4,8 per cent in April and May respectively. The inflation forecast of the Bank has shown a slight near-term deterioration since the previous meeting of the MPC. Inflation is now expected to breach marginally the upper end of the target range in the final quarter of 2011, and to average 6,3 per cent in the first quarter of 2012. Thereafter it is expected to remain at the upper end of the target range for the next two quarters, before declining somewhat in the final quarter of the year. The forecast period has been extended to the end of 2013 and inflation is expected to decline gradually during the year, to measure 5,6 per cent in the final quarter of 2013. The Bank's forecast of core inflation shows a moderately rising trend, peaking at around 5 per cent in the second quarter of 2012. Inflation expectations for 2011 as reflected in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research (BER) at Stellenbosch University had been declining for six consecutive quarters, but remained unchanged in the second quarter of 2011. Expectations for 2012 increased marginally, but remained within the target range, and declined for 2013. The average inflation expectation for the three main categories of respondents was 5,3 per cent for 2011 and 5,8 per cent for the next two years. Inflation expectations as measured by the Reuters survey of financial analysts showed very little change when compared to the forecasts at the time of the previous MPC meeting, with inflation expected to remain on average within the upper end of target range until the end of 2013. Inflation expectations as reflected in the break-even inflation rates of the inflation-linked bonds moderated slightly since the previous meeting. The MPC assesses the risks to the global economic environment to be on the downside, and continued weakness in the US and UK economies has extended the likely duration of monetary accommodation, particularly in the face of declining fiscal stimuli. Risks relating to debt sustainability in peripheral Europe have intensified, with further ratings downgrades to some countries. The focus has also moved beyond the periphery to larger countries such as Spain and Italy. As long as the sovereign debt crisis is unresolved, confidence will not be restored, and periodic bouts of risk aversion can be expected to contribute to a high degree of volatility in financial markets. There are concerns that a disorderly write-down of this debt could have systemic implications because of the high exposure of European banks to the debt of these countries. By contrast, there are encouraging trends in other parts of the world. The reconstruction of the Japanese economy in the wake of the natural disasters has begun to have some positive impact on that country's growth rate. Growth in emerging markets has generally remained strong, and fears of a marked slowdown in Chinese growth have been allayed somewhat by a robust second quarter growth performance. Global inflation has been driven primarily by food and oil price developments. There are, however, some indications that these price pressures may have peaked. Both the IMF and Food and Agricultural Organisation food price indices show a flattening out since the beginning of the year. International oil prices have contributed to, and in turn have also been constrained by the slowdown in global growth. The bouts of risk aversion relating to developments in the euro area have impacted on the volatility of the rand exchange rate. Since the previous MPC meeting, the rand has fluctuated within a range of R6,67 and R7,02 against the US dollar. The current level of the rand exchange rate against both the dollar and the euro is more or less unchanged since the previous MPC meeting. In recent months the rand has also been affected by a number of actual and expected direct investment transactions, as well as by net purchases of bonds and equities by non-residents totaling around R32,6 billion since the beginning of May. Net bond purchases by non-residents amounted to R34,1 billion, while net sales of equities amounted to R1,5 billion. From a macroeconomic perspective, the rand has remained relatively strong despite heightened global risk aversion, and despite continued purchases of foreign exchange by the Bank with the support of the National Treasury. Between September 2009 and August 2010, the rand dollar exchange rate fluctuated in the range of around R7,40 to R7,80. Since September of 2010, the rand has generally traded in the range of around R6,60 to R7,00, apart from a short period in early 2011 when it breached the R7,20 level. The domestic economic recovery remains fragile. Annualised GDP growth in the first quarter of 2011 measured 4,8 per cent, driven primarily by a 14,5 per cent growth in the manufacturing sector. This performance is not expected to be sustained in the second quarter: the monthly data for manufacturing sector output in April and May suggest that unless there is a major upside surprise in June, the positive contribution of the sector to second quarter growth is likely to be minimal. The Kagiso PMI, while still indicating positive growth in the sector, has declined for three consecutive months. Some of the slowdown in manufacturing can be ascribed to temporary factors such as the impact of the earthquake in Japan on the global motor industry supply chain. The outlook for the sector will also be influenced by developments in Europe, which is a significant market for South African manufactured exports. Growth in the physical volume of mining production was weak in April and May. Growth in gross fixed capital formation improved in the first quarter of 2011 to register an annualised growth rate of 3,1 per cent. This was mainly due to the higher levels of investment by public corporations. Growth in private sector fixed capital formation, while rising, was still subdued at 2,7 per cent. Despite the expected growth slowdown in the second quarter, the forecast of the Bank for GDP growth in 2011 and 2012 remains unchanged at 3,7 per cent and 3,9 per cent respectively, while growth in 2013 is expected to average 4,4 per cent. With a potential output growth rate of around 3,5 per cent, the estimates of the Bank show that the output gap, although closing, is still negative at around 2,5 per cent. This is consistent with the fact that the levels of output in both the manufacturing and mining sectors are still below pre-crisis levels, as is the level of capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector. Business confidence, as reflected in the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index, reversed its positive trend when it declined to below the neutral 50 level in the second quarter of 2011. Confidence in the construction sector remains at an extremely low level, and the real value of new building plans passed declined further in April. Household consumption expenditure, which grew at an annualised rate of 5,2 per cent in the first quarter of 2011, has been the main driver of the domestic growth recovery. There are indications that this growth may have moderated in the second quarter. The robust growth in real retail sales in April was more than offset in May when a month-on-month decline of 4,7 per cent was measured, while the year-on-year growth rate was zero. New vehicle sales increased by 12,6 per cent year-on-year, but declined by 4 per cent in the second quarter compared with the previous quarter. The FNB/BER Consumer Confidence Index increased marginally in the second quarter of 2011, but remains below levels reached in 2010. The MPC expects household consumption expenditure to be constrained by a number of factors, including subdued credit market conditions, high levels of household debt, negative wealth effects, and persistently high rates of unemployment. Growth in total loans and advances extended by banks to the private sector remain relatively subdued, and grew at a year-on-year rate of 5,5 per cent in May, compared with 6,0 per cent in April. Growth in “other loans and advances” , particularly general loans, was the major driver, as growth in mortgage loans –the largest category of loans - was restrained at around 3 per cent, in line with the weak housing market. The subdued state of the credit markets reflects in part the high levels of consumer indebtedness, which measured 77 per cent of personal disposable income in the first quarter of 2011. The ratio of impaired advances to gross loans and advances has remained at elevated levels for some time but declined marginally to 5,73 per cent in May. Wealth effects have been negatively affected by the subdued housing market. The various house price indices indicate that house prices are falling in real terms, although there appears to be some positive nominal growth. While the JSE Limited is at relatively high levels, it is vulnerable to correction in the event of a significant global slowdown. Although household net wealth to disposable income has recovered somewhat since the recession, it is still below the peak reached in 2007. Employment trends have been improving slowly. According to the Quarterly Employment Survey of Statistics South Africa, formal non-agricultural employment increased by 2,6 per cent in the first quarter of 2011, compared with the first quarter of 2010. This represented an increase of 212,000 jobs, just over half the number of formal sector jobs lost during the crisis. The majority of jobs created have been in the public sector and the recovery in employment in the private sector remains slow. Wage settlement rates have been declining, with Andrew Levy Employment Publications reporting an average overall wage settlement rate in collective bargaining agreements of 7,5 per cent in the first half of 2011, compared with 8,2 per cent in 2010 as a whole. Similarly, nominal unit labour costs, which account for productivity changes, moderated to 5,2 per cent in the first quarter of 2011, from 7,7 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2010. However, given that most of the wage negotiations take place in the second half of the year, and that some of the recent high profile settlements appear to have reversed the moderating trend, this positive outcome could change. Should these higher trends set a precedent for other wage settlements, this could represent a significant upside risk to the inflation outlook. The high trends in executive remuneration increases are also cause for concern. Food and oil price developments remain the major risks to the inflation outlook. As noted above, international food prices appear to have levelled out. Domestic food price inflation has lagged global trends, and further increases can be expected in the near term. However, these increases could be constrained should the favourable global developments persist. The price of Brent crude oil, currently at around US$117 per barrel, is at levels similar to those prevailing at the time of the previous meeting of the MPC. The price has experienced some volatility in recent weeks, particularly following the release of oil stocks by the International Energy Agency in June, when the price declined to US$106 per barrel. Although supply conditions are expected to remain tight, further upside potential is likely to be constrained by the uncertain global growth outlook. These developments allowed for a 31 cent per litre reduction in domestic petrol prices in July, following a 2 cent per litre decline in June. However an increase is expected in August. The view of the MPC continues to be that the underlying inflation pressures are mainly of a cost push nature, notwithstanding signs of a possible moderate increase in underlying inflation. Despite the upside risks posed by cost push factors, the MPC sees a number of downside risks to the inflation outlook, with the risks being seen to be delicately balanced. These risks include the continued fragile nature of the domestic recovery, as well as risks posed by the ramifications of a possible disorderly debt default in the eurozone. It is however recognised that should there be unexpectedly high inflation outcomes, particularly with respect to underlying inflation trends, this could impact negatively on inflation expectations, which to date appear to be relatively well anchored. For this reason the MPC is not complacent and will remain vigilant and continue to monitor closely any indications of second round effects on inflation emanating from these cost pressures as well as the changing risk profile of the inflation outlook. In light of the above, the MPC has decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 5,5 per cent per annum, for the time being. The MPC will not hesitate to respond timeously to signs that threaten to move inflation out of the target range on a sustained basis."
Israel,2011-07-25,"25.07.2011 The Bank of Israel leaves the interest rate for August 2011 unchanged at 3.25 percent To view this press release as a WORD file - Click here Background conditions Inflation data:The inflation rate over the last 12 months was 4.1 percent, above the upper limit of the target inflation range (of 1-3 percent a year). The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.4 percent inJune, in line with the forecasts and at the upper limit of the seasonal path consistent with achieving the inflation target. The June index was affected, as was the May index, by the continued increase in the housing and food components of the index. The inflation rate, as measured by the seasonally adjusted index, was slower in the last four months than in the preceding months. Inflation and interest rate forecasts:Inflation expectations of forecasters for the next twelve months remained unchanged this month at 2.9 percent, slightly below the upper limit of the target range. Inflation expectations as calculated from the capital market also remained stable this month at an average of 3 percent. Based on the Telbor (Tel Aviv Inter-Bank Offered Rate) market, the Bank of Israel interest rate one year from now is expected to be 4 percent, and the average of forecasters' predictions is that it will be 4.3 percent. Most forecasters expect the Bank of Israel to leave the interest rate for August unchanged. Real economic activity:Economic indicators that became available this month show that economic activity continued to expand, albeit more slowly than in the first quarter. The slowdown in the rate of growth stems mainly from moderation in the activity of the exporting industries. Goods exports (excluding diamonds, ships and aircraft, seasonally adjusted) declined by 2.4 percent, quarterly rate, in the second quarter compared with the first. Imports (excluding diamonds, ships and aircraft, seasonally adjusted) grew at a quarterly rate of 10.3 percent in the second quarter. The Bank ofIsrael Companies Survey for the second quarter and the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of business trends for June both report expectations of continued expansion of activity. Consumer confidence indices remained unchanged at a relatively high level, but is seems that economic developments around the world and geopolitical developments in Israel are having a negative effect on the expectations component of these indices. The composite state-of-the-economy index for June increased by 0.2 percent, continuing the relatively modest increases in the last few months. In the second quarter the index rose by 0.7 percent, compared with an increase of 1.4 percent in the first quarter. The Bank of Israel staff forecast is that inflation in the next twelve months will be 2.9 percent, with the interest rate increasing to an average of 3.4 percent in the third quarter of 2011 and to about 4 percent in a year's time. This is against the background of a 0.2 percentage point reduction in the forecast rise in the interest rate in the G 4 countries, both one quarter hence and one year hence, and a reduction of 0.3 percentage points in the GDP growth forecast of those countries one quarter ahead, and by 0.1 percentage points one year ahead. The Research Department emphasizedthe main risks facing Israel's economy: the realization of the pessimisticassessments regarding the global economic recovery and its expected impacton demand for Israel's exports; and negative geopolitical developments. The labor market and wages: Labor market data indicate a continued improvement in employment. The trend figure for May shows 5.7 percent unemployment in the civilian workforce. The number of employee posts (seasonally adjusted) increased by 0.3 percent in February-April compared with the previous three months. The number of vacancies increased by 8 percent in the second quarter--after remaining stable in the first quarter--although in June the seasonally adjusted figure showed a decrease. The nominal wage increased in February-April by 1.1 percent compared with the level in the previous three months, while thereal wage remained unchanged (three-monthly rates, seasonally adjusted). Health tax receipts in June, which provide an indication of wage payments inthat month, were 7.6 percent higher, in nominal terms, than in June 2010 (excluding the effect of legislative changes). The minimum monthly wage was increased from NIS 3,900 to NIS 4,100 at the beginning of July. Budget data: Tax revenues in January-June were 7.1 percent higher, in real terms, than in the corresponding period last year, and NIS 0.3 billion higher than the seasonal path of the budget forecast. The government's domestic activity in the first half of this year (excluding credit) resulted in a cumulative surplus of 0.3 percent of GDP, compared with a deficit of 1.1 percent of GDP in the corresponding period of 2010. The foreign exchange market: From the previous monetary policy discussion held on June 26, through July 22, the shekel appreciated by 1.6 percent against the dollar, lower than the appreciation of the main currencies against the dollar. Against the euro the shekel strengthened by about 0.3 percent. In terms of the nominal effective exchange rate the shekel strengthened by about 0.6 percent. The capital and money markets: Between the monetary policy discussions of June 26 and July 22, most Tel Aviv Stock Exchange share price indices rose, in line with the general trend in stock markets abroad, but with lower volatility. The Tel Aviv 100 Index rose by 5.3 percent. Yields on local currency government bonds declined by 4-20 basis points (b.p.), mainly in the medium term. Yields on CPI-indexed government bonds showed a sharper drop of 20-35 b.p., with the curve becoming steeper. The yield gap between Israeli unindexed 10-year government bonds and US 10-year Treasury notes contracted during the period surveyed, and at the end of the period stood at 218 b.p. (down from 235 b.p. at the beginning of the period). Makam yields edged down by 2-5 b.p., with some slight steepeningof the curve. New corporate bond issues totaled a gross NIS 5.5 billion inJune, bringing the year to date total to about NIS 25 billion, similar to the amount in the corresponding period in 2010. The yield spread between the Tel-Bond 40 and government bonds widened by 14 b.p. to 2 percent. Over the period as a whole. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spread declined, and at the end of the period was 138 b.p. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in June the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 8.4 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 9.5 percent. Developments in the market for housing credit: The balance of outstanding credit to the business sector increased in May by 0.4 percent, to NIS 750 billion. Outstanding credit to households increased by 1.5 percent in May, to NIS 351 billion. Of the credit to households, outstanding housing credit rose 14.4 percent in the twelve months ending in May, to NIS 246 billion, compared with a 14.1 percent increase in the twelve months to April. There was a decline in new mortgages granted in June, and as a result, for the first time since July 2009, total mortgages extended in the previous twelve months declined, by 1.4 percent. This contrasts with the usual summer trend of an increase in mortgages in the summer months. The share of new mortgages granted in June that were not indexed to the CPI, at variable interest rates, fell significantly, to 32 percent, down from 45 percent in May. The reduction in this share was due among other things to a directive issued by the Supervisor of Banks regarding the maximum permitted share of a housing loan at a floating interest rate that went into effect on May 5, 2011; the directive is expected to continue to have an effect in the future. Interest rates on new CPI-indexed and unindexed variable-interest mortgages increased in June, while interest rates on new CPI-indexed mortgages fixed interest were unchanged. The housing market: The supply of houses continues to increase, and in the twelve months to April building starts totaled 41,583, compared with 37,489 starts in the twelve months to April 2010--an 11 percent increase. Completions totaled 33,841 in the twelve months to April, compared with 31,374 in the twelve months to April 2010--a 7.9 percent increase. Since the beginning of the year there has been a marked moderation in the sale of new houses, with a rise in the number of houses for sale. House prices--which are presented in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of house prices but are not included in theCPI--increased in April-May at a rate of 0.7 percent a month, following their increase of 1.5 percent a month in March-April. The annual rate of increase in house prices declined slightly, but continues to be high, and in the twelve months that ended in May, house prices increased by 13.7 percent; compared with a 14.5 percent increase in the previous month's figure. The housing index, which is based mainly on renewed rental contracts and which is included in the CPI, continued to increase, rising by 0.5 percent in June, bringing the increase in the last twelvemonths to 6.2 percent. The effect of the increase in the interest rate, measures introduced by the Bank of Israel affecting mortgages, and steps taken by the Ministry of Finance in real estate taxation, together with the continued increase in the number of building starts, are expected to be reflected in house prices in the course of the coming year. The global economy: The debt crisis in Europe spread to major eurozone countries, especially Italy. The credit rating companies lowered the ratings of Greece. Ireland and Portugal severely, and lowered the rating outlook of Italy and Spain. However, in the last few days, agreement was reached on a European aid program for Greece (which can also help other countries), a program that was better than expected, and thus calmed the markets somewhat. In the US too the debt continues to be headline news as a result of the inability to reach an agreement about increasing the debt ceiling andits attendant cuts. This has led to threats by the rating companies to lower the US credit rating in the near future. Most macroeconomic data published this month indicate weakness, as a result of which many investment houses reduced their annual growth forecasts, with expectations of some recoveryin the second half of the year. Inflation remained high world wide, drivenby the steep increase in commodity and energy prices in the last few months. This led to increases in interest rates in the rapidly growing emerging market economies, and even in Europe. The Fed, however, which focuses on the core index, assessed that this was a temporary development, and that inflation would decline again and would not be reflected in the core index. At the same time, in light of the complex reality of inflation on one side andconcern over growth on the other, the general assessment is that increasesin the interest rate will be more moderate than expected in the last few months. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to leave the interest rate for August at 3.25 percent is consistent with the process of returning the interest rate to a more normal range intended to position inflation firmly within the target range, and to support further growth, while maintaining financial stability. The rate of increase in the interest rate is not pre-determined, but is set in accordance with the inflation environment, economic growth in Israel and globally, the monetary policies of the leading central banks, and developments in theexchange rates of the shekel. At the current level of the interest rate, monetary policy continues to be expansionary. Inflation over the previous twelve months, 4.2 percent, continues to be high. However, the seasonally adjusted CPI inflation rates in the last four months are in line with the target inflation range. Forecasters' inflation expectations for the next twelve months remained steady at slightly below the upper limit of the target range. Forecasters' inflation expectations and those derived from the capital market go together with the assessment that theBank of Israel will continue to increase the interest rate, but at a slower pace than in the first half of the year. Most economic indicators published this month support the assessment that the rate ofgrowth in economic activity in Israel moderated in the second quarter primarily as a result of the slower expansion of goods exports. In addition, developments in debt crises, the weakness of the US economy, and geopoliticalrisks, increase uncertainty about the pace of economic growth. The annual rate of increase in house prices continues to be high--in the twelve months to May house prices increased by 13.7 percent, slightly below the rate to the previous month. With that, the effect of interest rate increases, steps by the Bank of Israel in the mortgage market, and steps bythe Ministry of Finance regarding real estate taxation, together with the continued increase in building starts, are expected to affect housing prices during the coming year, although it is too early at this stage to see clear evidence of their effect on house prices in the data currently available. Central bank interest rates in the major advanced economies are still low, and are expected to remain so for a long time. Concern of a slowdown in US growth and the worsening of the debt crises in Europe led to expectations of a slowdown in the pace of interest rate increases in the US and Europe. In the first half of the year the Bank of Israel raised the interest rate markedly. At the same time, steps were taken by the Bank of Israel and the Ministry of Finance in the housing market. In addition, the shekel appreciated in the last few months and there was a decline in commodity prices. The impact on inflation of these developments is expected to continue to be felt in the future. In light of these issues, and the marked increase of risks in the global economy, it was decided this month to leave the interest rate at its current level. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in Israel's economy and the global economy and in the financial markets. The Bank will usethe instruments available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, including keeping a close watch on developmentsin the assets market, and especially in the housing market. The minutes of the discussions prior to the above interest rate decision will be published on August 8, 2011. The decision regarding the interest rate for September 2011 will bepublished at 17:30 on Monday. August 29, 2011. 25.07.2011 The Bank of Israel leaves the interest rate for August 2011 unchanged at 3.25 percent.

Nigeria,2011-07-25,"Central Bank of Nigeria Communique No. 77 of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting. July 25  26, 2011 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on 25th and 26th July, 2011 to review domestic economic conditions during the first half of 2011 and the challenges facing the Nigerian economy against the backdrop of developments in the international economic and financial environment in order to chart the course of monetary policy in the second half of the year. On the global scene, the Committee noted with concern the enormity of the challenges being faced by the US and euro zone countries as well as the major emerging market economies such as the fiscal position of Brazil, possible real estate bubbles in China and seemingly intractable inflation in India, which may impact the Nigerian economy adversely through several channels. The economic slowdown and the commodity price inflation in the international economy as well as the rapid increase in prices of some asset classes in some emerging market economies remain serious threats to the global economic recovery. There are continuing widespread threats of inflationary pressures fuelled by the sustained high energy, commodity and food prices in the global economy. Headline inflation in many of the major emerging market economies is now exceeding 6 per cent and is running close to or above central banks' targets in a number of other larger economies. The performance of the global financial markets was mixed. Many national currencies in Africa depreciated against the US dollar while in many emerging markets, currencies appreciated vis-à-vis the US dollar during the first half of 2011. Furthermore most stock markets around the world showed weak recovery during the period due to high inflation, weakening consumer confidence and government finances, particularly in the US and euro zone. The unfolding debt crises in the European periphery could damage confidence and output in the near-term while the US debt and unemployment situation pose grave danger to the international economy given the reserve currency role of the US dollar and the size of the US economy. It is not unlikely that the US will lose its AAA rating and actual default is possible unless a deal can be worked out between the White house and the Congress. On the domestic scene, the Committee noted that inflationary pressures which were traceable to the high expenditure levels associated with the April 2011 general elections as well as the effects of rising international energy, commodity and food prices had moderated by June 2011. This development was due in part to the tight monetary policy stance of the Bank since September of 2010. However the Committee observed that the inflation outlook appears uncertain 1 owing to the expected implementation of the new national minimum wage policy and the imminent deregulation of petroleum prices. Significant injection of liquidity from FAAC in the third quarter coupled with the impact of AMCON recapitalizing intervened banks to the tune of N16 trillion will both add to inflationary pressures. The Committee welcomed the favorable growth projections but cautioned that the current security challenges, infrastructural bottlenecks and the uncertainty in the international economy as well as fiscal developments could undermine investors' confidence and output growth in the near term. The Committee expressed serious concerns about the continued sluggish growth of credit to the private sector during the first half of the year which is attributed, among other factors, to the heightened credit risk in the real economy as a result of the persisting structural problems occasioned by the inadequate power supply and critical infrastructure deficit. It also observed that the lending rates of deposit money banks (DMBs) remained relatively high. Key Domestic Macroeconomic and Financial Developments Domestic Output: Provisional data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) indicate that real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 664 per cent in the first quarter of 2011 down from the 736 per cent in the corresponding period of 2010. The non-oil sector remained the major driver of growth recording 865 per cent growth rate in the first quarter of 2011. Overall GDP growth rate was projected at 780 per cent for 2011, which the Committee believed, is still reasonably robust by major emerging market standards, but which may be placed at risk in the event of crystallization of various negative developments in the developed and emerging markets. Domestic Prices: Inflationary pressures remained elevated during the first quarter of 2011 but moderated towards the end of the second quarter. The year-on-year headline inflation rate, declined from 128 per cent in March and 124 per cent in May 2011 to 102 per cent in June 2011. The downward movement in inflation in June 2011 was due to the moderation in both food and core inflation. Food inflation fell for the first time since February 2008 to below 10 per cent. It declined from 136 per cent in March and 122 per cent in May to 92 per cent in June 2011. Core inflation decreased from 128 per cent in March and 130 per cent in May 2 to 115 per cent in June 2011. Staff projections indicate that both headline and food inflation would continue to moderate in the second half of the year. However core inflation is projected to increase during the same period driven mainly by cost of energy, power and imports. Monetary Credit and Financial Market Developments: Broad money (M2) grew by 566 per cent in June 2011 over the end-December 2010 level, which when annualized, translated to a growth rate of 1132 per cent. Aggregate domestic credit (net) grew by 230 per cent in June 2011 over the 2010 December level which annualized to a growth rate of 460 per cent. The sluggish growth in aggregate credit was mainly due to the weak expansion in private sector credit which grew marginally by 145 per cent or 29 per cent on an annualized basis. Interest rates in all segments of the interbank money market moved up in response to the upward review of the MPR for most part of the period since the last meeting of the MPC. The weighted inter-bank call rate, which stood at 973 per cent prior to the last MPC meeting rose steadily, peaking at 1364 per cent on June 13, 2011 while the OBB rate also trended upward reflecting the increase in the MPR. Developments in the interest rate structure indicated that retail lending rates remained relatively high. The average maximum lending rate declined to 2202 per cent in June 2011 from 2219 per cent in May 2011 while the average prime lending rate declined to 1576 per cent from 1581 per cent during the same period. Thus the spread between the average maximum lending rate and the consolidated deposit rate narrowed marginally to 1922 per cent in June 2011 from 1940 per cent in May 2011. Stock market performance remained bearish during the review period as the All- Share Index (ASI) decreased by 34 per cent between March 31, 2011 and July 21, 2011. Market Capitalization (MC) also declined by 34 per cent during the same period. The Committee noted that the Nigerian stock market performance is consistent with the stock market performances around the rest of the world, and reflects a growing risk aversion on the part of portfolio investors as well as domestic concerns on the ongoing banking sector resolution. This will be addressed later in this communique. External Sector Developments At the wDAS, the exchange rate closed at N15161 (including the 1% commission) on 22nd July, 2011, representing an appreciation of 214 per cent over the N15491/US$ on 23rd May, 2011. The Inter-bank selling rate opened at N15667/US$ on 23rd May, 2011 and closed at N15233 on 22nd July, 2011, 3 representing an appreciation of 277 per cent. At the BDC segment of the market, the exchange rate closed at N16600/US$ on 22nd July, 2011, representing a depreciation of 440 per cent over the opening rate of N15900/US$ on 23rd May, 2011. In the light of this, the Committee noted that the premium between the rates at the wDAS and the interbank rate narrowed towards the end of the review period, while that between the wDAS and the BDCs widened which is not unconnected with the measures taken to limit sales to BDCs. However, while strengthening of currency is an important factor in mitigating inflationary pressures, the spread may lead to arbitrage by players and fuel unhealthy speculation. The Committee noted the modest accretion to external reserves in recent months, but remained concerned about the sustained low level of accretion in the face of higher oil output, higher oil exports volume and higher oil prices. Gross external reserves stood at US$3373 billion as at 21st July, 2011, representing an increase of US$184 billion or 577 per cent over the level attained on 30th June, 2011. Given that the current oil price level may not be sustained in the event of a slowdown in global economic recovery, the Committee reiterated the need for pursuing policies to foster macro-economic stability, economic diversification as well as encouraging foreign capital inflows. The Committee commended the CBN for the limit placed on the foreign exchange sales to the BDCs. However, in view of the widening premium between the wDAS and BDC rates, the Committee encouraged the CBN to review the existing limit. The decision and communication in this regard will be made by the Bank. With regard to banking system stability, the Committee was informed that 3 of the intervened banks had signed Transaction Implementation Agreements (TIAs) and 3 more are expected to sign TIAs within the next two to three weeks. The remaining two are already the subject of interest from prospective core investors, and the CBN is closely monitoring developments. It is expected that all the intervened banks would be fully re-capitalized by 30th September, 2011. Committee's Considerations The Committee recognized the decline in inflation rate and the slow down in GDP growth rate as well as credit to private sector which would ordinarily advice maintaining rates at current levels. However the consensus of the Committee is that the outlook is uncertain due to dark clouds on the International horizon and the rising spectra of a structural fiscal deficit. In view of the need to proactively address the impact of huge injections of liquidity in the third quarter to correct the negative real interest rate situation in the market and 4 attract foreign capital inflows to build up reserves to protect the economy against possible external shocks, the Committee decided as follows: Decisions: 1. To tighten monetary policy by a majority decision of 10 to 2. To raise the MPR by 75 basis points from 80 per cent to 875 per cent by a majority vote of 8 members in its favour, 1 member favoured 50 basis- point increase while 3 members voted for holding the MPR at 80 per cent. To maintain the corridor at +/- 200 basis points around the MPR. Sanusi Lamido Sanusi. CON Governor Central Bank of Nigeria July 26, 2011 5."
Hungary,2011-07-26,"At its meeting on 26 July 2011, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at 6.00%. In the Council's judgement, the Hungarian economy is likely to continue to pick up slowly over the next two years; however, the level of output will remain below its potential throughout the period. Domestic demand is expected to recover only gradually. Consequently, inflation may fall back to 3% by the end of 2012 even without policy tightening, despite the cost shocks hitting the economy. The decline in consumer prices was in line with the monetary Council's previous expectations. Falling unprocessed food prices had a dampening influence on overall consumer price inflation; however, core inflation continued to rise as a result of higher commodity prices. The restraining effect on price and wage-setting of the persistent weakness in domestic demand and high unemployment, in addition to moderate movements in administered prices, is likely to be a key determinant of inflation as the effects of the cost shocks wear off. It may be necessary to maintain interest rates at their current level over a sustained period in order to meet the target for CPI inflation by the end of 2012. External demand is expected to remain the main driver of Hungarian economic growth in the short term, with domestic demand growth likely to recover only slowly. The pace of global economic activity is expected to ease slightly, but this effect on Hungarian exports may be offset by the implementation of large-scale investment projects, mainly in the car industry. The trade surplus is likely to remain high, reflecting strong export growth and weak imports due to subdued domestic demand. The latest data on household consumption show little sign of a pick-up. Disbursements of real returns on private pension funds are likely to provide a temporary boost to consumption. However, the recent appreciation of the Swiss franc may lead to an increase in monthly instalments on existing household debt. If the strength of the franc were to persist, it would take longer for households to adjust their balance sheets, which may act as a drag on consumption growth. This in turn may result in lower inflation. The generalised increase in risk aversion due to the escalation of the euro-area sovereign debt crisis also had an impact on countries of the CEE region, including Hungary. The deepening of the crisis could lead to persistently high risk aversion, which would be reflected in increased yields on government securities and interbank rates, as well as in a depreciation of the forint against the currencies of developed countries. In addition, a deepening of the crisis could cause a slowdown in euro-area activity, which would negatively affect the outlook for Hungarian economic growth through lower external demand. The Monetary Council has decided to leave interest rates unchanged in light of the above considerations. In terms of the Council's future interest rate policy, a prolongation of the euro-area debt crisis represents the most important source of risk. Over the period ahead, the Council's interest rate decisions may be influenced by the extent to which measures to solve the euro-area debt crisis will prove successful and by expected developments in domestic inflation."
India,2011-07-26,"First Quarter Review of Monetary Policy 2011-12: Press Statement by Dr.D. Subbarao. Governor ""First of all, on behalf of the Reserve Bank of India. I want to welcome all of you to this First Quarter Review of Monetary Policy for 2011-12. A short while ago, we put out the monetary policy measures accompanying this review. To recap, based on an assessment of the current macroeconomic situation, we have decided to: increase the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 50 basis points. The repo rate will accordingly move up from 7.5 per cent to 8.0 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF, determined with a spread of 100 basis point below the repo rate, automatically adjusts to 7.0 per cent. Similarly, the Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) rate, determined with a spread of 100 bps above the repo rate, stands recalibrated at 9.0 per cent. These changes have come into effect immediately after the announcement. Considerations Behind the Policy Move 5. This policy decision has been informed by two broad considerations. First, demand pressures have remained strong. As we indicated in our May 3 Policy Statement, inflation was expected to remain elevated in the first half of 2011-12. Actual inflation so far has been even higher than expected. In particular, non-food manufactured product inflation has been significantly higher than the average rate of 4 per cent over the last six years. Crude oil prices remain volatile and are a major risk factor. The recent increase in domestic administered fuel prices and the minimum support price for certain food items will also keep inflation under pressure. The second consideration that shaped the policy decision is that there are signs that growth is beginning to moderate, particularly in respect of some interest rate sensitive sectors. However, there is no evidence, as yet, of a sharp or broad-based slowdown. Several indicators such as exports and imports, indirect tax collections, corporate sales and earnings and demand for bank credit suggest that demand is moderating, but only gradually. Although the impact of past monetary policy actions is still getting transmitted, considering the overall growth-inflation scenario, we determined that it is necessary to persevere with the anti-inflationary stance.2 Monetary Policy Stance 9. Let me now spell out the three broad contours of our monetary policy stance. These are: to maintain an interest rate environment that moderates inflation and anchors inflation expectations; to manage the risk of growth falling significantly below trend; and, finally, to manage liquidity to ensure that monetary transmission remains effective, without exerting undue stress on the financial system. Expected Outcomes 10. The expected outcomes of today's policy actions are the following: First, the cumulative impact of past actions on demand will be reinforced; second, the credibility of the commitment of monetary policy to controlling inflation, and thereby to keeping medium-term expectations anchored, will be maintained; and, third, the policy actions will reinforce the point that in the absence of complementary policy responses on both demand and supply sides, stronger monetary policy actions are required. Guidance 11. As regards guidance for the future, going forward, the monetary policy stance will depend on the evolving inflation trajectory, which in turn, will be determined by trends in domestic growth and global commodity prices. A change in stance will be motivated by signs of a sustainable downturn in inflation. Global and Domestic Developments 12. As part of the policy review, we have made a careful assessment of the global and domestic macroeconomic situation. I will briefly summarise that. You may recall that the Reserve Bank's Annual Policy Statement of May 3 had highlighted several risk factors to the growth-inflation outlook. Many of these risks have since materialised. The Global Economy 14. On the global front, the sovereign debt problems that have beset the euro area over the past year now threaten larger economies in the region. There is heightened anxiety about whether the euro area will be able to agree on an economically viable, fiscally sustainable and politically feasible solution to the vexing sovereign debt problem. In this regard, the agreement reached by the euro zone leaders in their meeting on July 21 is a positive development. However, its effective implementation remains to be seen. In the US, concerns over a sovereign default loom over financial markets, with potentially disruptive consequences for global capital flows. Despite sluggish economic activity, inflationary pressures also emerged in advanced economies under the impact of high commodity prices. In striking contrast to advanced economies, emerging market economies (EMEs) are generally dealing with rising inflation, caused by a combination of elevated commodity prices and robust domestic demand. While there has been3 talk of the two-speed recovery for some time, its very different impact on advanced economies and EMEs is now clearly visible. From the perspective of India's macroeconomic policy imperatives, a critical consideration is the effect that global conditions will have on commodity prices. After the May 3 Policy Statement, the prices of many commodities, including that of crude oil, showed signs of softening, reflecting weakening demand in advanced economies. Had this trend consolidated, it would have provided some welcome relief from inflationary pressures. However, one quarter later, the downtrend has not yet proved to be very strong. Prices are generally still high compared with last year. With no immediate prospects of monetary tightening in the advanced economies, the impact of weakening demand appears to be offset by that of abundant liquidity. The Indian Economy 18. Turning to the domestic economy, output expanded by 8.5 per cent during 2010-11. The revised and rebased index of industrial production (IIP) suggested that earlier signals of a growth deceleration in the second half of last year were exaggerated. In fact, the growth momentum remained strong throughout last year. However, data for the first two months of this fiscal. April- May 2011, suggest that some moderation might be under way. The May 3 Policy Statement projected baseline real GDP growth for 2011-12 at around 8 per cent. This was based on the assumption of a normal monsoon and crude oil prices averaging US$ 110 per barrel. Subsequent data suggest that this projection remains valid. Therefore, the baseline projection of real GDP growth for the current year has been retained at 8.0 per cent. It is important to recognise that in the absence of appropriate actions for addressing supply bottlenecks, especially in food and infrastructure, questions about the ability of the economy to sustain the current growth rate without significant inflationary pressures come to the fore. The economy's ability to grow rapidly for any length of time without provoking inflation is dependent on implementing policies, with corresponding resource allocations, which will allow the supply of various products and services to keep pace with demand. Inflation 21. Inflation continues to be the dominant macroeconomic concern. The headline WPI inflation rate for the first quarter of this fiscal year remained stubbornly close to double digits and inflationary pressures continued to be broad-based. Both the level and the persistence of WPI inflation are a cause for concern. Non-food manufactured product inflation ruled above 7 per cent in the first quarter suggesting that producers, operating at high levels of capacity utilisation, are able to pass on rising commodity input prices and wage costs to consumers. Inflationary pressures are clearly very strong, notwithstanding signs of moderation of economic activity. Importantly, the softening of commodity prices over the past three months did not translate into a decline in either headline WPI inflation or non-food manufactured products inflation. If the softening reverses, commodity prices are likely to exert inflationary pressures for some time, making moderation in demand necessary to bring inflation down.4 23. In our May 3 Policy Statement, we indicated the upside risks to the inflation outlook. Some of the upside risks have since materialised. These include: the upward revision in prices of petroleum products; the significant increase in the minimum support prices (MSPs) for some agricultural commodities; and the persistence of non-food manufactured products inflation at elevated levels reflecting underlying demand pressures. What factors will shape the inflation outlook going forward? Let me indicate the important ones. The first factor will be the overall performance of the south-west monsoon; both its spatial and temporal distribution will be important. The second factor will be crude oil prices whose outlook for the near future is uncertain. Going by the recent trend, the price of oil could remain volatile because of the pace of global recovery, liquidity conditions, and importantly, the overall oil supply situation; and. Finally, policy decisions with regard to increase in prices of petroleum products and other administered items will have a significant influence on inflation. Our baseline projection for WPI inflation for March 2012, as indicated in the May 3 policy statement, was 6.0 per cent with an upward bias. We have reviewed that projection. Keeping in view the domestic demand-supply balance, global trends in commodity prices and the likely demand scenario, we have revised the baseline projection for WPI inflation for March 2012 upward to 7.0 per cent. Let me reiterate what we said earlier, which is that inflation is expected to remain elevated for a few more months, before moderating towards the later part of the year. Notwithstanding the current inflation scenario, it is important to recognise that in the last decade, the average inflation rate, measured in terms of both WPI and CPI, had moderated to around 5.5 per cent. Monetary policy will, therefore, condition and contain perceptions of inflation in the range of 4.0-4.5 per cent. This will be in line with the medium-term objective of 3.0 per cent inflation consistent with India's broader integration into the global economy. Monetary Transmission 27. Now an important, albeit brief, comment on monetary transmission. Taking cues from the monetary policy actions of the Reserve Bank, scheduled commercial banks have been raising their deposit and lending rates. Since March 2010, banks have raised their modal term deposit rate by 225 basis points. On the lending side, since July 2010, the modal Base Rate of banks has also increased by 225 basis points, suggesting strong transmission of policy rates. Liquidity and Monetary Conditions 29. Turning to liquidity and monetary conditions, consistent with our anti- inflationary policy stance, liquidity conditions have generally remained in deficit mode so far in 2011-12. As per data on July 22, the average daily net injection5 of liquidity through the LAF window during this year was around 48,000 crore, which was within one per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL). The current trends in money supply (M ) and credit growth remain above 3 the indicative trajectory of the Reserve Bank. Keeping in view the evolving growth-inflation dynamics, the indicative projection of M growth for 2011-12 3 has been revised downwards from 16.0 per cent, as set out in the May 3 Policy Statement, to 15.5 per cent. Non-food bank credit growth projection has also been revised downwards from 19.0 per cent to 18.0 per cent. Risk Factors 31. Let me now turn to some of the risks to our indicative projections of growth and inflation for 2011-12: First, uncertainty about the future path of global commodity prices, especially oil; second, uncertainty about capital flows from the perspective of financing the current account deficit; third, risks to food inflation stemming from the monsoon performance, higher minimum support prices and inadequate supply response pertaining to protein-rich items; and, fourth, significant upside risks to the projected fiscal deficit for 2011-12 as fiscal deficit has been a key source of demand pressures. Before I close, let me mention that the Reserve Bank is strongly of the view that controlling inflation is imperative both for sustaining growth over the medium-term and for increasing the potential growth rate. This is a critical attribute of a favourable investment climate, on which the economy's potential growth depends. Fiscal consolidation can contribute to a sustainable growth path by rebalancing demand away from government consumption and towards investment. The Reserve Bank's efforts of achieving low and stable inflation could also be supported by concerted policy actions and resource allocations to address domestic supply bottlenecks, particularly in respect of food and infrastructure. The challenge for the Government and the Reserve Bank is to ensure that demand is constrained in the short term to bring inflation down, but to encourage supply response so as to expand the potential output of the economy in the medium term.""

Philippines,2011-07-27,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the BSP's key policy interest rates. At the same time, the Board increased anew the reserve requirement on deposits and deposit substitutes of all banks and non-banks with quasi-banking functions by one percentage point effective on 5 August 2011. The Monetary Board's decision is based on its view that prevailing price and output conditions support maintaining current policy settings. Latest baseline forecasts showed a lower path consistent with the 3-5 percent inflation target range for 2011 and 2012 while inflation expectations remained well contained. The Monetary Board also noted that bank lending has been growing at double-digit rates since January 2011, supported by the strong momentum of domestic economic activity and stable financial conditions. For this reason, the Monetary Board's decision to raise the reserve requirement anew is a forward-looking move to better manage liquidity. The Monetary Board is of the view that sustained foreign exchange inflows, driven by upbeat market sentiment over the brighter prospects for the Philippine economy, could fuel a further acceleration of domestic liquidity growth which could pose risks to future inflation. The Monetary Board believes that a prudent increase in the reserve requirement will help ensure that the inflation target will be met. The Monetary Board emphasized that the risks around the inflation forecasts remain skewed to the upside, suggesting a need for caution in the monetary policy stance. The BSP therefore remains watchful against any risks to the inflation outlook and will adjust policy and prudential settings as needed to preserve price stability and financial stability."
Armenia,2011-08-02,"Press Release 08.02.2011 In the February 8, 2011 meeting the Board of CBA decided to raise the Refinancing Rate of CBA by 0.5 pp, to 7.75 percent. In January of 2010 inflation was 2.8 percent, and the 12-month inflation indicator reached 10.6 percent, greatly contributed by food prices increases of as much as 8.8 pp. The Board agreed that the inflationary environment will keep on expanding as expected tension arising out of fundamentals in food and primary products in international markets continues and prices are still at high levels due to reduced demand for agricultural products. The Board believes that despite the recovery of internal demand is not creating inflationary pressures economic development trends, intensified additional inflationary effects recorded in the previous year and added inflationary expectations bring in new inflation risks. In this situation, the tightening of monetary conditions and its aligning with recent changes to the reserve requirement mechanism is priority in order to eliminate the deviation between the projected 12-month time horizon inflation forecast and target indicators The Board highlights the gradual tightening of monetary conditions in line with predicted developments with inflation. As part of measures to fight inflation, the Board will in cooperation with other state authorities create prerequisites to bring inflation back to the target band since the second half of 2011.

Romania,2011-08-03,"In its meeting of August 3, 2011, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided the following:. The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report which will be released to the public in a press conference on August 8, 2011. In June 2011, the annual inflation rate fell to 7.93 percent (which still includes the first-round effect of the standard VAT rate increase) from 8.41 percent in May, as a result of lower volatile food prices. However, the annual adjusted CORE21 inflation rate remained at 4.7 percent, unchanged ever since April 2011, its deceleration being affected by an inertial pass-through of previous adverse shocks and by a base effect related to processed food products. The favourable trends in volatile food prices combined with the fading out of the impact of July 2010 VAT rate hike are forecast to trigger faster disinflation in the coming months. According to the latest available data, industrial output and exports stayed on an upward path. However, the negative output gap still persists while the revival of lending to the private sector, mainly centered on corporates, remains modest also in the context of heightened risks related to eurozone sovereign debt crisis and signals regarding a relative slowdown in the eurozone recovery. The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, a document that assesses the recent macroeconomic context, investigates the inflation outlook and identifies the main challenges and constraints to monetary policy in the period ahead. The updated projection of macroeconomic developments reveals an improvement of the short-term inflation outlook as the VAT hike impact is fading out, in line with NBR expectations regarding the end of the cycle of supply-side shock effects that affected the economy, the relative easing of pressures from international food prices, and given the expected positive impact of the domestic agricultural supply. In the medium-term, upside risks to inflation remain significant, coming mainly from the timing and magnitude of administered price adjustments, the volatility of capital flows amid developments in the sovereign debt crisis in the European Union and the United States, as well as uncertainties regarding the evolution of global commodity prices. In this context, the NBR Board decided to leave unchanged the monetary policy rate at an annual 6.25 percent, to continue to pursue an adequate management of liquidity in the banking system and to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The monetary policy stance is thus aimed at preserving adequate broad monetary conditions so as to ensure a solid anchoring of inflation expectation and enhance the convergence of inflation towards the established medium-term targets. Moreover, as risks related to a prolongation of the sovereign debt crisis persist, the consistent implementation of commitments agreed by the Romanian authorities under the external financing agreements with international institutions, especially those regarding fiscal consolidation and the wage-productivity correlation, is essential to ensure a sound recovery of the economy in the context of the nominal and real convergence process. Against this background, a continued prudent monetary policy stance is needed not only to tackle the significant upside risks to inflation, but also to address the possible increased capital flow volatility in emerging economies. The NBR reiterates that the central bank will monitor domestic and global economic developments so as, via an adequate use of its available instruments, to ensure the fulfillment of its objectives of achieving and maintaining price stability in the medium term as well as financial stability. The quarterly Inflation Report will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled for August 8, 2011. According to the calendar of NBR Board meetings dedicated to monetary policy issues, the next meeting is scheduled for September 29, 2011. 1) Calculated by the NBR by excluding administered prices, volatile prices, and tobacco and alcohol prices from the consumer price index."
Czech Republic,2011-08-04,"Press conference of the CNB Bank Board 5th Situation Report on Economic and Monetary Developments 4 August 2011 The monetary policy decision taken and the ratio of the votes cast At the close of the meeting the Bank Board decided by a majority vote to leave the two-week repo rate unchanged at 0.75%. Five members voted in favour of this decision, and two members voted for increasing rates by 0.25 percentage point. Reasons for the decision Monetary-policy relevant inflation will be close to the inflation target over the entire forecast horizon. Headline inflation will be temporarily slightly above 3% due to a VAT increase. Consistent with the forecast is broad stability of market interest rates at the start of the forecast horizon and a gradual rise in rates starting in late 2011/early 2012. The rates do not react to the first-round effects of the VAT increase. The message of the forecast Inflation pressures from the domestic economy are currently not significant, commodity prices and food prices are the main source of inflation. Headline inflation will be just above 3% in 2012 owing to the VAT increase, but will return to the target at the start of 2013. Monetary-policy relevant inflation will be close to the target over the entire forecast horizon (low second-round effects of the VAT changes are assumed). Economic growth in the Czech Republic will slow this year due to fiscal consolidation, slower growth in external demand and fading investment in inventories. Real economic activity will not show higher growth until 2013. The nominal exchange rate is gradually appreciating over the forecast horizon. Consistent with the forecast is broad stability of market interest rates at the start of the forecast horizon and a gradual rise in rates starting in late 2011/early 2012. Downside risk: lower foreign interest rates Upside risk: weaker koruna exchange rate 13 Thank you for your attention More information about the forecast can be found at and in Inflation Report III/2011, to be published 12 August 2011."
Euroarea,2011-08-04,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by Commissioner Rehn. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged, following the 25 basis point increase on 7 July 2011. The information that has become available since then confirms our assessment that an adjustment of the accommodative monetary policy stance was warranted in the light of upside risks to price stability. While the monetary analysis indicates that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is still moderate, monetary liquidity remains ample and may facilitate the accommodation of price pressures. As expected, recent economic data indicate a deceleration in the pace of economic growth in the past few months, following the strong growth rate in the first quarter. For monetary policy, it is essential that recent price developments do not give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures. Inflation expectations in the euro area must remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. At the same time, short-term interest rates remain low and financing conditions are favourable. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments with respect to upside risks to price stability. Given the renewed tensions in some financial markets in the euro area, the Governing Council today also decided to conduct a liquidity-providing supplementary longer-term refinancing operation (LTRO) with a maturity of approximately six months. The operation will be conducted as a fixed rate tender procedure with full allotment. The rate in this operation will be fixed at the average rate of the main refinancing operations (MROs) over the life of the supplementary LTRO. The operation will be announced on 9 August 2011, with allotment on 10 August 2011 and settlement on 11 August 2011, and will mature on 1 March 2012. The Governing Council also decided to continue conducting its MROs as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of the last maintenance period of 2011 on 17 January 2012. This procedure will also remain in use for the Eurosystem's special-term refinancing operations with a maturity of one maintenance period, which will continue to be conducted for as long as needed, and at least until the end of the last quarter of 2011. The fixed rate in these special-term refinancing operations will be the same as the MRO rate prevailing at the time. Furthermore, the Governing Council has decided to conduct the three-month LTROs to be allotted on 26 October, 30 November and 21 December 2011 as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment. The rates in these three-month operations will be fixed at the average rate of the MROs over the life of the respective LTRO. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. In the first quarter of 2011 euro area real GDP posted a strong quarter-on-quarter increase of 0.8%. Data and survey releases for the second quarter point towards ongoing real GDP growth, albeit, as expected, at a slower pace. This moderation also reflects the fact that the strong growth in the first quarter was in part due to special factors. The underlying positive momentum of economic growth in the euro area remains in place and continued moderate expansion is expected in the period ahead. Euro area exports should continue to be supported by the ongoing expansion in the world economy. In addition, the present level of consumer and business confidence in the euro area supports private sector domestic demand. However, growth dynamics are currently weakened by a number of factors contributing to uncertainty, and activity is expected to be dampened somewhat by the ongoing process of balance sheet adjustment in various regions and sectors. In the Governing Council's assessment, the risks to this economic outlook for the euro area remain broadly balanced in an environment of particularly high uncertainty. On the one hand, consumer and business confidence, together with improvements in labour market conditions, could continue to provide support to domestic economic activity. They relate to the ongoing tensions in some segments of the euro area financial markets as well as to global developments, and the potential for these pressures to spill over into the euro area real economy. Downside risks also relate to further increases in energy prices, protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation was 2.5% in July 2011, following 2.7% in June. The relatively high inflation rates seen over the past few months largely reflect higher energy and other commodity prices. Looking ahead, inflation rates are likely to stay clearly above 2% over the coming months. Upward pressure on inflation, mainly from energy and other commodity prices, is also still discernible in the earlier stages of the production process. It remains of paramount importance that the rise in HICP inflation does not translate into second-round effects in price and wage-setting behaviour and lead to broad-based inflationary pressures. Inflation expectations must remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council's aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments remain on the upside. They relate, in particular, to higher than assumed increases in energy prices. Furthermore, there is a risk of increases in indirect taxes and administered prices that may be greater than currently assumed, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. Finally, upside risks may stem from stronger than expected domestic price pressures in the euro area. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 decreased to 2.1% in June 2011, from 2.5% in May. Looking through the recent monthly volatility. M3 growth has broadly stabilised over recent months, after edging up until the first quarter of 2011. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector declined to 2.5% in June, from 2.7% in May. Overall, the underlying pace of monetary expansion remains moderate. At the same time, monetary liquidity accumulated prior to the period of financial market tensions continues to be ample, and may facilitate the accommodation of price pressures in the euro area. Looking at M3 components, the annual growth rate of M1 remained unchanged at 1.2%, whereas growth in other short-term deposits declined to 3.7%. The growth differentials continue to reflect in part the gradual increase in the remuneration of short-term time and savings deposits over recent months. At the same time, the still relatively steep yield curve implies a dampening impact on overall M3 growth, as it reduces the attractiveness of monetary assets compared with more highly remunerated longer-term instruments outside M3. However, this impact is likely to be waning. On the counterpart side, the annual growth of loans to non-financial corporations continued to edge up, from 0.9% in May to 1.5% in June, whereas the annual growth of loans to households hovered over recent months around rates of slightly above 3%. The overall size of MFI balance sheets has remained broadly unchanged over recent months. Where it is necessary to provide adequate scope to expand the provision of credit to the private sector, it is essential for banks to retain earnings, to turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or to take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation. In particular, banks that currently have limited access to market financing urgently need to increase their capital and their efficiency. In this respect, we welcome the EU-wide stress-testing exercise, which was prepared by the European Banking Authority and national supervisors, in close cooperation with the ECB. We also welcome the commitment made by national authorities with regard to the provision of support facilities for banks where private sector means are insufficient. To sum up, based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged, following the 25 basis point increase on 7 July 2011. The information that has become available since then confirms our assessment that an adjustment of the accommodative monetary policy stance was warranted in the light of upside risks to price stability. A cross-check with the signals coming from the monetary analysis indicates that while the underlying pace of monetary expansion is still moderate, monetary liquidity remains ample and may facilitate the accommodation of price pressures. As expected, recent economic data indicate a deceleration in the pace of economic growth in the past few months, following the strong growth rate in the first quarter. For monetary policy, it is essential that recent price developments do not give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures. Inflation expectations in the euro area must remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. At the same time, short-term interest rates remain low and financing conditions favourable. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments with respect to upside risks to price stability. Turning to fiscal policies, the Governing Council stresses the need for strict and timely implementation of the IMF/EU adjustment programmes in Greece. Ireland and Portugal. In addition, it underlines the importance of the renewed commitment of all Heads of State or Government of the euro area to adhere strictly to the agreed fiscal targets. For several countries, this requires announcing and implementing additional and more frontloaded fiscal adjustment measures. Those that enjoy better than expected economic and fiscal developments should make full use of this room for manoeuvre for faster deficit and debt reduction. The common aim should be to put public debt ratios and public finances on a sustainable path as soon as possible. As emphasised by the Heads of State or Government of the euro area, the inflexible determination of all euro area countries to fully honour their own individual sovereign signature is a decisive element in ensuring financial stability in the euro area as a whole. The Governing Council also welcomes the renewed commitment of all Member States to improve competitiveness and address macroeconomic imbalances. Indeed, substantial and comprehensive structural reforms need to be implemented in the countries of the euro area in order to increase the flexibility of their economies and their longer-term growth potential. The removal of labour market rigidities and the implementation of measures which enhance wage flexibility, notably the elimination of automatic wage indexation clauses, are of key importance."
India,2011-08-04,"Reconstitution of the Technical Advisory Committee on Monetary Policy With a view to strengthening the consultative process in monetary policy, the Reserve Bank of India had constituted a Technical Advisory Committee on Monetary Policy in June, 2009.

Russia,2011-08-04,"The Board of Directors' Decision on the Bank of Russia Interest Rates(Unofficial translation). The Bank of Russia External and Public Relations Department informs that on August 4, 2011 the Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia decided to keep the refinancing rate and interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations unchanged (table “Interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations”). The decision was supported by the assessment of inflation risks and risks to the sustainability of economic growth, including those associated with the uncertainty of the global economic conditions. The pace of inflation continued to decrease and reached 9.0% over year ago in July (9.4% in June). The disinflation was still largely driven by certain food prices. Favourable grain crop forecast together with the world food market conditions provide for the reduction of the corresponding inflation risks. Observed decline in inflation expectations may contribute to the decrease in inflation rates in the future. Meanwhile the probable decline in the propensity to save implied by the continuing slowdown in households deposits growth and the faster growth of retail sales in comparison with the real income, could result in higher level of economic activity but may also be a source of additional inflation pressure. Certain macroeconomic indicators in June pointed to the improvement in economic conditions, however, the risks to the sustainability of economic growth persisted. Industrial production expansion continued and its annual growth rate increased for the first time this year. The unemployment rate decreased, though this decline was again to a great extent explained by the seasonal effects. Investment in production capacity continued to recover after the slump at the beginning of the year, however the reduction of its annual growth rate in comparison with May could indicate the inconsistency of the trend. Poor economic confidence indicators also reflect the remaining risks to growth sustainability. Considering current domestic and external economic conditions and the effect of the monetary policy measures, implemented in recent months, the Bank of Russia judged that the current level of money market interest rates was appropriate to maintain the balance between inflation risks and risks to economic activity in the coming months. The next meting of the Board of Directors on monetary policy issues is planned to be held in September, 2011. Interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations, % p.a. * Operations have been suspended.

Turkiye,2011-08-04,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to set the short term interest rates as follows: a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) has been decreased from 6.25 percent to 5.75 percent, b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate has been increased from 1.50 percent to 5 percent, lending rate has been kept at 9 percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions has been kept at 8 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent, while lending rate has been kept at 12 percent. Concerns regarding sovereign debt problems in some European economies and the global growth outlook have continued to intensify, increasing the risks highlighted in the July Committee meeting. In order to limit the potential downside volatility in the short-term interest rates, the Committee has decided to narrow the interest rate corridor by significantly increasing the overnight borrowing rate. In addition, the Committee has approved a technical adjustment to increase the efficiency of the central bank liquidity management and to facilitate a more balanced provision of liquidity across the system. Moreover, the Committee has delivered a measured policy rate cut to reduce the risk of a domestic recession that may be caused by the heightened problems in the global economy. The Committee has agreed to closely monitor the developments, and if necessary, take measures to provide foreign exchange liquidity via appropriate methods and instruments. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
United States,2011-08-09,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June indicates that economic growth so far this year has been considerably slower than the Committee had expected. Indicators suggest a deterioration in overall labor market conditions in recent months, and the unemployment rate has moved up. Household spending has flattened out, investment in nonresidential structures is still weak, and the housing sector remains depressed. However, business investment in equipment and software continues to expand. Temporary factors, including the damping effect of higher food and energy prices on consumer purchasing power and spending as well as supply chain disruptions associated with the tragic events in Japan, appear to account for only some of the recent weakness in economic activity. Inflation picked up earlier in the year, mainly reflecting higher prices for some commodities and imported goods, as well as the supply chain disruptions. More recently, inflation has moderated as prices of energy and some commodities have declined from their earlier peaks. Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee now expects a somewhat slower pace of recovery over coming quarters than it did at the time of the previous meeting and anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only gradually toward levels that the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate. Moreover, downside risks to the economic outlook have increased. The Committee also anticipates that inflation will settle, over coming quarters, at levels at or below those consistent with the Committee's dual mandate as the effects of past energy and other commodity price increases dissipate further. However, the Committee will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations. To promote the ongoing economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with its mandate, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee currently anticipates that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013. The Committee also will maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its securities holdings. The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate. The Committee discussed the range of policy tools available to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability. It will continue to assess the economic outlook in light of incoming information and is prepared to employ these tools as appropriate. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Elizabeth A Duke; Charles L Evans; Sarah Bloom Raskin; Daniel K Tarullo; and Janet L Yellen. Voting against the action were: Richard W Fisher. Narayana Kocherlakota, and Charles I Plosser, who would have preferred to continue to describe economic conditions as likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period."
Armenia,2011-08-11,"Press Release 08.11.2011 In the November 08, 2011 Meeting the Board of CBA decided to leave the Refinancing Rate of CBA unchanged, at 8 percent. In October inflation was 0.3 percent, and the 12-month inflation fell by 0.5 pp against the previous month's indicator and reached 5.7 percent, nearing the confidence band of 4%±1.5 pp as a result. The Board considers it most likely that world economic growth rates would slow down in the forecast time horizon, and world commodity markets would come as mainly balanced provided that supply shocks are shown up. In this case, no inflationary pressures on the Armenian economy would be observed. In the meantime, the effectiveness of macroeconomic policies of developed countries remains uncertain. The Board believes that the developments in aggregate demand and labor market, both recorded and anticipated, would not have essential pressures on the inflation environment. The Board summarized that the 2011 monetary policy forecasts of inflation trajectory to slope down and rest within the confidence band of 4%±1.5 pp in the forecast time horizon are being materialized. In this situation, no change in monetary policy directions in the upcoming period is required while implementing a neutral monetary policy is most reasonable. At the same time, depending on the extent and timeframe to which risks outlined in monetary policy programs show up, further adjustments in the policy directions is possible.

South Korea,2011-08-11,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.25% for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.25% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information, the Committee considers that, while emerging market economies have shown favorable performances, the recoveries in major advanced economies including the US have exhibited signs of weakening. Going forward, the Committee forecasts that the global economy will keep up its pace of recovery; nevertheless, the Committee recognizes the possibility of such factors as the potential for continuing economic slowdown in major countries, the spread of sovereign debt problems in Europe, and international financial market unrest posing downside risks to the global economy. For Korea, the Committee judges the economy to have maintained its underlying upward trend, given for instance that exports show robust growth and that domestic demand is increasing modestly. Labor market conditions have also remained on a track of improvement, led by the private sector. The Committee judges that the domestic economy will keep up this underlying trend going forward, but that uncertainty as to the growth path has intensified due to the impact of external risk factors. Consumer price inflation rose to the 4.7% level in July, due mostly to sharp rises in the prices of agricultural products including vegetables. The Committee expects the high level of inflation to continue in the coming months, driven largely by demand-side pressures resulting from the underlying uptrend in economic activity and by inflation expectations. Core inflation meanwhile increased to the 3.8% level, and this uptrend is seen persisting for the time being. As for housing prices, those in Seoul and its surrounding areas weakened, while prices in the rest of the country posted rates of increase similar to those for June. The rate of leasehold deposit increase rose in July compared to the previous month, with transactions becoming more active. In the financial markets, stock prices and long-term market interest rates have fallen sharply and the Korean won has depreciated against the US dollar since the start of August, due mainly to heightened external risk and international financial market instability. Mortgage lending posted a steady rise in July, as in the previous month. Looking ahead, the Committee, while closely monitoring financial and economic conditions both at home and abroad, including factors potentially disruptive to the financial markets, will conduct monetary policy with a greater emphasis on ensuring that the basis for price stability is firmly anchored while the economy continues its sound growth."
Peru,2011-08-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR AUGUST 2011 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 4.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference at 4.25 percent. This decision takes into account the slowdown observed in global economic activity. Future adjustments in the reference rate will depend on new information on the evolution of inflation and its determinants. Inflation in July was affected by transitory factors and recorded a monthly rate of 0.79 percent and a rate of 3.35 percent in the last twelve months. Core inflation, which registered 0.25 percent, accumulated an annual growth rate of 3.18 percent. Inflation excluding food and energy showed a rate of 0.2 percent and an accumulated annual rate of 2.02 percent. Some current and advanced indicators of activity show lower growth than in previous months. Moreover, indicators of global activity show signs of weakness and increased uncertainty due to the downgrade of the U.S. debt and the persistence of risks associated with the fiscal situation of some industrialized countries. The Board continues to oversee the projection of inflation and its determinants and stands ready to adopt future adjustments in monetary policy instruments in order to ensure that inflation converges towards the inflation target range. The Board also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as described below: Overnight deposits: 3.45 percent. Direct repo and rediscount operations: 5.05 percent. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.05 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for September on its session of September 8, 2011."
Georgia,2011-08-17,"The NBG Lowers Its Policy Rate By 25 Basis Points The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on August 17, 2011 and decided to lower its Main Policy Rate (the refinancing rate) by 25 basis points to 7.5 percent. Consumer Price Index decreased by 1.5 percent in July, 2011 compared to the previous month. The annual inflation rate stands at 8.5 percent. The share of food remains high in the annual rate of inflation and amounts to 6.7 percent. The core inflation net of food and energy decreased further to 0.03 percent in the month of June. The inflation in service sector is also low and stands at 1.2 percent. In the recent months inflation shows faster decrease than it was expected earlier. According to the existing forecasts, inflation can possibly decrease even more. Presumably, by the end of this year the inflation will fall below the target level and remain low in the first half of the next year. Based on the abovementioned. MPC continues monetary policy easing, started last month, in order to maintain the inflation at the target level in the medium term. Recently the risk of USA economic slowdown have developed and there also are some uncertainties as regards the growth rates in the Eurozone economies. Economic slowdown in USA and Eurozone on one hand will cause the price drop on the commodity markets and on the other may be reflected in the lower aggregate demand in Georgia. This will further increase the risks of deflation. In such case the NBG will carry out additional measures. The NBG will closely monitor developments in the economy and financial markets and will act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on September 14, 2011."
Chile,2011-08-18,"Santiago, 18 August 2011* Monetary policy meeting  August 2011 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 5.25% (annual). Internationally, activity indicators confirm a slower pace of growth in the United States and Europe, and consensus forecasts for these economies have been revised downward. Meanwhile, concerns about fiscal and financial risks have intensified, particularly in the Eurozone, triggering a widespread increase in financial volatility and risk aversion, with a significant adjustment of asset prices. Copper and oil prices have posted substantial reductions in recent weeks. At the global level, medium‐term inflation expectations have declined while prospects of interest rate normalization in advanced economies have been postponed again. Domestically, output, demand and labor market figures are evolving strongly and are showing signs of moderation at the margin. However, in the case of product and demand, such moderation has been less than foreseen in the baseline scenario of June's Monetary Policy Report. CPI inflation has hovered around 3% y‐o‐y while measures of core inflation remain bounded. Inflation expectations show a significant decline and are close to the target. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. * The Spanish original prevails."
Hungary,2011-08-23,"At its meeting on 23 August 2011, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at 6.00%. In the Council's judgement, the recovery of the Hungarian economy is likely to continue over the next two years; however, the level of output will remain below its potential throughout the period. Domestic demand is expected to remain subdued. Consequently, inflation may settle around the Bank's target by the end of 2012 even without policy tightening, despite the cost shocks hitting the economy. The decline in consumer prices in recent months was in line with the Monetary Council's expectation. Inflation fell back to close to 3% in July, partly as a result of a decline in unprocessed food prices and strict measures taken against attempts to raise administered prices. By contrast, core inflation continued to rise, due to the pass-through of higher commodity prices. The restraining effect on price and wage-setting of the persistent weakness in domestic demand and high unemployment is likely to be a key determinant of inflation as the first-round effects of the cost shocks wear off; however, consumer price inflation may remain above target in the coming months. It may be necessary to maintain interest rates at their current level over a sustained period in order to meet the target for CPI inflation in the medium term. The picture painted by the latest data on economic activity was weaker than the Monetary Council expected. External demand has recently been the main driver of economic growth; however, there is some evidence that global activity is slowing. The effect of the global slowdown on Hungarian exports may be partly offset by the implementation of large-scale investment projects, mainly in the car industry. The trade surplus is expected to remain high as export growth slows and imports weaken, reflecting subdued domestic demand. The Council maintains its view that household consumption is unlikely to pick up significantly in the near future. It may take longer for households to adjust their balance sheets as a result of the recent appreciation of the Swiss franc, which in turn may delay the recovery in consumption growth. Tight credit conditions and uncertainty surrounding the global economic environment and domestic consumption continue to impede the recovery in corporate investment. Hungary has also been affected by the decline in global risk appetite due to the euro-area sovereign debt crisis and uncertainty surrounding the outlook for growth in developed countries. The Monetary Council has decided to leave interest rates unchanged in light of the above considerations. Over the period ahead, the Council's interest rate decisions may be influenced by the success of measures to solve the euro-area debt crisis, in addition to expected developments in domestic inflation."
Turkiye,2011-08-23,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels: a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) at 5.75 percent, b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 5 percent, lending rate at 9 percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 8 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, lending rate at 12 percent. Recent data releases confirm the Committee's assessment that global economic activity continues to decelerate. In addition to weak external demand, there is an ongoing slowdown in the domestic demand since the second quarter. The slowdown in credit growth and domestic demand combined with the exchange rate movements have been contributing to the rebalancing of domestic and external demand. Accordingly, the Committee expects a notable improvement in the current account balance in the forthcoming period. The Committee has noted that inflation may temporarily hover slightly above the levels envisaged in the July Inflation Report and core inflation may continue to rise for some time. However, due to the slowdown in economic activity, it is expected that the second round effects of exchange rate movements would be limited, and thus the increase in inflation would be temporary. Accordingly, the Committee has indicated that inflation outlook for the end of 2012 is consistent with the 5 percent target. The Committee has agreed that the measures taken at the interim meeting on August 4, 2011 have contained the downside risks for the economy for the time being, and thus decided to keep the policy instruments unchanged at this meeting. However, given the uncertainties regarding the global economy, it is important to monitor all developments closely, and to deliver the required policy response in a timely manner. The Committee has also reiterated that all policy instruments may be eased should global economic problems further intensify and the slowdown in domestic economic activity becomes more pronounced. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Mongolia,2011-08-24,"MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Ref No: 2011/08 Date: August 24, 2011 Embargo: Not for publication or broadcast before 1100 hours on Thursday, 25 August 2011. August 25, 2011- BoM Board of Directors resolved to increase the policy rate by 0.25 unit percent to 11.75% and the required reserve by 2 unit percent to 11%. According to the statistical data of July released by the National Statistical Office of Mongolia, the national CPI was 11.4% the capital CPI was 10.1%. The core inflation has been increasing for 5 consecutive months and stands at 12% as of July due to the increase in price of some state regulated products. The total demand influence on inflation would not be decreased in this year. The oil price growth let the transportation cost higher in last months and through this reason the price of other goods and services might be heat up. The Bank of Mongolia is taking the action to decentralize the expected inflation pressure, economic overheat and to strengthen the reliability of financial sector. BANK OF MONGOLIA."
Thailand,2011-08-24,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 24 August 2011 Mr. Paiboon Kittisrikangwan. Assistant Governor. Bank of Thailand, announces the outcome of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today, as follows. The MPC assessed that the risks to economic growth of the advanced economies had increased as the US economic growth continued to slow to a rate lower than expected. Core member economies in the euro area began to slow somewhat. Meanwhile Asia is expected to be able to withstand some of the impact from the global economic slowdown due to the resiliency of its domestic demand and exports as well as remaining monetary and fiscal policy space to stimulate the economies. The MPC agreed that the slowdown in advanced economies would partially weigh on Thai exports. However expanding intra-regional trade in tandem with the continued growth of domestic demand in Asian economies as well as export diversification to new markets will help mitigate the impact. Domestic consumption and investment are expected to expand due to favorable employment conditions, improved confidence, robust growth in credit demand, and fiscal stimulus going forward. Despite the slowdown in global oil and commodity prices, inflationary pressure remained as domestic demand continued to expand amid fiscal stimulus. As a result, inflation expectations have risen. The MPC judged that, despite increased risk on growth emanating from risks on global growth compared to the previous meeting, the Thai economy retained its growth momentum but with heightened risks to inflation, together with a sub-normal policy rate. The MPC deemed it appropriate to continue policy rate normalization to contain inflationary pressure. The MPC therefore decided with a 5-2 vote to raise the policy interest rate by 025 per cent, from 325 to 350 per cent, effective immediately. The MPC will closely monitor global economic developments and inflationary pressure and stands ready to take necessary action to ensure sustainable growth for the Thai economy."
Egypt,2011-08-25,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release August 25, 2011 In its meeting held on August 25, 2011, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 825 percent and 975 percent, respectively, and the 7-day repo at 925 percen. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 85 percen. Headline CPI increased by 120 percent (m/m) in July following the 042 percent in June, while the annual rate declined from 1179 percent to 1036 percent on the back of favorable base effects from last yea. On the other hand, core CPI increased by 124 percent in July following the 045 percent in June, while the annual rate declined from 894 percent to 871 percent supported by favorable base effects from last yea. The latest monthly developments in both headline and core inflation have been mainly driven by broad based increase in the prices of food items ahead of the Holy month of Ramada. While the probability of a rebound in international food prices is less likely now in light of recent global developments, supply shortages in certain food commodities on the back of unfavorable weather conditions pose an upside risk to the inflation outloo. Meanwhile real GDP contracted by 42 percent in 2010/2011 Q3 which marks the first negative year-on-year growth rate since the release of quarterly GDP data in 2001/200. It is important to note that while a marked decline in economic activity was expected, the magnitude is larger than anticipated at the outset of the revolutio. This came on the back of significant declines in the tourism, manufacturing and construction sector. In the meantime, given the increased uncertainty that faced market participants early this year, investment witnessed a significant annual retrenchment of 26 percent in the quarter ending March 201. Looking ahead, the current political transformation may continue to have ramifications on both consumption as well as investment decisions, adversely weighing on key sectors within the econom. Moreover concerns related to the global recovery have intensified over the past weeks on the back of heightened worries regarding fiscal challenges facing the Euro Area along with weaker than anticipated growth rates in a number of advanced economie. These factors, combined, pose downside risks to domestic GDP going forwar. Against the above background, the slowdown in economic growth should limit upside risks to the inflation outloo. Given the balance of risks on the inflation and GDP outlooks and the increased uncertainty at this juncture, the MPC judges that the current key CBE rates are appropriat. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter.

Israel,2011-08-29,"29.08.2011 The Bank of Israel leaves the interest rate for September 2011 unchanged at 3.25 percent To view this press release as a WORD file - Click here Background conditions Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) declined 0.3 percent in July, below the average forecast and below the seasonal path consistent with achieving the inflation target. On a seasonally adjusted basis, theCPI in July fell 0.6 percent. Inflation over the past 12 months, as measured by the change in the CPI, was 3.4 percent, above the upper limit of the target inflation range (of 1-3 percent a year). Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Inflation expectations forthe next twelve months, both those of forecasters and those calculated from the capital markets, fell significantly over the past month. Inflation expectations for the next twelve months as calculated from the capital marketare currently 2 percent, and forecasters' inflation expectations for the next twelve months are currently 2.5 percent. The background to the drop in inflation expectations was a fall in commodity prices, the surprisingly lowJuly CPI reading, expectations of a slowdown in growth, and the social protests against the high cost of living. At the same time, forecasts, both offorecasters and those calculated from the capital markets, of the Bank of Israel interest rate fell. Based on the Telbor (Tel Aviv Inter-Bank OfferedRate) market, the Bank of Israel interest rate one year from now is expected to be 3.1 percent, down from 4 percent a month ago, and the average of forecasters' predictions is that it will be 3.6 percent (down from 4.3 percent a month ago). Forecasters expect the Bank of Israel to leave the interest rate for September unchanged. Real economic activity: Economic indicators that became availablethis month continue to support the assessment that the economy continues to expand, albeit more slowly than in previous quarters. The slowdown in therate of growth stems mainly from moderation in global demand, which influences goods exports by manufacturers, as well as services exports. At the same time, domestic demand continues to grow. Based on National Accounts datafor the second quarter (in annualized terms). GDP grew 3.3 percent and gross domestic product of the business sector grew 1.9 percent. With that, these figures are essentially consistent with the Bank of Israel forecast of 4.8 percent GDP growth for the full year of 2011. Exports (excluding diamonds) grew 0.5 percent quarter on quarter, in the second quarter, compared with an increase of 10.1 percent in the first quarter. Private consumption increased 2.3 percent, compared with 7.8 percent in the first quarter. However, private consumption, excluding relatively volatile consumer durables, grew 4.6 percent, compared with 4.3 percent in the first quarter. The moderation in the rate of growth was also seen in the composite state-of-the-economy index, which increased by 0.2 percent in July, continuing the relatively modest increases of the second quarter. Tax receipts continue to be below the seasonal path, for the fourth consecutive month. However, expectations for future activity, based on the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of business trends as well as the Globes and the Bank Hapoalim consumer confidence indices, are positive. The labor market and wages: Labor market data indicate a continued improvement in employment. The trend figure for May shows a 5.7 percent unemployment rate in the civilian workforce. The number of employee posts (seasonally adjusted) increased by 0.6 percent in March-May compared with the previous three months. The Central Bureau of Statistics job vacancy survey shows that the number of job vacancies increased by 2.2 percent inJuly. The nominal wage increased in March-May by 1.4 percent compared with the level in the previous three months, while the real wage (seasonally adjusted) was stable. In July, health tax receipts, which provide an indication of wage payments in that month, were 6.8 percent higher (preliminary estimate), in nominal terms, than in July 2010 (excluding the effect of legislative changes). The Bank of Israel Research Department staff forecast: Following a deterioration in the global economic environment in the past month, the Research Department's staff forecast is somewhat changed compared with last month. The current assessment is that inflation in the 12 months ending in the third quarter of 2012 will be 2.5 percent, and the average interest rate for that quarter will be 3.3 percent. For the full year of 2011, the Research Department forecasts that the inflation rate will be 2.7 percent, and that the average interest rate in the fourth quarter will be 3.3 percent. The Research Department emphasized the primary risks faced by Israel's economy, specifically, the realization of the pessimistic assessments regarding developments in the global economy and their expected impact on demand for Israel's exports and on domestic demand, and negative geopolitical developments. Budget data: Government domestic revenues in July were 3.5 percent lower than the forecast seasonal path, continuing a slowdown in indirect tax revenues. At the same time, tax revenues for the year to date, through July, were 5.7 percent higher, in real terms, than in the corresponding period of the year before, and NIS 100 million above the seasonal path of the budget forecast (net of legislative changes and one time revenues). The government's domestic activity in the first seven months of this year (excluding credit) resulted in a cumulative deficit of 0.4 percent of GDP, comparedwith a deficit of 1.2 percent of GDP in the corresponding period of 2010. Developments in government activity so far indicate that the budget deficitfor the full year of 2011 will be between 2.7 percent and 3 percent of GDP. (The deficit ceiling set by law is 3 percent.) The foreign exchange market: From the previous monetary policy discussion held on July 24, through August 26, the shekel depreciated by about 7 percent against both the dollar and the euro, and weakened by about 6.6 percent vis-?-vis the nominal effective exchange rate. This is a considerably greater depreciation than that of the main currencies against the dollar. This was apparently against the background of a change in market expectations of the path of the Bank of Israel interest rate, which, in contrast to expectations in recent months, now do not forecast an increase in the interest rate in the coming period. It is possible as well that the deterioration of the security situation in the south of Israel and other geopoliticalrisks led to weakening of the shekel. The capital and money markets: Between the monetary policy discussions of July 24 and August 26. Tel Aviv Stock Exchange share price indicesfell sharply, in line with the general trend in stock markets around the world. The Tel Aviv 25 Index fell by 14 percent, a move similar to that of US stock market indices. Yields on local currency government bonds declined sharply by 25-65 basis points (b.p.) across the entire yield curve,most markedly in the short end of the curve. The yield curve on CPI-indexed government bonds flattened, with a sharp rise of up to 35 basis points inshort terms and a drop of 5-12 basis points in the medium to long terms. This was against the background of a sharp drop in inflation expectations for the next two years, from about 3 percent per year last month to 2 percent per year currently. The yield gap between Israeli unindexed 10-year government notes and 10-year US Treasury notes widened considerably during the period surveyed, and at the end of the period stood at 266 b.p. (up from 214 b.p. at the beginning of the period). Makam yields fell by up to 40 b.p., across the curve, as the yield for one year fell during the period from 3.5 percent to 3.08 percent. Withdrawals from mutual funds specializingin corporate bonds continue. In the last three months, about NIS 10 billion were withdrawn. In contrast, money market funds continue to attract new investment, and in the past three months about NIS 10.8 billion flowed into those funds. This pace is considerably faster than that seen in the periodbefore the Lehman Brothers crisis. The negative sentiment in the corporatebond market can be seen as well in the widening yield spread against government bonds. The yield spread between the Tel-Bond 40 and government bonds widened from 200 b.p. to 288 basis points since the last monetary policy discussion. Over the period as a whole. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spread rose by 28 basis points, and at the end of the period was 166 b.p. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in July the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 3.2 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 9.3 percent. Developments in the credit markets: The balance of outstanding credit to the business sector decreased in June by 0.7 percent, to NIS 748 billion. Outstanding credit to households increased by 0.9 percent in June, to NIS 354 billion. Of the credit to households, outstanding housing credit rose 12.3 percent in the twelve months ending in June, to NIS 252 billion, compared with a 13.9 percent increase in the twelve months to May. The volume of new housing credit granted in the twelve months ending in July was 1.4 percent lower than the previous month (twelve months to June). The share of mortgages at floating interest rates (for all maturities) in total new mortgages continued to decline in July, and reached 79 percent, compared with 81 percent in June; Following a Bank of Israel directive that went into effect on May 5, 2011, the share of mortgages at interest rates that vary once in five years or less is expected to continue to fall. The interest rates on CPI-indexed and unindexed floating rate mortgages continued to increase in July, while the interest rates on fixed-interest rate CPI-indexed mortgages declined. The housing market: Data on building starts and completions show that activity in the construction industry continues to gain strength. The upward trend in starts and completions that started at the beginning of 2008 persists. The number of starts in the twelve months to May reached 42,304, compared with 41,138 in the twelve months to April, and the number of completions was 33,821 twelve months to May, compared with the April figure of 34,095. In comparison, the number of homes sold fell, and in April-June was 7 percent lower than in January-March. The number of homes available for sale continued to increase, and in April-June wason average 5.4 percent higher than the January-March average. Homeprices, which are presented in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of home prices but are not included in the CPI, increased at a monthly rate of 0.7 percent in May-June, after rising at a similar pace in April-May. The annual rate of increase in home prices continues to be high, but declined slightly for the second consecutive month, and in the twelve months ended in June house prices increased by 12.5 percent; compared with a 13.9 percent increase in the May figure. The slowdown in the rate of increase in home prices was influenced by the increase in the interest rate,measures introduced by the Bank of Israel affecting mortgages, and steps taken by the Ministry of Finance in real estate taxation, together with the continued increase in the number of building starts, and these factors are expected to moderate home price increases in the course of the coming year. The housing index, which is based mainly on renewed rental contracts and which is included in the CPI, continued to increase, rising by 0.4 percent in June, bringing the increase in the last twelve months to 5.6 percent. The global economy: Concern regarding global growth increased this month, in light of the disappointing growth data in the advanced economies. The figures published in the US during the month showed a continued slowdown in growth, and in the second quarter the rate (in annual terms) was only 1 percent, significantly lower than expected rate of 1.8 percent, and the figure for the first quarter was adjusted sharply downwards, from 1.9 percent to only 0.4 percent. The GDP of the eurozone grew at a rate of 0.2 percent in the second quarter, compared with the expectation of 0.3 percent. The average growth in the eurozone was reduced by the zero growth rates in Germany and France, showing a considerable weakening following their respective stronger growth rates of 1.3 percent and 0.9 percent in the first quarter. Concern over global growth intensified also due to the assessment that the set of tools available for economic policy was limited, relative to that in 2008. The emerging market economies are still showing strong growth, but it is expected that this will also slow in the near future due to the slowdown in the advanced economies. In light of this assessment, the investment houses reduced considerably their global growth forecasts for the next two years. Following the lowering of credit ratings of some eurozone countries. S&P this month announced a cut in the US credit rating, which led to severe reactions in the markets around the world. Moody's lowered Japan'scredit rating, and there was concern that France's rating may also be lowered. The European debt crisis is still spreading, and presents a threat to Italy and Spain. Inflation expectations fell steeply this month, in light of the expected slowdown in economic activity and the fall in commodity prices. Currently the markets do not expect an increase in interest rates by any of the central banks of the large advanced economies, and the Federal Reserve announced that it would leave the interest rate at its near zero leveluntil mid-2013 at least. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to leave the interest rate for September at 3.25 percent isconsistent with the process of returning the inflation rate to within the target price-stability range of 1-3 percent a year within the next twelve months, and with supporting economic growth while maintaining financial stability. The future direction of changes in the interest rate will bedependent on the inflation environment, economic growth in Israel and abroad, the monetary policy of the leading central banks, and developments in the exchange rates of the shekel. Inflation expectations--those derived from the capital market and predictions of the forecasters--declined significantly last month and are currently 2 percent and 2.5 percent respectively. The current forecast of the Bank of Israel Research Department is that inflation will enter the target range towards the end of 2011, as opposed to the middle of 2012 in the previous forecast. The July CPI was surprisingly low, following four months when the seasonally adjusted CPI inflation rates were in line with the target inflation range. Nevertheless, inflation over the previous twelve months, 3.4 percent, is still above the target range. The rate of growth in the second quarter was slower than in the first, mainly due to the slackening of global demand and its effect on exports, whereas domesticdemand continued to increase. Developments since the previous interest rate decision indicating a negative turnaround in economic activity in the US and the eurozone, together with the geopolitical risks, are likely to affect economic activity in Israel. Notwithstanding, the relatively good presentstate of the Israeli economy will enable it to withstand these shocks witha relatively moderate impact. The rate ofincrease in home prices over the last twelve months continues to be high, but moderated for the second month in succession, and in June reached 12.5 percent. With that, the interest rate increases, measures taken by the Bankof Israel in the mortgage market, and measures taken by the Ministry of Finance regarding real estate taxation, together with the continued increase in building starts, are expected to continue and to have a moderating effect on house prices during the coming year. As a resultof the reversal in the US and Europe, the markets are not pricing in an increase in the interest rate during the coming year by any of the central banks of the main advanced economies. The Federal Reserve announced this month that it would leave its interest rate at its near zero level until mid-2013 at least. The Bank ofIsrael will continue to monitor developments in Israel's economy and the global economy and in the financial markets. The Bank will use the instruments available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, including keeping a close watch on developments in the assetsmarket, and especially in the housing market. The minutes of the discussions prior to the above interest rate decision will be published on September 12, 2011. The decision regarding the interest rate for October 2011 will be published at 17:30 on Monday. September 26, 2011. 29.08.2011 The Bank of Israel leaves the interest rate for September 2011 unchanged at 3.25 percent.

Philippines,2011-09-07,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to keep the overnight policy rates steady. At the same time, the reserve requirement ratios were kept unchanged. The Monetary Board's decision is based on its assessment that current monetary policy settings remain appropriate given a manageable inflation environment and subdued economic outlook. Latest baseline forecasts continue to indicate that average annual inflation is likely to settle within the 3-5 percent target range for 2011-2013 while inflation expectations remain firmly anchored given the moderating commodity prices and the recent string of stable inflation rates. The growth of domestic output has moderated in the first half of 2011 as external demand weakened and public spending was below target. The Monetary Board is of the view that the risks to the inflation outlook may be receding as global inflationary pressures are expected to ease with the slowdown in the recovery of advanced economies. Food prices have also remained tame with favorable supply conditions in both domestic and international markets. The abating price pressures give monetary authorities sufficient room to keep policy rates on hold. A pause in the policy stance allows for careful assessment of inflation risks amid signs of sluggish global economic growth. The Monetary Board believes that the current monetary policy stance remains in line with the need to safeguard price stability and support sustained economic growth. The Monetary Board also noted that liquidity expansion and bank credit activity continue to grow at a strong pace, which could stoke inflationary pressures going forward. The BSP therefore remains watchful over emerging conditions to ensure that the monetary policy stance is appropriate."
Poland,2011-09-07,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 7 September 2011 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 6-7 September 2011 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e.: (cid:131) reference rate at 4.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate at 6.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate at 3.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate at 4.75% on an annual basis. Since the previous meeting of the Council, further signs of weakening global economic activity have appeared. In 2011 Q2, annual GDP growth in the United States declined and data on GDP in the previous quarters were revised downwards. In the euro area and in some emerging economies. GDP growth also slackened in 2011 Q2. At the same time, consumer and corporate sentiment deteriorated in many countries, whereas inflation persisted at an elevated level. The heightened risk of a global economic slowdown along with the persisting fiscal problems in some countries contributed to mounting tensions in the financial markets worldwide. There was a significant fall in equity prices accompanied by a further decline in global commodity prices. Given the increased risk aversion in the financial markets, the currencies of emerging economies, including the zloty, weakened. Heightened financial asset price volatility is also driven by the significant surplus of liquidity in the financial markets, related to the strongly expansionary monetary policy of the major central banks. In Poland, data on GDP in 2011 Q2 confirmed relatively high and stable growth in the first half of 2011. GDP growth was mainly driven by expanding domestic demand, fuelled by both rising private consumption and accelerated investment growth. Moreover, enterprises continued to build up their inventories at a robust pace. However, data on economic activity in the first months of 2011 Q3 signal a possibility of a slowdown in economic growth, in particular, of weaker growth in industry. In 2011 Q2, stable economic growth was accompanied by a slower increase in the number of the employed than the one registered in the previous quarter. Data from the enterprise sector also indicate weaker employment growth, following a period of strong performance. Amidst a concurrent continued, although slower than hitherto recorded, rise in the number of economically active persons, this results in the unemployment rate running at an elevated level. 2011 Q2 brought a certain acceleration in wage growth, which might have been driven, to some extent, by the disbursement of additional remuneration components in some sectors in connection with very good financial results of enterprises. July data indicate no further wage growth acceleration in the corporate sector. At the same time the revival in lending to enterprises, including 00-919 Warszawa, ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, tel. (22) 653 28 88, fax (22) 653 13 28 investment loans, continues. The relatively fast growth in mortgage lending to households has also been sustained while consumer loans continue to decline. In July, annual CPI inflation decreased to 4.1%, but remained markedly above the NBP's inflation target of 2.5%. Inflation fell mainly due to a decline in food prices, notwithstanding a simultaneous rise in energy prices. Core inflation net of food and energy prices remained unchanged. As current inflation fell, households' inflation expectations eased accordingly, however PPI inflation accelerated somewhat. In the coming months, annual CPI inflation will still run at an elevated level, primarily due to the previously observed sharp rise in global commodity prices. In the medium term, inflation will be curbed by slower domestic GDP growth, amidst a fiscal tightening, including reduced public investment spending, coupled with interest rate increases implemented in the first half of 2011 and a likely global economic slowdown. On the other hand, the potential impact of the situation in global financial markets upon the zloty exchange rate is an upside risk factor to domestic price developments. In the opinion of the Council, the significant monetary policy tightening implemented since the beginning of 2011 should facilitate inflation's return to the target in the medium term. Given the above the Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates at the current level. The Council does not rule out the possibility of further monetary policy adjustment, should the outlook for inflation returning to the target deteriorate. At its meeting held on 23 August 2011, the Council adopted the Monetary Policy Guidelines for 2012. As in previous years, in the Guidelines presented are the key elements of the monetary policy strategy pursued by the National Bank of Poland. The Guidelines also contain an overview of macroeconomic developments which may influence monetary policy in 2012, as well as a description of monetary policy instruments. In the Guidelines, the Council maintained the key elements of its monetary policy strategy, including a permanent inflation target of 2.5%, with a symmetric fluctuation band of ±1 pp., implemented under a floating exchange rate regime which does not rule out foreign exchange interventions. At the meeting held on 23 August 2011 the Council also adopted the Balance of Payments of the Republic of Poland in Q1 2011, whereas at the meeting held on 6-7 September 2011 the Council adopted the Forecast of the Balance of Payments of the Republic of Poland in 2012."
Armenia,2011-09-08,"Press Release 09.08.2011 In the August 9, 2011 meeting the Board of CBA decided to leave the Refinancing Rate of CBA unchanged, at 8.5 percent. There was 3 percent deflation recorded in July of 2011, and the 12-month inflation has fallen by 2.2 pp against the previous month's same indicator reaching 6.3 percent, as a result. The Board accepted that inflationary environment is moderating determined by macroeconomic developments in both domestic and external sectors. Inflationary pressures transmitted from world commodities and raw materials markets are expected to reduce further. Nevertheless, escalated debt issues in world economy and volatilities in international stock exchange markets make developed countries' macroeconomic policy forecasts even more uncertain. The Board has a consensus that domestic demand, still recovering at a slow pace, restrictive fiscal policy and the tightening of monetary conditions at the beginning of the year will also have their contribution to continued deceleration in the inflation rate over the forecast time horizon. The Board summed up that further moderation of the inflationary environment in world commodities and raw materials markets and in the domestic economy as well as more favorable conditions in agriculture in comparison with the previous year confirm that 12- month inflation rate is expected to slow faster and at the end of the year it most likely will be within a target band of 4 % ± 1.5 pp, stabilizing around the lower bound of the band. The aforementioned non-inflationary patterns notwithstanding, and in consideration of the current issues which the global economy is facing, the Board still refrains to ease monetary conditions.

Euroarea,2011-09-08,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by Commissioner Rehn. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Inflation has remained elevated and is likely to stay above 2% over the months ahead before declining next year. At the same time, the underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be moderate, while monetary liquidity remains ample. As expected, the pace of economic growth in the euro area decelerated in the second quarter, following strong growth in the first quarter. Looking ahead, we expect the euro area economy to grow moderately, subject to particularly high uncertainty and intensified downside risks. While our monetary policy stance remains accommodative, some financing conditions have tightened. It remains essential for monetary policy to focus on its mandate of maintaining price stability over the medium term, thereby ensuring that recent price developments do not give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures. A very thorough analysis of all incoming data and developments over the period ahead is warranted. Inflation expectations in the euro area must remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make its contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. The provision of liquidity and the allotment modes for refinancing operations will continue to ensure that euro area banks are not constrained on the liquidity side. All the non-standard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions are, by construction, temporary in nature. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro area real GDP growth decelerated to 0.2% quarter on quarter in the second quarter of 2011, after 0.8% in the first quarter. As expected, temporary factors which had boosted growth in the early part of the year ceased, and adverse effects resulted from the Japanese earthquake and the lagged impact of past oil price increases. Looking ahead, a number of developments seem to be dampening the underlying momentum in the euro area, including a moderation in the pace of global growth, related declines in equity prices and in business confidence, and unfavourable effects resulting from ongoing tensions in a number of euro area sovereign debt markets. As a consequence, real GDP growth is expected to increase very moderately in the second half of this year. At the same time, we continue to expect euro area economic activity to benefit from ongoing growth in the global economy as well as from the accommodative monetary policy stance and the various measures taken to support the functioning of the financial sector. This assessment is also reflected in the September 2011 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real GDP growth in a range between 1.4% and 1.8% in 2011 and between 0.4% and 2.2% in 2012. Compared with the June 2011 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the ranges for real GDP growth in 2011 and 2012 have been revised downwards. In the Governing Council's assessment, the risks to the economic outlook for the euro area are on the downside, in an environment of particularly high uncertainty. Downside risks mainly relate to the ongoing tensions in some segments of the financial markets in the euro area and at the global level, as well as to the potential for these pressures to spill over into the euro area real economy. They also relate to further increases in energy prices, protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation was 2.5% in August 2011, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, unchanged from July. We have now seen inflation rates at relatively high levels since the end of last year, with higher energy and other commodity prices as the main drivers. Looking ahead, inflation rates are likely to stay clearly above 2% over the coming months. Thereafter, on the basis of the path implied by futures markets for oil prices, inflation rates should fall below 2% in 2012. This pattern reflects the expectation of relatively stable wage growth developments in the context of moderate economic growth. The September 2011 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area embody these considerations and foresee annual HICP inflation in a range between 2.5% and 2.7% for 2011 and between 1.2% and 2.2% for 2012. In comparison with the June 2011 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the range for HICP inflation in 2011 remains unchanged, while the range for 2012 is slightly narrower. It is necessary to recall that the staff projections are conditional on a number of purely technical assumptions. The Governing Council views the risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments as being broadly balanced. On the upside, the main risks relate to the possibility of higher than assumed increases in oil and non-oil commodity prices as well as increases in indirect taxes and administered prices, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. The main downside risks relate to the impact of weaker than expected growth in the euro area and globally. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 was 2.0% in July 2011, after 1.9% in June. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector was 2.4% in July, after 2.5% in June. Looking beyond the monthly data and the effects of special factors, trends in broad money and loan growth have broadly stabilised over recent months. Overall, the underlying pace of monetary expansion remains moderate. At the same time, monetary liquidity accumulated prior to the period of financial market tensions continues to be ample. Looking at M3 components, the annual growth rate of M1 decreased to 0.9% in July, whereas growth in other short-term deposits remained unchanged at 3.7%. These developments continue to partly reflect the gradual increase in the remuneration of short-term time and savings deposits over recent months. On the counterpart side, the annual growth of loans to non-financial corporations continued to edge up slightly, from 1.5% in June to 1.6% in July, whereas the annual growth of loans to households seems to have levelled off at around 3%. The overall size of MFI balance sheets has remained broadly unchanged over recent months. Where it is necessary to provide adequate scope to expand the provision of credit to the private sector, it is essential for banks to retain earnings, to turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or to take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation, in line with the findings of the recent stress tests. To sum up, based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Inflation has remained elevated and is likely to stay above 2% over the months ahead before declining next year. A cross- check with the information from our monetary analysis confirms that the underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be moderate, while monetary liquidity remains ample. As expected, the pace of economic growth in the euro area decelerated in the second quarter, following strong growth in the first quarter. Looking ahead, we expect the euro area economy to grow moderately, subject to particularly high uncertainty and intensified downside risks. While our monetary policy stance remains accommodative, some financing conditions have tightened. It remains essential for monetary policy to focus on its mandate of maintaining price stability over the medium term, thereby ensuring that recent price developments do not give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures. A very thorough analysis of all incoming data and developments over the period ahead is warranted. Inflation expectations in the euro area must remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make its contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. Turning to fiscal policies, a number of governments have announced additional measures to ensure the achievement of their consolidation targets and to strengthen the legal basis for national fiscal rules. To ensure credibility, it is now crucial that the announced measures be frontloaded and implemented in full. Governments need to stand ready to implement further consolidation measures, notably on the expenditure side, if risks regarding the attainment of the current fiscal targets materialise. Countries that enjoy better than expected economic and fiscal developments should make full use of this room for manoeuvre for faster deficit and debt reduction. All euro area governments need to demonstrate their inflexible determination to fully honour their own individual sovereign signature, which is a decisive element in ensuring financial stability in the euro area as a whole. Fiscal consolidation and structural reforms must go hand in hand to strengthen confidence, growth prospects and job creation. The Governing Council therefore urges all euro area governments to decisively and swiftly implement substantial and comprehensive structural reforms. This will help these countries to strengthen competitiveness, increase the flexibility of their economies and enhance their longer-term growth potential. In this respect, labour market reforms are key, with a focus on the removal of rigidities and the implementation of measures which enhance wage flexibility. In particular, we should see the elimination of automatic wage indexation clauses and a strengthening of firm-level agreements so that wages and working conditions can be tailored to firms' specific needs. These measures should be accompanied by structural reforms that increase competition in product markets, particularly in services – including the liberalisation of closed professions – and, where appropriate, the privatisation of services currently provided by the public sector, thereby facilitating productivity growth and supporting competitiveness."
South Korea,2011-09-08,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.25% for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.25% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information, the Committee considers that, while emerging market economies have shown favorable performances, the recoveries in major advanced economies including the US have exhibited signs of further weakening. Going forward, the Committee forecasts that the global economy will keep up its recovery albeit at a moderate pace; nevertheless, the Committee judges that the possibility has increased of such factors as the economic sluggishness in major countries, the sovereign debt problems in Europe, and international financial market unrest posing downside risks to the global economy. In Korea, exports continued to show high growth and domestic demand increased modestly. Labor market conditions also remained on a track of improvement, led by the private sector. The Committee sees the domestic economy keeping up its long-term trend of growth going forward, but judges uncertainty as to its growth path to have intensified due to the impact of external risk factors. Consumer price inflation rose to the 5% range in August, due mostly to sharp rises in the prices of agricultural products. The Committee expects the high rate of price increase to continue for some time, driven largely by inflation expectations, although factors such as the stabilization of agricultural product prices and the base effect from last year will work to bring inflation down in the coming months. Core inflation meanwhile increased to 4.0%, and is forecast to remain elevated for the time being. As for housing prices, those in Seoul and its surrounding areas maintained their July levels, while prices in the rest of the country increased at a faster pace. The rate of increase in leasehold deposits rose in August compared to the previous month. In the financial markets, price variables including interest rates, stock prices and the exchange rate, which had fluctuated widely from the start of August due mainly to the impact of external risk factors, have shown signs of stabilizing somewhat, but the unease concerning changes in external conditions seems to still exist. Looking ahead, the Committee, while closely monitoring financial and economic risk factors both at home and abroad, will conduct monetary policy with a greater emphasis on ensuring that the basis for price stability is firmly anchored while the economy continues its sound growth."
Malaysia,2011-09-08,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.00 percent. Global growth has moderated in the recent months as growth in the advanced economies slowed by more than expected following the greater policy uncertainties, worsening of confidence and heightened financial market volatilities, amidst continued weaknesses in labour market conditions. Going forward, the advanced economies are expected to register a slower pace of growth than earlier anticipated. In the Asian region, sustained domestic demand is expected to continue to support economic growth amid weaker external performance. Prolonged uncertainties in the financial markets, weakness in the labour market and the prevailing fiscal conditions in the advanced economies have heightened the downside risks and fragility of the global economy. In the domestic economy, recent indicators point to slower growth in external demand following the weaker global economic environment. Domestic growth prospects, however, continue to remain positive, underpinned by the expansion in private consumption and private investment. Employment conditions remain favourable amid sustained business and consumer confidence. The public sector will also continue to support economic growth. Moving forward, the more challenging external environment has, however, increased the downside risks to the domestic economy. Domestic headline inflation moderated slightly to 3.4% in July on account of slower increase in the transport category. Food price inflation has, however, continued to increase. Going forward, inflation is expected to remain relatively stable for the rest of the year. While cost-push inflation continues to remain, the pace of increase is expected to be more gradual. The upside risks to inflation will also be contingent on whether the strength of domestic demand will be sustained, in the event of further deterioration in the external conditions. In the MPC's assessment, while inflation remains a concern, the increased uncertainties on the global and domestic economic growth prospects and their potential consequences could have a moderating impact on inflation. The MPC will continue to assess carefully the evolving developments surrounding inflation and the economy, and adjust monetary conditions accordingly to ensure the sustainability of growth of the Malaysian economy in an environment of price stability.

Georgia,2011-09-14,"14.09.11 The NBG Keeps Its Policy Rate Unchanged at 7.5% The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on September 14, 2011 and decided to keep its Main Policy Rate (the refinancing rate) unchanged at 7.5 percent. Consumer Price Index increased by 1.1 percent in July, 2011 compared to the previous month. At the same time, due to the base effect, the annual inflation rate decreased to 7.2 percent. The share of food remains high in the annual rate of inflation and amounts to 5.2 percentage points. The core inflation measures keep decreasing. Namely, the inflation net of food and energy (core inflation) decreased 0.1 percent in August. As expected, in the recent months inflation kept decreasing. This trend could possibly continue in future. According to the existing forecasts, the inflation by the end of the year will be within the target level. Notably, the loans extended in the national currency have increased in the recent period, particularly in case of loans extended to legal persons. The increase of national currency loans to the economy will promote economic growth with less risks accumulating. Recently the growth in economic activity has been stable. The decrease of the interest rates, decided on by the MPC at previous meetings has not yet been fully transmitted to economic activity. Accordingly, at this stage the committee decided to keep the policy rate unchanged. The NBG will closely monitor developments in the economy and financial markets and will act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on October 26, 2011."
Russia,2011-09-14,"The Bank of Russia External and Public Relations Department informs that on 14 September 2011 the Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia decided to keep the refinancing rate unchanged; and starting from 15 September 2011 to increase interest rates on the Bank of Russia deposit operations by 0.25 percentage points and to reduce interest rates on certain liquidity provision operations by 0.25 percentage points (table “Interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations”). The decision was supported by the assessment of inflation risks and risks to the sustainability of economic growth, including those associated with the uncertainty of the outlook for global economic activity, as well as of current money market conditions and the dynamics of the factors affecting banking sector liquidity. Implemented decision aimed at narrowing the gap between interest rates on the Bank of Russia liquidity provision and absorption operations should contribute to restrain money market interest rates volatility regarding the risks of the shortage of the rouble liquidity in the banking sector. The pace of inflation continued to decrease and as of 5 September 2011 reached 8.0% over year ago (8.2% in August, 9.0% in July). The disinflation was still largely driven by prices on certain categories of food products. Favourable harvest forecasts for main agricultural products combined with the decline in the inflation expectations could contribute to the reduction of the corresponding inflation risks. Meanwhile the annual rate of service and non-food price inflation continues to pick up. In July positive developments in economic activity persisted: industrial production and fixed capital investment continued to grow broadly in line with the previous months trends. Meanwhile the unemployment rate slightly increased, and this change was only partly explained by the seasonal effects. Relatively low levels of economic confidence indicators reflect the remaining risks to growth sustainability. The probable decline in the propensity to save implied by continuing slowdown in the household deposit growth and faster growth in consumer credit could result in higher level of economic activity but may also be a source of additional inflation pressure. Considering recent domestic and international macroeconomic developments and the effect of the monetary policy measures, implemented in recent months, the Bank of Russia judged that the current level of money market interest rates is appropriate to balance the inflationary risks and the risks of economic growth slowdown in the nearest future. The next meting of the Board of Directors on monetary policy issues is planned to be held in the last decade of October 2011. Interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations(% p.a.).

Chile,2011-09-15,"Central Bank of Chile Press Release* Santiago, 15 September 2011 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 5.25% (annual). Internationally, output indicators confirm slower growth in the United States and Europe, while consensus forecasts for these economies continue to be revised downward. Fiscal and financial risks in the Eurozone have increased, triggering greater financial volatility and high risk premiums in global markets. However, commodity prices are still high. Prospects for interest rate normalization in developed economies have been postponed further, while the tightening cycle in emerging market economies has been interrupted. Domestically, output and demand figures show signs of moderation, in line with projections in the Monetary Policy Report. Labor market conditions are still tight and faster growth in nominal wages is observed. CPI inflation indicators have hovered around 3% y‐o‐y, while core inflation measures remain contained. Inflation expectations are close to the target. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. * The Spanish original prevails."
Peru,2011-09-15,"- MONETARY PROGRAM FOR SEPTEMBER 2011 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE RATE AT 4.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference interest rate at 4.25 percent. This decision takes into account the slowdown observed in economic activity and the intensification of international financial risks. Should these trends continue, the Central Bank will change its monetary policy stance. Inflation in August was affected by transitory factors and recorded a monthly rate of 0.27 percent and an annual rate of 3.35 percent. Core inflation, which registered 0.25 percent, accumulated an annual growth rate of 3.19 percent. Inflation excluding food and energy showed a rate of 0.13 percent and an accumulated annual rate of 2.13 percent. Some current and advanced indicators of activity show a lower pace of growth than in the first semester. Furthermore, indicators of global activity show a lower growth and increased uncertainty continues to be observed in international financial markets. These factors have a potential negative effect on global economic growth as a result of the weak evolution of the U.S. economy and the persistence of risks associated with the fiscal and financial situation of some industrialized countries. The Board continues to oversee the projection of inflation and its domestic and external determinants and stands ready to adopt future adjustments in monetary policy instruments in order to ensure that inflation converges towards the inflation target range, in a context of domestic economic growth. The Board also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as described below: Overnight deposits: 3.45 percent. Direct repo and rediscount operations: 5.05 percent. Swap: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.05 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for October on its session of October 6, 2011."
India,2011-09-16,"Mid-Quarter Monetary Policy Review: September 2011 Monetary Measures On the basis of the current macroeconomic assessment, it has been decided to: increase the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 25 basis points from 8.0 per cent to 8.25 per cent with immediate effect. Consequent to the above increase in the repo rate, the reverse repo rate under the LAF will stand automatically adjusted to 7.25 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate to 9.25 per cent with immediate effect. Introduction Since the Reserve Bank's First Quarter Review of July 26, the global macroeconomic outlook has worsened. There is growing consensus that sluggishness will persist longer than earlier expected. Concerns over the sovereign debt problem in the euro area have added further uncertainty to the prospects of recovery. Domestically, even as many indicators point to moderating growth, both 12011-12. Stabilisation of energy prices and moderating domestic demand should facilitate this process. However, in the current scenario, with the likelihood of inflation remaining high for the next few months, rising inflationary expectations remain a key risk. This makes it imperative to persevere with the current anti-inflationary stance. Global Economy The global economy slowed in Q2 (April-June) of 2011. Lead indicators such as purchasing managers' indices (PMIs) suggest a further moderation in economic activity in Q3, with the global manufacturing PMI approaching the neutral level of 50. In recent weeks, global financial markets have been rattled by perceptions of inadequate solutions to the euro area sovereign debt problem, exposure of banks to euro area sovereign debt and renewed fears of recession. Global recovery will also be affected by fiscal consolidation measures in some of the advanced economies. In the US, apart from fiscal concerns, stubbornly high unemployment and weak housing markets continued to weigh on consumer confidence and private consumption. In response to the weakening of economic activity, the US Federal Open Market Committee, in its 9th August meeting, indicated that it would keep the federal funds rate near zero at least through mid-2013. Economic activity in the euro area decelerated significantly during Q2 of 2011 reflecting decline in both private and government consumption expenditures as well as deceleration in capital formation. Economic activity contracted in Japan reflecting the impact of the earthquake/tsunami. In contrast to advanced economies, growth remained relatively resilient in emerging and developing economies, notwithstanding some moderation in response to monetary tightening to contain inflation. 23.3 per cent in July. However, excluding capital goods, the growth of IIP was higher at 6.7 per cent in July as compared with 4.4 per cent in June. Cumulatively, the IIP increased by 5.8 per cent during April-July 2011, compared with an increase of 9.7 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year. The HSBC Purchasing Managers' Index for the manufacturing sector also suggested moderation. Corporate margins in Q1 of 2011-12 moderated across several sectors compared to their levels in Q4 of 2010-11. However, barring a few sectors, significant pass-through of rising input costs is still visible. Monsoon rains so far have been normal. The first advance estimates for the 2011-12 kharif season point to a record production of rice, oilseeds and cotton, while the output of pulses may decline. Inflation Headline year-on-year wholesale price index (WPI) inflation rose from 9.2 per cent in July to 9.8 per cent in August 2011. Inflation in respect of primary articles and fuel groups edged up in August. Year-on-year non-food manufactured products inflation rose from 7.5 per cent in July to 7.7 per cent in August 2011 suggesting as yet persistent demand pressures. The oil marketing companies raised the price of petrol by 3.14 per litre with effect from September 16, 2011. This will have a direct impact of 7 basis points to WPI inflation, in addition to indirect impact with a lag. The new combined (rural and urban) consumer price index (base: 2010=100) rose to 110.4 in July from 108.8 in June. Other consumer price indices registered inflation rates in the range of 8.4 to 9.0 per cent in July. Money and the government securities markets have remained orderly. In recent weeks, as a result of global risk aversion, the rupee has depreciated, which may have adverse implications for inflation. Monetary transmission strengthened further with 45 scheduled commercial banks raising their Base Rates by 25-100 basis points after the July Review. Consequently, the modal base rate of banks rose to 10.75 per cent in August from 10.25 per cent in July. Fiscal Conditions The central government's fiscal imbalances widened during April-July of 2011 reflecting, primarily, the impact of decline in revenue receipts coupled with pressures from non-plan revenue expenditures on account of higher petroleum and fertiliser subsidies. Fiscal deficit at 55.4 per cent of the budget estimates in the first four months of the current fiscal was significantly higher than that of 42.5 per cent during the corresponding period last year (when adjusted for the more than budgeted spectrum proceeds)."
Nigeria,2011-09-19,"Central Bank of Nigeria Communique No. 78 of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting. September 19, 2011 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on 19th September, 2011 to review domestic economic conditions during the first eight months of 2011 and the challenges facing the Nigerian economy against the backdrop of developments in the international economic and financial environment in order to reassess the challenges facing monetary policy for the rest of 2011. On the global scene, the Committee noted that current international developments presented substantial economic uncertainties, clouding the outlook for global growth and inflation. These developments included: increasingly weak and volatile global financial markets, deepening debt crisis in the Eurozone, global implications of slow growth at a time of limited fiscal flexibility, rising commodity and food prices, and costly natural disasters. There is a general expectation that there would be a slowdown in almost all advanced economies in the near term, raising fears of a second recession. These developments, in the Committee's view, affect the domestic economy through trade and financial flows. Also 1 international financial markets present a very volatile and uneven picture, reflecting a high degree of uncertainty. The Committee also noted that, there is increasing concern about the sustainability of public debt globally. The high fiscal deficits suggest that policies to usher in fiscal discipline are critical for restoring public confidence in Government finances. The Committee welcomed the Federal Government's expressed intent to contain fiscal deficits within credible limits over the medium term. On the domestic front, the MPC noted that inflationary pressures faced by the domestic economy had slightly moderated following the series of monetary policy tightening measures adopted by the Bank, complemented by a favourable harvest. The output growth remained robust, although the current security challenges could undermine investors' confidence and output in the near term. Nonetheless the inflation outlook appears uncertain despite the expected favorable agricultural production, the stability in expectations engendered by the imminent conclusion of the banking sector reforms, and the prospects for a return to a regime of fiscal prudence in the medium-term following the reconstitution of the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) Economic Management Team. It is against this backdrop that the Committee considered the 2 monetary policies required to attain the objectives of price and financial stability in the short to medium term. Key Domestic Macroeconomic and Financial Developments Output and Prices The Committee observed that the output growth rate for the second quarter 2011 remained robust. Provisional data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) indicated that real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 772 per cent in the second quarter of 2011, which is above the 769 per cent recorded in the second quarter of 2010. Overall GDP growth for 2011 is projected at 785 per cent which is slightly lower than the 787 recorded in 2010. The non-oil sector remained the major driver of growth, recording 882 per cent growth rate compared with 181 per cent for the oil and gas sector in the second quarter of 2011. The growth drivers remained agriculture, wholesale and retail trade, and services, which contributed 248, 188 and 252 per cent, respectively. Domestic Prices 3 The Committee noted that the moderation in inflationary pressures, which commenced towards the end of the second quarter of 2011, continued into the third quarter. The year-on-year headline inflation rate decreased from 94 per cent in July 2011 to 93 per cent in August and core inflation decelerated from 115 per cent to 109 per cent during the same period. However food inflation rose to 87 per cent in August 2011, from 79 per cent in July. The harvesting of early maturing crops, especially maize, tomatoes, vegetables, potatoes and fruits played a key role in the moderation of headline inflation. The recently announced government policies and programmes are likely to have a salutary impact on agricultural output, if speedily implemented. These expectations are however currently under threat from anticipated fiscal injections, increased government borrowing to finance the huge fiscal deficit in the 2011 budget, the recent upward revision of electricity tariffs and the anticipated deregulation of petroleum product prices, among other factors. Monetary Credit and Financial Market Developments Broad money (M2) grew by 855 per cent in the eight months to August 2011, which annualized to a growth rate of 1282 per cent. Aggregate domestic credit (net) grew by 1472 per cent in August 2011 when compared with the level in December, 2010. On 4 annualized basis, the growth in net domestic credit translated to 2208 per cent compared with the growth rate of 150 per cent in the corresponding period of 2010. The growth in aggregate credit was accounted for by increases in credit to the Federal Government and the private sector. Credit to the Federal Government grew by 1899 per cent, which annualized to 2848 per cent, close to the indicative benchmark of 2929 per cent for 2011. Similarly credit to the private sector grew by 1088 per cent, which annualized to 1632 per cent, as against the benchmark of 2334 per cent. With the banking crisis approaching a final resolution with the recapitalization of banks, it is expected that banks will increase lending once integration issues are concluded. Interest rates in all segments of the interbank money market rose in response to the upward review of the MPR at the previous MPC meeting. The Inter-bank and Open Buy Back (OBB) rates both opened at 749 per cent on July 27, 2011 and rose to 110 per cent and 1036 per cent on September 15, 2011, respectively. The retail lending rates which had remained relatively high, however, declined during the period. The average maximum lending rate declined to 2227 per cent in August, 2011 from 2242 per cent in July. The weighted average saving rate rose to 146 per cent from 142 per cent over the same period. The consolidated deposit rate declined during the period from 242 to 230 per cent. Thus the spread between the average maximum lending rate and the consolidated 5 deposit rate narrowed marginally from 200 per cent to 1997 per cent during the period. The bearish performance of the stock market continued during the review period as the All-Share Index (ASI) decreased by 155 per cent from 24,,98020 at end-June, 2011 to 21,,10667 on September 16, 2011. Market Capitalization (MC) decreased by 157 per cent from N799 trillion to N673 trillion during the same period. Despite the bearish performance, the equity market was more or less fairly valued as reflected in the NSE Price-Earnings (PE) ratios of 1082 in August 2011, which was close to the 10-year 8-month median of 1157. Moreover the performance of the NSE during the review period is consistent with the performance of other stock markets around the world, and reflects lingering risk aversion and deleveraging on the part of foreign institutional investors who are key players on the NSE. External Sector Developments At the wDAS, the exchange rate, during the period (July 27  September 15, 2011) opened at N15000/US$ and closed at N15352/US$ ,,representing a depreciation of N352 or 235 per cent. At the inter-bank segment, the selling rate opened at N15180/US$ and closed at N15630/US$, representing a depreciation of N450 or 296 per cent during the period. The exchange rate recorded a 6 modest appreciation at the BDC segment where the selling rate opened at N16300/US$ and closed at N15800/US$, representing an appreciation of N500 or 307 per cent. The appreciation recorded in the BDC segment of the market was attributed to the increased supply of foreign exchange by the CBN and the removal of ceilings on DMBs' sales to BDCs. The Committee noted that the premium between the rates at the WDAS and the interbank stabilized towards the end of the review period, while that of the BDCs narrowed significantly, suggesting the need to sustain existing measures to improve the efficiency of the market. The Committee also noted the modest accretion to external reserves during the period. Gross external reserves stood at US$3485 billion on 15th September, 2011, representing an increase of US$112 billion or 332 per cent above the level of US$3373 billion attained on July 21, 2011. The increase was mainly accounted for by increased inflows of royalties into the federation account, reflecting the upward trend in international oil prices and stable oil production in the Niger Delta. Besides foreign direct and portfolio investments increased over the last eight months. Foreign capital inflows for the first eight months of 2011 stood at US$566 billion which is US$106 billion or 2304 per cent higher than the US$460 billion recorded in the corresponding period of 2010. The Committee's Considerations The key concerns noted by the Committee were: 1. Continuing expansionary fiscal stance and high component of recurrent expenditure; 2. Liquidity surge expected from AMCON intervention, following conclusion of bank recapitalization; 3. Sharp rise in month-on-month headline inflation rate despite falling headline inflation rate on year-on-year basis; 4. Need to have positive real interest rates; and 5. Persisting demand pressure in the foreign exchange market, driven by significant liquidity injections and reflecting structural deficiencies that have perpetuated the import dependence of the economy. The Committee considered that given the difficult and uncertain international environment, it is important to ensure that the current trends in growth are sustained and price stability is maintained. The recent data on inflation showed that the headline inflation rate has been maintained within single digit for two consecutive months. However concerns remain about sustaining the present inflation trend. The Committee viewed the rise in the monthly headline inflation rate in August which, while justifiable from the point of view 8 of the large household expenditures on account of festivities, was sharp and out of line with the trend in the preceding 11 months. Besides the anticipated high liquidity in the near future would have a bearing on inflation. The fiscal stance continues to be expansionary. The announcement of a target of one per cent annual reduction in government recurrent spending when viewed in the context of the anticipated injections associated with the implementation of the new national minimum wage, suggests that the fiscal retrenchment is likely to be drawn-out. In addition, there is the weight of structural factors such as the announced hikes in electricity tariffs and the expected removal of petroleum subsidy. Moreover the AMCON injection of N30 trillion is going to add to liquidity surge with attendant adverse impact on prices. It is for these reasons that the Committee felt the need for further tightening of monetary policy. On the other hand, the Committee noted that rates have been increased in the last four consecutive MPC meetings and that high lending rates increase the cost of finance for SMEs and this has an adverse consequence for growth and job creation. However having considered the arguments for and against tightening, the Committee voted for maintaining the stance of tightening in the short term. The Committee emphasized that for monetary policy to be effective it would need to be complemented by other policies, both structural 9 and fiscal. Monetary policy can only address the monetary aspects of inflation while fostering growth and financial stability. The need for accelerating fiscal retrenchment and structural adjustment can therefore not be overemphasized. Decisions In the light of the above considerations the Committee decided as follows: 1. majority of 8 to 3 members voted for a tightening of monetary policy. Seven members voted for a 50 basis-point increase in MPR from 875 to 925 per cent. One member voted for a 100- basis-point increase in MPR. The 3 remaining members voted to maintain the MPR at the current rate. A Unanimous decision to: a. maintain the current symmetric corridor of +/-200 basis points around the MPR; and b. retain the current CRR of 40 per cent Sanusi Lamido Sanusi. CON Governor Central Bank of Nigeria September 19, 2011 10 PERSONAL STATEMENTS BY MPC MEMBERS: 10 ALADE. SARAH Headline inflation declined marginally to 93 percent in August 2011 from 94 percent recorded in July, but food price inflation increased from 79 to 87 in spite of the favourable harvest. The monetary tightening effected so far by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has helped to contain inflation; however, inflation expectations need to be firmly anchored. Base on this. I believe that a moderate increase in monetary policy rate is needed at this point as a premature change in the policy stance could harden inflationary expectations, thereby diluting the impact of past policy actions. While both headline and core inflation declined, food inflation increased from 79 percent in July to 87 percent in August. Headline and core inflation declined to 93 and 109 percent respectively; however, food inflation increased reflecting global volatility in food prices. This should come as a surprise as the usual seasonal effect during harvest did not help to moderate food price inflation in the middle of harvest season. The outlook on food price inflation will be hinged on the trend in global commodity prices. Global commodity prices have been volatile and can put undue pressure on headline inflation. Food price shocks tend to have large second-round effects especially when food component is high in the consumption basket and where inflation expectations are not firmly anchored. Therefore the 11 possibility that commodity price swings can make it hard to meet a headline inflation target is a reason for continued tightening. Minimum Wage increase, electricity tariff increase the removal of petroleum subsidy could pose upside risk to inflation in the short-run. The planned policy to remove the subsidy on fuel product by the Federal government of Nigeria and the minimum wage increase could further aggravate inflationary pressure in the economy and monetary tightening is needed to counter the effects of these policy actions which are good for long-run economic growth. Real interest rate continues to be negative. To remain competitive and benefit from the increased investment inflows to emerging markets as a result of uncertainties in advance countries, real interest rate needs to be corrected for inflation with monetary policy. AMCON activities in the recapitalized banks are injecting liquidity in the system. As AMCON tries to conclude the resolution of the troubled banks by bond issues, more liquidity will be injected into the system, putting additional pressure on the inflation dynamics. loose monetary policy stance could further push inflation up. Monetary tightening is needed to preserve the value of the domestic currency. Despite strong fundamentals (high oil prices, increased oil output, high GDP growth rate), the naira continues to depreciate against the US dollar. Although a number of factors could be responsible, one of such factor is the supply side effects of money supply. Tightening monetary policy will ease the pressure on the foreign exchange market and help stabilize the foreign exchange market. 12 While there are still pockets of downside risks in the domestic banking sector, the resolution action taken by the Central Bank is helping to restore confidence in the banking sector. The return in confidence needs to be solidified by concrete action, such as giving the banks the space to consolidate their position play in the market. There are indications that foreign direct investment inflow has resumed and a well anchored inflation would help attract foreign investors to the country. However this will require a balancing act: while abrupt easing could encourage banks to take on more risks, further monetary tightening could squeeze liquidity conditions in the market with adverse impact on economic activities. Based on the above. I would support a moderate increase in monetary policy rate as a premature change in the policy stance could harden inflationary expectations, thereby diluting the impact of past policy actions. .0 BARAU. SULEIMAN A KEY DEVELOPMENTS SINCE THE LAST MPC A1 It is remarkable to note that year-on-year headline inflation rate moderated to 93% in August from 94% in July, 2011. The major drivers for the decline being clothing, footwear and healthcare costs. Food inflation, however, increased from 79% to 87% over the same period driven by adjustments in processed food, fish and seafood, oil and fats, potatoes and other tubers. Clothing footwear and healthcare costs were also responsible for the decline in core inflation from 115% to 109% during the review period. .2 It is also significant to note that Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew modestly from 664% to 772% for quarter one and two respectively. 13 A3 In the foreign exchange markets, the Naira depreciated between July and September in the WDAS market by N357 or 236% and interbank market by N450 or 296%. However the Naira appreciated in the Bureau De Change (BDC) segment by N500 or 316%. The premium between WDAS and BDC rates narrowed positively to below 2% in August from 9% that was earlier witnessed. .4 Developments in respect of foreign reserves management have also been positive. Net flows have been positive, with foreign reserves increasing by 332 per cent to US$3485 billion from US$3373 billion on September 15, 2011 and on July 21, 2011 respectively. CONTEXT  Pressure points In order to make a recommendation for policy, it is important to critically examine the above developments and to form a view on the direction of issues that are important and critical. Inflation - It is true that inflation rate has trended down, but the upside risk to inflation going forward are real for the following reasons; • Increased fiscal spending arising from the rush to comply with year- end budgetary spending. Capital expenditure performance currently at less than 30% gives room for radical increase in spending in the next few months. Month-on-Month headline inflation actually inched upward during the review period, suggesting that the year-on-year inflation rate needs to trend downward on a sustained basis over time. Threats of imported inflation is still real, 14 • The declining trend in year-on-year headline inflation needs to be observed beyond two months that we witnessed to give comfort, that the trend is sustained. Liquidity from activities of AMCON is also a threat. The need to bring MPR to positive real rate territory is a compelling one that commends further tightening. Likely removal of petroleum subsidy is a political decision that could be implemented at very short notice. Compliance with minimum wage demands at all tiers of government, could potentially exacerbate the liquidity situation. Foreign Exchange Market In spite of the recent tight monetary stance, speculative demand for foreign exchange at all segments of the market has not abated. This is a major indicator of systemic liquidity surfeit. Meanwhile it will be unwise to depreciate the Naira based on speculative demand given the potential impact of unguarded depreciation on prices and inflation. Market rates and Growth Even though market volatility has reduced, market interest rates have trended upwards to reflect recent adjustments in MPR. The challenge is how to achieve positive real rates of interest (low inflation and higher lending rates) without negatively impacting credit and GDP growth. It is important to note, however, that we recorded GDP growth in the last quarter inspite of our tightening stance, underscoring the huge liquidity still left in the system. 15 C Recommendations In view of the foregoing. I make the following recommendations; • Continuation of the tightening stance of monetary policy • Upward adjustment of MPR by 50bps from 875 to 925 per cent • Maintenance of the corridor of +/- 2 per cent around the MPR • Cash Reserve Ratio to remain at 4 per cent 30 GARBA. ABDUL GANIYU Decision I vote for: I Holding the MPR at 875% II. Maintaining the Asymmetric Corridor for SLF and SDF III. Quantitative Tightening through more aggressive OMO to keep operating targets (OBB and Call Rate) around MPR+200 basis point. As observed from available data, the OBB and Call Rate averaged 813% and 86% respectively in the period between July MPC and September MPC meetings. Clearly the operating targets were well below desired targets leaving ample room for further tightening using OMO. Justification I First I am convinced that a more aggressive OMO to achieve the upper limit of the symmetric corridor (MPR+200 Basis Point) will substantially tighten liquidity without the unintended consequences of a higher MPR. I Second. I expect inflation to trend downwards driven mainly by expected fall in food prices in September and October as food crops are harvested and marketed. am mindful of the multi-dimensional global crisis with vortex in 16 the US. EU. Japan and the BRICs and the possible implications for commodity prices. The pass through effects will depend largely on (a) the exchange rate and (b) domestic production and demand. There are speculations about imminent removal of subsidies on petroleum products and increase in electricity tariffs. However both policies are more likely to cause shifts in the general prices (a correction) than a sustained increase in prices. I Third, in an inflation-unemployment trade-off. I give greater weight to employment creation for economic, social and security considerations. While SMEs which tend to have high employment elasticities have limited access to credit in the retail end of the money market, higher interest rates will limit access further and, increase the likelihood of current loan portfolio's becoming non-performing: a threat to jobs, growth and stability. IV Fourth, while a positive real rate of interest is desirable to attract foreign investment, achieving it through MPR hikes generates a trade-off: between foreign capital inflows (FDI and Portfolio) on one hand, and local businesses growth and jobs on the other hand. vote in favor of local businesses and jobs. am not convinced that given the volatility and instabilities in the global economic system and the declines in the Nigerian capital market that portfolio flows is good for the economy. Furthermore with the competitiveness challenges of Nigeria vis a vis its needs to create decent jobs. I am not convinced that Nigeria will attract the right FDI inflows with the highest growth (output and productivity) and employment elasticities. Fifth, between January and August, the Capital market has lost about two Trillion Naira and Staff projections estimate a bottoming up at 15,,000 All Share Index (ASI). It is of course rational to expect that asset prices will fall as interest rate rises. Consequently there is a strong chance that the likely effects on the equities market, the bond market and, indeed, the forex market will be incompatible with policy goals (growth, job creation and stability). 17 VI. Sixth. I am not convinced that interest rate hike at this point will address some of the core challenges such as (a) the likely AMCON effects; (b) the FAAC Effects; (c) banking system risks of exposure to government debts (FGN Bonds and Treasury Bills); (c) excessive Federal Debts and distortions in spending structures or (d) subsisting inefficiencies in the financial system indicated by the excessively high overheads and, high interest rate spreads. VII Seven. I am convinced that many of the challenges are institutional and, to a lesser extent structural. The implication being that such institutional and structural challenges require institutional changes, new incentive systems and outcome inspired and outcome-oriented fiscal actions. VIII Finally, harmony between the fiscal system and monetary system is critical to the medium to long term success of fiscal and monetary policies and indeed, macroeconomic management. It is of the outmost necessity, that the fiscal system be brought into harmony with monetary policy and to be bounded by the requirements for price stability, sustained growth in investment, employment, productivity and output. It is also, important that monetary system is similarly, bounded. .0 LEMO. TUNDE The global economy continues to grow sluggishly as USA now grapples with the effects of a downgrade and the impact on the yield on her bonds. The risk exists of another global recession arising from the growing sovereign debt crises in Europe as well as the concern about the excess capacity in the Chinese real estate market. This has implication for the sustainability of the existing high community prices. 18 The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) projected a growth rate of 839 per cent for the Nigerian economy during the fourth quarter of 2011. Overall GDP growth for 2011 was projected at780 per cent in 2010. This is a welcome development in spite of the consistent increase in MPR in the last few months as well as not-too-impressive growth in the credit to the private sector. The modest increase in External Reserves which stood at USD3485b as at September 15, 2011 is a welcome development but additional reserve accretion is required to build up robust external reserve to cushion the possible effect of a crash in crude oil price in the near future. Exchange rates remain fairly stable and generally within the 3% band with a near convergence of WDAS and BDC rates. This equilibrium may however be threatened by the build-up of liquidity pressure resulting from the repayment of NNPC debt, implementation of new minimum wage, fiscal activities resulting from the implementation of 2011 Budget at the benchmark price of USD75 per barrel as well as additional injection resulting from AMCON activities following conclusion of intervened banks' recapitalization. INFLATION Developments up to the third quarter of 2011 indicate that the inflationary pressures are moderating following the series of monetary policy tightening measures adopted by MPC at the last 4 meetings. However estimates from the National Bureau of Statistics indicate that year-on-year core inflation is expected to hit 10% in November 2011. The possibility of fuel subsidy removal as well as increase in electricity tariff may also exacerbate the pressure. Short-term money market rates have moved up in tandem with our tightening mode in the last few months and whereas negative real interest persists in Nigeria, it is heartwarming to note that the gap has narrowed substantially. This in addition to the relatively stable exchange regime has led to a significant increase in capital flow in the 19 last few months. MPC should push harder towards positive real interest regime to enhance Nigeria's competitiveness as an attractive portfolio and FDI destination. DECISION In view of the foregoing therefore and in order to consolidate on the gains of the past. I vote for the continuation of the tightening mode and recommend an upward adjustment of MPR by 50 basis points ie. from 875% to 925% while the existing symmetric corridor of +/- 2% around the MPR remains unchanged. This stance will help to fight the expected surging inflation resulting from the increase in fiscal activities, stem expected elevated demand for foreign exchange and accelerate our march towards positive real interest rates. .0 MOGHALU. KINGSLEY CHIEDU I had hoped that I would vote at this meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee in favour of holding the Monetary Policy Rate steady at the rate of 875 per cent, or at the most voting for further tightening by 25 basis points. My expectation was based on the reports that following a series of rate increases by the MPC, inflation was moderating. The nuances evident in the staff reports and projections, however, lead me to support another rate increase by 50 basis points, bringing the MPR to 925 per cent. Two main factors in my view account for the need to continue tightening. The first is the current and anticipated liquidity injections into the financial system through Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) and fiscal expenditure by the Federal Government in the last quarter of 2011. AMCON bonds of about 3 trillion naira covering purchases of non-performing loans in 20 banks and the recapitalization of the CBN-intervened banks will result in enhanced liquidity over the medium term. While one is encouraged by the commitment of the fiscal authorities to fiscal retrenchment, as evidenced by the policy stance of the reconstituted Economic Management Team, this goal will take a number of budget cycles to attain. In the short term, monetary policy tools must be deployed to contain the consequences of an expansionary fiscal stance until fiscal and monetary policy converge on measures to control inflation. Moreover increases in electricity tariffs and the anticipated  and necessary - deregulation of petroleum product prices are likely to have an inflationary impact. Secondly while interest rates have been moving in a real positive direction given rate increases and the moderation of inflationary threats, it remains necessary to accelerate and sustain this process in order to increase Nigeria's competitive advantage as an investment destination, which is presently at a disadvantage when compared to countries such as Ghana and South Africa. Moving real interest rates into positive territory relative to inflation will also contribute to increased deposit and savings rates when, as expected, the CBN withdraws its interbank guarantee on December 31, 2011 and commercial banks have to compete more actively for deposits. For the reasons above, combined with the staff projections of increased inflationary trends before a return to reduced inflation over the next six months, it is necessary to increase the MPR by 50 basis points as a precautionary measure to obviate the inflationary factors that still lie ahead and to consolidate the evident gains of the monetary tightening stance maintained by the MPC over the past several months. 21 I also vote for maintaining the symmetric corridor at plus/minus 2 per cent and retaining the cash reserve ratio at 4 per cent. conclude by noting a need to maintain a more cautionary stance about tightening going forward in light of an uncertain global economic outlook in which a return to global recession cannot be ruled out. .0 OLOFIN. SAM It is cheering news that headline, year-on- year, inflation rate has declined to 93 percent in August, 2011, and core inflation rate has fallen to 109 percent, even if food inflation has risen slightly to 87 per cent compared with the figures that were before us at the last meeting. This development can be partly attributed to monetary policy tightening measures that have been in place over the last two quarters or thereabout. We have over the last couple of months been wondering whether a single digit inflation rate is attainable in 2011 or not, and if so, would it be sustainable and for how long. Going by the reports we have before us at this meeting, we can answer the first part of the question in the affirmative. However as to whether the observed declining trend in inflation rate is sustainable over the medium term remains debatable if not out-rightly no, for a number of reasons. First the observed decline in inflation rate is also partly attributable to a seasonal factor of improved harvests and consequent decline in domestic food prices. There is however no evidence that the prices of imported food which account for nearly 50 percent of food inflation are declining. Secondly with respect to developments in the financial sector, there have been significant developments, indicative of the resolution of the crisis which threatened the stability of the sector and which has been receiving attention since August 2009. The recapitalization measures taken by AMCCON to rescue some of the intervened deposit money banks that were gravely in 22 danger will continue to exert some measure of inflationary pressure through additional liquidity injection into the financial system. Thirdly on the fiscal side, there is strong evidence that the Finance Ministry under the leadership of the new minister would be strongly committed to fiscal discipline and fisc"
Hungary,2011-09-20,"The Monetary Council discussed and commented on the September 2011 issue of the MNB's Quarterly Report on Inflation prepared by Bank staff. In the Council's judgement. Hungarian economic growth is likely to remain subdued over the next two years, with the level of output remaining below its potential throughout the period. Medium-term upside risks to inflation have fallen due to weak domestic demand. Inflation may fall back to 3% by the beginning of 2013, as the effects of cost shocks and increases in indirect taxes wear off. The Monetary Council is closely monitoring developments in tax-adjusted core inflation, in addition to movements in the consumer price index. The deteriorating outlook for economic activity points to a decline in inflation from the demand side. Higher commodity and fuel prices in the first half of the year fed through to core inflation, as reflected mainly in rises in processed food prices. The increases in VAT and excise duties are likely to raise the consumer price index considerably for a short period; however, inflationary pressures from the demand side continue to be extremely low. Subdued inflationary pressures from the demand side are likely to become the dominant factor in developments in annual CPI inflation, as the impact of the cost shocks and the increase in indirect taxes gradually fade. In the Council's judgement, the outlook for Hungarian growth has deteriorated significantly in the past quarter. Domestic demand is likely to be persistently low, reflecting the prolonged process of balance sheet adjustment by households and the further tightening in credit conditions. It is unlikely that the reduction in personal income taxation and disbursements to members of their private pension fund contributions this year will be sufficient to boost domestic household consumption, which has been subdued for some time. The high degree of uncertainty surrounding the outlook for incomes and high levels of debt are impeding the recovery in consumption growth. Investment activity is likely to be extremely subdued due to uncertainty in the business climate, the tightening in credit conditions and the deterioration in the outlook for activity. Large individual investment projects implemented in manufacturing will only partly offset weak investment activity. Service sector investment is unlikely to pick up, due to a significant margin of spare capacity. Household investment is likely to reach its trough at the end of this year, but is expected to remain flat thereafter. The slowdown in global growth and the prolonged problems of the European banking sector point to a more adverse external environment in Hungary's export markets, which is likely to weigh on domestic export growth. However, the large investment projects, mainly in the car industry, will partly offset this effect as they gradual start to produce output. As a result. Hungary's export market share may rise in 2012. Exports are likely to remain the driver of growth over the next two years, despite the slowdown in external demand. Risk premia have risen in the past month and the forint exchange rate has weakened. The increase in perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy was mainly accounted for by the deteriorating outlook for global growth and the protracted debt crisis of the euro area. The option for households to repay their foreign currency debt at below-market rate represents a significant source of uncertainty in terms of Hungary's risk perceptions. There is a risk that the programme will cause a major setback in the domestic banking sector's ability to lend, and companies' reduced access to bank credit may lead to a further deterioration in the outlook for Hungarian growth. In the Council's judgement, increased volatility in financial markets observed recently may persist for some time. The Monetary Council has decided to leave interest rates unchanged in light of the above considerations. Uncertainty in financial markets warrants a wait-and-see policy stance."
Turkiye,2011-09-20,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels: a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) at 5.75 percent, b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 5 percent, lending rate at 9 percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 8 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, lending rate at 12 percent. Recent data releases suggest that there will be a notable reduction in economic growth in the second half of the year. External demand remains weak, and domestic demand continues to slow down. The deceleration in credit growth and domestic demand combined with the exchange rate movements have been contributing to the rebalancing of domestic and external demand. Accordingly, the Committee expects a significant improvement in the current account balance in the forthcoming period. The Committee has noted that core inflation may continue to rise in the short- term. However, due to the slowdown in economic activity, it is expected that the second round effects of exchange rate movements would be limited, and thus the increase in inflation would be temporary. Accordingly, the Committee has indicated that inflation outlook for the end of 2012 is consistent with the 5 percent target. Given the uncertainties regarding the global economy, it is now more important to monitor all developments closely, and to take the required policy measures in a timely manner. Therefore, the Committee has also reiterated that all policy instruments may be eased should global economic problems further intensify and the slowdown in domestic economic activity becomes more pronounced. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days. 2. Annual inflation in food and non-alcoholic beverages group dropped to 6 percent. While unprocessed food prices went up amid the surge in vegetable and meat prices, the annual group inflation went down to 2.98 percent due to the base effect. In the processed food front, price hikes across sub-groups persisted, mainly in bread and cereals besides fats and oils group. Thus, annual processed food inflation maintained its recent uptrend climbing to 8.59 percent. 3. Prices of services edged up by 0.39 percent in August, while annual services inflation increased to 5.68 percent. The surge in transport prices persisted amid soaring fuel prices. The rise in processed food prices continued to affect the prices of catering services. Mild increases in rents continued. As a result, the impact of exchange rate movements on prices of services remained limited to transport services and no significant change was seen in the underlying trend of the group's prices. 4. Annual core goods inflation rose to 6.76 percent owing to the pass-through effect from the depreciation of the Turkish lira. This rise was particularly driven by the developments in prices of durable goods such as automobile and furniture. Annual inflation in clothing group maintained its rising trend. Meanwhile, due to the protective measures taken for imports of textiles and apparel, clothing prices are expected to accelerate in the last quarter of the year.

Quarter-on-quarter economic activity lost momentum as envisaged; however, domestic demand recorded a less-than-expected deceleration. Meanwhile, due to the plunge in imports, the contribution of net exports to quarterly growth turned out to be positive as envisaged. 6. Recent data releases suggest that there will be a notable reduction in economic growth in the second half of the year. Having contracted for five consecutive months, industrial production in seasonally adjusted figures recovered in July. The Committee noted that this increase in July did not reflect the trends of the recent period marked by intensifying global problems.Indeed,leading indicators forproduction and orders point that the slowdown in economic activity will become more pronounced as of August. The persistingdecline in the capacity utilization rate in the July-August period compared to the second quarter average indicates that the slowdown in the activity of manufacturing industry continues. 7. External demand remains weak.The downward revision of growth forecasts for the US and the euro area points to a deteriorating outlook for the global economy. Referring to themounting uncertainties over growth in the world economy, the Committee noted that despite the competitiveness gains due to the exchange rate movements, global problems would continue to restrain external demand. 8. Final domestic demand continues to slow down.Due to the depreciation in the Turkish lira, the demand for durable goods, particularly automobile sales, is expected to continue to weaken. The weakcourse of consumer confidence supports this outlook. Declining capacity utilization rates and escalating uncertainty for demand pose a downside risk on investments. All these developments signal that the slowdown in domestic demand will continue. 9. Seasonally-adjusted unemployment rates, which went up due to the deceleration in employment in May, remained flat in June. During this period, employment posted an increase in services and construction sectors, but decreased in the industrial sector in line with expectations. Leading indicators show that this slowdown in industrial employment will continue. (cid:3) (cid:3) 0RQHWDU\(cid:3)3ROLF\(cid:3)DQG(cid:3)5LVNV(cid:3) 10. The Committee has noted that core inflation may continue to rise in the short- term. It was indicated that the pass-through from exchange rates to domestic prices would be observed especially in core goods prices. The Committee stated that, although headline inflation will fall in September owing to the base effect from unprocessed food prices, itmay exceed the target significantly at the end of the year due to the pass-through effect. However, due to the slowdown in economic activity, it is expected that the second round effects of exchange rate movements would be limited, and thus the increase in inflation would be temporary. Accordingly, the Committee has indicated that inflation outlook for the end of 2012 is consistent with the 5 percent target. 11. The deceleration in credit growth and domestic demand combined with the exchange rate movements have been contributing to the rebalancing of domestic and external demand. Third quarter data suggest that components of the aggregate demand evolve in the desired direction. Domestic demand continues to decelerate and there is notable slowdown in imports. Accordingly, the Committee expects a significant improvement in the current account balance in the forthcoming period. However, the Committee members have also highlighted the important role of structural measures that would increase the productivity and the saving rate, in order to stabilize the current account deficit at reasonable levels in the medium to long term. Recently, both the worsening outlook for global economic activity and rapidly increasing concerns on the debt sustainability in Europe has led to a sharp deterioration in the risk appetite. Given the uncertainties regarding the global economy, it is now more important to monitor all developments closely, and to take the required policy measures in a timely manner. Therefore, the Committee has also reiterated that all policy instruments may be eased should global economic problems further intensify and the slowdown in domestic economic activity becomes more pronounced. The Committee members reminded that the measures taken at the August 4, 2011 interim meeting has laid out the ground for a timely, controlled and effective provision of liquidity to the market in case of a possible financial turmoil that may be triggered by global developments. In this respect, it was stated that developments would be monitored very closely and additional measures may be taken before the regular meeting, if deemed necessary. Moreover, with reference to the risk scenarios outlined in the Inflation Report, the Committee, has also reiterated that all policy instruments may be eased should global economic problems further intensify and the slowdown in domestic economic activity becomes more pronounced. Monetary policy will continue to focus on price stability while preserving financial stability as a supplementary objective. To this end, the impact of the macroprudential measures taken by the Central Bank and other institutions on the inflation outlook will be assessed carefully. Strengthening the commitment to fiscal discipline and the structural reform agenda in the medium term would support the relative improvement of Turkey's sovereign risk, and thus facilitate macroeconomic and price stability. Sustaining the fiscal discipline will also provide more flexibility for monetary policy and support the social welfare by keeping interest rates permanently at low levels. Therefore, addressing these issues in the new Medium Term Program and progressing with the structural reforms envisaged by the European Union acquiscommunautaire remains of utmost importance."
United States,2011-09-21,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in August indicates that economic growth remains slow. Recent indicators point to continuing weakness in overall labor market conditions, and the unemployment rate remains elevated. Household spending has been increasing at only a modest pace in recent months despite some recovery in sales of motor vehicles as supply-chain disruptions eased. Investment in nonresidential structures is still weak, and the housing sector remains depressed. However, business investment in equipment and software continues to expand. Inflation appears to have moderated since earlier in the year as prices of energy and some commodities have declined from their peaks. Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee continues to expect some pickup in the pace of recovery over coming quarters but anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only gradually toward levels that the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate. Moreover, there are significant downside risks to the economic outlook, including strains in global financial markets. The Committee also anticipates that inflation will settle, over coming quarters, at levels at or below those consistent with the Committee's dual mandate as the effects of past energy and other commodity price increases dissipate further. However, the Committee will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with the dual mandate, the Committee decided today to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities. The Committee intends to purchase, by the end of June 2012, $400 billion of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 6 years to 30 years and to sell an equal amount of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 3 years or less. This program should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and help make broader financial conditions more accommodative. The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate. To help support conditions in mortgage markets, the Committee will now reinvest principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities. In addition, the Committee will maintain its existing policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. The Committee also decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013. The Committee discussed the range of policy tools available to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability. It will continue to assess the economic outlook in light of incoming information and is prepared to employ its tools as appropriate. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Elizabeth A Duke; Charles L Evans; Sarah Bloom Raskin; Daniel K Tarullo; and Janet L Yellen. Voting against the action were Richard W Fisher. Narayana Kocherlakota, and Charles I Plosser, who did not support additional policy accommodation at this time."
Czech Republic,2011-09-22,"Press conference of the CNB Bank Board 6th Situation Report on Economic and Monetary Developments 22 September 2011 The monetary policy decision taken and the ratio of the votes cast At the close of the meeting the Board decided unanimously to leave the two-week repo rate unchanged at 0.75%. Reasons for the decision Monetary-policy relevant inflation will be close to the inflation target over the entire forecast horizon. Headline inflation will be temporarily slightly above 3% due to a VAT increase. Consistent with the forecast is broad stability of market interest rates at the start of the forecast horizon and a gradual rise in rates starting in late 2011/early 2012. The risks to the forecast are slightly on the downside for inflation and substantially on the downside for interest rates. The growth was driven by net exports and gross capital formation. July industrial production (4.4% y-o-y; 0.1% m-o-m) indicates slowing growth. Total employment increased in 2011 Q2 in y-o-y terms (by 0.6%). The seasonally adjusted ILO unemployment rate was flat at 7% in q-o-q terms. The seasonally adjusted registered unemployment rate slightly decreased in July and August. Decelerating albeit still high, growth in industrial producer prices (5.7%) and agricultural producer prices (16.4%) in August mainly reflects the gradually fading effects of the recent surge in global commodity prices.

South Africa,2011-09-22,"Issued by Gill Marcus. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank. Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee the downside risks to the global and domestic growth prospects have increased. Growth in some of the advanced economies has weakened against the backdrop of financial market turbulence, generated in large part by the unresolved European sovereign debt crisis. Although economic growth in emerging markets is expected to continue to outperform that of the advanced economies, these economies are unlikely to emerge unscathed from the challenging environment. Heightened risk aversion has resulted in increased volatility of capital flows globally and a flight from what are perceived to be more risky emerging market assets. These developments have impacted on the domestic capital and foreign exchange markets. Recent data have confirmed the fragile and uneven nature of the domestic economic recovery, and unfavourable forward-looking indicators are consistent with a downward revision of the Bank's economic growth forecast. At the same time a number of exogenous factors have continued to put upward pressure on domestic inflation. This combination of declining growth and rising inflation poses a challenge to monetary policy going forward, and is a feature being experienced in a number of emerging markets. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas was unchanged at 5,3 per cent in August 2011. The categories of food, housing and utilities, and transport together accounted for 3,7 percentage points of the August outcome. Although food price inflation moderated from 7,5 per cent in July to 7,3 per cent, further acceleration is expected in the coming months. Administered price inflation excluding petrol declined from 9,3 per cent in July to 8,8 per cent in August. Underlying inflation trends remained relatively well contained with CPI excluding food, petrol and electricity declining from 3,9 per cent in July to 3,8 per cent in August. Year-on-year producer price inflation followed a strong upward trend, increasing by 7,4 per cent and 8,9 per cent in June and July respectively. Price increases in the categories of mining, electricity and products of petroleum and coal remained the major contributors to the PPI outcome, but there were also significant contributions from chemical and other manufactures. Food prices continued to trend higher: agricultural prices increased by 5,1 per cent and 6,2 per cent in June and July respectively, while manufactured food prices increased at rates of 5,9 per cent and 6,3 per cent in these months. The inflation forecast of the Bank is more or less unchanged since the previous meeting of the MPC. Inflation is still expected to breach marginally the upper end of the target range in the final quarter of 2011 and to peak in the first quarter of 2012 at around 6,2 per cent before returning to within the target range in the second quarter. Inflation is then expected to decline gradually and to measure 5,5 per cent in the final quarter of 2013. The Bank's forecast of core inflation, which excludes food, petrol and electricity, shows a moderately rising trend, peaking at around 5,1 per cent in the second and third quarters of 2013. Inflation expectations, as reflected in the survey conducted in the third quarter of 2011 by the Bureau for Economic Research at Stellenbosch University remain on average within the target range for the forecast period ending 2013. Inflation is expected to average 5,5 per cent in 2011 and 5,9 per cent in both 2012 and 2013. This represents slight upward adjustments for all three years. While financial analysts and trade union officials expect inflation to remain within the target range over the forecast period, business executives expect average inflation to exceed moderately the upper end of the target range in the coming two years. Inflation expectations as measured by the Reuters survey of financial analysts also remain fairly stable at the upper end of the target range. According to the survey, inflation is expected to average 5,8 per cent and 5,6 per cent in 2012 and 2013 respectively. The growth performance in the advanced economies has remained weak. There is a general expectation of even weaker outcomes in the near-term, although it is still unclear if the stalled state that many economies find themselves in will translate into a recession. The IMF, in its latest World Economic Outlook, has reduced its forecast for US growth by 1,0 per cent in 2011 and by 0,9 per cent in 2012 to 1,5 per cent and 1,8 per cent respectively. Euro area growth has been revised down to 1,6 per cent and 1,1 per cent in these two years. The risks are seen to be on the downside. This slowdown comes against the backdrop of a deterioration in the sovereign debt crisis in the Euro area and the inability of the member countries to reach agreement on a credible and workable solution. Concerns have also spread to the European banking sector, particularly to those banks with exposures to peripheral Europe, resulting in ratings downgrades of a number of French and Italian banks. Growth in the United States is also being affected by continued weakness in the housing market and political disagreements on the pace and nature of fiscal consolidation. Emerging markets are still expected to experience faster growth than the advanced economies, but remain vulnerable to contagion effects from a possible significant slowdown or recession in the advanced economies. In line with the current two-speed global economy, inflation trends are higher in the emerging economies, driven mainly by food and energy prices. Over the past two years, the extraordinarily low interest rate environment in the advanced economies has resulted in significant capital flows to emerging markets, with consequences for their exchange rates and asset prices. However, the pattern of flows has not been smooth. During bouts of global risk aversion, there has been a tendency for these flows to reverse to so-called safe havens. Risk aversion associated with recent events in the US and Europe have resulted in a high degree of volatility of flows to emerging markets, including South Africa. Since the beginning of the year, non-residents have been net sellers of equities to the value of R16,9 billion and net buyers of bonds to the value of R44,3 billion. However, since the beginning of September, non-residents were net sellers of both bonds and equities valued at R4,6 billion and R7,6 billion respectively. These recent outflows, together with increased risk aversion, have contributed to the high degree of volatility observed in the JSE all-share index, in domestic bond yields and in the exchange rate of the rand. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand has traded in a range against the US dollar of between R6.68 and R8,33 per US dollar, and has depreciated by around 15,6 per cent against the dollar, by 11,0 per cent against the euro and by 12,7 per cent on a trade weighted basis. Since the beginning of the year the rand has depreciated by 18,6 per cent against the US dollar. The depreciation of the rand poses a potential upside risk to the inflation outlook. However the degree of this risk will depend on the extent and persistence of the depreciation trend, which in turn will be influenced by the duration and intensity of global risk aversion. The rand tends to be more sensitive to changes in global risk perceptions than most of its emerging market peers. At this stage the MPC still considers the upside risk to the inflation outlook from this source to be relatively moderate, but rising. Domestic economic growth remains disappointing, with the negative output gap widening to around 3 per cent in the second quarter of 2011 and gross domestic product growing by 1,3 per cent, following the 4,5 per cent increase recorded in the first quarter. Both the primary and secondary sectors contracted in the second quarter, while real value added by the tertiary sector increased only marginally. Wide-spread industrial action, which continued into the third quarter, contributed to this subdued outcome, and is expected to weigh negatively on third quarter prospects as well. Recent high frequency indicators are also not very favourable. Mining production contracted at a year-on-year rate of 5,1 per cent in July, and by 4,3 per cent on a month-on-month basis. Manufacturing output declined at a month-on-month and year-on-year rate of 6,0 per cent in July, confirming the sharp decline to 44,2 index points observed in the Kagiso/BER Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) in July. Despite a modest recovery in August to 46,7 index points, the PMI remained below the neutral 50 level, pointing to a further possible contraction in the sector. The construction sector also remains subdued with both the FNB Building Confidence Index and the FNB Civil Construction Index remaining at very low levels, while there was a further decline in the number of building plans passed in the third quarter. Overall business confidence, as reflected in the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index, has declined for two consecutive quarters, and at 39 index points is well below the neutral level of 50. The Bank has lowered its forecast for average growth in 2011 to 3,2 per cent, down from 3,7 per cent, while the forecast for 2012 has been reduced from 3,9 per cent to 3,6 per cent. The forecast for 2013 remains unchanged at 4,4 per cent. The lower forecast is a result of the lower-than-expected outcome in the second quarter, as well as a downward adjustment to the global growth assumption. The risks to this outlook are seen to be on the downside. The lower growth trajectory does not bode well for employment creation, which has been relatively muted. According to Statistics South Africa, employment in the formal non-agricultural business sector increased by 0,1 per cent or 5,701 people in this second quarter of 2011. The outcome was, however, negatively affected by the decline in public sector employment associated with the termination of contracts of temporary employees hired for the municipal elections. Consistent with the moderation in domestic production, growth in real gross domestic expenditure also declined, from an annualised growth rate of 7,9 per cent in the first quarter of 2011, to 1,3 per cent in the second quarter. A positive development was the further acceleration in the growth of real gross fixed capital formation, albeit off a low base, from an annualised rate of 2,7 per cent in the first quarter to 4,0 per cent in the second quarter. Nevertheless the ratio of gross fixed capital formation to GDP, at 18,9 per cent, is still well below the peak of 24,6 per cent measured in the fourth quarter of 2008. Consumption expenditure by households has to date been the main driver of growth. However, in the second quarter of 2011, growth in consumption expenditure moderated to an annualised rate of 3,8 per cent, compared with an increase of 5,2 per cent in the first quarter. Real retail trade sales increased at a year-on-year rate of 2,8 per cent in July, but declined by 0,7 per cent in the three months to July compared with the previous three months. Growth in motor vehicle sales, while still positive, has also declined. Consumption patterns may have been distorted somewhat by the high base effects arising from the 2010 World Cup, and a clearer picture should emerge in August. The RMB/BER Consumer Confidence Index has declined for two consecutive quarters, underlying the fragility of the outlook. Consumption expenditure is expected to remain constrained to some extent by low rates of credit extension and continued debt deleveraging by households. The ratio of household debt to disposable income declined further to 75,9 per cent in the second quarter of 2011 from a peak of 82,0 per cent in the first two quarters of 2008. Twelve-month growth in total loans and advances extended by banks to the private sector has fluctuated around 6 per cent in the three months to July. Mortgage advances, which is the largest category of credit, grew at a year-on-year rate of 2,9 per cent, consistent with the slow pace of recovery in the domestic property market. The main driver of growth in credit extension was the category of other loans and advances, in particular general loans which reflect primarily corporate sector borrowing. This category grew by almost 15 per cent in the year to end of July. Nominal wage settlements have continued to moderate somewhat, and have been lower than many of the highly publicised initial demands. Nevertheless, wage increases have been well above the upper end of the inflation target range. The main upside risks to the inflation forecast continue to emanate from administered prices and exogenous factors. Since the previous meeting of the MPC the price of Brent crude oil has fluctuated in a range of around US$104 and US$118 per barrel. The outlook for the oil price will be determined in part by global growth developments, and in particular by the extent to which China is affected by the slowdown. The recent depreciation of the rand against the US dollar is likely to contribute to a further increase in the domestic petrol price in October. Food prices are also expected to maintain their upward momentum for some time. The major global food price indices have remained relatively stable but at elevated levels during the past few months. However global wheat and maize prices have increased markedly, and have impacted on the domestic prices of these commodities. These increases have been compounded by the weaker exchange rate of the rand. The price of white maize for example, has increased by over 70 per cent during the past year, but futures prices reflect some expected moderation in the medium term. The MPC remains of the view that the underlying inflation pressures are mainly of a cost push nature, and at this stage there is no evidence of significant second round effects from these increases. Although the inflation trend remains on an upward trajectory, both headline and core inflation forecasts appear to be consistent with the continued attainment of the inflation target over time. Demand side pressures remain subdued and are expected to be constrained in the short to medium term. Inflation expectations also appear to be relatively well anchored. However there have been some changes in the MPC's assessment of the risks to the inflation outlook. The recent volatility in the rand exchange rate has imparted a degree of upside risk to the inflation forecast. Although the rand may not return to the elevated levels reached in the earlier part of 2011, the MPC considers some of the recent volatility to be of a short term nature, influenced by the vagaries of global risk aversion. Downside risks are seen to come from the heightened risks to global growth and its consequences for the domestic economy. The overall risks to the inflation outlook are assessed to be delicately balanced. The MPC will continue to assess the changing risk profile of the inflation outlook, and monitor closely those factors that could push inflation outside the target on a sustained basis. In the light of the above the MPC has decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 5,5 per cent per annum, for the time being. The MPC is however concerned at the potential impact of the current global turmoil on domestic economic prospects and stands ready to act appropriately should the need arise."
Israel,2011-09-26,"26.09.2011 The Bank of Israel reduces the interest rate for October 2011 by 0.25 percentage points to 3 percent To view this press release as a WORD file - Click here Background conditions Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 0.5 percent in August, at the upper limit of forecasts and above the seasonal path consistent with achieving the inflation target. Inflation over the past 12 months, as measured by the change in the CPI, was 3.4 percent, above the upper limit of the target inflation range (of 1-3 percent a year). With that, the rate of inflation, seasonally adjusted, over the past six months has been around the lower limit of the inflation target range. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Inflation expectations forthe next twelve months as calculated from the capital markets were steady over the past month and remain at 2 percent on average. Forecasters' inflation predictions for the next twelve months continued to fall, to 2.3 percent. The background to the convergence of inflation expectations to the midpoint of the target range, despite the depreciation of the shekel seen in thepast several weeks, was continued expectations of a slowdown in growth in Israel and worldwide, and apparently also a process of lowering prices by retail chains and various service providers, as part of the impact of socialprotests against the high cost of living. At the same time, forecasts of the Bank of Israel interest rate continued to fall. Based on the Telbor (TelAviv Inter-Bank Offered Rate) market, the Bank of Israel interest rate oneyear from now is expected to be 3 percent, down from 3.1 percent a month ago, and the average of forecasters' predictions is that it will be 3.15 percent, down from 3.6 percent a month ago. Most forecasters expect the Bank of Israel to leave the interest rate for October unchanged. Real economic activity: Economic activity continued to expand, but at a slower pace than in 2010 and the first half of 2011. Economic indicators that became available this month indicate stabilization of activity in the high tech sector and in exports, because of the moderation of activityabroad. Growth of real GDP of the business sector in the second quarter, according to the second National Accounts estimate for that quarter, was at an annual rate of 2.4 percent: slightly higher than the first estimate, a result of an upward revision in exports, in private consumption, and in investment. The moderate pace of activity was seen in the composite state of the economy index, which increased 0.3 percent in August, along with aslight upward revision in the index for June and July. Tax receipts grew in real terms, but are still below the seasonal path, for the fifth consecutive month. The Central Bureau of Statistics survey of business trends for August shows declines in all industries. With that, for all industries except the hospitality industry and high tech industries, the expectations for the next three months are for improvement in volume of activity. The Globes and the Bank Hapoalim consumer confidence indices point to a decline in the public's planned consumption, although both indices show that the public remains optimistic about the economy in the future. The labor market and wages: Labor market data for the second quarter indicate a continued improvement in employment. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate continued to fall and reached the low level of 5.5 percent, with stability in the participation rate and an increase in the employment rate. The number of employee posts (seasonally adjusted) increased by 0.4 percent in April-June compared with the preceding three months. The ratio of number of the unemployed to the number of job vacancies shows that in the business sector, there are 2.5 unemployed persons for every job vacancy: a historically low ratio, and similar to that recorded before the crisis. The nominal wage rose in April-June by 1.1 percent, compared with the three previous months, and the real wage (seasonally adjusted) rose 0.4 percent. In August, health tax receipts, which provide an indication of wage payments in that month, were 7.5 percent higher (preliminary estimate), in nominal terms, than in August 2010 (excluding the effect of legislative changes). The Bank of Israel Research Department staff forecast: The Research Department staff forecast was updated this month. The current assessmentis that inflation in the four quarters ending in the third quarter of 2012 will be 2.3 percent, and the average interest rate for that quarter will be 3 percent. For the full year of 2011, the Research Department forecasts that the inflation rate will be at the upper limit of the target range, and that the average interest rate in the fourth quarter will be 3.25 percent. GDP growth forecasts for 2011 and 2012 were revised lower. The current forecast is for 4.7 percent growth in 2011 (down from 4.8 percent in the previous forecast) and 3.2 percent in 2012 (down from 3.9 percent in the previousforecast). The assessment was based on, among other things, a lowered International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecast for global growth and world trade. The Research Department emphasized the primary risks faced by Israel's economy, specifically, the risk of a global slowdown and geopolitical risks thatcould have economic consequences. Budget data: Government domestic revenues in August were 9 percent lower than the forecast seasonal path, due to a continued slowdown in indirect tax revenues. Tax revenues for the year to date, through August (net of legislative changes and one time revenues), were 5.3 percent higher, in real terms, than in the corresponding period of the year before, but 1.6 percent below the seasonal path of the budget forecast. The government's domestic activity in the first eight months of this year (excluding net credit)resulted in a cumulative deficit of 0.7 percent of GDP, compared with a deficit of 1.6 percent of GDP in the corresponding period of 2010. Developments in government activity so far indicate that the budget deficit for the full year of 2011 will likely be slightly below the deficit ceiling set by law (3 percent). The foreign exchange market: From the previous monetary policy discussion held on August 28, through September 23, the shekel depreciated byabout 2.7 percent against the dollar, a significant depreciation relative to other currencies against the dollar. At the same time, the shekel appreciated 4.6 percent against the euro. The shekel strengthened by about 2.2 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. The rate of participation by nonresident investors in foreign currency trading was 31 percent in September, similar to the level in August, while the average for the yearto date in 2011 is 34 percent. This month. S&P raised Israel's credit rating. The capital and money markets: From the previous monetary policy discussion held on August 28, through September 23, the Tel Aviv 25 Index fell by 5 percent, similar to returns at most stock markets around the world. In the government bond market, the yield curve of unindexed bonds steepened, with drops of 14 basis points in maturities of up to 1 year and increases of up to 8 basis points in other maturities. Yields on CPI-indexed government bonds rose by up to 8 basis points for most maturities. The yield gap between Israeli 10-year government notes and 10-year US Treasury notes continued to widen during the period surveyed, as there was a sharper drop inyields in the US, and at the end of the period stood at 292 basis points (up from 262 basis points at the beginning of the period). Makam yields fellby up to 20 basis points across the yield curve, as the yield for one yearfell during the period from 3.08 percent to 2.98 percent. Withdrawals frommutual funds specializing in corporate bonds continued this month, although at a slower pace than that in the previous month. Since the beginning of September withdrawals totaled NIS 2.2 billion, compared with withdrawals ofNIS 4.6 billion in August. In contrast, money market funds continue to attract new investment, though at a more moderate pace than in previous months, and since the beginning of September about NIS 631 million flowed into those funds, compared with NIS 4.4 billion in the month of July and NIS 3.65 billion in August. The negative sentiment in the corporate bond market, especially in holding companies, was evident in the continuing rise in yields of several companies. Over the period as a whole. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spread continued to rise, against the background of geopolitical events, and widened from 166 basis points to 218 basis points. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in July the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 3.6 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 12.6 percent. Developments in the credit markets: The balance of outstanding credit to the business sector increased in July by 0.9 percent, to NIS 757 billion. Outstanding credit to households increased by 0.3 percent in July, to NIS 357 billion. Of the credit to households, outstanding housing credit rose 11.6 percent in the twelve months ending in July, to NIS 253 billion, compared with an 11.9 percent increase in the twelve months to June. The volume of new housing credit granted in the twelve months ending in August was 1.4 percent lower than in the twelve months ending in July. The share of mortgages at floating interest rates (for all periods) in total new mortgages continued to decline in August, and reached 76 percent, compared with 79 percent in the month before. The interest rates on CPI-indexed and unindexed floating rate mortgages continued to increase in July, while the interest rates on variable rate unindexed mortgages declined. The housing market: Activity in the construction industry continues to be strong. The number of starts in the twelve months to June reached 42,757 and the number of completions was 33,613, figures which were very similar to the levels of the previous month. The number of new homes sold fell, and in May-July was 9.6 percent lower than in February-April. The number of homes available for sale continued to increase, and in May-July was on average 6.4 percent higher than in the three preceding months. Home prices, which are published in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of home prices but are not included in the CPI, increased at amonthly rate of 0.4 percent in June-July, after rising 0.2 percentin May-June. The annual rate of increase in home prices continues to slow, and in the twelve months ended in June home prices increased by 12.3 percent; compared with a 12.1 percent increase in the May figure and a 14 percent increase in April. The slowdown in the rate of increase in home prices was affected by the increase in the interest rate, measures introduced by the Bank of Israel affecting mortgages, and steps taken by the Ministry of Finance in real estate taxation, together with the continued increase in the number of building starts. In contrast, the housing index, which is based mainly on renewed rental contracts and which is included in the CPI, continued to increase, rising by 1.3 percent in July, bringing the increasein the last twelve months to 5.2 percent. The global economy: This month, most macroecononomic figures published in the US and the eurozone were weak. The debt crisis continued to worsen this month as well: in Greece. CDS spreads indicated a growing probability of default in the near future; in the past week S&P cut its creditrating for Italy, with a negative outlook; there was growing concern of the European debt crisis spreading to the banking system, and amid that, credit ratings on large banks in the US. France, and Italy were cut. Against the background of increasing risk and negative macroeconomic data, investmentbanks and the IMF lowered their growth forecasts for major economies and for the global economy. The IMF revised its 2012 forecasts of global growth from 4.5 percent to 4 percent, and of world trade figures from 6.7 percent to 5.8 percent. The IMF also cut its forecast for US economic growth in 2012 from 2.7 percent to 1.8 percent, and cut its forecast for economic growthin Europe in 2012 from 1.7 percent to 1.1 percent, and assessments are that the balance of risks is to the downside. Within the framework of efforts to deal with the negative developments, there were several announcements this month: eurozone leaders announced unstinting support for Greece; five important central banks announced the extension of credit lines in dollars tobanks in Europe; in the US. President Obama presented an incentive plan worth $447 billion to support jobs, and according to Moody's, if the jobs plan is passed, it will add another 2 percent to US economic growth next year and lower the unemployment rate, currently at 9.1 percent, by 1 percent. Inflation expectations around the world remain low, in light of the expected slowdown in economic activity and the decline in commodity prices. Inflation expectations around the world remain low, in light of the expected slowdown in economic activity and the drop in commodity prices. Currently, markets and investment banks forecast an interest rate cut by the European Central Bank (ECB) as soon as in its upcoming meeting. In the past week, the Fed announced a program to sell short-term securities and buy longer term bonds (Operation Twist), and left in place its assessment that the federal fundsrate will remain at its current near-zero level through at least the middle of 2013. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to reduce the interest rate for October to 3 percent is based mainly on the negative turnaround in the global economy, is consistent with the return of inflation to within the target range of price stability, and is intended to support growth while preserving financial stability. Assessments have firmed recently that the slowdown in global growth will be steeper than previously expected. The IMF reduced its forecast of US growth in 2012 from 2.7 percent to 1.8 percent, and growth in the eurozone from 1.7 percent to 1.1 percent and it is assessed that the balance of risks is negative. The weakness of the US and European economies led policymakers in those countries to adopt more expansionary measures (Operation Twist in the US, and other stepsin the eurozone to increase liquidity). There are now market expectations of a cut in the ECB interest rate. In addition, volatility has increased oncapital markets around the world, and the downward trend in prices of financial assets continues. The more severe global slowdown is reflected in a slowdown in the growth of real activity in Israel, and in particular in the weakness of goods exports. The Bankof Israel has lowered its growth forecast for 2012 from 3.9 percent to 3.2 percent, and in the Israeli economy too the balance of risks is to the downside. Inflation expectations for the next twelve months as calculated from the capital market have remained stable this month around the midpoint of the 1 C2 AD-3 percent target range, and those of the forecasters continued to decline towards the midpoint of the inflation target range, and are currently 2.3 percent. The cumulative change in the last six monthly CPI readings, seasonally adjusted, is consistent with the target inflation range. Nevertheless, inflation over the previous twelve months, 3.4 percent, is still above the target range. The Bank of Israel's staff forecast and professional forecasters' expectations of the inflation rate over the previous twelve months at the end of 2011/beginning of 2012 are within the target range. The rate ofincrease in house prices in the last twelve months continues to be high, but in the last few months some moderation has been evident, and in the twelve months to July the rate was 12.3 percent (compared with 12.5 percent to June). The effects of the measures taken by the Bank of Israel with regard to mortgages, changes in real estate taxation introduced by the Ministry ofFinance, and the sustained increase in building starts are expected to continue to contribute to this moderation in the coming year. The Bank of Israel notes the strength of the Israeli economy, which is reflected in the high levels of growth and employment to date, the robust domestic banking system, the high level of foreign currency reserves, the downward trend in the government debt burden, and in Israel's raised credit rating. The cut in the interest rate for October is intended to minimize the negative effect on Israel's economy of the slowdown in activity and the increased level of uncertainty in the global economy. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in Israel's economy and the global economy and in the financial markets. The Bank will usethe instruments available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, including keeping a close watch on developmentsin the assets market, and especially in the housing market. The minutes of the discussions prior to the above interest rate decision will be published on October 10, 2011. The decision regarding the interest rate for October 2011 will be published at 17:30 on Monday.

Romania,2011-09-29,"In its meeting of September 29, 2011, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided the following:. The NBR will further monitor domestic and global economic developments so as, by accordingly adjusting its available instruments, to ensure the fulfillment of its objectives of achieving and maintaining price stability in the medium term as well as financial stability. The analysis of developments in macroeconomic indicators shows a faster disinflation, in line with the central bank's expectations. The annual inflation rate slid for the third consecutive month to reach 4.25 percent in August versus 7.93 percent in June, amid a steep reduction in volatile food prices and the gradual fading-out of the first-round effect of the VAT hike in July 2010. Moreover, the annual adjusted CORE21 inflation fell to 2.92 percent in August against 4.74 percent in June. Disinflation is expected to continue in the period ahead, so that annual inflation rate will near the target. The faster disinflation while keeping the monetary policy rate unchanged and amid a moderate leu exchange rate volatility translates into a tightening of real broad monetary conditions aimed at supporting the convergence of inflation towards the medium-term objectives. The resumption of economic growth continued, albeit at a slower pace, amid a worsening of global risk appetite and of the outlook for growth worldwide, as well as amid increased uncertainties regarding the eurozone sovereign debt crisis. The dynamics of industrial output and exports moderated, while the revival of loans to the private sector, especially leu-denominated lending, remained sluggish. The slower pace of the Romanian economy is expected to be temporarily countered by the good agricultural output in the second half of this year. The prospects reveal a consolidation of disinflation, but also persistent uncertainties related to developments in the external environment, capital flows, as well as administered and some volatile prices. Therefore, the central bank will gradually adjust the monetary policy stance, in line with these developments and in the context of fulfilling the Romanian authorities' commitments under the external financing arrangements with international institutions. Ensuring price stability, together with maintaining financial stability, paves the way for a sustainable cut in the costs of leu-denominated loans, a process fostered by the NBR. The resumption of lasting economic growth should also consider a boost of leu-denominated saving, which would secure sustainability of the external deficit and gradually reduce reliance on external financing. In this context, the NBR Board decided to keep the monetary policy rate at 6.25 percent per annum, to further pursue an adequate management of liquidity in the banking system and maintain unchanged the minimum reserve requirements for both leu and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR will further monitor domestic and global economic developments so as, by accordingly adjusting its available instruments, to ensure the fulfilment of its objectives of achieving and maintaining price stability in the medium term as well as financial stability in the context of fulfilment of commitments under the external financing agreements with the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and other international institutions. In line with the announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy is scheduled for November 2, 2011, when the new quarterly Inflation Report is to be examined. 1) Calculated by the NBR by excluding administered prices, volatile prices, and tobacco and alcohol prices from the consumer price index."
Armenia,2011-10-05,"Press Release 10.05.2011 In the May 10, 2011 meeting the Board of CBA decided to leave the Refinancing Rate of CBA unchanged, at 8.5 percent. In April of 2011 0.2 percent deflation was recorded, and the 12-month inflation reduced by 2.6 pp. and reached 8.9 percent, as a result. The Board accepted that during April prices of food products and primary goods in international markets tended to stabilize in spite of existing uncertainties. The Board agreed that an expected impact of developments in domestic economy on aggregate demand was predominantly neutral. At the same time, deflationary trends on food products of domestic manufacture due to an increase of the supply in agriculture are anticipated under the current weather conditions and as a result of the measures taken in that sector. The Board considers that the aforementioned developments as well as the interest rates created as a result of gradual tightening of monetary conditions since the beginning of 2011 will make inflation to subdue faster, starting the second half of 2011, and to bring it within the confidence band of 4 %± 1.5 pp. in the forecast time horizon.

Poland,2011-10-05,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 5 October 2011 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 4-5 October 2011 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e.: (cid:131) reference rate at 4.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate at 6.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate at 3.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate at 4.75% on an annual basis. Since the previous meeting of the Council, there have been further signs of weaker global economic activity. Data on the US economy point to continued slow economic growth. Similarly, in the euro area and in some emerging economies business conditions deteriorated as compared to the previous quarters. At the same time, economic growth forecasts for many countries were revised downwards, whereas inflation remains elevated. The heightened risk of a global economic slowdown along with the persisting fiscal problems in some countries give rise to enduring tensions in the financial markets worldwide. Given the increased risk aversion in the global financial markets, the currencies of emerging economies, including the zloty, weakened. The higher volatility of financial asset prices was still driven by ample liquidity in the global financial markets, connected with the strongly expansionary monetary policy of the major central banks. According to the released data on the Polish economy the past few months have seen a deterioration in business indicators, which signals a possible decline in business activity. At the same time, growth in industrial output and retail sales accelerated in August 2011, whereas the upward trend in construction eased somewhat. Data from the enterprise sector point to continued moderate growth in wages, amidst a concurrent decline in employment. At the same time, the unemployment rate remains at an elevated level. Lending to enterprises, including investment loans, is rising although at a slower pace than earlier. The relatively fast growth in mortgage lending to households has also been sustained, while consumer loans continue to decline in annual terms. In August, annual CPI inflation increased to 4.3%, remaining markedly above the NBP's inflation target of 2.5%. Higher inflation was related to an increase in the prices of telecommunication services, which also contributed to higher core inflation, and to higher energy prices. At the same time, the PPI inflation accelerated. Inflation expectations of households and enterprises declined. 00-919 Warszawa, ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, tel. (22) 653 28 88, fax (22) 653 13 28 In the coming months, annual CPI inflation will continue to run at an elevated level, primarily due to the previously observed sharp rise in global commodity prices. In the medium term, inflation will be curbed by the anticipated decline in domestic economic growth amidst fiscal tightening, including reduced public investment spending, and interest rate increases implemented in the first half of 2011, as well as a likely global economic slowdown. On the other hand, the impact of the situation in the global financial markets on the zloty exchange rate constitutes an upside risk factor to domestic price developments. In the opinion of the Council, the significant monetary policy tightening implemented since the beginning of 2011 should enable inflation to return to the target in the medium term. Given the above, the Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged. The Council does not rule out the possibility of further monetary policy adjustments, should the outlook for inflation returning to the target deteriorate. In the recent period the National Bank of Poland sold some amount of foreign currencies in exchange for zlotys. Such transactions were consistent with the pursued monetary policy strategy defined in the Monetary Policy Guidelines."
Euroarea,2011-10-06,"Ladies and gentlemen, dear President Trichet, dear Vice-President Constancio, welcome to the regional office of Bundesbank in Berlin where the ECB Governing Council held its 319th meeting earlier today. It has become a tradition that twice a year the Governing Council meets outside Frankfurt with one of the Eurosystem national central banks acting as host. This time it was the Deutsche Bundesbank's turn, and I must say it has been an honour to welcome the Governing Council here in the German capital. Before I give the floor to President Trichet I would like to use this opportunity to offer my sincere thanks to him. As you will be aware, today he chaired his penultimate Governing Council meeting and will be giving his final post-meeting press conference in a little while. This monthly press briefing has been like a piano that you have played as masterfully as any professional pianist would. Over the past 8 years you have commanded this stage  usually in Frankfurt  to gently steer market expectations using a careful and deliberate choice of words to give clear messages to the markets. I am certain that the corps of journalists will miss the typically French elegance with which you have chaired past press conferences. Although I became a member of the Governing Council only recently I feel lucky and grateful to have had first-hand experience of your diplomatic but consistently focussed style of chairmanship. As I already mentioned, you have been President of the ECB for 8 years, the last 4 years of which have proved very demanding. It is no overstatement when I say, that. Jean-Claude has fought passionately and with tireless and unconditional conviction to overcome the European debt crisis. What is often forgotten these days, are the achievements of the Eurosystem in the past decade. You would be right to point out that “we have delivered price stability for 330 million people”. This is in large part thanks to your own personal efforts and I would like to use this opportunity to thank you on behalf of the Bundesbank and the other national central banks for the excellent job you have done over the past 8 years. During your time living and working in Germany you have often stressed how fond you are of this country and its language. I therefore hope that we will have the continued pleasure of seeing you in Germany again many times in the future. Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference here in Berlin. Let me take the opportunity to warmly thank President Weidmann for his invitation and kind hospitality. I would also like to express our special gratitude to the staff of the Deutsche Bundesbank for the excellent organisation of our meeting. Let me now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup. Prime Minister Juncker, and Commissioner Rehn. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Inflation has remained elevated and incoming information has confirmed our view that inflation is likely to stay above 2% over the months ahead but to decline thereafter. At the same time, the underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be moderate. Ongoing tensions in financial markets and unfavourable effects on financing conditions are likely to dampen the pace of economic growth in the euro area in the second half of this year. The economic outlook remains subject to particularly high uncertainty and intensified downside risks. It remains essential for monetary policy to maintain price stability over the medium term, thereby ensuring a firm anchoring of inflation expectations in the euro area in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make its contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. A very thorough analysis of all incoming data and developments over the period ahead is warranted. The Governing Council has decided to conduct two longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs), one with a maturity of approximately 12 months in October and the other with a maturity of approximately 13 months in December. The operations will be conducted as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment. The rate in both operations will be fixed at the average rate of the main refinancing operations (MROs) over the life of the respective LTRO, and interest will be paid when each operation matures. These operations will be conducted in addition to the regular and special-term refinancing operations, which remain unaffected. The Governing Council has also decided to continue conducting its MROs as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of the sixth maintenance period of 2012 on 10 July 2012. This procedure will also remain in use for the Eurosystem's special-term refinancing operations with a maturity of one maintenance period, which will continue to be conducted for as long as needed, and at least until the end of the sixth maintenance period (i.e. around the end of the second quarter) of 2012. The fixed rate in these special-term refinancing operations will be the same as the MRO rate prevailing at the time. In addition, the Governing Council has decided to conduct the three-month LTROs to be allotted on 25 January, 29 February, 28 March, 25 April, 30 May and 27 June 2012 as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment. The rates in these three-month operations will be fixed at the average rate of the MROs over the life of the respective LTRO. Furthermore, the Governing Council has decided to launch a new covered bond purchase programme (CBPP2). The purchases will be for an intended amount of EUR 40 billion. The purchases will have the capacity to be conducted in the primary and secondary markets and will be carried out by means of direct purchases. The purchases will start in November 2011 and are expected to be fully implemented by the end of October 2012. Further details on the modalities of CBPP2 will be announced after the Governing Council meeting of 3 November 2011. The provision of liquidity and the allotment modes for refinancing operations will continue to ensure that euro area banks are not constrained on the liquidity side. All the non-standard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions are, by construction, temporary in nature. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Real GDP growth in the euro area, after slowing in the second quarter of 2011 to 0.2% quarter on quarter, is now expected to be very moderate in the second half of this year. In particular, a number of factors seem to be dampening the underlying growth momentum in the euro area, including a moderation in the pace of global demand, falling consumer and business confidence, and unfavourable effects on financing conditions resulting from ongoing tensions in a number of euro area sovereign debt markets. At the same time, we continue to expect euro area economic activity to benefit from continued positive growth in the emerging market economies as well as from the low short-term interest rates and the various measures taken to support the functioning of the financial sector. In the Governing Council's assessment, the risks to the economic outlook for the euro area remain on the downside in an environment of particularly high uncertainty. Downside risks notably relate to the ongoing tensions in some segments of the financial markets in the euro area and at the global level, as well as to the potential for these pressures to further spill over into the euro area real economy. They also relate to the still high energy prices, protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation was 3.0% in September 2011, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, after 2.5% in August. Inflation rates have been at elevated levels since the end of last year, mainly driven by higher energy and other commodity prices. Looking ahead, inflation rates are likely to stay clearly above 2% over the coming months but to decline thereafter. This pattern reflects the expectation of relatively stable wage growth developments in the context of moderate economic growth. The Governing Council continues to view the risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments as broadly balanced. On the upside, the main risks relate to the possibility of increases in indirect taxes and administered prices, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. The main downside risks relate to the impact of weaker than expected growth in the euro area and globally. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 was 2.8% in August 2011, up from 2.1% in July. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector, adjusted for loan sales and securitisation, was 2.8% in August, after 2.6% in July. A number of factors, possibly related to the intensification of tensions in some financial markets, could have had an upward effect on the components of M3. In particular, sizeable inflows into overnight deposits and money market fund shares/units, as well as a substantial inflow into repurchase agreements, appear to have driven monetary developments in August. The inflow into repurchase agreements mainly reflected secured lending in the interbank market, which was increasingly settled via central counterparties that are allocated to the money-holding sector. Overall. M3 growth was driven in particular by the increase in the annual growth rate of M1 from 1.0% in July to 1.7% in August and the increase in the annual growth rate of marketable instruments. On the counterpart side, the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations and to households in August, both adjusted for loan sales and securitisation, remained unchanged from July, at 2.2% and 2.7% respectively. Taking the appropriate medium-term perspective, trends in broad money and loan growth have broadly stabilised over recent months. Overall, the underlying pace of monetary expansion thus remains moderate. The situation of the banking sector calls for particular attention, taking into account the interplay between sovereign risk issues and banks' funding needs. As we have done on previous occasions, the Governing Council urges banks to do all that is necessary to reinforce their balance sheets, to retain earnings, to ensure moderation in remuneration, and to turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases. Where necessary, they should take full advantage of government support measures, which should be made totally operational, including the possibility in future for the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) to lend to governments in order to recapitalise banks. To sum up, based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Inflation has remained elevated and incoming information has confirmed our view that inflation is likely to stay above 2% over the months ahead but to decline thereafter. A cross-check with the information from our monetary analysis confirms that the underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be moderate. Ongoing tensions in financial markets and unfavourable effects on financing conditions are likely to dampen the pace of economic growth in the euro area in the second half of this year. The economic outlook remains subject to particularly high uncertainty and intensified downside risks. It remains essential for monetary policy to maintain price stability over the medium term, thereby ensuring a firm anchoring of inflation expectations in the euro area in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make its contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. A very thorough analysis of all incoming data and developments over the period ahead is warranted. Turning to fiscal policies, with financial market uncertainty remaining high, all governments need to take decisive and frontloaded action to bolster public confidence in the sustainability of government finances. All euro area governments need to show their inflexible determination to fully honour their own individual sovereign signature as a key element in ensuring financial stability in the euro area as a whole. Countries under joint EU-IMF adjustment programmes as well as those particularly vulnerable to financial market conditions need to unambiguously implement all announced measures for fiscal consolidation and the strengthening of domestic fiscal frameworks, and they need to stand ready to take any additional measures that may become necessary owing to the evolution of their situation. Fiscal consolidation and structural reforms must go hand in hand to strengthen confidence, growth prospects and job creation. The Governing Council therefore urges all euro area governments to decisively and swiftly implement substantial and comprehensive structural reforms. This will help these countries to strengthen competitiveness, increase the flexibility of their economies and enhance their longer-term growth potential. In this respect, labour market reforms are key, with a focus on the removal of rigidities and the implementation of measures which enhance wage flexibility. In particular, we should see the elimination of automatic wage indexation clauses and a strengthening of firm-level agreements. More generally, in these demanding times, moderation is of the essence in terms of both profit margins and wages. These measures should be accompanied by structural reforms that increase competition in product markets, particularly in services  including the liberalisation of closed professions  and, where appropriate, the privatisation of services currently provided by the public sector, thereby facilitating productivity growth and supporting competitiveness. At the same time, the Governing Council urges all euro area governments to fully implement all aspects of the decisions they took on 21 July 2011. This is my last press conference following a meeting of the Governing Council. I remember my first press conference, eight years ago, as if it were yesterday. I want to tell you that it has been a great pleasure to have this regular dialogue with the press, with all of you. We have, together, each of us with our different responsibilities, analysed the European and global situation throughout these years. But for more than four years now, we have been experiencing turbulent waters, storms, unexpected hurricanes. In demanding times, regular, real-time and transparent communication is more important than ever. The channels of national. European and global communication which you are responsible for are crucial for the appropriate functioning of markets, for the correct understanding of economists and economic agents, and for the information of the people of Europe, our fellow citizens, to whom, as an independent institution, we are accountable. Eight years ago the concept of a press conference immediately after the meeting of the Governing Council was still considered a bold innovation."
Pakistan,2011-10-08,"STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN MONETARY POLICY DECISION 8th October 2011 The main factors contributing in SBP's decision to reduce its policy rate by 50 basis points in July 2011 continue to show positive progress. There is decline in CPI inflation and government borrowing from SBP is lower than its end-June level. Led by consistent inflow of workers' remittances the external current account position is comfortable though there has been some decline in SBP's foreign exchange reserves. Importantly concerns regarding weak private sector credit growth and falling real private investment expenditures remain along with likelihood of rise in real interest rates. At the same time, risks to macroeconomic stability emanating from fiscal weaknesses and falling foreign financial inflows have not receded. Moreover severe energy crisis and precarious law and order conditions continue to render domestic economic environment least conducive for productive activities. In addition, the likelihood of falling short of the annual GDP growth target has increased due to damaging impact of recent flood in Sindh. The rapidly deteriorating global economic conditions, especially in Pakistan's export-destination countries, do not provide much confidence either. In these circumstances, balancing inflation and growth considerations through monetary policy alone is difficult. The year-on-year inflation in September 2011 has come down to 10. percent from 13. percent in June 2011 though month-on-month inflation is still more than percent on average. An expected seasonal rise in inflation in the first month of new fiscal year, the Ramazan seasonality of food prices, and the unexpected effect of flood on inflation have all coincided in the months of Q1-FY12. Thus isolating temporary changes from underlying inflationary pressures is more demanding at this point in time though the probability of meeting the 12 percent average CPI inflation target for FY12 remains high. There are upside risks, however, in meeting the medium-term inflation targets of. percent in FY13 and percent in FY14. These risks largely stem from persistence of government borrowing from scheduled banks, exchange rate depreciation, and likely upward adjustments in the administered prices of energy. Nevertheless these risks can potentially mitigate if following positive developments and intended policy actions take root. First continued restrain on government borrowing from SBP. According to the provisional data, the outstanding stock of these borrowings (on cash basis) has come down to Rs1051 billion as on 30th September 2011. This is considerably lower than the mutually agreed limit of Rs1155 billion for FY12 and is expected to have beneficial impact on inflation outlook if the trend continues. Second the government has decided to consolidate the outstanding inter-agency circular debt of the energy sector and settle the unpaid subsidy claims on account of its commodity operations by issuing government securities of close to Rs400 billion. These measures would alleviate the energy sector's financial difficulties leading to better utilization of installed productive capacity and may release the stuck-up resources of the banking system that can then be channelled to productive activities. Page of STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Assuming that the efforts to curtail the emergence of incremental debt in these areas will be stepped up, these measures could reduce inflationary pressures by closing the gap between prevailing aggregate demand in the economy and aggregate supply. Third led by the 50 bps reduction in the policy rate announced in July 2011, the market interest rates have come down considerably. For instance, 6-month T-bill and 10-year PIB rates in the secondary market have decreased by 1 and 136 bps between 1st August 2011 and 7th October 2011. The effect on corporate lending rates would become more visible in the coming months. This is expected to have desirable impact on the demand for credit by the private sector over and above their working capital needs. The resulting increase in fixed investment may help the productive capacity of the economy, having beneficial impact on inflation in the medium term. Moreover in continuation of Q4-FY11 trend, the proportion of amount offered by banks in the 12-month tenor during primary auctions of T-bills during Q1-FY12 has increased to 63 percent from 25 percent in Q4-FY11. This noticeable shift in banks' preference for the 12-month T-bill will help in alleviating the pressure on the government to rollover its short term debt and indicate market's expectation of inflation coming down. This may help to some extent in improving the supply of credit to the private sector. more enduring expansion in the private sector credit and thus investment in the economy would require fiscal reforms. Especially in the wake of declining external budgetary support, it is imperative to increase the tax to GDP ratio to scale down the reliance on borrowings from the banking system. Currently these requirements are substantial and increasing. For instance, compared to an announced T-bill auction target of Rs750 billion for Q1-FY12 the government raised Rs851 billion instead. The announced target for Q2-FY12 is Rs1025 billion, including Rs63 billion incremental requirements, and the possibility that the government may borrow more than this amount cannot be ruled out. Not surprisingly therefore the liquidity position of the market is under stress, in addition to the seasonal factors, as indicated by an outstanding liquidity injection by SBP of Rs292 billion as on 7th October 2011. Apart from seasonal factors, another source of tight liquidity conditions is decrease of $1. billion in SBP's foreign exchange reserves during Q1-FY11. The main reasons include growth of 42 percent in oil import payments and continued decline in foreign financial flows during the first two months of FY12. Consequently the rupee also experienced depreciation of. percent against the US dollar in Q1-FY12. Thus despite modest external current account deficit of $189 million during July- August. FY12, the assessment of overall balance of payment position requires vigilance. In conclusion, taking some comfort from declining inflation and high probability of meeting the FY12 inflation target together with need to support private sector credit and investment growth, the Central Board of Directors of SBP after due deliberations has decided to reduce its policy rate by 150 bps to 12 percent with effect from 10 October 2011. The SBP will continue to monitor developments in the fiscal sector and those pertaining to foreign financial inflows to gauge risks for macroeconomic stability. Page of."
Nigeria,2011-10-10,"Central Bank of Nigeria Communique No. 79 of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting. October 10, 2011 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) held an extraordinary meeting on 10th October, 2011 in response to unusual developments in the global and domestic economy, with potential negative impact on domestic liquidity conditions and renewed threats to price and exchange rate stability. The global economic horizon remains highly uncertain, with the signs getting more ominous as policy makers find it increasingly difficult to take the necessary economic decisions that may avert a new wave of recession. Three self-reinforcing negatives continue to define the global economy: the sovereign debt crisis in the Eurozone, significant undercapitalization of internationally-active banks, and negative market sentiment leading to continuing flight to cash as a safe haven and deleveraging. The first and second aspects intensify the third, and without confidence and some appetite for financial assets and credit, the debt crisis and financial solvency concerns in turn become deeper. As a result of these concerns about the Eurozone, coupled with the US deficit problem, inflation in emerging markets, debates about a soft or hard-landing in China and other pessimistic scenarios, there is a trend towards reversal of capital flows to emerging and frontier markets, and a recent depreciation in the national currencies of 1 many economies in Asia and Latin America including India. Indonesia. Malaysia. South Korea. Brazil. Chile. Colombia, and Mexico, among others. In Africa, the national currencies of Kenya. South Africa. Gabon. Ghana and Nigeria have also been under pressure. Central banks have generally responded through direct intervention in the foreign exchange market to stabilize the currency and, in some cases, a significant hike in policy rates. It is worthy of note that fund managers have not been eager to exit environments with relatively high real rates of interest and benign inflation outlook. The Domestic Economy and Committee's Deliberations The growth outlook for the economy does not appear to have changed much, driven largely by the positive forecasts for the non- oil sector as noted in the last MPC communique. Inflation had come down to 93 per cent in August but, as indicated in the same communique, a combination of monetary, fiscal and structural factors continue to advise against complacency. The naira has come under increasing pressure, and has recently traded outside the band of N150 +/- 30 per cent. In the Committee's view, the increasing pressure on the domestic currency has been emanating from a number of sources not all of which can be addressed by purely monetary interventions. First there are concerns about the likely impact of a double dip recession on oil 2 prices and already declining foreign reserves. Second there are also concerns about the delay in implementing fundamental economic decisions that will shore up reserves. Specifically it is estimated that simply passing the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) and removing subsidies on Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) will add at least US$10 billion to national reserves annually. The petroleum subsidy for 2011 alone is estimated to be about US$6 billion. substantial part of oil production (about 40 per cent) is currently in deep offshore wells. Based on the terms agreed in the 1990s when oil price was under US$30, royalty from oil wells deeper than 1,,000 metres is zero per cent and the nation is paid only 20 per cent of the profit by oil companies after deducting their expenses. As a result, the country has had limited benefits from high oil prices and increasing output, with most of the gains going to multinational oil companies under an inequitable fiscal arrangement. Similarly the Committee expressed concerns about the genuineness of demand for petroleum imports. This year alone, oil importers have bought over US$70 billion from wDAS, thereby, depleting the Nation's external reserves. This demand, in the Committee's view, might have been fuelled by rent-seeking and subsidies. It is imperative that the enabling legislation for correcting fiscal terms be put in place under a Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) that reflects 3 international best practice. Unfortunately discordant voices are delaying these processes to the long-term detriment of the economy. Whereas the labour unions have genuine concerns about the impact of subsidy removal on the poorer segments of society, the stark reality is that the country is living above its means. The Greek government recently passed a budget in which 33,,000 public sector workers had to be retrenched as a result of failure to take difficult but necessary economic decisions in the past. Nigeria cannot afford to delay, any further, the reforms of the petroleum industry. Third the draft 2012 budget and the underlying assumptions are based on an oil price of US$75 per barrel and an output of 24 million barrels per day. This makes the 2012 budget even more expansionary than the 2011 budget and further dampens any hope for an early fiscal retrenchment. The fiscal authorities have clearly signaled a commitment to medium-term consolidation and indeed the projected deficit in 2012 is lower than the deficit in the 2011 budget. This notwithstanding, the projected increase in spending, particularly the high levels of recurrent expenditure, would suggest increasing pressure on prices in general. Fourth, structural bottlenecks in the Nigerian economy that perpetuate import dependence make import-demand highly inelastic. Finally real interest rates have been low, partly driven by a cautious approach to monetary tightening at a time of financial system instability. Although the MPC recognized inflationary pressures and has consistently acted prudently in policy tightening based on expectations, a gradualist approach has been the pattern thus far, given the situation with the banking system and equity markets. Policy Issues and Dilemmas In the face of the spectre of declining oil prices, declining foreign reserves, increased demand for foreign exchange, fiscal dominance and capital flow reversals, monetary policy must bear a larger burden of economic adjustment. The MPC has, therefore, to make difficult choices, each of which has clear costs and benefits. One option is protecting reserves by reducing the supply of dollars at the wDAS. This will lead to a rapid depreciation of the currency and the emergence of a parallel market, leading to further pressures on the Naira, imported inflation and a general loss of confidence on the part of investors. Indeed the impact on price and exchange rate stability will be such as to undermine the key mandates of the Central Bank. Given the 5 highly inelastic demand for imports, it is doubtful that increasing the cost of dollars will significantly reduce quantity demanded. Indeed genuine demand will be compounded by high levels of speculative demand. second option is to address monetary and liquidity conditions more aggressively. By tightening liquidity and raising domestic interest rates, a number of advantages follow. First this is the logical response to fiscal expansion, especially with the anticipated capital releases in the fourth quarter as well as repayment of backlog of Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) debt to the Federation account. Second it provides an incentive for reallocation of portfolios by improving real returns of holding the naira as a store of value. Third it increases, after a lag, the rates paid on deposits and savings, thus reversing any tendency towards disintermediation and capital flight. Finally it increases the cost of foreign currency positions held for speculative purposes, and reduces the tendency to pre-pay dollar obligations with naira liabilities. The option has disadvantages in the form of high lending rates, financial cost to the banking system and possible losses on fixed income instruments due to capital losses. Besides tightening of liquidity would run the risk of slowdown in credit growth. Having considered the pros and cons of each option (and combinations of options), the Committee is of the view that given the completion of shareholder meetings on all banks and approvals from the courts for many, the risks to the banking system of tighter liquidity conditions have been significantly reduced, as the banks are in the process of receiving all approvals and fresh capital including AMCON bonds. Now that the banking system recapitalization is complete, monetary policy can be freed from concerns about its impact on financial system stability. The Committee reaffirmed its belief that maintaining exchange rate stability, especially in times of global uncertainty, is crucial to the mandate of price stability. Moreover the interest of the economy is best served, by maintaining an unequivocal stance of non- accommodative monetary policy, given the existing fiscal conditions. The Committee also reaffirmed its commitment to improving returns on naira assets and protecting the capital of investors against erosion due to huge exchange rate losses, in order to encourage appropriate asset allocation decisions. The Committee recognized the need to remain very clear on the Bank's primary mandate and maintain the credibility it has established so far by sending strong signals of continuing commitment to price and exchange rate stability. Finally, the Committee noted that the Committee of Governors has already commenced full investigation of compliance with rules governing foreign exchange transactions by authorized dealers and endorsed the declared commitment to sanction all infractions and improve the level of supervision and compliance in the market. Decisions 1. The monetary policy rate (MPR) is raised by 275 basis points from 925 per cent to 120 per cent (by a vote of 8 in favor and 1 in favor of status quo); 2. Maintain the current symmetric corridor of +/-200 basis points around the MPR (by unanimous vote); 3. The cash reserve ratio(CRR) is increased from 40 per cent to 80 per cent from the maintenance period beginning October 11, 2011 by a vote of 7 to 2 (2 members voted for a 60 per cent CRR); 4. The net open position (NOP) is reduced from 50 per cent to 10 per cent of share-holders funds with immediate effect and with full compliance by Friday. October 14, 2011 (by unanimous vote); and 8 5. It was further agreed that the reserve averaging method of computation be suspended in favour of daily maintenance until further notice. Sanusi Lamido Sanusi. CON Governor Central Bank of Nigeria October 10, 2011 9 PERSONAL STATEMENTS BY MPC MEMBERS: 10 ALADE. SARAH The renewed pressure on the foreign exchange market despite strong economic fundamentals is of serious concern to the conduct of monetary policy. To stabilize the foreign exchange market and restore confidence in the economy, there is need for monetary policy intervention to stem the sharp decline of the naira and reduce the pressure in the short run. Nigeria is not alone as emerging markets around the world are making efforts to shore up their falling currencies amid concerns that the global economic growth may stall. These responses have ranged from increasing monetary policy rate and/or reserve requirements, or restricted use of foreign reserves/sales. To rein in the intense pressure on the foreign exchange market and better anchor inflation expectation. I support an increase in monetary policy rate and Cash Reserve Requirements (CRR). Global growth prospect has become grimmer. Developments in the global economy over the past few weeks are a matter of serious concern. The downgrading of the US sovereign debt rating, the continuing sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone and volatile commodity prices have led to increasing global anxieties. These events are taking place against the backdrop of a 10 slowdown in growth in many of the advanced economies. Growth momentum is weakening in the advanced economies amidst heightened concerns that recovery may take longer than earlier expected. Although Nigeria's exports have performed well in the recent period, this trend is unlikely to be sustained in the face of weakening global demand. This combined with intense pressure on the foreign exchange market calls for policy responses to help restore confidence and anchor inflation expectation. While headline inflation declined to 93 percent in August, upside risk to inflation still exist. The global food and energy prices remain elevated, and as an import dependent country, global food prices could spill over to higher domestic prices. Food inflation inched up to 87 percent in August from 79 percent in July even in the middle of the harvest season. As global commodity prices continue to remain at an elevated level and given that the country import food stuff such as rice, there may be heighten upside risks to domestic inflation. The planned removal of fuel subsidy and the increase in electricity tariff could pose upside risk to inflation in the short-run. The Federal Government resolve to remove the fuel subsidy coupled with the increase in electricity tariffs is bound to increase price inflation. Furthermore real interest rate compared to neighboring countries continue to be negative. To attract inflows into 11 the country, this condition needs to be corrected with sensible monetary policy tool. Fourth quarter capital releases by the Federal Government is expected to be huge. Expenditure in the fourth quarter is expected to be expansionary as government aims to complete capital projects started during the year by the end of the budget period. This bundled expenditure is bound to put upward pressure on both inflation and exchange rate as some of the capital procurement would have high import content. While there are still pockets of downside risks in the domestic banking sector, the resolution action taken by AMCON is stabilizing the system. The return in confidence to the banking sector, and the AMCON injection of funds through sale of AMCON bonds could impact the level of liquidity in the banking sector. Rising policy rate may help channel the additional liquidity to productive uses in the economy rather than non-productive and speculative activities. Based on the above. I will recommend an increase in monetary policy rate by 275 basis points and an increase in Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR) to help stabilize the currency and fend off inflationary pressures. 12 20 BARAU. SULEIMAN A Strictly guided by the context and framework that influenced my voting decision at the last Monetary Policy Committee meeting. I voted again today to support further tightening through the following specific measures; A1 Upward adjustment of the MPR by 275% to 12% A2 Upward adjustment of the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) from 40% to 8%. .3 Retention of symmetric corridor of plus and minus 2% around the MPR (Standing Deposit Rate of 10% and Standing Lending Rate of 14%). .4 Support other administrative measures to reign in demand for foreign exchange namely; reduction of the Deposit Money banks Net Open Position and adoption of appropriate sanctions for foreign exchange infractions and so on. The rationale for voting the way I did is summarized as follows; B1 Current liquidity levels have supported increased speculative demand for foreign exchange. There is evidence of huge liquidity in the banking system as demonstrated by liquid asset holding of banks and their liquidity ratios. In effect, the huge liquidity injected in 2008 and the subsequent quantitative easing monetary policy measures in response to the global 13 financial crises have not been mopped up in spite of the recent aggressive stance. In addition, the system liquidity has been exacerbated by Governments fiscal operations including the monetization of excess crude account balances. .2 The liquidity outlook is also not so good in the light of anticipated AMCON liquidity injection and Government's fiscal operations particularly relating to further drawdown from the Excess Crude Account and the normal year and capital related activities of Ministries. Departments and Agency of Government. .3 The obvious speculative attacks on the Naira in the foreign exchange market continued in spite of various policy measures recently adopted by the MPC. Foreign reserves have continued to decline in spite of the recent significant improvement in inflows from the NNPC. Speculative demand could only be sustained in a regime of relatively low interest rates, lack of alternative profitable investment outlets, current and future anticipated liquidity position in the market. It has therefore become necessary to take further steps to tighten liquidity. .4 Inflation is still a threat and further tightening stance would help to arrest the threat. It is recognized that the measures recommended would increase money market and lending 14 rates and may affect lending and output growth. With inflation trending down, however, real interest rates would therefore be positive as a result of further tightening. Besides in the context of current liquidity situation, liquidity outlook, threat to Naira exchange rates and declining foreign reserves, the measures recommended become even more compelling. Given the structure of our economy and observed historical reactions when the Naira depreciates, the greatest threat to inflation is a depreciating Naira and we have to do whatever is necessary to eliminate the liquidity driven speculative demand. In effect. I hold the very strong view that any depreciation in the value of the Naira must be driven by fundamental and real factors. I'm convinced that the recent demand pressure on the Naira exchange rate is powered by factors that are speculative and technical factors, of course supported by huge market liquidity. The measures recommended are no doubt very strong and would produce unintended impact on interest rates and credit growth. am however aware that the next MPC meeting scheduled to hold in November, does provide an opportunity for a quick review of market developments and the measures taken. 15 30 LEMO. TUNDE I have closely followed the review of the domestic and international economic and financial environments and observed some worrisome developments. Global economic conditions deteriorated as shown by the increased downside risks and sluggish growth caused by fiscal constraints and declining confidence in the resilience of the financial system. The potential eurozone banking system undercapitalization, rising global inflationary trends, declining public confidence in the euro and the US fiscal problems, are manifests of uncertain global economic outlook. On the domestic front, the fragile global output, negative market sentiments and declining international oil prices have serious consequences for the domestic economy, particularly, the foreign exchange market and the country's external reserves position. have also noted of late elevated forex demand, largely driven by speculation which resulted in the recent trading of the naira outside the band of N150 +/- 30 per cent. also observed that although, headline inflation declined to 93 per cent in August from 94 per cent, in July, 2011, inflationary pressures may persist for the rest of the year due to the recent announcement effect of the proposed removal of petroleum subsidy, increase in electricity charges, anticipated expansionary fiscal stance in the fourth quarter of 2011, injection of new capital into the intervened banks by the new core 16 investors and the expected liquidity injections by AMCON before the end of the year, as well as high household expenditures associated with end of year festivities. Overall the recent unusual developments evidenced in the liquidity surfeit in the banking system fuelled the unprecedented demand pressures in the foreign exchange market. This situation had negative effects on the level of external reserves and sustenance of exchange rate stability. It is, therefore, necessary that a very non – accommodative stance be taken by the MPC so as to halt further deterioration in domestic economic conditions. In view of the foregoing. I recommend further aggressive monetary tightening stance. In this regard. I vote for an increase of 275 basis points in the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) and maintain the symmetric corridor of plus or minus 2 per cent around the MPR; an increase in the Cash Reserve Ratio from 4 per cent to 8 per cent and a reduction of the Net Open Position of banks from 5 per cent of shareholders' funds to 1 per cent. In conclusion. I also agree that the reserve averaging method of computation of Cash Reserve Ratio be suspended in favour of daily maintenance until further notice. .0 MOGHALU. KINGSLEY CHIEDU At this Extraordinary Meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, confronted with the context of a threatening economic environment – the naira under increased pressure, the 17 announcement of the Federal Government's plan to remove petroleum subsidy in the forthcoming 2012 budget and the inflationary expectations thus unleashed, and imminent, massive liquidity injections by the fiscal authorities and the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) – the MPC clearly needs to take strong action. This is so especially in relation to the naira as a store of value, with the markets factoring in widespread but mistaken sentiment that the naira is about to be devalued. Should this mistaken notion take hold, it will result in a massive run on the naira. Combined with the ongoing and anticipated liquidity injections, a depreciation of the naira at this time would undoubtedly result in a marked increase in inflation that would have a destabilizing impact on the Nigerian economy. It is necessary to reassert the commitment of the Central Bank of Nigeria to the stability of the naira and to restraining inflation in no uncertain terms. The restoration of increased stability to the banking system through the successful recapitalization of the eight intervened banks makes such strong action at this time possible without significant adverse consequences for financial stability. This time, however, the MPC needs to deploy a combination of tools designed to prevent the excess liquidity - including within the banking system - that is feeding continued 18 speculation on the value of the naira. Against this backdrop. I vote for: An increase of the Monetary Policy Rate by 275 basis points from the current 925 per cent, and maintaining a symmetric corridor of plus or minus 2 per cent. An increase in the Cash Reserve Ratio of 100 per cent from the current 4 per cent to 8 per cent. A reduction of the Net Open Position of banks from 5 per cent of shareholders' funds to 1 per cent. .0 OLOFIN. SAM This is an emergency meeting which by its very nature suggests new developments that have implications for the economy have occurred since our last meeting, and for which urgent corrective measures may be` required before the next statutory meeting of the MPC. Without necessarily wanting to sound like an alarmist reading of the current situation, recent developments at the foreign exchange market which no doubt reflect market reaction to both domestic as well as external disturbances have been quite worrisome. The various market signals suggest a declining confidence in the Naira as a store of value, and hence the unabated ever rising demand for the dollar. This has led to a sharp 19 decline in the level of foreign reserves by US$265 to $3136 billion or nearly 8 percent decline by Oct. 6, 2011, compared with the figure of $3401 billion as at September 20, 2011. Similarly the rate of exchange has over the same period moved above the upper three percent bound set around the target rate of N150: $1 that has been sustained over the last several months. Evidence available to us at this meeting shows that Reserve Money (RM) has fluctuated above the quarterly indicative benchmarks set for quarters 1, 2 and 3, in 2011 suggesting the existence of excess liquidity in the system that may among other factors be fuelling the hedging against the Naira, and the resulting rapid decline in the level of reserves. If these facts are put side by side with the developments in the global economy which suggest the likelihood of a double-dip recession in the advanced economies and likely fall in demand for energy in both developed and emerging economies, we are likely to be confronted in the short to medium term with a possible decline in the price of oil which would further accentuate the pressure on the Naira. As a highly import depend economy with less than elastic demand for imports and exports, it would be futile to contemplate foreign exchange adjustment or outright devaluation to ease the pressure on the Naira. It is our strong view that not only would devaluation further exacerbate the pressure on the Naira, it would heighten the current surge in the demand for foreign exchange. 20 We may therefore in no time have to be confronted with the bleak prospects not only of halting the accretion but of a possible wiping out of existing reserves! There is therefore an urgent need for a combination of both administrative and appropriate monetary policy measures to stem the growing speculative attack on the Naira and level of foreign reserves. Given the current and foreseeable developments in a turbulent if not depressing outlook of the global economy, a stable exchange rate and a rising accretion rate in the level of reserves are about the most effective insurance the economy has against any likely external disturbances, and for being able to sustain current level of economic activity as well as promote growth. Every indication on the fiscal side shows that inflationary pressure reduction through fiscal consolidation is not likely to be achievable in the short term, at least not in the 2011-2012 budget periods. Similarly the structural constraints to growing credit and lending to the real sector are not likely to improve in the short run, given the current interest inelasticity of investment in the real sector. We are therefore still left with a considerable room of leverage for a policy stance that may raise the level of interest rate without necessarily or unduly harming the prospects for growth in the short to medium term. Secondly we are still far behind competing countries like Ghana and South Africa in bringing our MPR to a positive level that would make us more 21 competitive in attracting both FDI and portfolio capital. positive real interest rate is also desirable for encouraging growth in domestic saving. In the light of the foregoing, our current challenging situation leaves the MPC with little or no choice but to utilize every available means within its reach to halt the current run on foreign reserves and weakening of the Naira. This would require a combination of very strong monetary tightening signal beyond the symbolic levels hitherto undertaken, coupled with necessary administrative measures, to arrest the growing attack on the level of reserves and the Naira. would therefore vote for an upward adjustment of the CRR from its current level of four to eight percentage points, and the MPR raised by 275 basis points from its current level of 925 to 12 percent, and retaining existing symmetric corridor. Our next meeting within the next one month would offer the opportunity for evaluating the effectiveness of these measures in achieving the desired goals of reducing inflation rate, maintaining a stable exchange rate and drastically reducing the speculative demand for foreign exchange. .0 OSHILAJA. JOHN Inflation expectations in Nigeria are correlated with expectations of adverse changes in exchange rates for the Naira. Nigeria's is 22 currently a highly import-dependent economy. Accordingly a goal of Monetary Policy has to been to maintain relative price stability by also supporting (using tools at its disposal) relatively stable exchange rates. Since FY 2009, it has been the policy of the Central Bank to maintain exchange rates for the US Dollar within a +/- 3% range around N 15000; ie. at a “quasi-pegged rate”. There are fundamentally only two ways to do this. The Central Bank can ensure the supply of sufficient foreign currency, by drawing upon its reserves to meet the nation's demands at the desired price. Or it can adjust levels of available Naira needed to pay for foreign currency. The first approach has been the CBN's principal Exchange Rate Management strategy. This mostly explains why, over a 2-year period characterized by high oil prices and high capacity export production, the CBN's holdings of foreign currency reserves have fallen from a high of approximately N 60 billion, and have been hard pressed to exceed the top of a N 32-36 billion range observable so far in FY 2011. Since our meeting of 20 September, despite repeatedly expressed concerns about the impact of fiscally-sponsored liquidity in our markets, and measures taken to mitigate clear threats to local currency values, exchange rates for the Naira have breached and remained above desired target-levels. Which brings us to where we stand today – with the Naira trading as high as N 164 in 23 interbank markets, annual inflation at 93%, and the Monetary Policy Rate progressively increased from 6% to 925% within a 12- month time span. Market behavior and expectations now seem to be running well ahead of policy action, thus compounding the Central Bank's targeting efforts. Fast-breaking developments of the past few weeks also bring into stark relief the challenge Monetary Policy faces in utilizing exchange rate targeting to anchor price stability when Fiscal Policy is lax. The effectiveness of Central Bank liquidity management tends to be harmfully diluted when Naira amounts drained by the Central Bank are inevitably replenished, and thus cancelled out, by Government spending operations. This is the liquidity that invariably throws the currency market system out of balance by promoting disproportionately outsized demands for foreign currency, which thereby weakens the Naira. Under these circumstances it makes little sense to throw good reserves (ie. hard currency) after bad (ie. soft currency). Especially when further options remain available for tackling demand sides of this currently, unbalanced equation. The MPC decisions taken today may be characterized as a “stake” the Committee has driven into the ground – a stake based on Central Bank Liquidity Demand Management measures. Tethered around this stake will be a number of administrative and market-oriented measures to be rolled out, for the following purposes expressly: 24 1. Increase the Naira's attractiveness as a store of value 2. Ensure that non-speculative demands for foreign currency continue to be met 3. Promote a conducive Monetary environment for enhanced Foreign Investment Accordingly, the first thing that has to go is the implicit cost- subsidy the investing public affords governments for sovereign and sub-national investment securities; ie. Bills and Bonds. Savers utilizing domestic fixed-income markets must be paid competitive, real-term, rates of interest. Hence the MPC's initiation of a real interest rate regime, by an elevated increase in the MPR to 12%, with corresponding normal symmetries for the CBN's Deposit and Lending Facilities; ie. -/+ 2% respectively. The second measure entails addressing the level of perverse investment incentives in the banking sector. Nigerian DMB's appear to be holding (and funding) extraordinarily high levels of Naira assets, in the form of tax-free Government Treasury Bills and Bonds. This represents a conversion of surplus bank liquidity into comparatively risk-free assets. Most seem to be paying for these lucrative holdings with far cheaper deposit monies. see nothing wrong with any bank turning an easy Naira profit, given prudent and legal opportunities to do so. However in the current environment. I believe the costs our banks incur in temporarily 25 transforming such holdings into cash, to meet higher yielding demands (such as for business loans), is unacceptably low. This is also to say that current spreads between FGN Government securities' yields and penal CBN repo rates – for which the same securities are required as collateral – are too low. Especially given that a significant proportion of the proceeds of such credits are likely to hit currency markets under fiscally-boosted demand for imports. The increase in the Cash Reserve Ratio is intended immobilize further surplus banking liquidity; with added aim"
Chile,2011-10-13,"Central Bank of Chile Press Release* Santiago, 13 October 2011 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 5.25% (annual). Internationally, output indicators confirm slow growth in the United States and Europe. Consensus forecasts for these economies continue to be revised downward, while forecasts for emerging economies have been reduced. Fiscal and financial risks in the Eurozone are still high and uncertainty persists about how this situation will be resolved. Financial volatility is high and external financial conditions have tightened. Global commodity prices have experienced declines, of particular significance in the cases of copper and other metals. Central banks in the major economies have adopted additional expansionary measures, while most emerging economies have interrupted their tightening cycle, and in some cases, there have been cuts. Domestically, output and demand show signs of moderation. In the case of output, the slowdown is more pronounced than was assumed in the Monetary Policy Report's baseline scenario; the opposite occurs with demand. Labor market conditions remain tight. CPI inflation rates have hovered around 3% y-o-y, while core inflation measures remain contained. Inflation expectations are close to the target. A deepening of the trends observed in the world economy could shape a more adverse scenario than the one assumed in the Report's baseline scenario, with potential consequences for growth and inflation in Chile, as well as for the orientation of monetary policy. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. * The Spanish original prevails."
Egypt,2011-10-13,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release October 13, 2011 In its meeting held on October 13, 2011, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 825 percent and 975 percent, respectively, and the 7-day repo at 925 percen. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 85 percen. Headline CPI increased by 143 percent (m/m) in September following the 110 percent increase in Augus. The annual rate declined for the second consecutive month, on the back of favorable base effects from last year, falling from 849 percent to 821 percent in Septembe. On the other hand, core CPI increased by 113 percent in September following the 118 percent in August, leading the annual rate to increase from 698 percent to 795 percen. The latest monthly developments show that the sharp food price increases witnessed in July and August due to the Ramadan effect have moderated in September while adjustments in housing rentals led to an increase in non-food price. The probability of a rebound in international food prices is less likely now in light of recent global developments, nonetheless supply shortages in certain food commodities on the back of bad harvests could pose an upside risk to the inflation outloo. Meanwhile real GDP expanded by a mere 04 percent in 2010/2011 Q4 following the significant contraction of 43 percent recorded the previous quarte. This led the annual GDP growth for the whole year 2010/2011 to fall to 18 percent from 51 percent recorded in 2009/201. It is important to note that while a marked decline in economic activity was expected, the magnitude is larger than anticipated at the outset of the revolutio. This came on the back of significant declines in the tourism, manufacturing and construction sector. In the meantime, given the increased uncertainty that faced market participants early this year, investment witnessed a significant annual retrenchment of 20 percent in the second half of 2010/201. Looking ahead, the current political transformation may continue to have ramifications on both consumption as well as investment decisions, adversely weighing on key sectors within the econom. Moreover concerns related to the global recovery have intensified on the back of heightened worries regarding fiscal and banking sector challenges facing the Euro Area along with weaker than anticipated growth rates in a number of advanced economie. These factors, combined, pose downside risks to domestic GDP going forwar. Against the above background, the slowdown in economic growth should limit upside risks to the inflation outloo. Given the balance of risks on the inflation and GDP outlooks and the increased uncertainty at this juncture, the MPC judges that the current key CBE rates are appropriat.

South Korea,2011-10-13,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.25% for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.25% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information, the Committee considers that, while emerging market economies have shown favorable performances, major advanced economies have exhibited signs of sluggishness. Going forward the Committee forecasts that the global economy will show a recovery, albeit a moderate one; nevertheless, the Committee judges that downside risks to growth have expanded—due mostly to the likelihood of the sovereign debt problems in Europe spreading, and to the possibilities of the slumps in major country economies and the unrest in international financial markets continuing. In Korea, exports have sustained their high growth and domestic demand has posted a modest rising trend. On the employment front, although the increase in the number of employed slowed in September due to temporary factors, the trend of improvement led by the private sector appears to be continuing. The Committee anticipates that the domestic economy will keep up its long-term trend of growth going forward, but judges the downside risks to growth to have increased due to the impact of external risk factors. Consumer price inflation declined to 4.3% in September, owing to the stabilization of agricultural product prices. The Committee expects the pace of decline in inflation to be modest in the coming months, given stubbornly high inflation expectations, although factors such as declines in agricultural product prices and the base effect from last year will work to bring inflation down. Core inflation meanwhile recorded 3.9%, similar to its level of the previous month, and is forecast to remain elevated for the time being. As for housing prices, those in Seoul and its surrounding areas maintained their August levels, while prices in the rest of the country continued to climb at a rapid pace. The rate of increase in leasehold deposits also rose further. In the financial markets, stock prices and the exchange rate continued to fluctuate widely, mainly reflecting unease concerning external risk factors. Long-term market interest rates fell somewhat, affected primarily by concerns over slowdowns in economic growth both at home and abroad and by foreigners' continued bond purchases. Looking ahead, the Committee, while closely monitoring financial and economic risk factors both at home and abroad, will conduct monetary policy with a greater emphasis on ensuring that the basis for price stability is firmly anchored while the economy continues its sound growth."
Peru,2011-10-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR OCTOBER 2011 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 4.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference at 4.25 percent. This decision takes into account the slowdown observed in some components of expenditure and production, as well as the intensification of international financial risks. Should these trends continue, the Central Bank will change its monetary policy stance. Affected by transitory factors, inflation in September recorded a monthly rate of 0.33 percent and an annual rate of 3.73 percent. Core inflation, which registered 0.31 percent, accumulated an annual rate of 3.37 percent. Inflation excluding food and energy showed a rate of 0.25 percent and accumulated an annual rate of 2.38 percent. Some current and advanced indicators of activity show that growth in the economy is moderating, even though several components still maintain a strong pace of growth. Thus, sales of electricity grew 9.2 percent in September, while the domestic consumption of cement recorded an increase of 7.3 percent in August. Moreover, indicators of global activity register lower growth rates, and increased uncertainty persists in international financial markets with potential negative effects on global economic growth due to the weak evolution of the U.S. economy and the persistence of risks associated with the fiscal and financial situation of some industrialized countries. The Board continues to oversee the projection of inflation and its determinants and stands ready to adopt future adjustments in monetary policy instruments on a prompt and timely basis. The Board also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as described below: Overnight deposits: 3.45 percent. Direct repo and rediscount operations: 5.05 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.05 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for November on its session of November 10, 2011."
Philippines,2011-10-19,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the overnight policy rates. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs, and special deposit accounts (SDAs) were also maintained accordingly. The reserve requirement ratios were also kept steady. The Monetary Board's assessment of a manageable inflation environment and subdued economic conditions continues to support current monetary policy settings. Latest average baseline forecasts show a lower inflation path, consistent with the 3-5 percent target range for 2011-2013, while inflation expectations remain well-contained, supported by easing commodity prices. Domestic economic growth has moderated as the global recovery has slowed down and as domestic public spending has been weaker than expected. The Monetary Board also believes that the risks surrounding the inflation outlook over the policy horizon are slightly tilted to the downside. The global economic outlook has become significantly more uncertain and financial markets continue to be vulnerable to interlocking sovereign debt and banking concerns in Europe. The expected moderation in external demand, which has also contributed to the slight pullback in international commodity prices, provides scope to pause and assess the outlook for inflation and growth. The Monetary Board believes the decision to maintain the policy stance is consistent with the emerging economic developments and the inflation outlook. While the inflation outlook is expected to be manageable, the Monetary Board continues to be mindful of any remaining upside risks to inflation, including potential increases in liquidity due to sustained capital inflows. The BSP remains watchful over evolving price and output conditions, both on the global and domestic fronts, and will ensure that monetary policy settings remain appropriate."
Thailand,2011-10-19,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 19 October 2011 Mr. Paiboon Kittisrikangwan. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announces the outcome of the meeting today, as follows. The MPC assessed that the global economic outlook had deteriorated markedly as a result of the impasse over the resolution of the euro area's sovereign debt problem, which prompted a surge in financial market volatility on concerns that spillovers onto the banking sector and the real economy will become more severe. Latest US economic data indicated a fragile recovery and market perception of a recession had increased. In Asia, export growth in some countries moderated in line with the global economic slowdown. Nonetheless firm domestic demand and available fiscal policy space should help to cushion growth and trade within the region from the impact of a slowdown in advanced economies. Preliminary data for 2011 Q3 pointed to continued growth of the Thai economy though the effects of a softer world economy became evident in the moderation in export growth. Going forward, intra-regional trade and domestic demand, particularly from forthcoming government stimulus measures, would help limit downside risks to growth. The MPC noted the severity of the floods, which had already brought about partial halt in some production sectors, and would substantially curtail economic growth in the remaining part of the year from previously projected. Nevertheless reconstruction spending would provide support for domestic demand to gradually pick up in the periods ahead. Inflationary pressure continued to be sustained by growth in domestic demand, though declines in input costs, such as moderated oil prices from a weaker global economy, as well as more stable inflation expectations would lessen inflationary pressure going forward. Nonetheless upside risks to inflation from higher public and private spending as the floods recede would need to be monitored. The MPC deemed that the current level of the policy rate is appropriate in addressing upcoming inflationary pressure and supporting economic adjustments amidst heightened uncertainty in the global economy. Meanwhile with the floods not yet over, their impact on the economy was not fully evident. The MPC therefore voted 6 to 1 to hold the policy interest rate at the current level of 350 per cent, with one vote in favour of a 025 per cent decrease. The MPC would remain vigilant in monitoring developments of risks and stand ready to take appropriate policy actions."
Turkiye,2011-10-20,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to adjust the short term interest rates as follows: a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) has been kept at 5.75 percent, b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate has been kept at 5 percent while lending rate has been increased from 9 percent to 12,5 percent. Interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions has been increased from 8 percent to 12 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent while lending rate has been increased from 12 percent to 15,5 percent. Recent data releases suggest that the rebalancing between the domestic and external demand is ongoing as envisaged. With the credit growth decelerating to more reasonable levels, the desired increase in private savings has already started to take place. Accordingly, the Committee has noted that there is a significant improvement in the current account balance and this trend will be more evident in the final quarter of the year. Inflation will rise significantly in the upcoming months due to the recent excessive depreciation of the Turkish lira, base effects from unprocessed food prices and the recent adjustments in administered prices. The Committee will not tolerate these developments to have an adverse impact on medium term inflation expectations and inflation outlook. In this respect, the Committee has decided to widen the interest rate corridor by increasing the lending rate significantly. Moreover, in line with the strategy formulated at the interim meeting of August 4, 2011, the Committee will continue to monitor global developments closely and take the needed measures promptly to maintain the stability in the domestic financial markets. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Israel,2011-10-24,"24.10.2011 The Bank of Israel leaves the interest rate for November 2011 unchanged at 3 percent To view this press release as a WORD file - Click here The current interest rate decision was made by the Monetary Committee inaccordance with the new Bank of Israel Law. The Monetary Committee has sixmembers. Three are from the Bank: Governor of the Bank of Israel Prof. Stanley Fischer, who serves as chairperson of the committee. Deputy Governor Dr.Karnit Flug, and Barry Topf. Senior Advisor to the Governor. The other three members of the committee are from the public: Prof. Reuben Gronau. Prof. Rafi Melnick, and Prof. Alex Cukierman. The Bank of Israel notice of the confirmation of their appointment can be accessed at the Bank's website. <br> Background conditions Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) declined 0.2 percent in September, below forecasts which on average predicted no change, and within the seasonal path consistent with achieving the inflation target. The food prices component of the index continued to decline, among other reasons against the background of the social protest. This month, the rate of inflation over the past 12 months, as measured by the change in the CPI, entered the target range (1-3 percent per year) and is now 2.9 percent. The rate of inflation, seasonally adjusted, over the past seven months has been around the lower limit of the inflation target range Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Inflation expectations as calculated from the capital markets, which reached around 2 percent toward the end of September, declined in October and are at 1.6 percent on average. Expectations fell primarily for the short term: for the medium andlonger periods expectations remained steady at 2.3 percent. Forecasters' inflation predictions for the next twelve CPI readings were 2.2 percent on average, slightly below last month's average. The decline in expectations ofinflation took place against the background of continued expectations for a slowdown in growth world wide and in Israel, as well as the lowering of prices by retail chains and service providers, influenced by the social protest against the high cost of living. At the same time, forecasts of the Bank of Israel interest rate continued to fall. Based on the Telbor (Tel Aviv Inter-Bank Offered Rate) market, the Bank of Israel interest rate one year from now is expected to be 2.7 percent, down from 3 percent a month ago, and the average of forecasters' predictions is that it will be 3 percent, down from 3.15 percent a month ago. Most forecasters expect the Bank of Israelto leave the interest rate for November unchanged, and on average they expect the interest rate to be reduced by 0.3 percent in the next three months. Real economic activity: Economic indicators that became availablethis month support the assessment of recent months that the rate of growthof the economy is lower than that of the first quarter of 2011. The growthof both domestic demand and goods exports declined. Based on foreign tradefigures (seasonally adjusted) industrial exports declined around 4.3 percent in the third quarter, compared with the second quarter. In contrast, imports were mostly unchanged, primarily due to an increase in imports of investment goods. In September, the goods trade deficit continued to widen, as it had over recent months. The Bank of Israel's Companies Survey for the third quarter shows that the economy continues to expand, though at a more moderate pace than in previous quarters. With that, in most industries the expectations for the fourth quarter range from a freeze in activity to a moderate drop in activity. The Central Bureau of Statistics survey of business trends as well as the Globes and the Bank Hapoalim consumer confidence indices point to a decline in the public's planned consumption. The Purchasing Managers Index, compiled by Bank Hapoalim and the Israel Purchasing and Logistics Managers Association, fell sharply and in September was below 50. Tax receipts in September were 4 percent lower than forecast, a continuation of the slowdown that began in April. The labor market and wages: Labor market data indicate a high level of employment and a low unemployment rate. The rate of growth of the number of employed has moderated in recent months. The trend rate of unemployment for July was unchanged at 5.4 percent. The number of Israeli employee posts (seasonally adjusted) increased by 2 percent in May-July, in annual terms, compared with the preceding three months. The nominal wage rose in May-July by 1.5 percent, compared with the three previous months (seasonally adjusted), and the real wage was unchanged. In September, health tax receipts, which provide an indication of wage payments in that month, were 9 percent higher (preliminary estimate), in nominal terms, than inSeptember 2010 (excluding the effect of legislative changes). The Bank of Israel Research Department staff forecast: According to the Research Department staff forecast (from September), inflation over the four quarters ending in the third quarter of 2012 will be 2.3 percent, and the average interest rate for 2012 will be 3 percent. GDP growth for 2011 is forecast to be 4.7 percent, and 3.2 percent in 2012. The assessment is based on, among other things, a lowered International Monetary Fund (IMF)forecast for global growth and world trade. This month the Research Department examined the possible effect on Israel's economy of a scenario in which global growth is 1 percentage point lower than the base scenario. If the lower growth scenario develops. GDP growth in Israel is forecast to be about 0.5 percentage points lower in 2012 than in the base scenario. Inflation over the four quarters ending in the third quarter of 2012 is forecast to be 0.8 percentage points lower than in the base scenario, and the average interest rate for 2012 is expected to be 1 percentage point lower than in thebase scenario. Budget data: Government domestic revenues for the year to date through September were 3.1 percent lower than the seasonal path of the budgetforecast, due to a continued slowdown in indirect tax receipts, which began in April. The overall government deficit (excluding net credit) in the year to date was NIS 9.7 billion, compared to a deficit of NIS 14 billion in the corresponding period of the year before. Developments in government activity so far indicate that tax revenues will be slightly lower than the budget forecast, and the budget deficit for the full year of 2011 will be around the deficit ceiling set by law: 3 percent of GDP. The foreign exchange market: From the previous monetary policy discussion held on September 25, through October 21, the shekel appreciated by about 1.8 percent against the dollar, in line with the general trend, butat a moderate level compared with the performance of currencies of developed countries. In contrast, the shekel was essentially unchanged against theeuro (depreciation of 0.02 percent). The shekel strengthened by about 0.8 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. The rate of participation by nonresident investors in foreign currency trading was 26 percentin October, compared with 32 percent in September, while the average for the year to date in 2011 is 34 percent. The capital and money markets:From the previous monetary policy discussion held on September 25, through October 21, the Tel Aviv 25 Index increased by 5.9 percent, with relatively high volatility, similar to the trend on most stock markets around the world. The government bond market responded with declining rates for most maturities. Returns declined 10-16 basis points across most of the yield curve of unindexed bonds, and yields on CPI-indexed government bonds declined by up to 6-12 basis points for most maturities. The yield gap between Israeli 10-year government bonds and equivalent 10-year US Treasury securities contracted to about 250 basis points, from 290 basis points in the previous month. Makam yields fell by up to 25 basis points across the yield curve, as the yield for one year fellduring the period from 2.98 percent to 2.8 percent: against the background of the interest rate cut by the Bank of Israel last month, and expectations of similar moves in coming months. Withdrawals from mutual funds specializing in corporate bonds continued this month, although at a slower pace than that in the previous month. Over the period as a whole. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spread declined, andnarrowed to 160 basis points from last month's 218 basis points. The Tel-Bond indices rose around 2 percent. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in September, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 0.5 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up toone year) increased by 13.1 percent. Developments in the credit markets: The balance of outstanding debt of the business sector increased in August by 1.5 percent, to NIS 768 billion. Outstanding credit to households increased by 0.4 percent in August,to NIS 359 billion. Of the credit to households, outstanding housing credit rose 10.9 percent in the twelve months ending in August, to NIS 255 billion, compared with an 11.8 percent increase in the twelve months to July. The volume of new housing credit granted in the twelve months ending in September was slightly lower than in the twelve months ending in August: a continuation of consecutive declines since the record high set in May. The share of unindexed floating rate mortgages extended in September rose to 26.8 percent, from 26.1 percent in August. These percentages are significantly lower than the record levels of the first quarter of 2009: about 75 percent on average. The interest rates on floating rate mortgages, bothCPI-indexed and unindexed, continued to increase in August, while the interest rates on fixed rate CPI-indexed mortgages declined. The housing market:Activity in the construction industry continues to be strong. The number of starts in the twelve months to July reached 42,910, compared with 42,059 the month before, and the number of completionswas 33,138, compared with 33,740 the previous month (Ministry of Construction and Housing figures). The number of homes available for sale continued to increase, and in June-August was on average 9.1 percent higher than in the three preceding months (original data). The construction sector continued to expand in the third quarter, according to figures from the Bankof Israel's Companies Survey, and expectations in the sector are for continued growth in activity in the fourth quarter as well. Housing prices reflected in the housing index, which is based mainly on renewed rental contracts and which is included in the CPI, continued to increase at a relatively rapid pace, rising 0.9 percent in September, and by 5.5 percent in the past twelve months, and prices are expected: according to the Research Department forecast: to continue to increase at a similar pace in the coming year. Home prices, which are published in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of home prices but are not included in the CPI, increased at a monthly rate of 0.8 percent in July and August, afterrising 0.4 percent in June and July. The annual rate of increase in home prices remains high and relatively stable. In the twelve months ended in July home prices increased by 12.1 percent; compared with a 12.3 percent increase in the June figure and a 12.1 percent increase in May: this follows levels of around 20 percent in 2010. The slowdown in the rate of increase in home prices comes against the background of the continued increase in the number of building starts, the lagged effect of the increase in the interest rate, measures introduced by the Bank of Israel affecting mortgages, and steps taken by the Ministry of Finance in real estate taxation. The effect of these moves is expected to continue and be evident going forward. The global economy: Uncertainty about the continuation of the global economic recovery increased this month, primarily against the background of difficulties in major economies, the financial crisis in Europe, and lack of clarity regarding rescue plans developing in Europe. Growth forecasts for Europe for 2011 and 2012 were revised down. The base scenario is for a standstill in Europe and low growth in the US. There are also the first signs of moderating economic activity in emerging markets. Europe continues to be the focus of risk factors: the probability of negative growth,even in core economies, increased significantly, and recently, the growth forecast in Germany for 2012 declined by half, to 0.8 percent. Concern regarding a severe financial crisis remained high, due to risk spreading to leading banks in Europe, liquidity difficulties in the banking system, and lowered ratings of leading banks in the world. These background conditions ledpolicy makers in Europe to announce a wide ranging aid plan, and led majorcentral banks (the Fed. ECB, and BOE) to undertake further measures of monetary easing. With that, the aid plans developing in Europe and relatively good macroeconomic figures in the US, led to gains in main stock indices. </td> The main considerations behind the decision The decision to leave the interest rate for November unchanged after reducing it for October is in line with monetary policy aimed at stabilizing the rate of inflation within the price stability target range of 1-3 percent over the coming 12 months, and is intended to support growth whilepreserving financial stability. The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel, the global economy, the monetary policies of major central banks, and developments in the exchange rate of the shekel. Inflation expectations for the coming 12 months, both those calculated from the capital market and those of forecasters, continued to decline within the inflation target range and are currently 1.7 percent and 2.2 percent, respectively. The rate of inflation over the previous 12 months entered the target range in September, for the first time since December 2010, and is currently 2.9 percent. The rate of inflation, seasonally adjusted, over the past seven months has been around the lower limit of the inflation target range. Economic indicators that became available this month indicated that local economic activity continued to expand, but at a slower pace than in 2010 and the first quarter of 2011. The slowdown in the growth of the local economy was primarily a result of moderation in global demand and its impact on exports, but some weakness also began to be evident in domestic demand. Concerns of a negative turnaround in the eurozone remained, primarily in light of thedifficulties in formulating a rescue plan for countries suffering debt crises. In the US, while concerns of a negative turnaround have not dissipated, recent figures on activity were better than expected. With that, the level of uncertainty regarding developments in the global economy remains especially high, and clearly impacts on uncertainty regarding developments in Israel's economy. The negative turnaround in Europe and the slow growth in the US have led to themarkets not pricing in an interest rate increase over the coming year by the central bank of any large advanced economy. The Federal Reserve has saidthat the fed funds rate is expected to remain at its near zero level untilat least the middle of 2013. The Fed and ECB continued monetary expansion programs. The rate of increase in home prices over the twelve months which ended in August remains relatively stable at a high level of over 12 percent, though low compared with last year's 20 percent levels. With that, the sustained increase inbuilding starts, the lagged effect of the increase in the interest rate, measures taken by the Bank of Israel with regard to mortgages, and changes in real estate taxation introduced by the Ministry of Finance, are expected to continue to contribute to moderation in home prices over the coming year. Maintaining the interest rate at its current level leaves the Bank of Israel room to respond to events in the global and local economies. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in Israel's economy and the global economy and in the financial markets. The Bank will usethe tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, including keeping a close watch on developments in the assets market, and especially in the housing market. The minutes of the discussions prior to the above interest rate decision will be published on November 7, 2011. The decision regarding the interest rate for December 2011 will be published at 17:30 on Monday. November 28, 2011. 24.10.2011 The Bank of Israel leaves the interest rate for November 2011 unchanged at 3 percent.

Hungary,2011-10-25,"At its meeting on 25 October 2011, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to leave the central bank base rate unchanged at 6.00%. In the Council's judgement, economic growth is likely to remain subdued over the next two years, with the level of output remaining below its potential throughout the period. In the short run, inflation is likely to pick up as a result of certain Government measures and a depreciating exchange rate. It is then expected to moderate in the weak demand environment as the effects of the cost shocks and indirect tax increases wear off. However, there is considerable uncertainty around the degree and time path of disinflation, as developments in inflation have been affected by several shocks in the short term. In the Council's judgement, the outlook for growth has worsened significantly recently. Consumption demand is likely to be persistently low, reflecting the protracted process of balance sheet adjustment by households, uncertain income prospects and the further tightening in credit conditions. Significant fiscal adjustment next year is also likely to act as a brake on domestic demand growth. In the uncertain economic environment, the tightening in credit conditions and the weaker outlook for growth are likely to be a drag on investment activity. Corporate profitability is expected to fall, reflecting rising labour costs due to the increase in the minimum wage and the tightening in the rules on write-offs of losses incurred in previous years. As a result, corporate investment activity may fall in 2012, which will be only partly offset by a couple of large individual investment projects implemented in manufacturing and the use of EU development funds. Service sector investment is unlikely to pick up, due to the significant margin of spare capacity. Household investment may reach its trough at the end of this year, but is expected to remain flat thereafter. Domestic lending continues to make little contribution to economic growth. Rolling over short-term external funding has become more expensive and difficult for banks, due to the sovereign debt problems in the euro-area periphery. In addition, banks' capital position has been deteriorating due to early repayments by households of their foreign currency-denominated mortgages. These factors may lead to a further tightening of credit supply constraints. The slowdown in global activity, concerns about debt sustainability in some euro-area periphery countries and the vulnerability of the financial system point to a weaker outlook for activity in Hungary's export markets, which in turn is likely to dampen export growth. Despite the slowdown in external demand, exports are likely to remain the main driver of subdued domestic growth over the next two years. Over the past month. Hungarian risk premia have remained elevated, due mainly to the deteriorating outlook for global growth and the protracted debt crisis of the euro area. The decline in domestic banks' capital buffers due to the option for households to repay their foreign currency debt at below-market rates represents a significant source of uncertainty in terms of Hungary's risk perceptions. The Monetary Council welcomes the Government's commitment to next year's 2.5% deficit target, which, if met, may contribute to reduced perceptions of the risks associated with the economy. The deteriorating outlook for activity points to disinflationary pressure from the demand side. The increases in VAT and excise duties are likely to boost the consumer price index temporarily. Although the weaker exchange rate and the planned increase in the minimum wage may generate short-term inflationary pressures, subdued inflationary pressures due to weak demand are likely to dominate developments in annual CPI inflation as the impact of cost shocks and the indirect tax increase gradually fades. However, there is considerable uncertainty around the degree and time path of disinflation, as developments in inflation have been affected by several shocks in the short term. The Monetary Council will therefore monitor particularly carefully the potential spillover impact of these shocks and developments in tax-adjusted inflation, in addition to the consumer price index. Monetary policy can best support the recovery and contribute to an environment conducive to investment and job creation by maintaining predictability and preserving the stability of prices and the financial system. The risks to the outlook for inflation and financial market developments warrant a wait-and-see policy stance. The Monetary Council has therefore decided to leave interest rates unchanged."
India,2011-10-25,"Second Quarter Review of Monetary Policy for 2011-12 Press Statement by Dr.D. Subbarao. Governor At the outset, on behalf of the Reserve Bank of India. I want to welcome all of you to this Second Quarter Review of Monetary Policy for 2011-12. Earlier this morning, we put out the monetary policy measures accompanying this Review. Based on an assessment of the current macroeconomic situation, we have decided to: increase the repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 25 basis points. The repo rate will accordingly move up from 8.25 to 8.5 per cent. Accordingly, the reverse repo rate under the LAF, determined with a spread of 100 basis point below the repo rate, gets calibrated to 7.5 per cent. Similarly, the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate, determined with a spread of 100 bps above the repo rate, stands adjusted at 9.5 per cent. These changes have come into effect immediately after the announcement. We have also decided to deregulate the savings bank deposit interest rate with immediate effect. I will come to its details later. Considerations Behind the Policy Move 6. The decision to persist with monetary tightening has been informed by two broad considerations. First, both inflation and inflation expectations remain high. Inflation is broad- based, and is above the comfort level of the Reserve Bank. We expect these levels to persist for two more months. There are potential risks of expectations becoming unhinged in the event of a pre-mature change in the policy stance. However, reassuringly, momentum indicators, particularly the de-seasonalised quarter-on-quarter headline and core inflation measures, indicate moderation. This is consistent with the projection that inflation will decline beginning December 2011. The second consideration that shaped the policy decision is that growth is clearly moderating on account of the cumulative impact of past monetary policy actions as well as some other factors. As inflation begins to decline, there will be growing room for the policy stance to give due consideration to growth risks, within the overall objective of maintaining a low and stable inflation environment. While the impact of past monetary actions is still unfolding, based on our growth- inflation dynamics, we considered it necessary to persist with the anti-inflationary stance.2011 and then continue down a steady path to 7 per cent by March 2012. It is expected to moderate further in the first half of 2012-13. This reflects a combination of commodity price movements and the cumulative impact of monetary tightening. Further, moderating inflation rates are likely to impact expectations favourably. These expected outcomes provide some room for monetary policy to address growth risks in the short run. With this in mind, notwithstanding current rates of inflation persisting till November, the likelihood of a rate action in the December mid-quarter review is relatively low. Beyond that, if the inflation trajectory conforms to projections, further rate hikes may not be warranted. However, as always, actions will depend on the evolving macroeconomic conditions. It must be emphasised, however, that several factors  structural imbalances in agriculture, infrastructure capacity bottlenecks, distorted administered prices of several key commodities and the pace of fiscal consolidation  combine to keep medium-term inflation risks in the economy high. These risks can only be mitigated by concerted policy actions on several fronts. In the absence of progress on these, over the medium term, the monetary policy stance will have to take into account the risk of inflation surging in response to even a moderate growth recovery. Expected Outcomes 13. We expect that today's policy action and the guidance we have given will result in the following three outcomes: first, on the basis of a credible commitment to low and stable inflation, medium- term inflation expectations will remain anchored. second, the emerging trajectory of inflation, which is expected to begin to decline in December 2011, will be reinforced. and, finally, it will contribute to stimulating investment activity. Global and Domestic Developments 14. As always, our decision has been based on a careful assessment of the global and domestic macroeconomic situation. Let me summarise that. Global Economy 15. On the global front, the growth momentum in the US and the euro area economies has weakened. In the euro area, macroeconomic prospects are intimately tied in to its ability to credibly resolve its sovereign debt and financial sector problems. The adverse feedback loops among sluggish growth, weak sovereign balance sheets, large exposures of banks to sovereign debt and political compulsions coming in the way3. Going forward, the inflation path will be shaped by both demand and supply factors. First, it will depend on the extent of moderation in aggregate demand. Some signs of demand moderation are evident, although the impact is being felt more on the investment side. Second, the behaviour of crude prices will be a crucial factor in shaping the outlook of domestic inflation in the near future. The benefit of a decline in global crude prices in the recent period has been more than offset by the depreciation of the rupee in nominal terms. Thus, the exchange rate will also have some impact on the behaviour of domestic petroleum prices.4. Keeping in view the domestic demand-supply balance, the global trends in commodity prices and the likely demand scenario, the baseline projection for WPI inflation for March 2012 is kept unchanged at 7 per cent. Elevated inflationary pressures are expected to ease from December 2011, though uncertainties about sudden adverse developments remain. Liquidity and Monetary Conditions 25. The systemic liquidity deficit remained within one per cent of banks' net demand and time liabilities (NDTL), the comfort zone assessed by the Reserve Bank and consistent with the anti-inflationary stance of monetary policy. This year so far, the money supply (M ) and credit growth remain above the 3 indicative trajectories of the Reserve Bank. We expect that monetary aggregates will evolve along the projected trajectory indicated in the First Quarter Review. Accordingly, we have retained the M growth projection for 2011-12 at 15.5 per cent and non-food 3 credit growth at 18 per cent. Risk Factors 27. Now, let me highlight the risks to our growth and inflation projections: first, a major downside risk to growth emanates from the global macroeconomic environment; second, despite recent moderation, global commodity prices remain high; third, the Government has announced increased market borrowings, which can potentially crowd out more productive private sector investment; and, fourth, structural imbalances in protein-rich items such as pulses, milk, egg, fish and meat will persist and consequently, food inflation is likely to remain under pressure. Developmental and Regulatory Policies 28. This Review also includes developmental and regulatory policies. Let me explain briefly some of the important initiatives we have announced. As alluded to earlier, we have decided to deregulate the savings bank deposit interest rate with immediate effect; banks are free to determine their savings bank deposit interest rate, subject to the following two conditions: First, each bank will have to offer a uniform interest rate on savings bank deposits up to 1 lakh, irrespective of the amount in the account within this limit. Second, for savings bank deposits over 1 lakh, a bank may provide differential rates of interest, if it so chooses. However, there should not be50,000 to 99,999) without the need to take permission from the Reserve Bank in each case, subject to reporting. In the area of financial markets, four important initiatives have been announced. First, the Reserve Bank will issue the final guidelines on the cash settled 5-year and 2-year interest rate futures (IRFs), including the final settlement price by end-December 2011. Second, guidelines on credit default swaps (CDS) will be made effective by end-November 2011. Third, guidelines on short sale in government securities will be issued by end-December 2011. Fourth, a Working Group will be constituted to examine and suggest ways for enhancing secondary market liquidity in the G-Sec and interest rate derivatives markets. Moving on to the regulatory measures for commercial banks, let me highlight a few important initiatives we have announced in this review: First, the Reserve Bank will issue the final guidelines on internal rating based (IRB) approach for credit risk by end-December 2011. Second, a discussion paper will be issued by end-March 2012 on the dynamic provisioning approach for comments. Third, a Working Group will be constituted to look into principles governing proper, transparent and non-discriminatory pricing of credit. Fourth, another Working Group will be constituted to review the existing prudential guidelines on restructuring of advances by banks/ financial institutions and suggest revisions taking into account the best international practices and accounting standards. Customer service has always been on top of the Reserve Bank's policy agenda. Recognising the need for revisiting the issues of customer service in banks, the Reserve Bank constituted the Damodaran Committee to make recommendations for improving customer service. The Committee has made several recommendations to improve customer service. We have decided to implement the recommendations of the Committee, on which a broad consensus has emerged, as also the action points which were identified by the Indian Banks' Association (IBA) and Banking Codes and Standards Board of India (BCSBI) in the last Banking Ombudsmen conference.6. Before I close, let me mention that the Reserve Bank is firmly of the view that controlling inflation is imperative both for sustaining growth over the medium-term, and for increasing the potential growth rate. The potential growth rate is not a long term constant; nor is it exogenously determined. It is critically dependent upon policies that create a congenial investment climate and encourage investment activity. The challenge for the Government and the Reserve Bank is to ensure that demand is constrained in the short term to bring inflation down, but at the same time to encourage supply response so as to improve productivity and expand the potential output of the economy in the medium term. I thank you for your attention and best wishes for a Happy Diwali. Ajit Prasad Press Release : 2011-2012/646 Assistant General Manager."
Georgia,2011-10-26,"26.10.11 NBG Lowers Its Policy Rate by 25 Basis Points The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on October 26, 2011 and decided to lower its Main Policy Rate (the refinancing rate) by 25 basis points to 7.25 percent. As expected, the decreasing trend of inflation continued in September as well. Annual inflation stands at 4.6% as of September and core inflations remain low. Specifically, core inflation (net of food and energy) amounts to 0.5 percent. According to the existing forecasts, inflation is expected to remain low till the end of the year and will further decrease at the beginning of 2012. In recent months the bank credits to the economy has increased considerably, particularly the loans disbursed in the domestic currency. The growth in loans stimulated economic activity and as a consequence, increase in the growth rate of the economy was observed in the third quarter. The annual inflation rate dropped below the target level of the NBG in September and is expected to decrease further at the beginning of the next year. According to the existing forecasts, the inflation forecast in 2012 will remain below the target level. Accordingly, the Monetary Policy Committee of the NBG considered it appropriate to continue easing the monetary policy and decided to decrease the policy rate by 25 basis points. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on November 22, 2011."
Mongolia,2011-10-26,"MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Ref No: 2011/10 Valid from: October 26, 2011 Embargo: Not for publication or broadcast before 1100 hours on Tuesday, 25 October 2011. October 25, 2011- BoM Board of Directors decided to increase the policy rate by 0.5 unit percent to 12.25%. The inflation speeds up and includes more and more kinds of products. The National Statistical Office of Mongolia announced that the national CPI has grown to 10.5%, the capital city's CPI was to 11.9% as of September, 2011. The rapid expansion of budget expense, cash hand-out from the Human Development Fund and the high increase in loans are contributing to higher demand. This sharp increase in demand builds the pressure on core inflation even the total supply and the real capacity of economy have not added on yet. The consecutive growth in prices of non-food products from the beginning of 2011 and the current stand in yoy 11.3% prove that the increase of total demand is bringing the growth of core price. The budget amendment of 2011 and the draft of 2012 budget probably have risk to build the unstable condition of macroeconomy as highly increasing the total demand and the inflation pressure. The debt crisis of European countries and the stagnation of economic growth in USA have shown the unpleasant outlook of world economy in upcoming years. The Bank of Mongolia is taking the action to decentralize the expected inflation pressure, economic overheat and to maintain the stability of macroecoomy. BANK OF MONGOLIA."
Russia,2011-10-28,"The Bank of Russia External and Public Relations Department informs that on 28 October 2011 the Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia decided to keep the refinancing rate and interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations unchanged (table “Interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations”). The decision was supported by the assessment of inflation risks and risks to the sustainability of economic growth, including those associated with the uncertainty of the outlook for global economic activity. Since the previous meeting the Board of Directors on monetary policy issues the pace of inflation continued to decrease and as of 24 October 2011 reached 6.9% over year ago (7.2% in September, 8.2% in August). The disinflation was still largely driven by prices on certain categories of food products, however this effect has been losing momentum. In September disinflation was also registered in the services prices. Meanwhile the annual rate of non-food price inflation in recent months remained elevated. The Bank of Russia will continue to monitor the influence of relevant factors on the inflation dynamics, including the potential pass-through effect of rouble depreciation of the recent months on consumer prices. The dynamics of the main macroeconomic indicators in September were mixed. In September industrial production annual growth rate decreased sharply relative to the August level. Meanwhile after previous month's decline fixed capital investment annual growth rate picked up. Persistently modest unemployment rate as well as faster growth in real disposable incomes and consumer credit supported consumer demand growth which was reflected in the continuing acceleration of retail sales growth rate. Current developments in domestic demand indicators could result in higher level of economic activity but may also be a source of additional inflation pressure. The situation on the money market in recent months has been characterized by the growing banking sector demand on the Bank of Russia's refinancing instruments. Increase in the amounts of liquidity provided by the Bank of Russia will contribute to restrain money market interest rates growth. Considering recent domestic and international macroeconomic developments and the effect of the monetary policy measures, implemented in recent months, the Bank of Russia judged that the current level of money market interest rates is appropriate to balance the inflationary risks and the risks of economic growth slowdown in the nearest future. The Bank of Russia also decided to expand the maturity of the Bank of Russia's loans secured by gold to 180 days and set the interest rate on such loans with maturity from 91 to 180 days at 7.25% per annum. The next meeting of the Board of Directors on monetary policy issues is planned to be held in the last decade of November 2011. Interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations(% p.a.). 1 7 days fixed rates REPO operations have been suspended. 2 Operations have been suspended. 3 The interest rate has been set from 1 November 2011. 4 Operations were suspended from 10 February 2011, resumed from 1 November 2011.

Armenia,2011-11-01,"Press Release 11.01.2011 In the January 11, 2011 meeting the Board of CBA decided to leave the Refinancing Rate of CBA unchanged, at 7.25 percent. In December of 2010 inflation was 1.8 percent, and annual inflation indicator for 2010 reached 9.4 percent. The Board stated that a high level of the 12-month inflation remains to be driven by price increases on agricultural products and food products in international markets: total contribution of food price increases to annual inflation made up 7.5 pp. Further, price increases on fruit, vegetable, meat products, dairy products and egg made a 5.0 pp contribution while imported food's contribution  about 2 pp. The Board believes that inflationary pressures from international food markets persist and are intensifying as tension deriving from fundamentals of main food markets of the world is further felt. The latter, coupled with inflationary pressures fuelled by the developments in agriculture over 2010, keeps on creating secondary effects and inflation expectations. However, as considered by the Board, recording a similar decline in agriculture and resultant inflationary pressures during 2011 is less risky. The Board also agrees that a slowly recovering aggregate demand is not creating inflationary pressures yet. However, there are prevailing risks that inflation will exceed the upper border of the band if the above mentioned developments persist. In consideration of monetary policy lags on aggregate demand, demonstration of supply factors and their secondary effects as well as uncertainties about the developments in agriculture, the Board sees tightening of monetary conditions still an option.

Romania,2011-11-02,"In its meeting of November 2, 2011, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided the following:. The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled for November 7, 2011. The annual inflation rate dropped to 3.45 percent in September from 4.25 percent in the previous month and re-entered the variation band around the central target after more than 12 months. Moreover, the annual adjusted CORE21 inflation rate also dropped, albeit less significantly, to 2.72 percent in September from 2.92 percent in August 2011. The reduction in the annual inflation rate was mainly attributed to the fall in volatile food prices over June-September and the fading-out of most of the first-round effect of the VAT rate hike. For the months ahead, disinflation is envisaged to consolidate, along with the downward adjustment of inflation expectations against the background of maintaining a prudent monetary policy stance. The favourable performance of industrial production and exports continued, despite the recent negative signals coming from the external environment. Nevertheless, the negative output gap is persisting, and the revival of loans to the private sector is still modest, also as a result of banks' pro-cyclical behaviour reflecting uncertainties and risks related to the sovereign debt crisis in the euro zone and the mixed signals on world economy recovery. The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, a document that assesses the recent macroeconomic context, investigates the inflation outlook and identifies the main challenges and constraints to monetary policy in the period ahead. The updated projection of macroeconomic developments shows the annual inflation rate remaining inside the variation band around the central targets of 3 percent in both 2011 and 2012. A significant improvement was recorded by the short-term inflation outlook, in line with NBR expectations regarding the end of the cycle of supply-side shock effects following the VAT rate hike that affected the economy and the favourable impact of the domestic agricultural production. However, the balance of medium-term risks is still asymmetric, as they relate to external developments, investors' risk aversion and capital flow volatility, as well as the fiscal policy stance and administered price adjustments. In view of these overall prospects, the NBR Board has decided to lower the monetary policy rate to 6.00 percent per annum from 6.25 percent. As a result, starting 3 November 2011, the rate on the deposit facility will be cut to 2.00 percent per annum from 2.25 percent and the rate on the lending facility (Lombard) will be 10.00 percent per annum versus 10.25 percent. The NBR Board has also decided to continue to pursue an adequate management of liquidity in the banking system and to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The judicious adjustment of the central bank's stance is aimed at steadily ensuring adequate real broad monetary conditions so as to secure a lasting maintenance of inflation inside the variation band around the targets as well as financial stability  these elements, alongside the implementation of commitments on strengthening fiscal consolidation and structural reforms undertaken by the Romanian authorities under the multilateral external financing arrangements signed with international institutions, are essential for a sustainable recovery of the Romanian economy. The gradual adjustment of real broad monetary conditions is expected to be reflected in banks' lending rates. At the same time, the NBR Board reiterates the importance of fostering domestic saving, also by an appropriate remuneration of bank deposits in order to ensure a sustainable external deficit and a progressive reduction in relative terms of the degree of dependency of Romania's economy on external financing. The NBR reaffirms that the central bank will further monitor domestic and global economic developments so as, via an adequate use of its available instruments, to ensure the fulfilment of its objectives of achieving and maintaining price stability in the medium term as well as financial stability. The quarterly Inflation Report will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled for November 7, 2011. According to the calendar of NBR Board meetings dedicated to monetary policy issues, the next meeting is scheduled for January 5, 2012. 1) Calculated by the NBR by excluding administered prices, volatile prices, and tobacco and alcohol prices from the consumer price index.

United States,2011-11-02,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September indicates that economic growth strengthened somewhat in the third quarter, reflecting in part a reversal of the temporary factors that had weighed on growth earlier in the year. Nonetheless, recent indicators point to continuing weakness in overall labor market conditions, and the unemployment rate remains elevated. Household spending has increased at a somewhat faster pace in recent months. Business investment in equipment and software has continued to expand, but investment in nonresidential structures is still weak, and the housing sector remains depressed. Inflation appears to have moderated since earlier in the year as prices of energy and some commodities have declined from their peaks. Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee continues to expect a moderate pace of economic growth over coming quarters and consequently anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only gradually toward levels that the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate. Moreover, there are significant downside risks to the economic outlook, including strains in global financial markets. The Committee also anticipates that inflation will settle, over coming quarters, at levels at or below those consistent with the Committee's dual mandate as the effects of past energy and other commodity price increases dissipate further. However, the Committee will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with the dual mandate, the Committee decided today to continue its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities as announced in September. The Committee is maintaining its existing policies of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate. The Committee also decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013. The Committee will continue to assess the economic outlook in light of incoming information and is prepared to employ its tools to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Elizabeth A Duke; Richard W Fisher; Narayana Kocherlakota; Charles I Plosser; Sarah Bloom Raskin; Daniel K Tarullo; and Janet L Yellen.

Czech Republic,2011-11-03,"Press conference of the CNB Bank Board 7th Situation Report on Economic and Monetary Developments 3 November 2011 The monetary policy decision taken and the ratio of the votes cast At the close of the meeting the Board decided by a majority vote to leave the two-week repo rate unchanged at 0.75%. Six members voted in favour of this decision, and one member voted for lowering rates by 0.25 percentage point. Reasons for the decision Monetary-policy relevant inflation will be slightly below the target over the entire forecast horizon. Headline inflation will rise temporarily to just below 3% in 2012 owing to a VAT increase, but will fall back below the target at the start of 2013. Consistent with the forecast is a slight decline in market interest rates at the start of the forecast and flat rates until late 2012/early 2013. The risks to the forecast are skewed towards stable interest rates in line with the “euro area stagnation” alternative scenario (see below). The message of the forecast baseline scenario Inflation pressures from the domestic economy are currently not significant, commodity prices and food prices are still the main source of inflation. Headline inflation will rise temporarily to just below 3% in 2012 owing to a VAT increase, but will fall back below the target at the start of 2013. Monetary-policy relevant inflation will be slightly below the target over the entire forecast horizon. Economic growth in the Czech Republic will continue to slow this year. It will slow further (to 1.2%) next year as a result of euro area developments. The nominal exchange rate is appreciating in the forecast as from the beginning of 2012. Consistent with the forecast is a slight decline in market interest rates at the start of the forecast and flat rates until late 2012/early 2013. The alternative scenario simulates such foreign developments that would correspond to the market outlook for euro interest rates. In this scenario. GDP growth in the euro area slows to almost zero in 2012. This transmits immediately to the domestic economy and adversely influences GDP. Appreciation of the koruna is markedly slower than in the baseline scenario. Weaker exchange rate is associated with higher levels of 3M PRIBOR compared to the baseline scenario. Inflation remains broadly at the same levels as in the baseline scenario. Downside risks: slower wage growth substantial deterioration in expected foreign economic growth and further decline in outlook for world commodity prices and 3M EURIBOR Upside risks: materialization of the “euro area stagnation” alternative scenario, leading to fundamentally weaker koruna exchange rate and lower GDP weaker koruna exchange rate due to market sentiment 19 Thank you for your attention More information about the forecast can be found at and in Inflation Report IV/2011, to be published 11 November 2011."
Euroarea,2011-11-03,"Today is the first time that I have had the privilege and pleasure of chairing the meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. I am delighted to proceed now with our well-established practice of real-time communication and to report on the outcome of our meeting, together with the Vice-President. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to reduce the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. While inflation has remained elevated and is likely to stay above 2% for some months to come, inflation rates are expected to decline further in the course of 2012 to below 2%. At the same time, the underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be moderate. After today's decision, inflation should remain in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon. Owing to their unfavourable effects on financing conditions and confidence, the ongoing tensions in financial markets are likely to dampen the pace of economic growth in the euro area in the second half of this year and beyond. The economic outlook continues to be subject to particularly high uncertainty and intensified downside risks. Some of these risks have been materialising, which makes a significant downward revision to forecasts and projections for average real GDP growth in 2012 very likely. In such an environment, price, cost and wage pressures in the euro area should also moderate; today's decision takes this into account. Overall, it remains essential for monetary policy to maintain price stability over the medium term, thereby ensuring a firm anchoring of inflation expectations in the euro area in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make its contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. The provision of liquidity and the allotment modes for refinancing operations will continue to ensure that euro area banks are not constrained on the liquidity side. All the non-standard monetary policy measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions are, by construction, temporary in nature. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Real GDP growth in the euro area, which slowed in the second quarter of 2011 to 0.2% quarter on quarter, is expected to be very moderate in the second half of this year. There are signs that previously identified downside risks have been materialising, as reflected in unfavourable evidence from survey data. Looking forward, a number of factors seem to be dampening the underlying growth momentum in the euro area, including a moderation in the pace of global demand and unfavourable effects on overall financing conditions and on confidence resulting from ongoing tensions in a number of euro area sovereign debt markets. At the same time, we continue to expect euro area economic activity to benefit from continued positive economic growth in the emerging market economies, as well as from the low short-term interest rates and the various measures taken to support the functioning of the financial sector. In the Governing Council's assessment, the downside risks to the economic outlook for the euro area are confirmed in an environment of particularly high uncertainty. Downside risks notably relate to a further intensification of the tensions in some segments of the financial markets in the euro area and at the global level, as well as to the potential for these pressures to further spill over into the euro area real economy. They also relate to the impact of the still high energy prices, protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation was 3.0% in October according to Eurostat's flash estimate, unchanged from September. Inflation rates have been at elevated levels since the end of last year, mainly driven by higher energy and other commodity prices. Looking ahead, they are likely to stay above 2% for some months to come, before falling below 2% in the course of 2012. Inflation rates are expected to remain in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon. This pattern reflects the expectation that, in an environment of weaker euro area and global growth, price, cost and wage pressures in the euro area should also moderate. The Governing Council continues to view the risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments as broadly balanced, taking also into account today's decision. On the upside, the main risks relate to the possibility of increases in indirect taxes and administered prices, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. In the current environment, however, inflationary pressure should abate. The main downside risks relate to the impact of weaker than expected growth in the euro area and globally. In fact, if sustained, sluggish economic growth has the potential to reduce medium-term inflationary pressure in the euro area. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 increased to 3.1% in September 2011, up from 2.7% in August. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector, adjusted for loan sales and securitisation, was 2.7% in September, unchanged from August. As in August, inflows into M3 also reflect the heightened tensions in some financial markets. In particular, inflows into money market fund shares/units, as well as into repurchase agreements conducted through central counterparties, appear to have significantly affected monetary developments in September. The annual growth rate of M1 increased to 2.0% in September, from 1.7% in August. On the counterpart side, the annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations and to households in September, adjusted for loan sales and securitisation, remained broadly unchanged compared with August, at 2.2% and 2.6% respectively. These figures do not signal that the heightened financial market tensions have affected the supply of credit up to September. However, as such effects can manifest themselves with lags, close scrutiny of credit developments is warranted in the period ahead. Taking the appropriate medium-term perspective and looking through short-term volatility, underlying broad money and loan growth have stabilised over recent months. Overall, the underlying pace of monetary expansion thus remains moderate. The overall size of monetary financial institutions' balance sheets remained broadly unchanged over the past few months. The soundness of bank balance sheets will be a key factor in reducing potential negative feedback loop effects related to tensions in financial markets, thereby facilitating an appropriate provision of credit to the economy over time. We therefore welcome the agreement of the European Council to proceed with the increase in the capital position of banks to 9% of core Tier 1 by the end of June 2012. We also fully support the call to national supervisors to ensure that banks' recapitalisation plans do not lead to excessive deleveraging. To sum up, based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to reduce the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. While inflation has remained elevated and is likely to stay above 2% for some months to come, inflation rates are expected to decline further in the course of 2012 to below 2%. A cross-check with the information from our monetary analysis confirms that the underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be moderate. After today's decision, inflation should remain in line with price stability over the policy-relevant horizon. Owing to their unfavourable effects on financing conditions and confidence, the ongoing tensions in financial markets are likely to dampen the pace of economic growth in the euro area in the second half of this year and beyond. The economic outlook continues to be subject to particularly high uncertainty and intensified downside risks. Some of these risks have been materialising, which makes a significant downward revision to forecasts and projections for average real GDP growth in 2012 very likely. In such an environment, price, cost and wage pressures in the euro area should also moderate; today's decision takes this into account. Overall, it remains essential for monetary policy to maintain price stability over the medium term, thereby ensuring a firm anchoring of inflation expectations in the euro area in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make its contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. Turning to fiscal policies, all euro area governments need to show their inflexible determination to fully honour their own individual sovereign signature as a key element in ensuring financial stability in the euro area as a whole. The Governing Council takes note of the fiscal commitments expressed in the Euro Summit statement of 26 October 2011 and urges all governments to implement fully and as quickly as possible the measures necessary to achieve fiscal consolidation and sustainable pension systems, as well as to improve governance. The governments of countries under joint EU-IMF adjustment programmes and those of countries that are particularly vulnerable should stand ready to take any additional measures that become necessary. It is crucial that fiscal consolidation and structural reforms go hand in hand to strengthen confidence, growth prospects and job creation. The Governing Council therefore calls upon all euro area governments to accelerate, urgently, the implementation of substantial and comprehensive structural reforms. This will help the euro area countries to strengthen competitiveness, increase the flexibility of their economies and enhance their longer-term growth potential. In this respect, labour market reforms are essential and should focus on measures to remove rigidities and to enhance wage flexibility, so that wages and working conditions can be tailored to the specific needs of firms. More generally, in these demanding times, moderation is of the essence in terms of both profit margins and wages. These measures should be accompanied by structural reforms that increase competition in product markets, particularly in services – including the liberalisation of closed professions – and, where appropriate, the privatisation of services currently provided by the public sector. At the same time, the Governing Council stresses that it is absolutely imperative that euro area national authorities rapidly adopt and implement the measures announced and recommended in the Euro Summit statement of 26 October 2011."
Pakistan,2011-11-03,"STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN MONETARY POLICY DECISION 30 November 2011 The SBP reduced its policy rate by 200 bps, to 12 percent, in FY12 so far. The objective of adopting this stance is to support revival of private investment in the economy despite constraining domestic and global economic environment. The primary factors in support of this stance were the expectation of average CPI inflation remaining within the announced target in FY12 and small projected external current account deficit. In pursuing this stance SBP did acknowledge the risks to macroeconomic stability emanating from fiscal weaknesses and falling foreign financial inflows. These include resurgence of medium term inflationary pressures and challenges SBP is facing in managing market liquidity and preserving foreign exchange reserves. reassessment of latest developments and projections indicate that macroeconomic risks have somewhat increased during the last two months. For instance, although the year-on-year CPI inflation stands at 1 percent in October 2011, the month-on-month inflation trends, averaging at around. percent per month during the first four months of FY12, show existence of inflationary pressures. The sifting of commodity level CPI data reveal that the number of CPI items exhibiting year-on-year inflation of more than 10 percent is consistently increasing and almost all of these items belong to the non-food category. The government has also increased its wheat support price by Rs100 to Rs1050 per 40kg for the next wheat procurement season. Thus while the average inflation may settle around the targeted 12 percent for FY12, it is uncertain that inflation will come down to single digit level in FY13. The main determinants of this inflation behaviour are government borrowing from the banking system and inertial effects of high inflation on its expected path. The severe energy shortages are also holding back the effective utilization of productive capacity and adding to the high inflation-weak growth problem. On the external front, the earlier comfortable external current account position for FY12, which helped SBP in lowering its policy rate, has become less benign. The actual external current account deficit of $1. billion for the first four months of FY12 is now higher than the earlier projected deficit for the year. The main reason for this larger than expected deterioration is the rising trade deficit. In particular, the windfall gains to export receipts due to abnormally high cotton prices in FY11 have dissipated faster than anticipated. This is indicated by slightly less than $2 billion per month export receipts in September and October 2011. At the same time, international oil prices of around $110 per barrel and strong growth in non-oil imports have kept the total import growth at an elevated level of close to $3. billion per month. Adding to the challenges faced by the external sector is the precarious global economic outlook. relatively larger external current account deficit in FY12 would require higher financial inflows to maintain foreign exchange reserves. However during July-October. FY12, the total net direct and portfolio inflows were only $207 million while there was net outflow of $113 million in official loans. As consequence. SBP's liquid foreign exchange reserves have declined to $13. billion at end-October Page of STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN 2011 compared to $14. billion at end-June 2011. Given the scheduled increase in repayments of outstanding loans in H2-FY12, realization of substantial foreign flows, especially the proceeds of assumed privatization receipts, euro bond. Coalition Support Fund, and 3G licence fees, becomes important for strengthening the external position. reflection of widening external current account deficit and declining financial inflows can be seen in the reduction of Rs115 billion in the Net Foreign Assets (NFA) of SBP's balance sheet during July 18 November, 2011. This implies that to meet the economy's prevailing demand for money. SBP has to provide substantial liquidity in the system, at least to the extent of compensating for the declining NFA of SBP. As of 28 November 2011, the outstanding amount of liquidity injected by SBP through its Open Market Operations (OMOs) is Rs340 billion. This is significantly higher than normal SBP operations and appears to have developed characteristics of permanent nature at this point in time. dominant source of demand for money and thus liquidity injections by SBP is government borrowings for budgetary support from the banking system. Excluding the issuance of government securities of Rs391 billion to settle the circular debt and commodity loans, the government has borrowed Rs255 billion from scheduled banks and Rs62 billion from SBP during July 18 November, 2011 to finance its current year's budget deficit. The growth in private sector credit has remained muted so far but may pick up in coming months as the desired effects of cumulative decrease of 200 bps in the policy rate and reduction in financial constraints of the energy sector gather momentum. In this context where government is the main user of the system's liquidity and banks remain hesitant to extend credit to the private sector. SBP faces dilemma. Efforts to scale down liquidity injections could have implications for settlement of payments in the interbank market, which is an important consideration given SBP's mandate of maintaining financial stability. Even if these considerations are addressed, the government may end up settling its obligations by borrowing from SBP. This does not bode well for government's own commitment of keeping such borrowings at zero on quarterly basis. The marginally increasing trend of these injections, on the other hand, also carries inflationary risk, which is not consistent with the objective of achieving and maintaining price stability. There are three solutions to this predicament of reconciling price and financial stability considerations and supporting private investment in the economy. First the government needs to ensure that all or major parts of budgeted foreign inflows materialize as soon as possible. This will alleviate pressure on the balance of payments and help inject fresh rupee liquidity in the system. Second sooner than later the government will have to initiate comprehensive tax reforms that broadens the tax base of the economy. This is of paramount importance to reduce the government's borrowing requirements from the scheduled banks that are currently not consistent with the objective of promoting private sector and economic growth. Third efforts need to be stepped up to improve financial deepening and increase competition in the banking system. The last of these solutions is something that SBP has been actively working on. For instance, to promote competition in the banking system and to offer alternative sources of savings to the population. SBP has Page of STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN been encouraging depositors to invest in government securities through Investor's Portfolio Securities (IPS) accounts. The option of maintaining saving deposits or investments in IPS accounts could provide stiff competition to banks forcing them to offer better returns on deposits. This in turn would incentivize savings and help lower the currency in circulation. Moreover it will improve the transmission of monetary policy changes to market interest rates. Over time this strategy would also diversify the government's funding source, deepen the secondary market of government securities, and facilitate the issuance of corporate debt. Finally it must be understood that there are uncertainties involved in realizing the full benefits of these measures. These uncertainties can potentially have adverse effects on SBP's recent efforts to support private sector credit and investment in the economy. Therefore after giving due consideration to the need to revive growth and emerging risks to macroeconomic stability, the Central Board of Directors of SBP has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 12 percent.

Poland,2011-11-09,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 9 November 2011 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 8-9 November 2011 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e.: (cid:131) reference rate at 4.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate at 6.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate at 3.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate at 4.75% on an annual basis. In 2011 Q3 economic sentiment deteriorated considerably in the global economy, including, in particular, in the euro area and the United States. Nevertheless, the released data, including preliminary estimate of GDP in Q3 in the United States, have not so far confirmed a further significant weakening in activity in those economies. At the same time, however, economic growth forecasts for 2012 were further revised downwards and inflation remained elevated. There persists heightened uncertainty about global economic developments in the coming quarters and about the scale of economic slowdown in countries being Poland's main trading partners. The risk of a global economic slowdown combined with fiscal problems faced by some countries, are behind the enduring tensions in the financial markets worldwide. The decisions taken at the Euro Area Summit supported improvement of financial markets' sentiment, yet, amidst persistently uncertain situation in Greece, risk aversion remains heightened, which adds to increased volatility of asset prices, including of foreign exchange rates. Increased asset price volatility is also driven by ample liquidity in the global financial markets, related to strongly expansionary monetary policy of the major central banks. According to incoming information on the Polish economy  including favourable data on industrial output, construction and assembly output and retail sales  GDP growth in 2011 Q3 continued to be relatively high and presumably close to the one recorded in 2011 Q2. At the same time, majority of business sentiment indicators suggest that economic activity may weaken somewhat in the coming quarters, which is largely connected to the anticipated economic slowdown in countries being Poland's major trading partners. Data on the enterprise sector point to continued moderate growth in wages amidst concurrent further decline in employment. Unemployment rate remains elevated. Lending to enterprises is growing, a relatively high growth continues also in mortgage lending to households, whereas consumer loans continue to decline in annual terms. In September, annual CPI inflation decreased to 3.9%, remaining markedly above the NBP's inflation target of 2.5%. Decrease in inflation was related to further decline in food prices, despite continued strong rise in energy prices. Core inflation net of food and energy prices 00-919 Warszawa, ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, tel. (22) 653 28 88, fax (22) 653 13 28 slowed down slightly. Yet, at the same time, continued strong growth was recorded in PPI, and inflation expectations of households shifted somewhat upwards. In the coming months, annual CPI inflation will continue to run at an elevated level, primarily due to the previous sharp rise in global commodity prices and the zloty depreciation of recent months. Waning impact of VAT rate increases and considerable rises in food and energy prices observed in the first half of 2011 will be conductive to lowering inflation at the beginning of 2012. The Council got acquainted with the projection of inflation and GDP prepared by the Economic Institute of the NBP, being one of the inputs to the Council's decisions on the NBP interest rates. In line with the November projection  under the assumption of constant NBP interest rates  there is a 50-percent probability of inflation running in the range of 3.9-4.2% in 2011 (as compared to 3.7-4.4% in the July projection), 2.5-3.9% in 2012 (as compared to 2.1-3.4%) and 2.2-3.7% in 2013 (as compared to 1.8-3.4%). In turn, with a 50-percent probability the November projection sees the annual GDP growth in the range of 3.7-4.3% in 2011 (as compared to 3.0-4.9% in the July projection), 2.0-4.1% in 2012 (as compared to 1.9-4.5%) and 1.5-4.0% in 2013 (as compared to 1.5-4.3%). In the opinion of the Council, in the medium term inflation will be curbed by somewhat lower domestic economic growth amidst fiscal tightening, including reduced public investment spending, and interest rate increases implemented in the first half of 2011, as well as the expected global economic slowdown. Such an assessment is also supported by the November projection of inflation and GDP. The impact of the situation in the global financial markets on zloty exchange rate continues to be an upside risk to domestic price developments. In the opinion of the Council, the significant monetary policy tightening implemented in the first half of 2011 should enable inflation to return to the target in the medium term. Given the above, the Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged. The Council does not rule out the possibility of further monetary policy adjustments in the future, should the outlook for inflation returning to the target deteriorate. The Council has adopted the Inflation Report  November 2011."
Armenia,2011-11-10,"Press Release 11.10.2011 In the October 11, 2011 Meeting the Board of CBA decided to leave the Refinancing Rate of CBA unchanged, at 8 percent. In September inflation was 0.8 percent, and the 12-month inflation grew by 1.4 pp against the previous month's indicator and reached 6.2 percent, as a result. Back in September the Board of CBA had outlined that the 12-month inflation would most likely be near or above the confidence band and had it published in the September 16th Minutes of the Refinancing Rate. The Board accepted that impulses coming from the external sector remain neutral to the inflationary environment. Yet the developed countries' macroeconomic policy responses to their fundamental imbalances remain uncertain. The Board believes that impulses coming from the domestic economy create largely a contractionary impact on inflationary environment when impacts from the labor market, private spending, fiscal and monetary policies are summed up. These impacts in future will be greatly depending also on the developments in the external sector. The Board summed up that inflation developments in the last couple of months are in line with the trajectory outlined in the 2011 monetary policy programs. Though in end- September inflation outstripped the upper border of the confidence band, it is expected to slow down gradually in the upcoming months. Interest rates which exist and which are expected in the financial market after 0.5 pp decrease of the Refinancing Rate in September will allow shaping a level of aggregate demand, which will bring inflation into the confidence band of 4%±1.5 pp, provided that risks deriving from uncertainties show up to a moderate extent.

South Africa,2011-11-10,"Issued by Gill Marcus. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank. Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, there has been no meaningful progress to resolving the sovereign debt crisis that is engulfing the euro area, with the primary focus now on Italy and Greece. The interlinked nature of the debt crisis and concerns about the banking sector in Europe, coupled with the inability of the advanced economies to generate sustained growth, continues to weigh negatively on the global economic outlook. The heightened uncertainty has had implications for the pattern of global capital flows and exchange rates in emerging markets. The domestic economic recovery remains hesitant. The relatively weak economy has ensured that demand pressures on inflation are restrained at this stage. Nevertheless exogenous supply side factors have resulted in a deterioration of the inflation outlook, with a more protracted breach of the inflation target expected in 2012. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas increased to 5,7 per cent in September 2011, up from 5,3 per cent in August. The categories of food, housing and utilities, and transport together accounted for 4,0 percentage points of the September outcome. Food price inflation accelerated from 7,3 per cent in August to 8,7 per cent. Petrol and electricity prices increased by 26,2 per cent and 17,3 per cent respectively. Administered price inflation excluding petrol was unchanged at 8,8 per cent. CPI inflation excluding food, petrol and electricity remained unchanged at 3,8 per cent in September. Year-on-year producer price inflation continued its strong upward trend, increasing by 10,5 per cent in September, from 9,6 per cent in August. These price developments were strongly influenced by global commodity price movements as well as by the depreciation of the rand exchange rate. Price increases in the categories of mining, electricity and products of petroleum and coal, as well as other manufactures remained the major contributors to the PPI outcome. Food prices also continued their higher trend with agricultural prices increasing by 10,7 per cent, and manufactured food prices by 8,8 per cent in September. The inflation forecast of the Bank showed a modest increase since the previous meeting of the MPC. Inflation is expected to breach the upper end of the target range in the final quarter of 2011 and to peak in the first quarter of 2012 at around 6,3 per cent before declining gradually and returning to within the target range in the final quarter of 2012. Inflation is expected to measure 5,2 per cent in the final quarter of 2013. The Bank's forecast of core inflation, which excludes food, petrol and electricity, continues to show a moderately rising trend, with the peak of around 5,2 per cent expected in the first quarter of 2013. Market expectations of inflation, as reflected in the Reuters survey of financial analysts, show expectations to be anchored around the upper level of the inflation target range over the medium term. In the October survey, inflation was expected to peak at an average of 6,1 per cent in the first quarter of 2012, and to measure 5,4 per cent by the second quarter of 2013. Break-even inflation rates have moderated against most maturities since the previous meeting. The global growth outlook continues to be characterised by heightened uncertainty with weak growth and declining consumer confidence in a number of the major advanced economies. The protracted crisis in the euro area has now spread beyond the peripheral countries, despite recent attempts to devise a credible and workable approach to contain the problem. The risks created by these developments are likely to exacerbate the low or negative growth expected in the region, amid increased fiscal austerity, tightened bank lending standards and deleveraging, and tightening conditions in the European interbank markets. Weak growth is also forecast for the UK and Japan. On the positive side, fears of a return to recession in the US have dissipated somewhat with a higher-than-expected growth outcome in the third quarter, driven mainly by a recovery in household consumption expenditure. Although employment increased in the past quarter, the unemployment rate is expected to remain at elevated levels for some time, along with persistent weakness in the housing market. Growth in many of the emerging markets has moderated during the year. Growth forecasts have generally been revised down, and are sensitive to developments in the advanced economies. China has experienced a policy-induced slowdown, but fears of a possible hard landing have receded somewhat. Significant growth reductions have been experienced in a number of Latin American and emerging European countries. Headline inflation appears to have peaked in many of the advanced economies, and is expected to moderate in line with declining economic activity and the softer trend in commodity prices. Inflationary pressures remain at elevated levels in many of the major emerging market economies. The exchange rate of the rand continues to be subject to changes in risk aversion in global financial markets. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand has fluctuated between R7,70 and R8,50 to the US dollar, but has generally traded in a more narrow range of between R7,80 and R8,00. On a trade-weighted basis, the rand has depreciated by around 18,6 per cent since the beginning of the year. Since the last meeting of the MPC the rand has appreciated by 1,0 per cent on a trade-weighted basis and by 1,4 per cent against the US dollar. Although the rand tends to be more volatile than most of its emerging market peers, the movements of the currency have been in line with other emerging market and commodity-linked currencies. The exchange rate has also been influenced to some extent by volatile capital flows. Non-residents have been persistent net sellers of South African equities for most of 2011, with cumulative net sales since the beginning of the year amounting to R16,6 billion. Between April and August, non-residents were net buyers of bonds to the value of R58,4 billion but as the European crisis intensified, net sales of R17,0 billion were recorded in September. In October this trend was reversed somewhat with non-resident net purchases of R9,8 billion. Year to date net purchases of bonds and equities amount to R29,4 billion. The uncertainty related to the exchange rate imparts an upside risk to the inflation outlook. However, unless the rand continues on a depreciating trend, the impact is likely to be relatively limited and should dissipate in the short to medium term. While the rand is not expected to return to its previous elevated levels, consensus forecasts indicate an expectation of a moderate appreciation from the current levels during the course of 2012. This is largely dependent on global developments. The slower domestic economic growth in the second quarter of 2011 appears to have continued in the third quarter and the forecast of the Bank has been subject to downward revision. Real GDP growth in 2011 is now expected to average 3,0 per cent, compared with 3,2 per cent in the previous forecast. The growth forecasts for 2012 and 2013 have been revised down to 3,2 per cent and 4,2 per cent from 3,6 per cent and 4,4 per cent respectively. The downward revision is a result of revised assumptions primarily of international commodity prices and global growth. The composite leading business cycle indicators of the Bank continued the moderate downward trend that began in February. It decreased for the second consecutive month in August, corroborating the expected restrained economic conditions. There has been some normalisation of manufacturing activity following widespread industrial action in July. The physical volume of manufacturing output increased at a year-on-year rate of 7,7 per cent in September, following the revised 5,9 per cent increase in August. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, a slight contraction of -0,1 per cent was measured in the third quarter. Despite the recent recovery, the Kagiso/BER Purchasing Managers Index remained marginally above the neutral 50 level in September and October, in line with subdued global PMIs. Mining output has continued its overall downward trend, with the physical volume of mining output declining in September by 5,1 per cent on a quarter-on-quarter basis and by 5,4 per cent on a year-on-year basis. The construction sector remains under stress with the FNB/BER civil construction index declining further in the third quarter. Despite the disappointing growth outcomes, the Quarterly Labour Force Survey published by Statistics South Africa indicates that the number of people employed increased by 195,000 in the third quarter of 2011. The prospects for further employment creation are uncertain, given the slowing growth of the domestic economy and the fragile global economic environment. Growth in consumption expenditure by households is expected to have remained relatively subdued following its moderation in the second quarter of 2011 to 3,8 per cent from 5,2 per cent in the previous quarter. When comparing the three months to August with the previous three months, real retail trade sales increased by 0,7 per cent. The BER Retail Survey for the third quarter of 2011 shows that business confidence among retailers, at a level of 48, remained below the neutral level of 50. These trends reflect, in part, concern about employment, slower wage and income growth and declining levels of consumer confidence. Other factors expected to constrain consumption expenditure include high levels of household debt, constrained access to credit, and consistently above-average increases in a range of administered prices which reduce the amount available for household discretionary expenditure. Growth in credit extension to the private sector remains lacklustre, reflecting both supply and demand considerations. After reaching a recent high of 6,1 per cent in July, twelve-month growth in banks' total loans and advances extended to the private sector moderated to 5,3 per cent in September. Twelve-month growth in mortgage advances declined to 1,9 per cent, consistent with the subdued state of the domestic housing market. The main driver of credit extension was the category of other loans and advances, in particular general loans, which grew at a rate over twelve months of 12,9 per cent, down from 17,9 per cent in August. General loans account for 11 per cent of total loans and advances to households. The ratio of impaired advances as a percentage of gross loans and advances of banks has declined to 5,1 per cent in September 2011, down from 5,9 per cent in September 2010, indicating some improvement in the balance sheets of the banks. According to the Medium Term Budget Policy Statement, fiscal policy is set to be more expansionary than indicated in the main budget in February. Nevertheless the commitment to medium-term deficit consolidation remains. For the current fiscal year, the deficit is expected to increase from 5,3 per cent of GDP to 5,5 per cent, compared with the 4,6 per cent deficit recorded in 2010/11, and is expected to decline to 3,3 per cent of GDP by 2014/15. The wider deficit for the current year is a result of a 0,7 per cent of GDP increase in expenditure, and lower tax revenues of 0,3 per cent of GDP which result from the slower economic growth. The primary deficit is expected to decline from 2,9 per cent of GDP in the current year, to 0,5 per cent in 2014/15. If maintained within the parameters as set out in the MTBPS, the fiscal consolidation and debt dynamics should be sustainable. Food prices continue to pose an upside risk to the inflation outlook, and a further acceleration of food inflation is expected in the near term. This follows the marked food and agricultural price increases at the PPI level, and the depreciation of the exchange rate which has contributed to the increase in maize prices in recent weeks. Global food prices have remained relatively stable over the past months, albeit at high levels, and could signal some relief going forward. International oil prices have remained relatively stable since the last meeting of the MPC and are expected to remain constrained by the weak growth outlook in the advanced economies. At current prices. Brent crude oil is about US$10 per barrel lower than the peak prevailing earlier in 2011. Currently there is a small overrecovery on the domestic petrol price, and if maintained, could provide some relief to consumers following four consecutive months of price increases which has resulted in domestic petrol prices being at their highest levels ever. Other administered prices, particularly electricity, are expected to maintain upside pressure on the inflation rate. The Monetary Policy Committee remains of the view that the underlying inflation pressures are of a cost push nature and that the subdued state of domestic demand and output will contribute to core inflation remaining contained, notwithstanding the continued pressures from some administered prices. However the Committee is concerned that the change in the profile of the inflation forecasts, and the extended breach of the upper end of the inflation target range, may impact adversely on inflation expectations. At this stage the breach of the upper limit is still expected to be relatively small, and inflation is expected to return to within the target range by the end of 2012. The Committee assesses the risks to the inflation outlook to be on the upside mainly due to cost push pressures. The exchange rate is also seen to pose some upside risk to the outlook, while downside risks are seen to come from possible contagion effects from the European crisis and associated slow growth. The committee is aware of the dangers of a disorderly resolution of the crisis and the systemic implications for the global and domestic economy, and remains ready to act appropriately should the need arise. Under the prevailing circumstances the MPC has decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 5,5 per cent per annum. ADDENDUM TO THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE STATEMENT OF 10 NOVEMBER 2011. The Monetary Policy Committee meeting schedule for 2012 is as follows:."
South Korea,2011-11-11,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.25% for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.25% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information, the Committee considers that, while emerging market economies have shown favorable performances, major advanced economies have exhibited signs of sluggishness. Going forward the Committee judges that the global economy will show a recovery, albeit a moderate one, but that downside risks to growth are high, due mostly to the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and to the possibilities of the slumps in major country economies and the unrest in international financial markets continuing. In Korea, domestic demand has faltered but exports have continued to grow strongly. The trend of improvement in employment conditions has been sustained, led by the private sector. The Committee anticipates that the domestic economy will keep up its long-term trend of growth going forward, but recognizes the situation to be one in which downside risks to growth remain high due to the impact of external risk factors. Consumer price inflation declined to 3.9% in October owing to the stabilization of agricultural product prices, and core inflation recorded 3.7%, down slightly from the previous month. In the coming months, factors including the declines in agricultural product prices will work to stabilize prices, but the Committee expects the inflation rate to fluctuate at a high level for the time being given factors such as the public utility charge hikes and stubbornly high inflation expectations. As for housing prices, those in Seoul and its surrounding areas maintained their September levels, while the uptrend in the rest of the country slowed somewhat from the previous month. The rate of increase in leasehold deposits meanwhile declined nationwide. In the financial markets, stock prices and the exchange rate continued to fluctuate widely as unease concerning external risk factors persisted, and long-term market interest rates fell, affected primarily by foreigners' continued bond purchases. Looking ahead, the Committee, while closely monitoring financial and economic risk factors both at home and abroad, will conduct monetary policy so as to firmly anchor the basis for price stability amid continuing sound growth of the economy."
Malaysia,2011-11-11,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.00 percent. Latest indicators suggest that the global growth momentum has moderated in recent months. Economic activity in the advanced economies is being weighed down by heightened market volatility and lower confidence, amid rising policy uncertainties. Labour market conditions in several of these economies also continue to be weak. Going forward, these conditions may persist as critical policy issues remain unresolved and pose further downside risks to global growth. In the Asian region, sustained domestic demand is projected to continue to support economic growth. Nevertheless, greater weakness in the external environment is expected to affect regional growth prospects. The domestic economy improved in the third quarter, due primarily to stronger domestic demand. Export performance also improved, reflecting firm regional demand and the normalisation of trade flows from supply chain disruptions. Looking ahead, the weaker external environment could, however, impact the overall growth prospects. Domestic demand will continue to be the anchor of growth, supported by private consumption and investment and reinforced by public sector spending and investment activity. Employment conditions are also expected to remain stable. Domestic headline inflation was 3.4% in September on account of the slower increase in the transport category. Going forward, inflation is expected to remain stable for the rest of the year and moderate in 2012. Global energy prices are expected to experience some moderation while the impact of domestic demand factors on inflation is also expected to remain contained. High food price inflation, largely due to supply disruptions, continues to remain a concern. In the MPC's assessment, the global economic outlook is expected to be weaker and international financial market conditions will remain highly uncertain and volatile going forward. While the domestic economy is expected to expand, these external developments could affect the overall growth prospects of the Malaysian economy. The MPC will continue to monitor these developments and assess the risks to the outlook for domestic growth and inflation. The meeting also approved the schedule of MPC meetings for 2012. In accordance with the Central Bank of Malaysia Act 2009, the MPC will convene six times a year. The Monetary Policy Statement will be released at 6 p.m. on the same day as the MPC meeting. Schedule of Monetary Policy Committee Meetings for 2012. Bank Negara Malaysia 11 November 2011."
Chile,2011-11-15,"BANCO CENTRAL DE CHILE Santiago, 15 November 2011 Monetary Policy Meeting  November 2011* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 5.25% (annual). Internationally, indicators confirm the slow pace of growth in advanced economies. Consensus forecasts for growth in the Eurozone continue to be revised downward, while they are maintained for the United States. Despite announcements, fiscal and financial risks in European economies are still very high and uncertainty persists about how this situation will be resolved. In other regions, financial conditions have improved slightly, although financial volatility remains high. World prices of copper and oil have risen. Domestically, output figures are evolving close to projections in the last Monetary Policy Report's baseline scenario, while domestic demand is somewhat stronger. Labor market conditions remain tight. Headline inflation has been somewhat higher than expected because of the incidence of fuels and foodstuffs. Core inflation figures remain contained. Inflation expectations are close to the target. The persistence of problems in advanced economies could shape a more adverse external scenario than the one assumed in the Report's baseline scenario, with potential consequences over growth and inflation in Chile, as well as for the orientation of monetary policy. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. * The Spanish original prevails."
Peru,2011-11-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR NOVEMBER 2011 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 4.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference at 4.25 percent. This decision takes into account the lower growth being recorded by some components of expenditure, as well as the intensification of international financial risks. Should these trends continue, the Central Bank will change its monetary policy stance. Inflation in October continued to be affected by transitory factors and recorded a monthly rate of 0.31 percent and an annual rate of 4.20 percent. Core inflation, which registered 0.28 percent, accumulated an annual rate of 3.5 percent. Inflation excluding food and energy showed a rate of 0.11 percent and accumulated an annual rate of 2.3 percent. Some current and advanced indicators of activity show that growth in the economy is moderating and registering lower rates than the ones observed in the first semester. Thus, sales of electricity grew 8.3 percent in October whereas they recorded a growth rate of 9.6 percent in the first semester. Furthermore, indicators of global activity show lower growth rates, while high uncertainty persists in international financial markets with potential negative effects on global economic growth. The Board continues to oversee the projection of inflation and its determinants and stands ready to adopt future adjustments in monetary policy instruments on a prompt and timely basis. The Board also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as described below: Overnight deposits: 3.45 percent. Direct repo and rediscount operations: 5.05 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.05 percent. The Monetary Program for December will be approved on the Board's session of December 7, 2011."
Nigeria,2011-11-21,"Central Bank of Nigeria Communique No. 80 of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting. Monday. November 21, 2011 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met with 11 out of the 12 members present on 21st November, 2011 to review domestic economic conditions up to the early part of Q4 2011 and the challenges facing the Nigerian economy against the background of developments in the international economic and financial environment in order to reassess the options for monetary policy for the remaining part of the year and Q1 2012. The Committee noted that international economic and financial conditions had deteriorated with possible threats of financial shocks from Europe, making it very difficult to correct the serious imbalances that have developed in the international economy since the peak of the global economic and financial crises. Most of the major industrial economies are at present economically weak and are expected to remain in recession with high unemployment rates and large unsustainable fiscal imbalances for an extended period, going by the recent forecasts of most international institutions. Inflation 1 rates, with the exception of Japan, are expected to be higher than in 2010. It is projected at around 30 per cent in 2011 in the US, the Euro-area and the UK compared with 19 per cent in 2010. The ratio of government debt to GDP for the European Union remains high and has led to a change of governments in Greece and Italy and a likely election of conservative government in Spain. It has also led to the adoption of tougher austerity measures including staff rationalization and privatization. In the case of some countries of the Euro area, the markets are still not certain that the risk of sovereign default will be addressed expeditiously and in an efficient manner. These concerns have opened up issues relating to financial stability, given the considerable exposures of banks and other financial institutions to government securities across countries. Consequently financial markets have become nervous with their uncertainties reflected in the volatility of stock, bond and foreign exchange markets. Current account imbalances are also projected to be high in 2011 in both the US and the Euro area. The Committee noted that, with the limited available fiscal space, the burden of economic adjustment has fallen on central banks in the industrial economies. However as the policy rates are close to zero, the only recourse available to central banks to promote recovery is through quantitative easing. In resorting to quantitative easing, the Committee is concerned that central banks, particularly, in the US and UK, are failing to recognize the limitations of monetary 2 policy and delaying the difficult but inevitable structural adjustment required by the developed world to avoid a recession. significant amount of sovereign debt needs to be written off, systemically important banks need to be recapitalized (and if necessary nationalized) and stronger austerity measures need to be put in place in the US and the Europe. Concerns over elections in 2012 in the US. Germany and France seem to be getting in the way of these tough decisions. Failure to act quickly may lead Europe into a prolonged recession that could lead to a permanent loss of competitiveness and economic vibrancy. Emerging countries are also projected to record lower growth rates in 2011 than in 2010. Given the high degree of real and financial integration with the industrial economies, a quick rebound in growth in 2012 does not seem to be realistic at this point in time. In many emerging countries, inflation rates are relatively high. There are also concerns about financial asset prices and the growing non- performing loans of banks. In China, early signals of a collapse in property prices have emerged and should the real estate bubble burst, this will have an impact on China's growth prospects. Fiscal imbalances have also been high in many countries. Growth performance of industrial and emerging economies in 2012 is vital for Nigeria's economic performance. Oil demand, in the Committee's view, would soften as a consequence of slow global growth and would necessitate comprehensive and sound policy 3 actions to help diversify the domestic economy away from oil. The impact of external developments on the domestic economy working through the channels of trade, finance and confidence has, in the Committee's view, been strong and would need to be addressed efficiently and expeditiously. On the domestic front, the Committee observed a mild resurgence of inflationary pressures at the end of the third quarter and beginning of the fourth quarter of the year, after they had moderated following a series of monetary policy tightening measures. The inflation outlook, however appears mixed, and is complicated by the fact that the full effects of the recent aggressive monetary tightening measures are yet to be felt. Latest output growth projections remained robust, even though lower than earlier projected. The Committee observed no major threats to financial system stability and welcomed the conclusion of the banking sector recapitalization exercise, which places the banks in a strong position to weather external shocks and also lays the foundation for strong earnings and credit growth. Key Domestic Macroeconomic and Financial Developments Output and Prices 4 The Committee observed that the robust output growth recorded since the beginning of the year has been sustained. Real output growth was estimated at 740 per cent in Q III of 2011 as against 786 per cent in the corresponding quarter of 2010, according to the latest estimates of the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). Non-oil GDP was estimated to grow sharply by 881 per cent in Q III of the current year as compared with 838 per cent recorded in Q III of the previous year. For the year as a whole, real GDP growth was projected at 769 per cent, slightly lower than the 787 per cent attained in 2010. The Committee noted with satisfaction that the expected output performance in 2011 was higher than the average growth of 663 per cent recorded since 2004. As investments increase and productivity improves, real GDP could double in less than ten years from now if the potential growth is elevated slightly over the average growth recorded in the last seven years. The year-on-year headline inflation rate rose to 105 per cent in October 2011 from 103 per cent in September. Similarly food inflation rose to 97 per cent in October 2011 from 95 per cent in September. However core inflation declined marginally to 115 from 116 per cent in September. Coming on the heels of a series of monetary policy measures, and at a time of global uncertainty, the numbers send mixed signals for 5 inflationary expectations in spite of the uptick in year-on-year headline inflation. For instance, all broad measures declined on a month-on-month basis. Headline inflation declined by 09 per cent in October compared to an increase of 14 per cent in September. This was a result of a month-on-month decline of 08 and 07 per cent in food and non-food inflation compared to increases of 19 and 09 per cent, respectively, in the preceding month. On the fiscal front, the Ministry of Finance continued to stress its commitment to a tighter fiscal stance and has already indicated a reduction in the benchmark price of oil from US$750 per barrel to US$700 per barrel. It has also adopted an exchange rate assumption consistent with the current stance of monetary authorities. Although the Sovereign Wealth Fund is subject to continuing political negotiations between States and Federal Governments, it would appear from public statements on both sides that a positive resolution would be reached very soon. The risk to inflation from removal of fuel subsidy is ever-present. However whenever the policy becomes effective, the Central Bank stands ready to react to any second round effects of a price adjustment. As a matter of policy, the Central Bank will not respond to first-round shocks, as tightening money supply in such a circumstance will be pro-cyclical. Finally in view of the external developments above, any softening in oil prices will impact negatively on government revenue receipts. Given the concerns over the budget deficit, such 6 a development would lead to a forced adoption of belt-tightening measures, thus, providing the much-needed fiscal support in the effort to rein in inflation. In such a circumstance, further tightening may also turn out to be pro-cyclical, especially, as the full effects of recent measures are still working their way through the system. Given the cost of borrowing in current tight monetary conditions, the Committee projects that in the face of revenue shocks, the likely reaction of the authorities will be a reduction in non-essential spending, rather than an increase in public debt. Monetary Credit and Financial Market Developments Provisional data indicate that aggregate domestic credit (net) grew by 2457 per cent in October 2011 over the end-December 2010 level, and by 2948 per cent when annualized, which was below the indicative benchmark of 3258 per cent for 2011. The growth in aggregate credit (net) in October 2011 was due to increases in credit to the private sector as well as State and Local governments. Credit to the private sector grew by 2424 per cent (2909 per cent on annualized basis) which was higher than the indicative benchmark of 2334 per cent for 2011. However credit to the Federal Government which fell by 2165 per cent (2598 per cent on annualized basis), was below the indicative benchmark growth rate of 2929 per cent for 2011. This was due to the fiscal surplus of N30784 7 billion in July 2011 following the sharing of the arrears of budget augmentation (January-April, 2011) which reduced the need for government borrowing. Rates at the interbank money market moved in tandem with the upward reviews of the MPR at the MPC meetings during the period. The average interbank call and Open buy back (OBB) rates rose from 1138 and 1116 per cent before the extra-ordinary MPC meeting, held in October 2011, to 1500 and 1370 per cent, respectively, after the meeting, reflecting the spike in the MPR. In addition, the upward review of the CRR and the sterilization of the funds helped to push up inter-bank rates to a high of 1806 per cent on October 14, 2011. The Interbank and OBB rates, which opened at 1074 and 1063 per cent on September 19, 2011 rose to 1709 and 1400 per cent on October 31, and closed at 1430 and 1326 per cent, respectively, on November 15, 2011. Other factors responsible for the upward movement in rates included the various OMO auctions conducted to mop-up excess liquidity, as well as the low level of liquidity in the banking system following the deadlock at the Federation Accounts Allocation Committee meeting which culminated in the late release of statutory revenue to the three tiers of government. However the purchase of AMCON bonds by the Bank and the injection of funds, moderated rates in the market. The Committee also noted that deposit money banks have improved the rates on fixed-term deposits. Thus the average 8 weighted three-month deposit rate has gone up to 706 per cent in October from 549 per cent in September. Also the rates on deposits for 12 months increased from 447 per cent in September to 490 per cent in October, 2011. The average weighted interest bearing deposit rate stood at 493 per cent in October compared with 402 per cent in September. This increase in rates had been anticipated by the Committee and is likely to continue especially as we approach the December 31, 2011 deadline for the removal of the CBN guarantee on the interbank market. Lending rates have also gone up in response to tighter conditions in the money market. The Committee observed that the bearish performance of the Nigerian capital market continued for most of the year. The All-Share Index (ASI) decreased by 180 per cent on a year-to-date basis from 24,,77052 at end-December 2010 to 20,,31151 on November 18, 2011. Market Capitalization (MC) also declined, by 192 per cent, from N791 trillion to N639 trillion over the same period due partly to the delisting of acquired banks. The bearish market is consistent with the trends globally in a very uncertain world where fund managers have resorted to a flight to safety. High yields on fixed income securities and subdued activity from investors in the wake of the Euro Zone crisis should advise against undue optimism for a rally in stocks in the short-term. However strong earnings and fundamentals mean that the market is at present very attractive to long-term investors but not speculators. External Sector Developments The Committee observed some restoration of stability in the Foreign exchange market since the last MPC meeting. The average exchange rate appreciated at all three segments of the market during the period. At the wDAS market, the exchange rate opened at N15848/US$ (including 1% commission) on October 11, 2011 and closed at N15605/US$ on November 18, 2011, representing an appreciation of N243k or 153 per cent within the period. At the inter-bank segment, the selling rate opened at N15890/US$ and closed at N15862/US$, representing an appreciation of N 028k or 017 per cent. At the BDC segment, the selling rate opened at N16500/US$ and closed at N16000/US$, representing an appreciation of N500k or 303 per cent for the period. The external reserves position has continued to improve, closing at US$3438 billion of international reserves as at November 17, 2011. The Committee felt that external developments have in general responded favorably to monetary policy stance adopted in the last MPC meeting in October. It urged the Central Bank to be vigilant with respect to the developments in the foreign exchange market and maintain its stance in favour of stable exchange rates, and send 10 clear signals that will help anchor the expectations of investors, manufacturers, and policy makers in the short-to-medium term. The Committee's Considerations The Committee reviewed its decisions over the course of 2011 and their impact on the Bank's core mandate of maintaining price stability. It noted that Nigeria had been ahead of all other African countries in anticipating the impending danger of inflation and started its monetary tightening cycle at a time other African Central Banks were still holding or reducing policy rates. It noted that these decisions have helped in controlling pressures on the general price level and in maintaining a relatively stable equilibrium in the foreign exchange markets. Where this equilibrium is disturbed by external factors, the ability to respond rapidly has succeeded in quickly restoring stability. The Committee also noted the mixed signals sent by inflation numbers for October 2011. The slight uptick in headline inflation year-on-year represents only a 20 basis-point increase from a high base of 103 per cent, and it is important not to exaggerate its significance. The index of all items except food declined marginally year-on-year, and all three broad indices (headline, food and core) showed a month-on-month decline in October, against month-on- month increases in the previous month. 1 On the fiscal side, a moderated oil benchmark price coupled with very strong public statements of commitment to fiscal consolidation by the fiscal authorities, give rise to optimism about long-awaited support on the fiscal side. Global headwinds may lead to a softening of commodity markets, thus reducing the resources available to fiscal authorities and contributing to a disinflationary process. The Committee noted the continuing demand pressures in the foreign exchange market and the slow rate of reserve accretion as indicators that liquidity conditions may still need further tightening. On the other hand, lending rates are already high and having impact on the real sector, and global headwinds may make further tightening counter-productive and pro-cyclical should oil price fall significantly. Also a combination of small fiscal adjustments and moderate depreciation in the exchange rate of the naira should compensate for maintaining current interest rate stance. Finally the Committee noted that December is usually a period of muted economic activity, and an appropriate time to pause and assess the full impact of the recent tightening decisions after a lag. Decision The Committee decided as follows: 1. By a unanimous vote to retain the MPR at 120 per cent and the symmetric band at +/-200 basis points. To retain the CRR at 80 per cent. To adjust the mid-point of target official exchange rate from N15000/US$100 to N15500/US$100 and maintain the band of +/-30 per cent. This means that the naira should float roughly within a range of N15000/US$100–N16000/US$100, unless extraordinary shocks necessitate a change in stance. To encourage the CBN to continue to seek convergence between wDAS and interbank rates to reduce arbitrage opportunities, avoid speculative attacks, and the emergence of a multiple-exchange rate environment. Sanusi Lamido Sanusi. CON Governor Central Bank of Nigeria November 21, 2011 13 PERSONAL STATEMENTS BY MPC MEMBERS: 10 ALADE. SARAH This Committee meeting is coming on the hills of October meeting which saw policy rate increased by 275 basis points and Cash Reverse Requirement (CRR) doubled. Although headline inflation remain elevated at 105 percent in October from 103 recorded in September, 2011, there is need to allow the impact of the last policy decisions in October to work its way into the economy. Since monetary policy operates with a lag, the cumulative impact of the policy actions in October is yet to be fully transmitted into the economy. Based on this. I am inclined to support a no change in monetary policy rate and CRR to help address the growth concerns in the economy. Headline inflation increased moderately to 105 percent in October, reflecting global economic environment and commodity price volatility. Both headline and food inflation increased moderately in October. While headline inflation increased from 103 percent in September to 105percent in October, food inflation increased from 95 percent to 97 percent. The impact of sustained monetary tightening by the Central Bank is helping to contain inflationary pressure, however seasonal spending during the Christian and Muslim holiday season may have been 14 responsible for the elevated inflationary pressure in October. The outlook going forward is that this temporary pressure will be contained as the full effect of the last monetary policy is transmitted into the economy. Available forecast points to continued decline in both food and headline inflation through the first quarter of 2012. Global growth prospect has become more uncertain with high unemployment and elevated inflationary pressure. Developments in the global economy over the past few weeks are a matter of serious concern. Growth momentum is weakening in the advanced economies amidst heightened concerns that recovery may take longer than earlier expected. Most major industrial economies are experiencing high inflation and high unemployment rates making recovery harder to achieve. Additionally the Euro zone countries are grappling with the sovereign debt crisis which has resulted in the change of government in two countries (Greece and Italy). Most analysts are uncertain that the risk of sovereign default will be addressed expeditiously and this loss of confidence is reflecting in market transactions. Although Nigeria's exports have performed well in the recent period, this trend is unlikely to be sustained in the face of weakening global demand. This suggests that risks to the growth projection for the next few months are on the downside and further tightening could dry up domestic economic activities. While there are still pockets of downside risks in the domestic banking sector, the resolution action taken by the Central Bank is helping to restore confidence in the banking sector. The return in confidence needs to be enhanced by giving the banks some space to consolidate their position 15 and cater to the needs of their customers. Another policy hike could further tighten liquidity conditions in the market with adverse impact on economic activities. Based on the above. I will recommend a “no change” in monetary policy rate and Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR). Furthermore, the deceleration in global growth and increased volatility in commodity prices all call for prudent monetary policy stance to maneuver the fragile economic environment. .0 BARAU. SULEIMAN A Developments since the last MPC meeting A1 I entered the Monetary Policy Committee meeting today convinced that having recently “front loaded” policy actions to contain the possible impact of excess liquidity and speculative attack on inflation and exchange rate respectively. I would vote for status- quo. The rationale for this position is obvious. .2 In the first place, although Year-on-Year (YoY) Headline and Food Inflation rates inched up marginally from 103% to 105% and 95% to 97% in September and October respectively. Month-on-Month (MoM) rates for Headline and Food Inflation actually declined by 092% and 07% respectively during the same period. .3 Year-on-Year Core Inflation rate however actually declined marginally from 116% in September to 115% in October. Therefore while Year-on-Year measures showed a mixed but stable trend, the Month-on-Month rates witnessed a marginal decline. This for me, is an indication that the recent rather aggressive tightening measures adopted by the MPC are beginning to bear fruits. 16 A4 In spite of the fact that market rates and lending rates in general have trended upwards in response to the recent increase in MPR, the economy recorded a robust growth as GDP grew by 740% in Quarter Three . Even though this is a decline when compared to 772% recorded in Quarter Two , it is an impressive improvement over the 664% recorded in Quarter One . This further supports my view that at present, no direct relationship has been established between liquidity tightening measures, credit and GDP growth. Even if there is, it is substantially a lagged relationship. Significantly Staff estimates are that Quarter Four GDP growth is expected to be 905%, riding on good growth projections from Agriculture. Wholesale and Retail Trade, and Services sectors. Overall GDP growth rate is estimated to be 769% for 2011. .5 The level of foreign reserves actually rose by 832% from $317 billion in September to $343 billion in October in reflection of the various liquidity tightening and administrative measures adopted by the CBN. .6 Market interest rates were volatile but all trended upwards in response to the upward adjustment of the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) to 12%. .7 We witnessed mild appreciation of exchange rates. In the WDAS segment we witnessed 15% appreciation while 018% and 303% appreciation were recorded in the Interbank and BDC segments, respectively. .8 The Euro Sovereign Debt problem and possible banking crises worsened. This had led to change in leadership in Greece. Italy and Spain. The US deficit problem continued as the congressional super committee that is negotiating possible deficit reduction agreement failed to reach a deal. Meanwhile GDP growth rate slowed down in Brazil. India and China with India recording the lowest growth rate in Quarter Two since 2009. 17 A9 Overall, we recorded moderate success in keeping inflation and exchange rate stable while recording modest GDP growth rate and some foreign reserves accretion. Challenges/pressure points In spite of the successes recorded the following are possible pressure points which we must keep in view. .1 Continued demand pressure for foreign exchange due to the fact that the system is still very liquid which could support sustained speculative demand. The measures taken to adjust the WDAS exchange rate to N1545 per USD has done little in eliminating the effect of these factors. There is the obvious need to embark on further liquidity mop up that is consistent with our tightening stance and on further administrative measures. .2 It is unlikely that the fuel subsidy would be removed before the next MPC meeting. It is still a possibility though and the inflationary impact of such a decision is a risk to keep in mind in spite of the expected positive fiscal and foreign exchange market impact of this decision. .3 Year-end festivities usually put pressure on inflation via excessive fiscal and consumer spending. This is a source for concern as such a development may erode whatever gains we have made in containing inflationary pressures. .4 The Euro area sovereign debt and possible financial crises should be of keen interest to us. We should be hopeful that the contagion would not radically impact on Italy any further given the potential consequence of such on the fortunes of Nigeria via second round effects. Recommendation 18 Having reflected deeply on the foregoing. I have no doubt that any immediate further tightening measures at this time may be unnecessary. therefore recommend the following: C1 Monetary Policy Rate should be maintained at 12% C2 Cash Reserve Ratio should be maintained at 8% with Symmetric Corridor of plus and minus 2%. .3 Continue to tighten liquidity based on normal open market operations C4 Further administrative measures to check wastages associated with foreign exchange demand. This should be complemented with active participation in the interbank market by the CBN in order to contain divergence in rates at the various segments of the foreign exchange market. .0 GARBA. ABDUL GANIYU Decision I vote for: I Holding the MPR at 120% II. Maintaining the Asymmetric Corridor for SLF and SDF at ±2% III. Maintaining CRR at 8% Basis of Decision 1. To allow for the effects of previous policies to be fully realized. To allow for more active implementation of policies. To allow for more effective implementation of institutional changes that change the incentive system against “rouge players” whose 19 motives and behaviors undermine the efficient functioning of the financial markets particularly money and foreign exchange markets. .0 LEMO. TUNDE The recent monetary tightening stance of the Monetary Policy Committee has assisted a great deal in reducing the demand pressures in the foreign exchange market, resulting in modest accretion to the Gross External reserve which stood at USD 3438billion on November 17, 2011. The decision has also made Nigeria more attractive to foreign investors as the MPR, for the first time in October 2011, turned positive in real terms. The above notwithstanding, developments in the domestic economy suggest that the inflationary pressures may persist till the end of the year as headline and food inflation rose marginally in October. The slight reduction in core inflation may not be sustained in the run up to the year- end due to the impact of increase in consumption pattern at this time of the year. These pressures are however not strong enough for serious concern, especially as the political negotiations necessary for the removal of fuel subsidy may not be concluded in the near-term. The global economic recovery remains fragile. While the threat of double dip recession has decreased in USA, unemployment still remains high. Europe continues to grapple with sovereign debt crisis, mounting market tension and risk of banking crises, while expected growth in China may slow down considerably as the housing market is already showing sign of a possible crash. These external developments may have negative impact on global demand for crude oil and therefore result in significant shortfall in government revenue and money supply. am therefore of the opinion that MPC needs to watch these domestic and foreign developments in the next few months as further tightening 20 may be pro cyclical in the event of a major slowdown in global and domestic economies. Furthermore additional time is also required to monitor the full effects of MPC decisions taken on October 18, 2011. In view of the foregoing. I recommend the following: a. Maintenance of the MPR at the current rate of 12% b. Retention of the current symmetric corridor of +-2% c. Current Cash Reserve Requirement of 8% to remain unchanged, and d. Achieve a convergence of the Wholesale Dutch Auction (WDAS) and Interbank rates. .0 MOGHALU. KINGSLEY CHIEDU Several indicators, in particular a mild resurgence of inflationary pressures, would, on the face of it, argue for a continuation of monetary tightening at this meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee. The year-on-year headline inflation rate rose from 103 per cent in September 2011 to 105 per cent in October 2011. Food inflation also rose from 95 per cent in September to 97 per cent in October. However there are also important factors and developments that, without prejudice to the need for the Central Bank of Nigeria to maintain its strong anti-inflation stance in the medium to long term, point to the conclusion that is wiser to adopt a pause-and-see stance and hold the policy rate steady at this review by the MPC. These factors include:  Research indicators that, despite the mild increase in price levels and increases associated with year-end consumption patterns, it is likely, perhaps even probable, that there will be price declines in the first half of 2012. 21  A combination of marginal reduction in core inflation to 115 per cent in October 2011 from 116 per cent in September 2011 and staff projections that the effects of recent extensive monetary tightening measures agreed at the extraordinary meeting of the MPC on 10 October 2011 have yet to be fully transmitted into the economy. Global economic crisis, especially the debt crisis of the Eurozone and its far-reaching potential consequences if not contained, could create recessions that will impact Nigeria's economy through possible effects on crude oil prices and the exposures of Nigerian banks and require a return to a more accommodative monetary stance. The dark clouds hovering over the global economy call for proceeding cautiously with monetary tightening at this point in time. There are now questions over the timing of a previously anticipated deregulation of petroleum product prices as the Federal Government of Nigeria seeks to build political consensus in support of the proposed policy change. The utilization of other measures, including an adjustment of the mid-point of the naira, to ensure the stability of the currency, ensures that the monetary policy rate is not the sole means for managing exchange rate policy. On the basis of the foregoing. I vote for: Holding the monetary policy rate steady at 120 per cent. Maintaining the symmetric corridor at +/- 200 basis points Maintaining the Cash Reserve Ratio at 80 per cent. Adjusting the mid-point target of the naira to N155 to the dollar. .0 OLOFIN. SAM 22 It is gratifying to note that some of the proactive policy measures put in place at the extraordinary meeting held in October 2011 to forestall an unwarranted attack on the Naira are beginning to yield the desired results. The observed turbulence in the foreign exchange market and excessive speculative hedging against the Naira which partly warranted the emergency meeting appears to have abated and stability has been restored to the foreign exchange market albeit at a moderately higher rate of $1: N155. This may be suggesting the need for a more elastic band other than the plus or minus 3 percent around the $1::N150 rate that has prevailed in the market over the last three to four quarters. Even though there has been a mild resurgence of inflationary pressure, the year-on- year headline inflation has only risen by insignificant percentage points from 93 percent in September 2011 to 103 in October 2011. Projections by the NBS indicate that real GDP growth rate is likely to remain significantly positive at a projected rate hovering around 8 percent for the year 2011. Despite the phenomenal jerking up the MPR by over 200 basis points at the last meeting, aggregate domestic credit continues to grow even though at a slightly lower annualized rate of 195 percent compared with 2372 percent recorded over a similar period in 2010. For the first time in recent months the country has a positive real interest rate even if this is at the moment at a rate that still leaves the country less competitive in attracting the much desired foreign capital inflows when compared with Ghana and South Africa. The outlook on the fiscal front "
Georgia,2011-11-22,"22.11.11 NBG Lowers Its Policy Rate By 25 Basis Points The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on November 22, 2011 and decided to lower its Main Policy Rate (the refinancing rate) by 25 basis points to 7 percent. Annual inflation fell even further in October, dropping to 2.3 percent. Core inflation (net of food and energy) is low as well, amounting to -0.2 percent. The decrease in the inflation rates was anticipated, although the actual decrease in the recent period is somewhat higher than one would have expected. According to the existing forecasts, inflation is expected to remain low till the end of this year and the first half of the next one. Starting in summer 2012 the moderate increase in the inflation rate is expected, although according to forecasts, given the unchanged policy stance, the inflation rate will remain below the target. In the recent period the indicators of the economic growth show the significant GDP growth. Hence, it is expected that the economic growth in 2011 will exceed 6 percent. Despite this increase in growth rates, the total output is still below the potential and therefore the aforementioned increase in the aggregate demand does not create inflationary pressures. The formation of the aggregate demand and therefore the high rates of the economic activity were to a considerable degree caused by the bank credits to the economy. The growth in loans disbursed in the domestic currency is particularly worth mentioning, since it bears fewer risks for the economy. The present loan growth rates do not carry inflationary risks. Given that the total output is below the potential and the existing forecasts indicate that the inflation in the next year will remain below the target, the Monetary Policy Committee of the NBG considered it appropriate to continue easing the monetary policy and decided to decrease the policy rate by 25 basis points. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on December 21, 2011."
Turkiye,2011-11-23,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels: a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) at 5.75 percent, b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 5 percent, lending rate at 12.5 percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 12 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, lending rate at 15.5 percent. Recent data releases suggest that the rebalancing between the domestic and external demand is ongoing as envisaged. With the credit growth decelerating to more reasonable levels, the desired increase in private savings has already started to take place. Accordingly, the improvement in the current account balance is expected to become more significant in the final months of the year. The Committee has noted that inflation will display a rapid increase in the short- term due to the base effects from unprocessed food prices. The Central Bank has delivered a strong tightening in October in order to prevent the potential second round effects of a year-end inflation significantly above the target. In this respect, domestic demand is expected to follow a moderate path and second round effects of the temporary price movements will be contained in the forthcoming periods. The impact of the measures undertaken on credit, domestic demand, and inflation expectations will be monitored closely and the amount of Turkish lira funding via one-week repo auctions will be timely adjusted on both sides, if needed. Moreover, in line with the strategy formulated at the interim meeting of August 4, 2011, the Committee will continue to monitor global developments closely and take the needed measures promptly to maintain the stability in the domestic financial markets.

Egypt,2011-11-24,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release November 24, 2011 In its meeting held on November 24, 2011, the Monetary Policy Commitiee (MPC) decided to raise the overnight deposit rate by 100 bps to 925 percent while raising the overnight lending rate and the 7-day repo by 50 bps to 1025 percent and 975 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also raised by 100 bps to 95 percen. Headline CPI inched up by 033 percent (m/m) in October following the 143 percent increase in Septembe. The annual rate declined to 710 percent on the back of favorable base effects from last year down from 821 percent recorded in Septembe. On the other hand, core CPI inched up by 04 percent in October following the 113 percent increase in September, while the annual rate declined from 795 percent to 760 percen. The latest monthly developments showed that the sharp food price increases witnessed in July and August due to the Ramadan effect have moderated in September through October while annual adjustments in school tuition led to a further increase in non-food price. While the probability of a rebound in international food prices is less likely now in light of recent global developments, the re-emergence of local supply bottlenecks and distortions in the distribution channels pose an upside risk to the inflation outloo. Meanwhile real GDP expanded by a mere 04 percent in 2010/2011 Q4 following the significant contraction of 43 percent recorded the previous quarte. This led the annual GDP growth for the whole year 2010/2011 to fall to 18 percent from 51 percent recorded in 2009/201. It is important to note that while a marked decline in economic activity was expected, the magnitude is larger than anticipated at the outset of the revolutio. This came on the back of significant declines in the tourism, manufacturing and construction sector. In the meantime, given the increased uncertainty that faced market participants early this year, investment witnessed a significant annual retrenchment of 20 percent in the second half of 2010/201. Looking ahead, the current political transformation may continue to have ramifications on both consumption as well as investment decisions, adversely weighing on key sectors within the econom. Moreover concerns related to the global recovery have intensified on the back of heightened worries regarding fiscal and banking sector challenges facing the Euro Area and possible spillovers to other regions along with weaker than anticipated growth rates in a number of advanced economie. These factors, combined, pose downside risks to domestic GDP going forwar. While the slowdown in economic growth should limit upside risks to the inflation outlook, there are possible upward pressures on inflation as mentioned abov. Given the upside risks on the inflation outlook and the increased uncertainty at this juncture, the MPC judges that a rate hike is neede. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter. Dr Rania Al-Mashat A Sub Governor.

Russia,2011-11-25,"The Bank of Russia External and Public Relations Department informs that on 25 November 2011 the Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia decided to keep the refinancing rate and interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations unchanged (table “Interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations”). The decision was supported by the assessment of inflation risks and risks to the sustainability of economic growth, including those associated with the global economic uncertainty. By the end of October the disinflationary effect of the decline in food prices had almost faded away and this largely explained the less pronounced slowdown in inflation in October—November. As of 21 November 2011 inflation reached 7.0% over year ago (7.2% in October and September). The rouble appreciation observed in October could contribute to the reduction of the inflation risks caused by its depreciation in August-September. The tightening of monetary conditions resulting from the shortage of the rouble liquidity in the banking sector, which is expected to persist in the medium term, would also help to curb inflation pressure in the future. The annual growth rate of industrial production continued to decrease in October, and the persistently poor economic confidence indicators reflect the moderate economic growth perspectives. The rate of unemployment increased slightly in October while the pace of growth of real income and wages declined. However, these indicators remained at the levels compatible with the expansion of consumer demand, indicated by the still high retail sales growth rate. The observed firmness of consumption beside the moderate production indicators could result in higher level of economic activity but may also be a source of additional inflation pressure. Considering recent domestic and international macroeconomic developments the Bank of Russia judged that the current level of money market interest rates was appropriate to balance the inflationary risks and the risks of economic growth slowdown. The increase in money market interest rates, resulting from the transition to the liquidity shortage in the banking sector together with the instability on the global financial markets, puts upward pressure on other interest rates in the economy. Thereupon the Bank of Russia will continue to monitor the money market conditions and the external economic developments, and to assess the risks of further increase in the market interest rates and its consequences. The next meeting of the Board of Directors on monetary policy issues is planned to be held in the last decade of December 2011. Interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations. (% p.a.). 1 7 days fixed rates REPO operations have been suspended. 2 Operations have been suspended. 3 The interest rate has been set from 1 November 2011. 4 Operations were suspended from 10 February 2011, resumed from 1 November 2011.

Israel,2011-11-28,"28.11.2011 The Bank of Israel reduces the interest rate for December 2011 by 0.25 percentage points to 2.75 percent To view this press release as a WORD file - Click here Background conditions Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 0.1 percent in October, in line with forecasts, and within the seasonal path consistent with achieving the inflation target. The rate of inflation over the past 12 months, as measured by the change in the CPI, continued to settle more firmly within the target range (1-3 percent per year) and is now 2.7 percent. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Inflation expectations, ascalculated from the capital markets, remained at the same level as in the previous month at around 1.7 percent. With that, after publication of the October CPI, expectations rose slightly to 1.9 percent. Expectations for themedium and longer terms also remained steady at an average of 2.3 percent.Forecasters' inflation predictions for the next twelve CPI readings were 2.3 percent on average, compared with 2.2 percent last month. Expectations of the Bank of Israel interest rate one year from now, based on the Telbor (Tel Aviv Inter-Bank Offered Rate) market, remained at 2.7 percent, while the average of forecasters' predictions of the interest rate in one year's time continued to decline, and reached 2.75 percent (compared with 3 percent last month). Most forecasters expect the Bank of Israel to cut the interest rate for December by 0.25 percentage points, and on average they expect the interest rate to be reduced by 0.38 percentage points over the next threemonths. Real economic activity: Economic indicators that became availablethis month support the assessment that in the third quarter and in Octoberthe slowdown in the rate of growth of economic activity and of demand continued. With that, these figures are currently consistent with the Bank of Israel forecast of 4.7 percent growth in 2011. According to National Accounts figures for the third quarter (in annual terms). GDP grew 3.4 percent, similar to its growth rate in the previous quarter; business product grew 5.3 percent, compared with 2.7 percent in the previous quarter; private consumption increased by 0.9 percent, compared with 1.3 percent in the previous quarter, gross fixed capital formation increased by 17.8 percent, compared with 9.3 percent in the previous quarter; and exports declined 16.9 percent,compared with growth of 1.5 percent in the previous quarter. The CompositeState of the Economy Index increased slightly in October, by 0.1 percent. The Bank of Israel's Companies Survey and the new Central Bureau of Statistics survey of business trends showed that the slowdown in private sector business activity persisted and even intensified in October. In contrast, theBank Hapoalim consumer confidence index increased in October, to a level of 50.7, the first time in three months that the figure has been above the 50 point level. Tax receipts in October were 8 percent lower than the forecast seasonal path, a continuation of the slowdown that began in April. The labor market and wages: Labor market data indicate a high level of employment and a low unemployment rate. Based on trend data, the rateof unemployment declined by 0.1 percentage points in August, and reached 5.6 percent. The number of Israeli employee posts increased by 3.1 percent in June-August, in annual terms, compared with the corresponding period of 2010. The nominal wage rose in June-August by 0.3 percent, compared with the preceding three months, and the real wage increased 0.15 percent in June-August, compared with the preceding three months. Health tax receipts, which provide an indication of wage payments, were 8 percent higher in October (preliminary estimate) in nominal terms than in October 2010 (excluding the effect of legislative changes). The Bank of Israel Research Department staff forecast: According to the Research Department staff forecast (from September), the rate of inflation over the four quarters ending in the third quarter of 2012 will be 2.3 percent, and the average interest rate in 2012 is expected to be 3 percent. The GDP growth forecast is 4.7 percent for 2011, and 3.2 percent for 2012. The assessment is based on, among other things, a lowered InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF) forecast of global growth and world trade. Last month the Research Department examined the possible effect on Israel's economy ofa scenario in which global growth is 1 percentage point lower than the base scenario. If the lower growth scenario is realized. GDP growth in Israel is forecast to be about 0.5 percentage points lower in 2012 than in the base scenario. Inflation over the four quarters ending in the third quarter of 2012 is forecast to be 0.8 percentage points lower than in the base scenario, and the average interest rate for 2012 is expected to be 1 percentage point lower than in the base scenario. Budget data: Government domestic revenues for the year to date through October were 2.7 percent lower than the seasonal path of the budget forecast, primarily due to a continued slowdown in indirect tax receipts, which began in April. The overall government deficit (excluding net credit) in the year to date was NIS 14 billion, compared to a deficit of NIS 16.3 billion in the corresponding period in 2010. Developments in government activity so far indicate that tax revenues will be about 2 percent lower than the budget forecast, and the budget deficit for the year 2011 will be around 0.5 percent of GDP above the deficit ceiling set by law: 3 percent of GDP. The foreign exchange market: From the previous monetary policy discussion held on October 23, through November 25, the shekel depreciated byabout 3.8 percent against the dollar, in line with the general strengthening of the dollar world wide. The shekel was essentially unchanged against the euro (appreciation of 0.1 percent). The shekel weakened by about 2 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. The rate of participation by nonresident investors in foreign currency trading was 30 percent in November, compared with the average of 35 percent since the beginning of 2011. The capital and money markets: From the previous monetary policy discussion held on October 23, through November 25, the Tel Aviv 25 Index declined by 8.3 percent, more than stock market indices in advanced economies unconnected with the debt crisis. The unindexed government bond market responded with declining rates for most maturities of up to 10 basis points (b.p.), while the yield curve of CPI-indexed government bonds declined sharply in short maturities, and increased by up to 15 b.p. for terms to maturity of over 4 years. The yield gap between Israeli 10-year government bonds and equivalent 10-year US Treasury securities widened to about 270 b.p., from 250 b.p. in the previous month. Makam yields increased slightly for maturities of up to 8 months, and declined slightly in longer terms. The yield for one year fell during the period from 2.8 percent to 2.7 percent: against the background of an exit from risk assets and expectations of continued interest rate cuts by the Bank of Israel, and despite the continued exit of nonresidents from makam. Withdrawals from mutual funds specializing in corporate bonds continued this month, although at a slower pace than that in the previous month. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by thefive-year CDS spread increased this month to 215 basis points from last month's 160 basis points. The Tel-Bond 20 Index declined by 1.4 percent, and the Tel-Bond 40 Index declined by 2.1 percent. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in October, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 2 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to oneyear) increased by 14.1 percent. Developments in the credit markets: The balance of outstanding debt of the business sector increased in September by 1.7 percent, to NIS 781 billion. Outstanding credit to households remained at NIS 359 billion in September, with an increase of 0.8 percent in outstanding housing credit, and a decrease of 1.8 percent in non-housing credit. Of the credit to households, outstanding housing credit rose 11.3 percent in the twelve months ending in September to NIS 257 billion, compared with a 10.9 percent increase in the twelve months to August. The volume of new housing credit granted in the twelve months ending in October was 2.2 percent lower than in the twelve months ending in September: a continuation of consecutive declinessince the record high set in May. The share of unindexed floating rate mortgages extended in October was 26.6 percent, after reaching 26.1 percent inAugust. These percentages are significantly lower than the record levels of the first quarter of 2009: about 75 percent on average. The interest rates on CPI-indexed mortgages: both fixed rate and variable rate: increased in October, while interest rates on variable rate unindexed mortgages declined. The housing market: Activity in the construction industry continues to be strong. The number of starts in the twelve months to August reached 43,672, and the number of completions was 33,605, both similar to the numbers in the previous month. The number of homes available for sale continued to increase, and in August-October was on average 8.3 percent higher than in the three preceding months (original data). The Central Bureau of Statistics Survey of Business Trends indicates a decline in activity andin new orders in the industry. Housing prices reflected in the housing index, which is based mainly on renewed rental contracts and which is included in the CPI, declined 0.3 percent in October, but over the 12 months ending in October they increased by 6.3 percent: compared with an increase of 5.5 percent in the 12 months ending in September: and prices are expected, according to the Research Department forecast, to continue to increase at a similar pace in the coming year. Home prices, which are published in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of home prices but are not included in the CPI, declined in August-September by 0.2 percent (the first decline since December 2008) after an increase of 0.6 percent in July-August. The annual rate of increase in home prices also moderated: in the 12 months ending in September the rate was 10.5 percent, compared with 12.1 percent in the 12 months ending in August, and this after levels of around 20 percent in 2010. The moderation in home prices comes against the background of the continued increase in the number of building starts, the lagged effect of the increase in the interest rate, measures introduced by the Bank of Israel affecting mortgages, and steps taken by the Ministry of Finance in real estate taxation. The effect of these moves is expected to continue and be evident going forward. The global economy: The debt crisis in Europe is deepening and spreading to additional countries. There is growing concern of a severe impact on the global economy. Austerity measures announced by several European countries have not succeeded, to date, to calm the markets. Yields on government bonds of Italy. Spain, and other countries in the eurozone have reached high and apparently unsustainable levels. The banking sector around the world, specifically in Europe, is under pressure due to its exposure to bonds of countries in difficulty, and in the event of a crisis would be liable to contribute significantly to the contagion effect, and to lead to the spread of the European crisis to other countries over and above the macroeconomic effects resulting from the contraction of world trade. Last month credit rating companies made further cuts in the rating of European countries, and warned of the credit rating outlook of other countries and of banks around the world. Macroeconomic figures published this month in the US were relatively favorable, and were generally better than expected, but they are still relatively weak. Data published in Europe were weaker, and many forecasters and investment houses expect that Europe will slip into a recession that is likely to deteriorate in light of the austerity measures announced inseveral countries. Inflation around the world is starting to moderate, andcommodity prices that fell sharply are expected to reduce it further, but the increase in oil prices this year, that was out of line with the economic situation and with the fall in industrial metal prices, constitutes a burden on the already weak global economy. Against the background of these developments, the ECB made a surprise cut in the interest rate this month, andthe markets are pricing in interest rate cuts in other economies. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to reduce the interest rate to 2.75 percent for December isconsistent with the interest rate policy that is intended to entrench the inflation rate within the price stability target of 1-3 percent inflation a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel, the global economy, the monetary policies of major central banks, and developments in the exchange rate of the shekel. The debt crisis in Europe is becoming more severe and is spreading to other countries,and there is growing concern over its potentially strong impact on the global economy. Inlight of the weak economic data published in Europe, the risk of Europe sliding into a recession and a significant slowdown in the global economy hasrisen. These negative developments are already affecting the Israeli economy, and their effect is expected to intensify. Economic indicators that became available this month support the assessment that in the third quarter and in October the slowdown in the rate of growth of economic activity continued. Most of the slowdown in the domestic economy resulted from the easing in global demand and its effect on exports, and also to some extent from the slackening of domestic demand. Inflation forecasts for the next twelve months as calculated from the capital market,those of the forecasters and that of the Bank of Israel are all close to the midpoint of the target inflation range. Actual inflation over the last twelve months is within the target range for the second month in succession,and is expected to remain there over the next year. The persistent negative trends in Europe led to a cut in the ECB interest rate and tocuts in interest rates in other countries, and resulted in the markets notpricing in an increase in the interest rate in the coming year in any of the major advanced economies. According to the announcement by the Federal Reserve, the interest rate in the US is expected to remain at its almost zero level till the middle of 2013 at least, and the Fed and the ECB are continuing with their quantitative easing measures. Home pricesincreased by 10.5 percent in the twelve months ending September, compared with 12.1 percent in the twelve months to August. In August-September home prices declined for the first time since December 2008. The continued increase in the number of building starts, the delayed effect of the increase in the interest rate, measures introduced by the Bank of Israel affecting mortgages, and steps taken by the Ministry of Finance in real estate taxation are all expected to continue to moderate home prices during the coming year. It should be noted that the limitation imposed by the Bank of Israel on the share of housing loans at variable interest rate reduces the effect of a cut in the interest rate on the average rate of interest on mortgages. The reduction in the interest rate, together with the recent weakening of the effective exchange rate of the shekel, are expected to help Israel's economy deal with the difficulties confronting it. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in Israel's economy and the global economy and in the financial markets. The Bank will usethe tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, including keeping a close watch on developments in the assets market, and especially in the housing market. The minutes of the discussions prior to the above interest rate decision will be published on December 12, 2011. The decision regarding the interest rate for January 2012 will be published at 17:30 on Monday. December 26, 2011. 28.11.2011 The Bank of Israel reduces the interest rate for December 2011 by 0.25 percentage points to 2.75 percent.

Hungary,2011-11-29,"At its meeting on 29 November, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to raise the central bank base rate by 50 basis points from 6.00% to 6.50%, with effect from 30 November 2011. In the Council's judgement, economic growth is likely to remain subdued over the next two years, with the level of output remaining below its potential throughout the period. The consumer price index will increasingly reflect the disinflationary impact of weak domestic demand after the effects of the indirect tax increases have worn off; however, the depreciation of the forint in recent months is a threat to meeting the 3 per cent inflation target. Exchange rate depreciation is also increasing the vulnerability of the domestic financial system. The increases in VAT and excise duties are likely to raise the consumer price index significantly in 2012. Fiscal compensation to companies will partly offset the effects of the minimum wage increase. The depreciation of the forint in recent months may lead to a build-up of inflationary pressure even in the medium term. The extent to which companies will be able to pass cost increases on to prices is a source of uncertainty in terms of the future outlook for inflation. The Monetary Council is closely monitoring developments in tax-adjusted core inflation, in addition to movements in the consumer price index. In the Council's judgement, the outlook for Hungarian economic growth is unfavourable. The slowdown in global activity, concerns about debt sustainability in some euro-area periphery countries and the vulnerability of the financial system point to a weak outlook in Hungary's export markets, which in turn may dampen export growth. Consumption demand is likely to remain persistently low, reflecting the protracted balance sheet adjustment by households, uncertain income prospects, the inflationary impact of indirect tax increases and the weaker exchange rate. Significant fiscal adjustment next year is also likely to act as a brake on domestic demand growth. Domestic lending continues to make little contribution to economic growth. Rolling over short-term external funding has become more expensive and difficult for Hungarian banks, due to the sovereign debt problems in the euro-area periphery. Furthermore, the banking sector's capital position has been deteriorating due to losses arising from early repayments by households of foreign currency-denominated mortgages, which in turn weakens banks' lending capacity. Also, the banking sector's willingness to lend is low. These factors may lead to a further tightening in credit supply, as confirmed by the Bank's latest lending survey. In the current uncertain economic environment, the weaker outlook for growth and the tightening in credit conditions are acting as a drag on investment activity. Corporate profitability is expected to deteriorate. As a result, corporate investment may fall significantly in 2012, which will be only partly offset by a couple of large individual investment projects in manufacturing. The depreciation of the forint and the increase in risk premia have continued over the past month. The deteriorating outlook for global growth, the escalating euro-area sovereign debt crisis and growing tensions in the banking sector have been the main factors contributing to these unfavourable developments. All this leads to a deterioration in the outlook for growth in Hungary, while creating more unfavourable financing conditions for the country. The adverse impact of the early repayment option for foreign currency borrowers on domestic banks' capital position and increasing fiscal sustainability concerns also contributed to the increase in risk premia. The decision by the Government that it would conduct talks with the International Monetary Fund led to only temporary improvement in market sentiment, which deteriorated again following the move by Moody's to downgrade Hungary's sovereign debt rating. In this situation, the Monetary Council considers it important that an agreement between the Government and the international organisations as well as between the Government and the Banking Association is reached as soon as possible. Monetary policy can best support the recovery and contribute to an environment conducive to investment and job creation by maintaining predictability and preserving the stability of prices and the financial system. The depreciation of the forint in recent months has caused a deterioration in the inflation outlook and increased the need for balance sheet adjustment in the economy. The Monetary Council decided to raise the base rate by 50 basis points in view of the upside risks to inflation and increased perceptions of the risks associated with the economy. If the outlook for inflation and risk perceptions remain persistently unfavourable, it may prove necessary to raise interest rates further in the coming months."
Philippines,2011-11-30,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to leave unchanged the overnight policy interest rates. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs, and special deposit accounts (SDAs) were also maintained. The reserve requirement ratios remained unchanged as well. The Monetary Board's decision is based on its assessment that the inflation outlook continues to be manageable, with within-target headline inflation and well-contained inflation expectations. Latest baseline forecasts indicate that the annual inflation rates for 2011-2013 are likely to fall within the 3-5 percent target range. The Monetary Board also took into account the data showing subdued domestic economic activity in the third quarter, due to the weather-related slowdown in the expansion of the agricultural sector, weak global economy and concerns over Europe's sovereign and banking sectors. At the same time, the Monetary Board considers the risks surrounding the inflation outlook to remain tilted to the downside. Weak global economic recovery is likely to be reflected in easing global demand and commodity price pressures. The Board also noted that some upside risks to prices remain, including potential increases in liquidity due to sustained capital inflows. The Monetary Board believes that, on balance, the prevailing monetary policy settings are appropriately calibrated to the outlook for inflation and domestic economic activity. The BSP will continue to monitor price and demand conditions to ensure that monetary policy remains in line with price stability while being supportive of economic growth."
Thailand,2011-11-30,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 30 November 2011 Mr. Paiboon Kittisrikangwan. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announces the outcome of the meeting today, as follows. The MPC assessed that the global economic outlook had deteriorated after the impact of euro zone's sovereign debt problem on financial markets of the major economies became more pronounced, increasing the possibility of a recession in the euro zone. While the US economy improved slightly, its recovery remained fragile from the conjunction of low consumer confidence and anemic labor market conditions. Economic growth in Asia moderated in the third quarter on the back of softening global demand, though domestic demand continued to expand. Relative to the previous meeting, it has become apparent that the impact of flooding on the Thai economy has been more widespread and severe. The floods directly brought about partial halt in some production sectors and affected other economic activities indirectly through supply chain disruptions. This reinforced the negative impact on exports from the global economic slowdown, further undermining private sector confidence. The MPC expected economic growth in the last quarter and the whole of 2011 to be much lower than previously projected. With the worst of the flood crisis over, the economy has moved onto the restoration and reconstruction phase which, if delayed could undermine confidence and domestic demand recovery. Inflationary pressure persists due to government stimulus measures and an anticipated pickup in private sector demand from restoration spending. Nevertheless the weakening of the global economy would curtail price pressure to some extent. At the same time, price increases driven by flood-related shortages, which have only affected a limited number of goods in certain areas, was expected to be temporary. The risk of inflation accelerating to the extent that would threaten economic stability thus remains contained. The MPC assessed that the risk of a global economic slowdown has increased while consumer and business confidence remained weak. With upside inflation risks expected to be limited, the current accommodative monetary policy can provide further support to economic restoration and investment. The MPC therefore voted 5 to 2 to reduce the policy rate by 025 percent, from 350 percent to 325 percent per annum, with 2 votes in favour of a 050 percent reduction. The MPC would remain vigilant in monitoring developments in the global economy as well as progress on domestic restoration efforts and stands ready to take appropriate policy actions."
Armenia,2011-12-04,"Press Release 12.04.2011 In the April 12, 2011 meeting the Board of CBA decided to raise the Refinancing Rate of CBA by 0.25 pp, to 8.5 percent. In March of 2011 inflation was 0.8 percent. Though inflation, which was adjusted for January and February based on new weights in the consumer basket, pushed the 12- month inflation indicator down, it still is rather high, 11.5 percent. Moreover, as much as 8.3 pp out of the 12-month inflation contributed to food prices increases. The Board accepts that the growth rates of food prices in world markets are now slowing down. However, in the first quarter of 2011 their growth exceeded the forecasts which would make external inflationary pressures, second round effects and inflation expectations persisting in the domestic economy in the upcoming period of time. The Board believes that the measures taken up in agriculture would be helpful for recovering the supply in the branch, which had a reported decline based on the 2010 results, in the course of the next months. The Board considers that the gradual tightening of monetary conditions since the beginning of 2011, the restrictive impact of the fiscal policy on the generation of aggregate demand as well as the support from other public authorities in taking up anti- crisis measures would create serious preconditions for bringing inflation back to its target band starting the second half of 2011. The Central Bank Public Relations."
Armenia,2011-12-07,"Press Release 12.07.2011 In the July 12, 2011 meeting the Board of CBA decided to leave the Refinancing Rate of CBA unchanged, at 8.5 percent. There was 1.4 percent deflation recorded in June of 2011, and the 12-month inflation has fallen by 0.5 pp against the previous month's indicator and reached 8.5 percent, as a result. The contribution of the increase of food prices to the 12-month inflation is high  7.3 pp. The Board accepted that impulses coming from the external sector are not significant enough to shape an inflationary environment. In the second quarter of the year, prices in world commodity markets are relatively stable in spite of some observed volatility, and presently inflationary pressures have been neutralized. The Board has a consensus that the developments in the domestic economy now do not lead to an inflationary environment, either: the impacts from the labor market and private spending are neutral and the impact from the fiscal policy restrictive. The tightening of monetary conditions since the beginning of the year remains a factor that contributes to the easing of the inflationary environment. The Board summed up that the current developments in global and domestic economies as well as more favorable conditions in agriculture in comparison with the previous year allow to reaffirm that inflation in the forecast time horizon will most likely be within a target band of 4 % ± 1.5 pp, given the risks outlined in the monetary policy program show up balanced.

Poland,2011-12-07,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 7 December 2011 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 6-7 December 2011 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e.: (cid:1) reference rate at 4.50% on an annual basis; (cid:1) lombard rate at 6.00% on an annual basis; (cid:1) deposit rate at 3.00% on an annual basis; (cid:1) rediscount rate at 4.75% on an annual basis. In 2011 Q3, economic growth remained weak in the euro area. Moreover, the incoming data indicate a possible further deterioration in business conditions in the region. Economic activity may be dampened by increasingly pessimistic expectations of agents, rising funding costs and possible constraints on lending by banks. In the United States, in turn, economic growth recovered somewhat in 2011 Q3, although business activity indicators - despite their slight improvement observed recently - continue to run at historically low levels. Both in the euro area and in the United States inflation remains elevated, triggered by a prior rise in commodity prices. In the developing countries, on the other hand, there are signs of easing inflationary pressure. Due to the global economic slowdown coupled with the fiscal problems faced by some euro area countries, tensions in the financial markets persist worldwide. Risk aversion remains heightened, which feeds into higher volatility of asset prices, including exchange rates. Increased asset price volatility is also fuelled by huge liquidity surplus in the global financial markets, related to strongly expansionary monetary policy pursued by major central banks. In Poland. GDP data for 2011 Q3 confirmed continuously relatively high and stable growth in that period, running at a rate close to that recorded in 2011 Q2. GDP growth was mainly driven by expanding domestic demand, supported by, on the one hand, rising private consumption and, on the other, somewhat accelerated investment growth. Yet, as compared with the previous quarters, contribution of net exports to GDP growth rose considerably. October retail sales remained robust, while industrial output growth slowed down slightly, accompanied by a more pronounced deceleration in construction and assembly output. As suggested by business indicators, we may expect flagging economic activity in the subsequent quarters, largely as a result of the anticipated slowdown affecting Poland's major trading partners. LFS data suggest that in 2011 Q3 growth in the number of persons working in the economy was increasingly sluggish, while the unemployment rate remained at a heightened level. In October, also corporate employment continued to fall and wage growth remained moderate. Similarly, zloty-denominated mortgage lending to households continued to grow relatively steeply, while consumer lending in annual terms went on shrinking. Annual CPI inflation increased to 4.3% in October, remaining markedly above the NBP's inflation target of 2.5%. The rise in inflation was mainly driven by growing food and fuel prices, albeit core inflation eased as well. At the same time. PPI inflation stayed high, while households' inflation expectations remained elevated. In the coming months, annual CPI will persist at a heightened level, primarily due to the previous sharp rise in global commodity prices and the zloty depreciation of recent months. Waning impact of VAT rate increases and considerable rises in food and energy prices observed in the first half of 2011 will be conducive to lowering inflation at the beginning of 2012. In the opinion of the Council, in the medium term inflation will be curbed by gradually decelerating domestic demand amidst fiscal tightening, including reduced public investment spending, and interest rate increases implemented in the first half of 2011, as well as the expected global economic slowdown. The impact of the situation in the global financial markets on zloty exchange rate continues to be an upside risk to domestic price developments. In the opinion of the Council, the significant monetary policy tightening implemented in the first half of 2011 should enable inflation to return to the target in the medium term. Given the above, the Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged. The Council does not rule out the possibility of further monetary policy adjustments in the future, should the outlook for inflation returning to the target deteriorate."
Euroarea,2011-12-08,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to lower the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points, following the 25 basis point decrease on 3 November 2011. Inflation is likely to stay above 2% for several months to come, before declining to below 2%. The intensified financial market tensions are continuing to dampen economic activity in the euro area and the outlook remains subject to high uncertainty and substantial downside risks. In such an environment, cost, wage and price pressures in the euro area should remain modest over the policy-relevant horizon. At the same time, the underlying pace of monetary expansion remains moderate. Overall, it is essential for monetary policy to maintain price stability over the medium term, thereby ensuring a firm anchoring of inflation expectations in the euro area in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make its contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. In its continued efforts to support the liquidity situation of euro area banks, and following the coordinated central bank action on 30 November 2011 to provide liquidity to the global financial system, the Governing Council today also decided to adopt further non-standard measures. These measures should ensure enhanced access of the banking sector to liquidity and facilitate the functioning of the euro area money market. They are expected to support the provision of credit to households and non-financial corporations. First, to conduct two longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) with a maturity of 36 months and the option of early repayment after one year. The operations will be conducted as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment. The rate in these operations will be fixed at the average rate of the main refinancing operations over the life of the respective operation. The first operation will be allotted on 21 December 2011 and will replace the 12-month LTRO announced on 6 October 2011. Second, to increase collateral availability by reducing the rating threshold for certain asset-backed securities (ABS). In addition to the ABS that are already eligible for Eurosystem operations. ABS having a second best rating of at least “single A” in the Eurosystem harmonised credit scale at issuance, and at all times subsequently, and the underlying assets of which comprise residential mortgages and loans to small and medium-sized enterprises, will be eligible for use as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations. Moreover, national central banks will be allowed, as a temporary solution, to accept as collateral additional performing credit claims (namely bank loans) that satisfy specific eligibility criteria. The responsibility entailed in the acceptance of such credit claims will be borne by the national central bank authorising their use. These measures will take effect as soon as the relevant legal acts have been published. Third, to reduce the reserve ratio, which is currently 2%, to 1%. This will free up collateral and support money market activity. As a consequence of the full allotment policy applied in the ECB's main refinancing operations and the way banks are using this option, the system of reserve requirements is not needed to the same extent as under normal circumstances to steer money market conditions. This measure will take effect as of the maintenance period starting on 18 January 2012. Fourth, to discontinue for the time being, as of the maintenance period starting on 14 December 2011, the fine-tuning operations carried out on the last day of each maintenance period. A detailed press release will be published at 3.30 p.m. today on the ECB's website. As stated on previous occasions, all the non-standard monetary policy measures are, by construction, temporary in nature. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Real GDP in the euro area grew by 0.2% quarter on quarter in the third quarter of 2011, unchanged from the previous quarter. Evidence from survey data points to weaker economic activity in the fourth quarter of this year. A number of factors seem to be dampening the underlying growth momentum in the euro area. They include a moderation in the pace of global demand growth and unfavourable effects on overall financing conditions and on confidence resulting from ongoing tensions in euro area sovereign debt markets, as well as the process of balance sheet adjustment in the financial and non-financial sectors. At the same time, we expect euro area economic activity to recover, albeit very gradually, in the course of next year, supported by resilient global demand, very low short-term interest rates and all the measures taken to support the functioning of the financial sector. This assessment is also reflected in the December 2011 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real GDP growth in a range between 1.5% and 1.7% in 2011, between -0.4% and 1.0% in 2012 and between 0.3% and 2.3% in 2013. Compared with the September 2011 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, there is a narrowing of the range of the real GDP growth projection for 2011 and a significant downward revision of the range for 2012. These revisions mainly reflect the impact on domestic demand of weaker confidence and worsening financing conditions, stemming from the heightened uncertainty related to the sovereign debt crisis, as well as downward revisions of foreign demand. In the Governing Council's assessment, substantial downside risks to the economic outlook for the euro area exist in an environment of high uncertainty. Downside risks notably relate to a further intensification of the tensions in euro area financial markets and their potential spillover to the euro area real economy. Downside risks also relate to the global economy, which may be weaker than expected, as well as to protectionist pressures and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances. With regard to price developments, euro area annual HICP inflation was 3.0% in November, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, unchanged from the two previous months. Inflation rates have been at elevated levels since the end of last year, mainly driven by higher energy and other commodity prices. Looking ahead, they are likely to stay above 2% for several months to come, before declining to below 2%. This pattern reflects the expectation that, in an environment of weaker growth in the euro area and globally, underlying cost, wage and price pressures in the euro area should also remain modest. This assessment is also reflected in the December 2011 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation in a range between 2.6% and 2.8% for 2011, between 1.5% and 2.5% for 2012 and between 0.8% and 2.2% for 2013. Compared with the September 2011 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the projection ranges for 2011 and 2012 have been revised slightly upwards. This results from the upward impact of higher oil prices in euro terms, as well as a higher contribution from indirect taxes. The upward impact of these factors is expected to more than compensate the downward adjustments to profit margins and wage growth that are related to the downward revision of activity. The Governing Council continues to view the risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments as broadly balanced. On the upside, the main risks relate to further increases in indirect taxes and administered prices, owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years. The main downside risks relate to the impact of weaker than expected growth in the euro area and globally. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 decreased to 2.6% in October 2011, after 3.0% in September. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector, adjusted for loan sales and securitisation, increased to 3.0% in October, compared with 2.7% in September. As in the previous two months, the monetary data for October reflect the heightened uncertainty in financial markets. On the counterpart side, the annual growth rates of loans to non-financial corporations and loans to households, adjusted for loan sales and securitisation, remained broadly unchanged in October, at 2.3% and 2.5% respectively. The unadjusted growth rates were lower, owing to substantial securitisation activities in October. Overall, the figures on lending do not suggest that the heightened financial market tensions have significantly affected the supply of credit in the period to October. However, given that credit supply effects can manifest themselves with lags, close scrutiny of credit developments is warranted in the period ahead. Taking the appropriate medium-term perspective and looking through short-term volatility, overall, the underlying pace of monetary expansion remains moderate. The soundness of bank balance sheets will be a key factor in reducing potential negative feedback loop effects related to tensions in financial markets, thereby facilitating an appropriate provision of credit to the economy over time. The agreement of the European Council of 26 October to proceed with the increase in the capital position of banks to 9% of core Tier 1 by the end of June 2012 should improve the euro area banking sector's resilience over the medium term. In this respect, it is essential that national supervisors ensure that the implementation of banks' recapitalisation plans does not result in developments that are detrimental to the financing of economic activity in the euro area. To sum up, inflation is likely to stay above 2% for several months to come, before declining to below 2%. Intensified financial market tensions are continuing to dampen economic activity in the euro area and the outlook remains subject to high uncertainty and substantial downside risks. In such an environment, price, cost and wage pressures in the euro area should remain modest over the policy-relevant horizon. A cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture, with the underlying pace of monetary expansion remaining moderate. Turning to fiscal policies, all euro area governments urgently need to do their utmost to support fiscal sustainability in the euro area as a whole. A new fiscal compact, comprising a fundamental restatement of the fiscal rules together with the fiscal commitments that euro area governments have made, is the most important precondition for restoring the normal functioning of financial markets. Policy-makers need to correct excessive deficits and move to balanced budgets in the coming years by specifying and implementing the necessary adjustment measures. This will support public confidence in the soundness of policy actions and thus strengthen overall economic sentiment. To accompany fiscal consolidation, the Governing Council has repeatedly called for bold and ambitious structural reforms. Going hand in hand, fiscal consolidation and structural reforms would strengthen confidence, growth prospects and job creation. Key reforms should be immediately carried out to help the euro area countries to improve competitiveness, increase the flexibility of their economies and enhance their longer-term growth potential. Labour market reforms should focus on removing rigidities and enhancing wage flexibility. Product market reforms should focus on fully opening up markets to increased competition."
South Korea,2011-12-08,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.25% for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 3.25% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information, the Committee considers major advanced economies to have exhibited continued sluggishness and growth in emerging market economies to have slowed somewhat. Going forward the Committee expects the pace of global economic recovery to be very moderate, and judges that downside risks to growth are high, due mostly to the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and to the possibilities of the slumps in major country economies and the unrest in international financial markets continuing. In Korea, exports have shown a steady increase, but consumption has remained at a level similar to that in the previous month and facilities investment has decreased sharply. The trend of improvement in employment conditions has been sustained, led by the private sector. The Committee anticipates that the domestic economy will not deviate significantly from its long-term trend of growth going forward, but recognizes the situation to be one in which downside risks to growth remain high due to the impact of external risk factors. Consumer price inflation exceeded 4% in November, owing mainly to increases in prices of industrial products, and core inflation rose compared to the previous month as well. In the coming months, factors including the declines in agricultural product prices and the base effect from the previous year will work to stabilize prices, but the Committee expects the pace of decline in the inflation rate to be moderate given factors such as the public utility charge hikes and ongoing high inflation expectations. As for housing prices, those in Seoul and its surrounding areas appeared to weaken, while those in the rest of the country kept up their rising trend. The rate of increase in leasehold deposits meanwhile slowed greatly in Seoul and its surrounding areas, but remained high in the rest of the country. In the financial markets, stock prices and the exchange rate continued to fluctuate widely as unease concerning external risk factors persisted, and long-term market interest rates declined as in the previous month. Looking ahead, the Committee, while closely monitoring financial and economic risk factors both at home and abroad, will conduct monetary policy so as to firmly anchor the basis for price stability amid continuing sound growth of the economy."
Chile,2011-12-13,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 13 December 2011 Monetary Policy Meeting  December 2011* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 5.25% (annual). Internationally, the advanced economies are growing at a slow pace. Consensus forecasts for growth in the Eurozone and other regions have been revised downward, but for the United States. they have not changed. Despite recent announcements, the uncertainty persists about the resolution of the situation in European economies, whose fiscal and financial risks are still very high. Global financial conditions remain tight. Domestically, economic activity has evolved somewhat below projections, while domestic demand is still strong. Labor market conditions continue to be tight. Financial conditions are somewhat more constrained, reflecting the situation in global markets. Headline inflation has exceeded expectations somewhat, due to the incidence of fuels and foodstuffs. Core inflation figures remain contained. Inflation expectations are close to the target. Over the course of the past few months, the external scenario has become more adverse than previously projected, which will likely have consequences over growth and inflation in Chile, as well as for the orientation of monetary policy. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. * The Spanish original prevails."
United States,2011-12-13,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in November suggests that the economy has been expanding moderately, notwithstanding some apparent slowing in global growth. While indicators point to some improvement in overall labor market conditions, the unemployment rate remains elevated. Household spending has continued to advance, but business fixed investment appears to be increasing less rapidly and the housing sector remains depressed. Inflation has moderated since earlier in the year, and longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee continues to expect a moderate pace of economic growth over coming quarters and consequently anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only gradually toward levels that the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate. Strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook. The Committee also anticipates that inflation will settle, over coming quarters, at levels at or below those consistent with the Committee's dual mandate. However, the Committee will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with the dual mandate, the Committee decided today to continue its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities as announced in September. The Committee is maintaining its existing policies of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate. The Committee also decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013. The Committee will continue to assess the economic outlook in light of incoming information and is prepared to employ its tools to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Elizabeth A Duke; Richard W Fisher; Narayana Kocherlakota; Charles I Plosser; Sarah Bloom Raskin; Daniel K Tarullo; and Janet L Yellen. Voting against the action was Charles L Evans, who supported additional policy accommodation at this time."
Peru,2011-12-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR DECEMBER 2011 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 4.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference at 4.25 percent. This decision takes into account the lower growth being recorded by some components of expenditure, the current international financial risks, and the rise of inflation associated mainly with temporary supply factors. Future adjustments in the reference interest rate will depend on the evolution of inflation and its determinants. Inflation in November continued to be affected by transitory supply factors and recorded a monthly rate of 0.43 percent and an annual rate of 4.64 percent. Core inflation, which has also been influenced by the rise in food prices, registered a monthly rate of 0.29 percent and a rate of 3.73 percent in the last 12 months. Inflation excluding food and energy showed a rate of 0.14 percent and accumulated an annual rate of 2.48 percent. Inflation is expected to return to the target range in 2012 once these supply factors subside. The survey on macroeconomic indicators shows that expectations of inflation in 2012 are within the inflation target range. Some current and advanced indicators of activity show that growth in the economy is moderating and registering lower rates than the ones observed in the first semester. Thus, even though sales of electricity maintained a strong dynamism in November registering a growth rate of 8.0 percent, this rate is lower than the growth rate of 9.6 percent observed in the first semester. Furthermore, indicators of global economic activity show lower growth rates and that uncertainty persists in international financial markets. The Board continues to oversee the projection of inflation and its determinants and stands ready to adopt future adjustments in monetary policy instruments on a prompt and timely basis. The Board also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as described below: Overnight deposits: 3.45 percent. Direct repo and rediscount operations: 5.05 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.05 percent. The Monetary Program for January 2012 will be approved on the Board's session of January 12, 2012."
India,2011-12-16,"Mid Quarter Monetary Policy Review: December 2011 Monetary Measures On the basis of the current macroeconomic assessment, it has been decided to: keep the cash reserve ratio (CRR) unchanged at 6 per cent; and keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 8.5 per cent. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF will remain unchanged at 7.5 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate at 9.5 per cent. Introduction Since the Reserve Bank's Second Quarter Review (SQR) of October 25, 2011, the global economic outlook has worsened significantly. The recent European Union (EU) summit agreement did not assuage negative market sentiments, thereby increasing the likelihood of persistent financial turbulence as well as a recession in Europe. Both factors pose threats to emerging market economies (EMEs), including India. Significantly, despite these developments, crude oil prices remain elevated. On the domestic front, growth is clearly decelerating. This reflects the combined impact of several factors: the uncertain global environment, the cumulative impact of past monetary policy tightening and domestic policy uncertainties. Both inflation and inflation expectations are currently above the comfort level of the Reserve Bank. However, reassuringly, inflationary pressures are expected to abate in the coming months despite high crude oil prices and rupee depreciation. The growth deceleration is contributing to a decline in inflation momentum, which is also being helped by softening food inflation. Global Economy The global economic situation continues to be fragile with no credible solution as yet to the immediate euro area sovereign debt problem. At the EU summit on December 8-9, the European leaders agreed on a new fiscal compact, involving stronger coordination of economic policies to strengthen fiscal discipline. While the agreement is necessary for medium and long-term sustainability of the euro area, its ability to resolve short-term funding pressures was questioned by markets. Q3 euro area growth, at 0.8 per cent, was anaemic and 2012 growth is now expected to be weaker than earlier projected. Reflecting these projections, the European Central Bank (ECB) cut its policy rate twice in the last two months, and also implemented some non-standard measures. By contrast, growth in the US in Q3 of 2011 was better than in Q2, although still substantially below trend.2 Growth in EMEs is also moderating on account of sluggish growth in advanced economies and the impact of monetary tightening to contain inflation. In view of the slowing down of their economies. Brazil. Indonesia. Israel and Thailand cut their policy rates, while China cut its reserve requirements. EME currencies have also come under varying degrees of downward pressure as a result of global risk aversion and financial stress emanating from the euro area. Domestic economy Growth GDP growth moderated to 6.9 per cent in Q2 of 2011-12 from 7.7 per cent in Q1 and 8.8 per cent in the corresponding quarter a year ago. The deceleration in economic activity in Q2 was mainly on account of a sharp moderation in industrial growth. On the expenditure side, investment showed a significant slowdown. Overall, during the first half (April-September) of 2011-12. GDP growth slowed down to 7.3 per cent from 8.6 per cent last year. Industrial performance has further deteriorated as reflected in the decline of the index of industrial production (IIP) by 5.1 per cent, y-o-y, in October 2011. This was mainly due to contraction in manufacturing and mining activities. The contraction was particularly sharp in capital goods with a y-o-y decline of 25.5 per cent, reinforcing the investment decline story emerging from the GDP numbers. Other indicators also suggest a similar tendency, though by no means as dramatic as the IIP. The HSBC purchasing managers' index (PMI) for manufacturing suggested further moderation in growth in November 2011. However. PMI-services index recovered in November from contractionary levels in the preceding two months. Corporate margins in Q2 of 2011-12 moderated significantly as compared with their levels in Q1. The decline in margins was largely on account of higher input and interest costs. Pricing power is evidently declining. On the food front, the progress of sowing under major rabi crops so far has been satisfactory, with area sown under foodgrains and pulses so far being broadly comparable with that of last year. Inflation On a y-o-y basis, headline WPI inflation moderated to 9.1 per cent in November from 9.7 per cent in October, driven largely by decline in primary food articles inflation. Fuel group inflation went up marginally. Notably, non-food manufactured products inflation remains elevated, actually increasing to 7.9 per cent in November from 7.6 per cent in October, reflecting rising input costs. The new combined (rural and urban) consumer price index (base: 2010=100) rose further to 114.2 in October from 113.1 in September. Inflation in terms of other consumer price indices was in the range of 9.4 to 9.7 per cent in October 2011. Reassuringly, headline momentum indicators, such as the seasonally adjusted month-on-month and 3-month moving average rolling quarterly inflation rate, show continuing signs of moderation. External sector Merchandise exports growth decelerated sharply to an average of 13.6 per cent y-o-y in October-November from an average of 40.6 per cent in the first half of 2011-12. However, as imports moderated less than exports, the trade deficit widened, putting pressure on the current account. This, combined with rebalancing of global portfolios by foreign institutional investors and the tendency of exporters to defer repatriating their export earnings, has led to significant pressure on the rupee. As on December 15, 2011, the rupee had depreciated by about 17 per cent against the US dollar over its level on August 5, 2011, the day on which the US debt3 downgrade happened. In the face of this, several measures were taken to attract inflows. Limits on investment in government and corporate debt instruments by foreign investors were increased. The ceilings on interest rates payable on non‐resident deposits were raised. The all‐in‐cost ceiling for external commercial borrowings was increased. Further, a series of administrative measures that discourage speculative behaviour were also initiated. The Reserve Bank is closely monitoring the developments in the external sector and it will respond to the evolving situation as appropriate. Fiscal Situation The central government's key deficit indicators worsened during 2011-12 (April-October), primarily on account of a decline in revenue receipts and increase in expenditure, particularly subsidies. The fiscal deficit at 74.4 per cent of the budgeted estimate in the first seven months of 2011-12 was significantly higher than 42.6 per cent in the corresponding period last year (about 61.2 per cent if adjusted for more than budgeted spectrum proceeds received last year). The likely slippage in this year's fiscal deficit has inflationary implications. Money. Credit and Liquidity Conditions The y-o-y money supply (M ) growth moderated from 17.2 per cent at the 3 beginning of the financial year to 16.3 per cent on December 2, 2011, although still higher than the projected trajectory of 15.5 per cent for the year. Y-o-y non-food credit growth at 17.5 per cent on December 02, 2011, however, was below the indicative projection of 18 per cent. Consistent with the stance of monetary policy, liquidity conditions have remained in deficit during this fiscal year. However, the deficit increased significantly beginning the second week of November 2011. The average borrowings under the daily LAF increased to around 89,000 crore during November-December (up to December 15, 2011) from around 49,000 crore during April-October 2011. The Reserve Bank conducted open market operations (OMOs) on three occasions in November-December 2011 for an amount aggregating about 24,000 crore to ease liquidity conditions. There are currently no significant signs of stress in the money market. The overnight call money rate is stable around the policy repo rate and liquidity facilities such as marginal standing facility (MSF) remain unutilised. However, in view of the fact that borrowings from the LAF are persistently above the Reserve Bank's comfort zone, further OMOs will be conducted as and when seen to be appropriate. Outlook Global growth for 2011 and 2012 is now expected to be lower than earlier anticipated. Increased strains in financial markets on the back of growing concerns over euro area sovereign debt, limited monetary and fiscal policy manoeuvrability, high unemployment rates, weak housing markets and elevated oil prices are all contributory factors. These factors have also contributed to moderating growth in the EMEs. As a consequence of all-round slower growth, inflation has also started declining, both in advanced countries and EMEs. On the domestic front, agricultural prospects look promising on the back of expected record kharif output and satisfactory progress on rabi sowing. However, industrial activity is moderating, driven by deceleration in investment, which is a matter of serious concern. Overall, the growth momentum in the economy is clearly moderating. Further, considering the global and domestic macroeconomic situation, the downside risks to the Reserve Bank's growth projection, as set out in the SQR,4 have increased significantly. Between the First Quarter Review (FQR) and the SQR, while non-oil commodity prices had declined significantly, the rupee too had depreciated sharply. Consequently, the headline inflation projection at 7 per cent for March 2012, as set out in the FQR, was retained in the SQR. With moderation in food inflation in November 2011 and expected moderation in aggregate demand and hence in non- food manufactured products inflation, the inflation projection for March 2012 is retained at 7 per cent. The Reserve Bank will make a formal numerical assessment of its growth and inflation projections for 2011-12 in the third quarter review of January 2012. Guidance While inflation remains on its projected trajectory, downside risks to growth have clearly increased. The guidance given in the SQR was that, based on the projected inflation trajectory, further rate hikes might not be warranted. In view of the moderating growth momentum and higher downside risks to growth, this guidance is being reiterated. From this point on, monetary policy actions are likely to reverse the cycle, responding to the risks to growth. However, it must be emphasised that inflation risks remain high and inflation could quickly recur as a result of both supply and demand forces. Also, the rupee remains under stress. The timing and magnitude of further actions will depend on a continuing assessment of how these factors shape up in the months ahead.

Hungary,2011-12-20,"At its meeting on 20 December, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to raise the central bank base rate by 50 basis points from 6.50% to 7.00%, with effect from 21 December 2011. The Monetary Council also reviewed the December issue of the MNB's Quarterly Report on Inflation prepared by Bank staff. In the Council's judgement, the Hungarian economy is likely to be stagnant next year, with growth expected to resume in 2013. The level of output will remain below its potential over the entire forecast period. The consumer price index may increasingly reflect the disinflationary impact of weak domestic demand as the effects of the indirect tax increases and the exchange rate depreciation wane. The outlook for inflation and growth and the recent increase in perceptions of the risks associated with the economy made it necessary to raise interest rates. Inflation can be brought back to 3% by early 2013 by maintaining a tight monetary policy. The increases in VAT and excise duties are likely to raise the consumer price index significantly in 2012. Fiscal compensation will cushion the effect of the minimum wage increase on companies' labour costs and therefore it is unlikely to cause considerable inflationary pressure. However, the depreciation of the forint in recent months, reflecting the increase in perceptions of the risks associated with the economy, has led to a deterioration in the inflation outlook. The Monetary Council is closely monitoring developments in tax-adjusted core inflation, in addition to movements in the consumer price index. In the Council's judgement, the outlook for Hungarian economic growth is unfavourable. The slowdown in global growth, contractionary fiscal policies aimed at preserving the sustainability of public debts in Europe and the vulnerability of the financial system point to a weak outlook for activity in Hungary's export markets, which in turn may dampen export growth. The euro-area debt crisis has made it more expensive for Hungarian banks to roll over their external funding. In the current uncertain economic environment, the weaker outlook for growth and tighter credit conditions are acting as a drag on investment activity. As a result, corporate investment may fall in 2012, which will be only partly offset by a couple of large individual investment projects in manufacturing. The Monetary Council welcomes the agreement between the Government and the Banking Association, which is likely to reduce the burden on foreign currency debtors and thereby strengthen bank lending activity. The process of balance sheet adjustment by households is likely to be protracted, reflecting the effects of the weak exchange rate. Given the uncertain prospects for income growth and the indirect tax increases, consumption is likely to remain persistently low. The Government's measures to ensure that the target for next year's budget deficit is met are also likely to act as a significant brake on domestic demand growth, but may help reduce perceptions of the risks associated with Hungary. Perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy have increased recently, due to the escalating euro-area sovereign debt crisis, the increasing risks faced by the European banking sector, the deteriorating outlook for global growth and domestic factors. Higher risk premia and increased financing risks are limiting the potential growth of the economy. In view of the significant uncertainty surrounding the outlook for global and domestic growth and financial markets, the Monetary Council considers it important that an agreement between the Government, the European Union and the International Monetary Fund is reached as soon as possible, in order to reduce financing risks. Monetary policy can best support the recovery by ensuring a predictable economic environment, maintaining price stability and preserving the stability of the financial system. The recent depreciation of the forint has led to a deterioration in the inflation outlook and increased the vulnerability of the domestic financial system. The Monetary Council decided to raise the base rate by 50 basis points in view of increased perceptions of the risks associated with the economy and upside risks to inflation. If risk perceptions and the outlook for inflation deteriorate significantly further, it may prove necessary to raise interest rates again."
Czech Republic,2011-12-21,"Press conference of the CNB Bank Board 8th Situation Report on Economic and Monetary Developments 21 December 2011 The monetary policy decision taken and the ratio of the votes cast At the close of the meeting the Board decided unanimously to leave the two-week repo rate unchanged at 0.75%. Reasons for the decision According to the existing forecast, monetary-policy relevant inflation will be slightly below the target in 2012 and 2013. Headline inflation will rise temporarily to just below 3% in 2012 owing to a VAT increase, but will fall back below the target at the start of 2013. Consistent with the forecast is a slight decline in market interest rates at the start of the forecast and flat rates until late 2012/early 2013. The risks to the forecast for inflation and interest rates are slightly on the upside compared to the baseline scenario of the existing forecast. The risks to the forecast for GDP and the exchange rate are tilted towards the alternative scenario as foreign developments have moved towards the materialisation of this alternative. In line with the forecast, the y-o-y growth was driven solely by net exports. October industrial production (1.7% y-o-y; 0.1% m-o-m, s.a.) indicates slowing economic growth. Total employment increased in y-o-y terms in 2011 Q3 (by 0.3%). The seasonally adjusted ILO unemployment rate fell in q-o-q terms (to 6.6%, s.a.). The decline in the seasonally adjusted registered unemployment rate came to a halt in Q4. Y-o-y average nominal wage growth in the business sector decelerated slightly in 2011 Q3 (to 2.7%); in the public sector it accelerated to 1.1%. Y-o-y growth in industrial producer prices remained broadly flat at relatively high levels (5.6%) in November, reflecting only gradually fading effects of the recent surge in global commodity prices.

Georgia,2011-12-21,"21.12.11 NBG Lowers Its Policy Rate By 25 Basis Points The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on December 21, 2011 and decided to lower its Main Policy Rate (the refinancing rate) by 25 basis points to 6.75 percent. Annual inflation fell even further in November, dropping to 1.9 percent. Core inflation (net of food and energy) is low as well, amounting to 0.4 percent. In the third quarter of this year the real growth of the economy reached 7.5%. Nevertheless, the output gap is still negative, indicating that this growth in aggregate demand does not bear inflationary risks. In the fourth quarter the growth of bank loans to the economy has decreased, indicating the weakening of the domestic demand. Given that the current trends indicate the weakening of the demand the inflation forecast had been revised downwards. According to the existing forecasts, inflation is expected to remain low in the first half of the next year. Starting in summer 2012 the moderate increase in the inflation rate is expected, although given the unchanged policy stance, the inflation rate will remain below the target. Hence the Monetary Policy Committee of the NBG considered it appropriate to continue easing the monetary policy and decided to decrease the policy rate by 25 basis points. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on January 18, 2012."
Turkiye,2011-12-22,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels: a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) at 5.75 percent, b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 5 percent, lending rate at 12.5 percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 12 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, lending rate at 15.5 percent. Data on the third quarter of the year confirms that the rebalancing between the domestic and external demand is ongoing as envisaged. Consumption demand is decelerating and the contribution of net external demand to growth is increasing. Accordingly, the improvement in the current account balance is becoming more pronounced. The Committee has noted that inflation will increase in December due to the base effects from unprocessed food prices. The Central Bank delivered a strong tightening in October in order to prevent the potential second round effects of a 2011 year-end inflation that will exceed the target significantly. Although recent data releases suggest that the economic activity is stronger than expected, domestic demand is expected to follow a moderate path due to monetary tightening. In fact, the slowdown in the consumer loan growth is becoming more pronounced. Therefore, the Committee expects second round effects of the temporary price movements to remain contained and inflation to fall gradually throughout 2012, converging to 5 percent target during the final months of the year. The Committee has indicated that tight monetary policy should be maintained for a while in order to keep inflation outlook consistent with the medium term targets. However, given the prevailing uncertainties regarding global economy, it would be appropriate to preserve the flexibility of monetary policy. Therefore, the impact of the measures undertaken on credit, domestic demand, and inflation expectations will be monitored closely and the amount of Turkish lira funding via one-week repo auctions will be timely adjusted on either direction, if needed. Moreover, the Committee has determined the main components of the “Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy in 2012” document, to be published on Tuesday 27th of December. In line with the strategy formulated at the interim meeting of August 4, 2011, the Committee will continue to monitor global developments closely and take the needed measures promptly to maintain the stability in the domestic financial markets. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Russia,2011-12-23,"The Bank of Russia External and Public Relations Department informs that on 23 December 2011 the Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia decided to reduce starting from 26 December 2011 the refinancing rate and interest rates on certain lending standing facilities by 0.25 percentage points and to raise interest rates on the Bank of Russia deposit standing facilities by 0.25 percentage points (table “Interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations”). The said decision was made considering the assessment of inflation risks and risks to the sustainability of economic growth, including those associated with the global economic uncertainty. Narrowing of the gap between interest rates on the Bank of Russia liquidity providing and absorbing operations is neutral in terms of monetary policy stance. It should contribute to restraining money market rates volatility and strengthening of the interest rate channel of monetary policy transmission to inflation. In the past month inflation rate retained its downward tendency and as of 19 December 2011 reached 6.4% over year ago (6.8% in November). Considering the planned deferment of an increase in regulated prices and tariffs until the middle of 2012 the Bank of Russia expects inflation to fall significantly early next year. However, in making monetary policy decisions it will take into account the temporality of this effect and rely on medium-term inflation forecasts. The tightening of monetary conditions since September resulting from the transition to the shortage of liquidity in the banking sector should support the achievement of next year's inflation target. The dynamics of the main macroeconomic indicators in November showed persistent firmness of consumption beside the moderate production growth figures. Industrial production growth rates remained rather low alongside a somewhat weaker growth of investment in production capacity. Meanwhile, the rate of unemployment declined and the growth rate of real wages and retail sales was still high. Considering recent domestic and international macroeconomic developments the Bank of Russia judged that the current level of money market interest rates within the interest rate corridor was appropriate to balance the inflationary risks and the risks of economic growth slowdown. The Bank of Russia will continue to monitor money market conditions and external economic developments, and to assess the risks and consequences of an increase in market interest rates. The next meeting of the Board of Directors on monetary policy issues is planned to be held in the first decade of February 2012. Interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations(% p.a.).

Israel,2011-12-26,"26.12.2011</tr> The Bank of Israel leaves the interest rate for January 2012 unchanged at 2.75 percent To view this press release as aWORD file - Click here Background conditions Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) declined by 0.1 percent in November, in contrast with forecasts, which had predicted an increase of 0.1 percent. The unexpected change was due mainly to the fall in the housing component. The rate of inflation over the past 12 months, as measured by the change in the CPI, continued to settle more firmly within the target range (1-3 percent per year), and is now 2.6 percent. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: One year forward inflation expectations as calculated from the capital markets rose at the beginning of the month to almost 2 percent. Inflation expectations (break-even inflation) for the medium term increased slightly, and those for the long term declined, and both are currently 2.5 percent. Forecasters' inflation predictions for the next twelve CPI readings average 2.2 percent, compared with 2.3 percent last month. Expectations of the Bank of Israel interest rate one year from now, based on the Telbor (Tel Aviv Inter-Bank Offered Rate) market, dropped to 2.35 percent from 2.7 percent in the previous month, and the average of forecasters' predictions of the interest rate in one year's time declined to 2.3 percent, from 2.8 percent last month. About half of theforecasters expect the Bank of Israel to leave the interest rate for January 2012 unchanged, and half expect the Bank to cut the rate by 0.25 percentage points. Real economic activity: Economic indicators that became available this month show a continued slowdown in the rate of growth. The rate of increase of domestic demand slowed, and is close to the long-term trend. Exports, however, remain low, and in light of the reduced forecasts of world trade are not expected to return to the high rates of increase evident till the first quarter of 2011. In the third quarter of 2011 the current account of the balance of payments recorded a surplus of $0.6 billion, in essence the result of a decline in imports and in nonresidents' income from their investments in Israel. Direct tax revenues were 6 percent lower in November, in real terms, than in November 2010, while indirect tax revenues were 6 percent higher, in real terms, than in November 2010. The Composite State-of-the-Economy Index rose in November by 0.2 percent, indicating continuedexpansion of economic activity, but at a slower pace than in the third quarter. The most notable item in the index was the high-tech component of manufacturing production, which increased by 4.6 percent. The consumer confidence indices and the trends survey reflect a high degree of uncertainty and pessimism with regard to the level of activity in the future. The labor market: Labor market data indicate a high level of employment and a low unemployment rate. According to the CBS Labor Force Survey for the third quarter, the unemployment rate remained virtually unchanged at 5.6 percent, the rate of participation in the labor force was steadyat 57.4 percent, and the rate of employment was stable at 54.2 percent. Inthe third quarter the number of employed persons increased in most industries in the business sector, while the number in the public sector fell. The number of full-time employees increased, and the number of part-time employees declined. The nominal wage increased by 0.8 percent in July-September compared with the previous three months, and the real wage increased by 0.4 percent. Health tax receipts, which provide an indication of wage payments, were 5.5 percent higher in November in nominal terms than in November 2010 (excluding the effect of legislative changes). The Bank of Israel Research Department staff forecast: The basic forecast of the Bank of Israel Research Department was updated this month, and the forecast of inflation in 2012 now stands at 2.1 percent, and that of the interest rate in the last quarter of 2012 is 2.2 percent. GDP growth in 2011 is expected to be 4.8 percent. The growth forecast for 2012 wasrevised downwards, to 2.8 percent, compared with the previous forecast of 3.2 percent. The forecast was lowered due to the slowdown reflected in published data on Israel's economy, mainly National Accounts figures for the third quarter, and to the expectation of a global slowdown, against the background of the debt crises in Europe and their implications. Budget data: Government domestic revenues for the year to November (inclusive) were 2.7 percent lower than the seasonal path of the budget forecast, primarily due to a continued slowdown in indirect tax receipts, which began in April. The overall government deficit (excluding net credit) in the year to date was NIS 15.1 billion, compared with a deficit of NIS 17.1 billion in the corresponding period in 2010. Government activity so far indicates that tax revenues will be about 2 percent lower than the budget forecast, and the budget deficit for the year 2011 will be above the deficit ceiling set by law of 3 percent of GDP. The foreign exchange market: From the previous monetary policy discussion held on November 27, to December 23, the exchange rate of the shekel against the dollar was almost unchanged (the shekel appreciated by 0.1 percent against the dollar), in contrast with most major currencies thatstrengthened against the dollar; the shekel appreciated by 1.9 percent against the euro. In terms of the nominal effective exchange rate the shekel strengthened by about 0.6 percent. The capital and money markets: From the previous monetary policy discussion held on November 27, to December 23, the Tel Aviv 25 Index rose by 7.3 percent, similar to stock market indices in advanced and emerging economies. In the government bond market rates declined along the entire curve. Yields on unindexed government bonds dropped by 15-25 basis points (b.p.) along the entire curve, and yields on indexed bonds also declined by 15-25 b.p. for medium maturities (5-10 years), and fell more moderately, by 5-15 b.p., for short and long maturities. The yield gap between Israeli 10-year government bonds and equivalent 10-year US Treasury securities narrowed to about 258 b.p., from 280 b.p. in the previous month. Makam yields decreased by 12-27 b.p. along the entire curve, and the yield for one year decreased from 2.68 percent to 2.56 percent, this against the background of expectations of further cuts in the interest rate by the Bank of Israel and despite the continued exit of nonresidents from makam. Withdrawals from mutual funds specializing in corporate bonds continued this month, although at a slower pace than in the previous month. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spread fell this month to 198 b.p. from 215 b.p. last month. The Tel-Bond 20 Index rose by 0.2 percent, and the Tel-Bond 40 Index by 0.3 percent. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in November, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 2 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 10.4 percent. Developments in the credit markets: The balance of outstanding debt of the business sector decreased in October by 1.7 percent, to NIS 767 billion. Outstanding credit to households declined by 0.2 percent, to NIS 360 billion. Of the credit to households, the balance of outstanding housing credit increased by 9.77 percent in the twelve months to October, to NIS 256 billion, compared with an increase of 11.3 percent in the twelve months to September. Housing credit advanced in the twelve months to November was 3.6 percent lower than that advanced in the twelve months to October, continuing the decline from the peak level in May. The share of unindexed floating rate mortgages granted in November was 26.6 percent. Interest rates on mortgages of all types remained basically unchanged. The housing market: Housing prices (rental rates), which are included in the CPI, declined by 0.7 percent in November. In the twelve months to November they increased by 5.5 percent, compared with an increase of 6.3 percent in the twelve months to October; according to the updated Research Department forecast, in the next twelve months they are expected to increase by about 4 percent. Home prices, which are published in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of home prices but are not included in the CPI,declined in September-October by 0.9 percent, the second decline in succession. These decreases in home prices came after a long period of price increases that started in December 2008. This month too the annual rateof increase in home prices moderated: in the twelve months to October homeprices increased at a rate of 8.6 percent, compared with a rate of 10.5 percent in the twelve months to September, and rates of increase of about 20 percent in 2010. Activity in the construction industry continues to be strong. There were 43,058 building starts in the twelve months to September, and the number of completions was 33,583, slightly lower than the numbers in the previous month. The number of homes available for sale continued to increase, andin September-November was on average 11.5 percent higher than in the three preceding months (original data). The moderation in the rate on increase of home prices comes against the background of the continued increase in the number of building starts, the lagged effect of the increase in the interest rate, measures introducedby the Bank of Israel affecting mortgages, and steps taken by the Ministryof Finance in real estate taxation. The effect of these moves is expected to continue and be evident going forward. The global economy: Most data on economic activity in Europe are consistent with assessments that a recession will start in the eurozoneduring 2012. In contrast. US data continue to indicate an improvement in the economic situation. The European Central Bank (ECB) assesses that eurozone growth will be 0.3 percent in 2012, and 1.3 percent in 2013. The investment houses are more pessimistic, and predict negative growth of 0.7 percentin 2012, and global growth of 2.9 percent, compared with the previous forecast of 3.2 percent. The rating agencies warned about a possible downgrading of the rating of core European countries, including Germany. Signs of a slowdown in growth are evident also in several leading emerging countries, and forecasts for next year have been revised down. Moody's downgraded Belgium's sovereign credit rating, and three rating agencies downgraded the ratings of many banks, mainly in Europe and the US. Central banks around the world are taking steps to increase liquidity. The ECB announced that it wouldsupply unlimited loans (collateralized) to banks for periods of up to three years. The Fed and five other central banks announced coordinated measures to reduce the interest rate in their dollar swap lines. Eurozone inflation is expected to be 2.7 percent in 2011, and 2 percent in 2012. The ECB lowered its interest rate by 0.25 percentage points for the second successive month, to 1 percent. Central banks in other countries also cut their interest rates, against the background of the global economic situation. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to leave the interest rate unchanged at 2.75 percent for January 2012 following the cut in the rate last month is consistent with the interest rate policy that is intended to entrench the inflation rate within the price stability target of 1-3 percent inflation a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financialstability. The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel, the global economy, the monetary policies of major central banks, and developments in the exchange rate of the shekel. Inflation forecasts for the next twelve months--those calculated from the capital market, those of the forecasters and that of the Bank of Israel--are all close to the midpoint of the target inflation range. Actual inflation over the last twelve months is continuing to settle more firmly within the target inflation range. Indicators of economic activity in Israel continue to support the assessment that the economy is still expanding, although more slowly than at the beginning of the year and during last year. According to Bank of Israel assessments, the economy is expected to grow in 2012 at a rate of 2.8 percent. Most of the slowdown in growth derives from the weakness of exports, against the background of the weakness in the global economy; a moderation in domestic demand is also evident. Against thebackground of measures taken by the ECB this month, financial markets around the world improved somewhat. In the US, economic data continue to indicate an improvement in the economic situation. Data on economic activity in Europe, however, support the assessment that a recession is likely to start in the eurozone in the course of 2012. Several leading emerging countries are also showing signs of a slowdown in growth. Uncertainty regarding developments in the global economy remains high, and this impacts on the level ofuncertainty regarding economic developments in Israel. The persistent negative trends in Europe led to another cut in the ECB interest rate, following the cut last month. The ECB also took steps to increase liquidityin the banks significantly. Other countries also cut their interest rates. The markets are not pricing in an increase in the interest rate in the coming year in any of the central banks of the large advanced economies. The Fed, it will be recalled, declared that its interest rate will remain at a near-zero level till mid-2013 at least. The Fed continues with its quantitative easing measures. The Bank of Israel emphasizes that the current level of the interest rate helps to support the level of domestic economic activity and exports,and to keep inflation within the target range, and at the same time leavesthe Bank room to react to developments in the global and domestic economy. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in Israel'seconomy and the global economy and in the financial markets. The Bank willuse the tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stabilityof the financial system, including keeping a close watch on developments in the asset markets. The minutes of the discussions prior to the above interest ratedecision will be published on January 9, 2012. The decision regarding the interest rate for February 2012 willbe published at 17:30 on Monday.
