Peru,2003-01-06,"BANCO CENTRAL DE RESERVA DEL PERU Press release MONETARY PROGRAM APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF THE BANK FOR JANUARY 2003 The Board of the Bank approved to reduce the effective interest rate for monetary regulation credits and operations of temporary direct purchase of titles values from 4,50 to 4,25 percent, remaining the effective interest rate for overnight deposits in domestic currency held by banks at the Central Bank at 3,0 percent. For this month the projected range for the banks' current account balance held at the Central Bank will be 170 million to 190 million on a daily average basis, considering the lower liquidity requirements that seasonally is observed in the months of January. The interest rate for the credits of monetary regulation and operations of temporary direct purchase of titles values will be equal to the interest rate of the interbank market when this last one surpasses 4,25 percent. The decisions of monetary policy are oriented to obtain an annual accumulated inflation rate of 2,5 percent, with a rank of tolerance of one percentage point upwards and downwards. In the 2002 the rate of inflation was of 1,52 percent, placed in the inferior margin of the Central BankÂ´s target. For the 2003, the result of economic surveys applied to reveal a rate of expected inflation of 2 percent and a depreciation of the exchange rate of 3 percent. Until October 2002, the annual growth of the GDP and domestic demand has reached at 4,7 and 3,9 percent, respectively. For the 2003 favorable perspective remain on the evolution of the economic activity, in an environment of low inflation. Thus, the economic surveys applied to consultant foresees show a expected growth of the GDP of 3,5 percent in 2003. In the short term, the main source of inflationary risk is the rise of the international price of petroleum, the one that increased 15 percent in December in a volatile external context. Nevertheless, while this rise does not affect the rest of internal prices, it would not be required to take any offsetting action of monetary policy. The interest rates for the operations in US dollars of the Central Bank are: Credits of monetary regulation: one-month Libor interest rate plus one percentage point. Overnight deposits: rate equivalent to the average rate that the Central Bank obtains abroad for same type of deposits The chronogram of the sessions in which the Board will approve the Monthly Monetary Program is the following: February 6th March 6th April 3rd May 8th June 5th July 3rd August 7th September 4th October 2nd November 6th December 4th The Central Bank will issue its Inflation Report in the following dates: January 31st May 30th August 29th."
Euroarea,2003-01-09,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I will report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB, which was also attended by the President of the ECOFIN Council. Mr. Christodoulakis, and Commissioner Solbes. We have reviewed monetary, financial and economic developments and updated our assessment in light of the new information available. Overall, we consider that the outlook for price stability in the medium term has not changed since our decision of 5 December to reduce the key ECB interest rates. We judge the current monetary policy stance appropriate to maintain a favourable outlook for price stability in the medium term. As regards the analysis under the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 was 7.1% for the period from September to November 2002, unchanged from the period from August to October 2002. A strong preference of investors for liquid and secure assets, in an environment of continued financial market, economic and geopolitical uncertainty, remains a major driving force behind the strong monetary dynamics. Furthermore, the low level of interest rates prevailing in the euro area makes the holding of monetary assets relatively attractive. As a result of the pace of monetary growth, liquidity in the euro area is ample. However, at the current juncture, given that the portfolio shifts due to economic and financial uncertainty may be a temporary phenomenon, and in light of the sluggish economic growth, the excess liquidity is deemed unlikely to translate into inflationary pressures. The continued decline in the growth of loans to the private sector up to November 2002 supports this assessment. Turning to the second pillar, the outlook for economic activity in the euro area has remained broadly unchanged. As recently published survey data indicate, economic growth is likely to have remained subdued at the end of last year. For 2003, a gradual increase in real GDP growth rates to levels close to potential later in the year remains the main scenario, provided that the factors currently contributing to the general climate of uncertainty gradually unwind. Although some stabilisation in financial markets has been observed over the past couple of months, investors continue to perceive a high level of uncertainty. At the same time, there are still risks relating to a disorderly adjustment of the past accumulation of macroeconomic imbalances, especially outside the euro area. In addition, geopolitical tensions continue to weigh adversely on confidence. Indeed, the increase in oil prices over the past few weeks  besides being influenced by temporary supply constraints  reflects the risk of more acute tensions in oil markets in the future, which, in turn, would have a negative impact on the prospects for economic activity worldwide. There are still, therefore, downside risks to the outlook for economic activity in the euro area, although the current low level of interest rates should help to counterbalance these. Turning to price developments, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 2.2% in December 2002, unchanged from November 2002. Due to the increase in oil prices, some renewed upward pressure on consumer prices is likely to have emerged around the turn of the year, and this pressure may have been reinforced by effects stemming from various increases in indirect taxes and administered prices which became effective at the beginning of 2003. At the same time, base effects  relating mainly to unprocessed food prices but, in part, also originating from past increases in services prices  will help to reduce annual HICP inflation figures in early 2003. Furthermore, the direct effects of the recent appreciation of the exchange rate of the euro on import prices and their gradual passthrough to the euro area economy should contribute to dampening consumer price inflation. The current subdued pace of economic growth should also contain inflationary pressures. While the significant risks surrounding oil price developments make any short-term prediction difficult at this stage, the most likely outcome remains that inflation will stabilise in the course of 2003 at a level below 2%. A major condition for this outlook for inflation to materialise will be moderate wage developments. Reflecting the rigidities prevailing in euro area labour markets, wage growth remained on an upward trend until early 2002, despite the weakening of economic activity. Furthermore, it would help to improve the prospects for economic and employment growth. An important contribution to strengthening growth prospects in the euro area should also come from fiscal and structural policies. Determined reform efforts are needed in these policy areas to increase incentives for investment and employment creation in the euro area. Regarding fiscal policy, countries with remaining fiscal imbalances have committed themselves to implement consolidation plans in order to reach budgetary positions close to balance or in surplus in the medium term. As part of this process, governments should put emphasis on growth-oriented consolidation policies that strengthen the productive forces of the economy. Such policies are likely to be most effective when integrated into a comprehensive reform strategy based on structural retrenchment in spending. The fiscal policy framework, as laid down in the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact, provides a sound basis for limiting the risk of fiscal imbalances occurring. At the same time, it preserves an appropriate medium-term orientation for fiscal policy, based on realistic assumptions regarding economic developments. The Governing Council supports the steps taken by the Commission to preserve the functioning of the framework, including the implementation of excessive deficit procedures and the issuing of early warnings, where required. Turning to structural reforms, it is essential that governments intensify their efforts to expand the euro area's potential for non-inflationary growth and to reduce its high level of unemployment. The need for further progress in this field is particularly evident in a phase when the euro area economy has to adapt to a sequence of adverse shocks. Indeed, such reforms, which should aim to reduce rigidities in labour and goods markets, could significantly enhance the degree of resilience of economic activity to such shocks, both in the euro area as a whole and in its regions. Renewed momentum in the process of structural reform will be important to foster confidence among consumers and investors in long-term growth and employment opportunities in the euro area. This, in turn, should also have a positive effect on spending and investment decisions in the short and medium term."
South Korea,2003-01-09,"Despite the slowdown of private consumption, the economic upswing has continued steadily, as evidenced by strong industrial production and exports. Consumer price inflation accelerated in December mainly owing to a sharp rise in agricultural product prices and increases in public and private service charges. Core inflation, however, stayed within its annual target range last year. Real estate prices remained stable following on from the previous month. Domestic and overseas uncertainties weakened financial markets sentiment in December, as was demonstrated by the decline of both stock prices and long-term interest rates. Fund-raising conditions for the corporate sector, however, remained favorable. Meanwhile, banks' expansion of household credit slowed down, following its slower growth in the preceding month. In the external environment, international oil prices have risen sharply due to the heightened possibility of a war between the U.S, and Iraq, and the tension over North Korea's nuclear program has been growing. Taking these into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark overnight call rate at its current level for the inter-meeting period. Inflation Target in 2003. In consultation with the government, the inflation target for the year 2003 has been set at 3Â±1 percent, based on the annual rate of increase in core inflation*. * Consumer Price Index after stripping out non-cereal agricultural products and petroleum-based products. The medium-term inflation target has been set as a range from 2.5 to 3.5 percent."
Philippines,2003-01-15,"Following its meeting today, the Monetary Boardâthe policy-making body of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP)âvoted to keep the BSP's policy rates unchanged at 7.0 percent for the overnight borrowing rate and 9.25 percent for the overnight lending rate. The BSP's policy rates were last changed on 15 March 2002, when they were reduced by 50 basis points. Members of the Monetary Board continue to expect manageable price conditions over the policy horizon, given generally muted demand-side pressures and expected transient cost-side risks to future inflation. Average annual inflation is expected to move broadly in line with the government's targets for 2003 and 2004. Nevertheless, the continuing presence of cost-side inflationary risks, including those coming from movements in food and oil prices as well as user charges, require a cautious monetary policy stance going forward. At the same time, the greater risk of weaker global economic activity combined with the heightened risk of geopolitical events as well as the mixed signals regarding the strength of the domestic economic recovery suggest that ensuring appropriate liquidity conditions remains central to sustained economic recovery. In its latest assessment of the outlook for inflation and economic activity, the Monetary Board believes that the current monetary policy settings are compatible with the liquidity requirements of the economy. Encouragingly, there are indications that past monetary stimulus is showing signs of exerting its impact on the real sector of the economy. Loans outstanding of commercial banks have been on the rise in the past three months, ending with a 1.4 percent year-on-year increase in November. Although overall loan activity growth remains modest, the available evidence suggests a possible sustained rise in credit demand, which should lead to more vigorous consumption and investment activities. In the light of such considerations, the overall assessment for future inflation and output supports continued caution on the part of monetary authorities, with greater recognition of the lags in monetary policy in order to gain a firmer indication of the extent to which monetary impulses have translated into stronger real sector activity. The Monetary Board is scheduled to meet again to re-examine the BSP's monetary policy settings on 13 February 2003."
Thailand,2003-01-20,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 20 January 2003 Mr. Bandid Nijathaworn. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand announced that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance going forward. The main issues discussed were as follows: 1. The MPC reviewed the latest data on economic conditions in Thailand and deemed that economic growth in the first 11 months of 2002 was satisfactory, with continued expansion in production, consumer spending, investment, and export supporting the recovery. The pickup in growth in 2002 was driven by fiscal policies aimed at boosting domestic spending, improvements in the external environment over the previous year, and the easing of financial constraints on firms and households, especially from lower interest rates. In addition, domestic spending was buoyed by improvements in business and consumer confidence as well as higher farm income. External stability remained strong with international reserves at a high level, the current account in surplus, and foreign debt on a downward trend. The baht/US dollar exchange rate fluctuated in line with market conditions and trends in regional currencies. The pickup in economic activity had not exerted upward pressure on prices. Headline inflation rose to 16 percent year-on-year in December 2002, reflecting higher oil prices, while core inflation edged up slightly to 03 percent. Higher oil and food prices during the last quarter of 2002 contributed to average headline and core inflation rates for 2002 of 07 and 04 percent, respectively. The MPC expected core inflation to remain low and within the target range of 0-35 percent over the next 8 quarters, facilitating the maintenance of the accommodative monetary stance going forward. 4. Overall the MPC assessed that the economic recovery was progressing well and that the pickup in growth should extend into 2003. Key factors supporting growth in 2003 were expected to include an improvement in the world economy, especially in the latter half of the year, the accommodative monetary policy stance, and a stable macroeconomic environment underpinned by core inflation within the target range. Nevertheless possible repercussions on the Thai economy of a war between the US and Iraq continued to generate uncertainties in the near future which warranted continued close monitoring. The MPC therefore decided to maintain the 14-day repurchase rate 175 per cent per annum. Bank of Thailand 20 January 2003."
Israel,2003-01-27,"The Bank of Israel's Monetary Program for February 2003. The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for February 2003, according to which the interest ratewill remain unchanged at 8.9 percent. In recent weeks uncertainty has increased, as is reflected by the capital markets and the foreign-exchange market. Inflation expectations for one year ahead derived from the capital market again rose above the upper limit of the inflation target set by the government. Expectations derived from the capital market for the second year ahead and beyond also rose, and remained above the price stability level. Private forecasters' predictions also edged up a little, but remained within the inflation target range. The models developed by the Bank of Israel indicate a possibility that the target will be achieved, conditional on calm prevailing in the foreign-exchange market. It is noteworthy that assessments of future inflation rose despite a decline in actual inflation and the slow rate of price increases, 0.2 percent, in the second half of 2002 (down from 6.3 percent in the first half). The overall picture is one clouded by uncertainty deriving from uncertainty about political stability, concern regarding the effect on economic stability of war against Iraq, and doubts related to the budget for 2003. All these elements come on top of the background conditions that have persisted for more than two years: the intifada and the continued global recession. The 2003 budget which was passed by the Knesset is based on an over-estimate of receipts, which is likely to bereflected in a larger-than-planned deficit. In order to prevent this, a substantial revision of the budget will have to be undertaken by the new government after the election. Investors' doubts regarding the government's ability to maintain fiscal discipline, uncertainty as to the size of the deficit in 2003, and increased borrowing by the government to finance the deficit were expressed in the capital market by a rise in yields on Shaharand Galil bonds, which reached 11.4 percent and 5.8 percent respectively, similar to their levels in June 2002. The new government will have to adhere to fiscal discipline by taking significant measures to cut current expenditure in 2003 and to reduce its rate of increase in the next few years such that it will be consistent with the downward path of budget deficits until 2007 and of the government debt/GDP ratio. This policy is essential to ensure the availability of credit and the reduction of long-term interest on government bonds, and hence the reduction of interest on credit for investments and mortgages that is vital to encourage renewed growth and to boost employment. Beyond the measures approved regarding the 2003 budget, the new government will have to decide to implement a budget policy that will re-establish the credibility of the markets and bolster financial stability. Thecontinued reduction of the short-term interest rate without undermining stability largely depends on public confidence in fiscal discipline that is also essential for strengthening the financial system. The level of uncertainty in the foreign-exchange market rose again in the last few weeks, with the intensification of the main elements that have a negative effect on the markets: a loosening of fiscal discipline and concern about a deterioration in the security situation. In the last few months the implied volatility of NIS/dollar options issued by the Bank of Israel: which measures the riskthat the market imputes to the domestic exchange rate: has risen, and is now higher than it was in June 2002. The risk premium ascribed to Israel by international markets also remained at a high level. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the market, in order to bolster financial stabilityand ensure that the rate of inflation is maintained within the range of between 1 percent and 3 percent a year defined as price stability, which becomes the effective target from 2003 onwards. Subject to these conditions, the Bank will act to support policy aimed at fostering employment and shortening the recession. Changes in NIS and dollar interest rates. ISRAEL.

Poland,2003-01-29,"Warsaw, 29 January 2003 INFORMATION FROM A MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL, held on 28-29 January 2003 On 28-29 January the Monetary Policy Council held a meeting. The Council read materials prepared by NBP Management Board and its Departments and also information and analyses furnished by the Ministry of Finance, banks and research institutes. The Council then discussed the external environment of the Polish economy as well as real trends, trends in payments and social welfare benefits, matters involving the public financial sector, the money supply, loans and interest rates and the structures of pricing and inflationary expectations, as well as the expected rate of inflation. Decision of the Monetary Policy Council New economic data which emerged since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Council: a) Indicates strengthening signs of a continuing low growth rate in domestic demand: - a low salary growth rate in the industrial sector, - a further declining growth rate in construction industry proves the investment related demand to be very low, - the annual growth rate of monetary aggregates - M3 and loans - remains low, the cash growth rate has levelled off, b) Confirms that the German economy shows no signs of an upturn: optimism both by entrepreneurs and consumers' remained low for another month, economic growth forecasts have been downgraded. c) Shows that the current inflation and base inflation rate indicators have been reduced again. Factors potentially stimulating inflationary pressure include: - The level to date of interest rate cuts which, allowing for the customary time lag, will gradually stimulate growth in domestic demand in the second half of 2003 and in 2004, 2 - a probable overrun in the level of economic deficit in the public finance sector as envisaged in the draft 2003 Budget Act and uncertainty underlying fiscal policy for 2004, - high oil prices fuelled by the impending military confrontation in Iraq. The Monetary Policy Council resolved: to reduce the lombard rate from 8.75% to 8.50% p.a., to reduce the re-discount rate from 7.50% to 7.25% p.a., that the National Bank of Poland will conduct open market operations for 14-day maturities with a profitability rate of at least 6.50% p.a., that the interest rate on term deposits taken by NBP from banks will be held at 4.50% p.a. The Council confirms its neutral approach in respect of monetary policy. * * * In December 2002 inflation for the preceding twelve-month period stood at 0.8%, and fell below the short-term inflation target for 2002. This lower-than-expected inflation rate during the last several months of the year is primarily due to factors outside the domain of monetary policy. The major factors include: declining prices of foodstuffs and non-alcoholic drinks, a lower-than-expected rise in regulated prices, including a drop in alcohol and tobacco prices, a lower-than-expected global economic position. 2002 witnessed a continuing high supply in the foodstuffs and agricultural produce market stemming, amongst other causes, from good cereal, fruit and vegetable crops. These depressed the prices of foodstuffs and non-alcoholic drinks by 2.7%. Relying on the available predictions for the 2002 national budget and pronouncements from bodies responsible for price regulation, a higher increase in excise duties and a curtailment of at least a portion of the lower VAT rates to date. This was attributable to a need to adjust indirect tax rates to those prevailing in the European Union. Consequently, an expectation of at least a 5% increase in regulated prices in 2002 would have been justified, whereas in reality it only reached 2.7%. This lower increase in prices in this group of goods and services was largely due to falling alcohol prices (3.1%) in the wake of the recently-reduced excise duty on spirits. If it had been assumed that foodstuff, alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks prices would grow at around the 2001 rate, the goods and services growth indicator in 2002 would have approached ca. 2.5%. In December 2002 the base inflation rate computed after exclusion of food and fuel prices was only 2%. The considerable decline in the global economic situation contributed to the lessening of inflationary pressures via lower-than-expected growth in domestic demand and more favourable prices for numerous raw materials and imported goods. 3 The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Council is scheduled for 25-26 February 2003. 4 I Assessment of the economic situation In November and December 2002 indicators anticipating the status of the US economy were markedly better than in the euro zone. American Improved expectations entrepreneurs' optimism was discernibly higher (the NAPM index rose in in the USA December to 54.7 in comparison with 49.2 in November); the orders portfolio in the processing industry expanded rapidly. In December American consumer-confidence weakened somewhat in comparison to November after information about employment figures was published. However, the high growth in US retail sales (4.6% compared to 2.7% in November) indicates that growth in individual consumption remains the chief growth factor in the American economy. By contrast, in the euro zone, the last two months of 2002 Sharp deterioration of demonstrated a clear downturn, as shown by the majority of economic consumer-confidence indicators. The industrial/economic activity index (PMI) dipped from 49.5 in the euro zone in November to 48.4 in December. German industry failed to report improvement; the IFO Institute indicator, best reflecting the mood of German companies rose only slightly - from 87.3 in December to 87.4 in January. Despite the Christmas shopping season, most West European economies (most notably those of Germany and Italy) suffered a sharp decline in consumer optimism (the index shows German consumer confidence declining from 11 in October to 17 in November and to 20 in December 2002). Evidence of the deteriorating confidence amongst German consumers is borne out by a fall in retail sales by almost 6%in November 2002, whereas in October the decline stood at a negligible 0.1%. Global oil prices continue to be a big question mark. A general strike in Venezuela and the already commonly-shared perception of the Oil prices rise again inevitability of a war with Iraq once again sent oil prices up in December 2002. On 20 December the price of oil reached USD 30 a barrel and levelled off. Thus, the average price of oil, month on month, was the highest in December 2002. Compared to December 2001 it rose by nearly USD 10 a barrel i.e. by nearly 50%. Venezuela's continued general strike, which has paralysed the country since early December, has reduced the global oil supply by over 2 million barrels a day. This is compounded by the market's anguished concern about the likelihood of continued supply of oil from the Persian Gulf. A war with Iraq may cause global oil production to shrink by another 2.5m. barrels a day (the current Iraqi quota under the oil-for-food programme). Should these two crises coincide, oil prices are bound to increase. The Polish economy is showing signs of slow and gradual economic revival. During the third quarter of 2002 it grew by 1.6% and gross added In third quarter 2002 value rebounded to 1.8%. On the demand side, growth was mainly GDP grew by 1.6% stimulated by individual consumption and exports. In December 2002, the annual industrial output rose by 5.1%. Seasonally adjusted industrial production grew by 4.1% year on year. Industrial production Production growth in the most significant industrial category  the growth  further fall in 5 processing industry - reached 6.7% (seasonally adjusted growth  5.3%). construction and Construction and assembly production shrank in December by 10.4% (the assembly production decline in November being -8.6%). The November figures for the balance-of-payments confirm that a positive trend in foreign trade has been maintained. Exports are growing Good November ever faster. Exports in EUR terms rose for a third month in a row  in this results for foreign case the rise amounted to 6.1% as compared with the preceding year. Since trade the beginning of the year receipts from exports has risen by 2%. After a decline in October, imports rose again (by 3.1% in comparison with November 2001). Nevertheless, imports for the year to date were below the figures for the previous year (a fall of 3.4%). Reliable statistical data also shows a higher level of exports. Between January and October 2002, exports computed in EUR rose by 5.3%. Similarly, imports were higher than in 2001, even if their value rose at a lower rate (+2.8%). Increased exports between January and October 2002 were primarily attributable to higher sales to Russia. Norway and Sweden. In terms of the Changes in the main country groups, the most significant growth in sales was reported in geographic structure the group of countries belonging to the Commonwealth of Independent of Poland's export States - 12.1% (including a 22% increase in exports to Russia) and Central and Eastern European countries - 9.8%. Sales to European Union countries rose by 4.1%. The lower growth rate of sales to EU countries principally resulted from a fall in exports to Germany (by 0.7%). The poor results of exports to Poland's main trading partner were partly offset by a large increase in exports to France and Sweden. Analyses of economic performance by the Central Statistical Office in December 2002 indicated a break in the trend of improving respondents' Worsening economic optimism, a trend which emerged at the beginning of 2002. Seasonally situation in the adjusted data indicates that the assessment of the situation in the processing processing and in the industry, in terms of both domestic and foreign demand, sold products, construction industries inventory levels and the potential for on-going settlement of financial liabilities in December 2002 was pessimistic and bleaker than in November (although better than in December 2001). This pessimism was supported in respect of employment forecasts and was additionally reported in respect of the financial situation and the overall economic conditions. In the construction industry increasing pessimism was noteworthy in respect of the assessment of demand, production and the economic situation of construction and assembly companies. Research into trade points to the continuation of very pessimistic perceptions of the current and future standing in this sector. The most recent research into the economic situation (carried out in January) indicates that pessimism is strong amongst respondents. A slight improvement was noted in the assessment of the overall conditions of the processing industry, primarily due to better-than-expected forecasts relating to demand and production; however the assessment of the current situation by companies continues to be negative. On the other hand, the pessimistic 6 assessment of the current situation of construction and trade intensified (primarily in respect of product sales by the construction industry and trade sales figures, as well as the financial standing of companies). Forecasts for the nearest future are equally bleak. II. Situation of public sector finances Budget deficit in 2002 Government revenue in 2002 was lower than expected. Lower than below statutory levels planned receipts from indirect taxes and personal income tax were partly offset by high corporate tax receipts (CIT) and non-taxable receipts, chiefly stemming from higher NBP earnings and customs duties. Higher tax receipts, approx. +7.3%, indicate that the economic situation in 2002, especially the financial situation of Polish companies, was slightly improved. Despite a shortfall on the revenue side (PLN 1.6Bn.), the budget deficit reached PLN 39.4 Bn. (0.5% below the statutory limit) due to a reduction in expenditure to PLN 182.9 Bn., and partly to lower-than-expected costs of public debt servicing. The funding of the deficit in 2002 was different than forecast. Privatisation receipts reached PLN 2.3 Bn. instead of the planned PLN 6.6 Bn. The deficit was financed mainly by the issue of Treasury securities on the domestic market, and issues in foreign markets partly covered foreign debt repayment. Consequently, planned net sales of Treasury securities on the domestic market were exceeded in respect of both Treasury bills and bonds. Economic deficit of the public finances sector Information gathered on funds and agencies confirms that their in 2002 accounted for standing did not improve significantly compared to preceding months. A 5.5 - 5.7% of GDP rise of debt in the banking system by, amongst others, the Labour Fund, the Social Security Fund and the Agricultural Market Agency, as well as on the part of local authorities, shows that the remaining public finances sector created, in 2002, a larger deficit than in the previous year. This was larger even than the one declared at the beginning of the year. It is estimated that the economic deficit of the entire public finances sector for 2002 may reach approx. 5.5  5.7% of GDP. III. Money supply, loans, interest rates, exchange rate Money supply increase In December 2002, the M3 money supply rose by PLN2.6 Bn. in December results (0.8%) above that of November 2002. Interest rate differences (appreciation from typical year-end of the zloty against the dollar and weakening against the euro) had a rise in corporate material impact on the aggregate M3 volume. After elimination of interest deposits rate differences, monthly rise in M3 would have amounted to approx. At the same time, approx. PLN 0.6 bn. of the rise in monthly M3 is attributable to accounting practises: in December banks Decline in household b k d i t f th i fb kb d th M3 t 7 booked receipts from the issue of bank bonds as other M3 components. deposits The M3 increase in December 2002 stemmed primarily from PLN 4.4 Bn. (8.6%) higher corporate deposits, a typical phenomenon prior to the end-of year period. Household deposits (private individuals) shrank by PLN 1.8 Bn. (0.9%), of which approx. PLN 0.8 Bn. was attributable to exchange-rate differences. The shrinking household deposit base manifest since the beginning of last year was accompanied by dynamic growth in the Low growth rate of volumes ploughed into alternative forms of savings. Estimated flow of loans household funds to investment funds reached PLN 2 Bn. in December. On the money-creation side, the year-end saw another typical December phenomenon, i.e. a drop in total amounts due by PLN 1.8 Bn. (- 0.7%), caused primarily by a fall in amounts due from corporations (by PLN 3 Bn., i.e. 2.3%). Amounts due from households rose by PLN 0.3 Bn. The annual rate of growth in amounts due from households rose Zloty stronger against slightly in December 2002 to 8.5%, and the annual rate of growth of the USD, weaker corporate loans reached 1.6 %. against the euro In December 2002 the zloty continued to gain ground against the US dollar (0.9%), but depreciated 0.8% against the euro. The euro continued gaining against the dollar and rose by 1.9% during the month. Annual indicator of IV. Prices, inflationary expectations commodities and consumer services In December 2002, the twelve-month inflation rate fell again to reached 0.8%; average 0.8%. The trend was helped by the lower prices of food and non-alcoholic annual inflation rate at drinks, alcohol and tobacco, clothing and footwear. The growth rate of 1.9% prices relating to domestic consumption and furnishing was also lower than in the previous year. On the other hand, transport costs rose slightly as a result of higher fuel prices. The latter had dropped during the preceding year. At the end of 2002 the annual inflation indicator ânetâ (i.e. excluding food, non-alcoholic drinks and fuel prices from the CPI) totalled 2.0%. Other base inflation indicators at the end of 2002 fitted into a bandwidth of 0.16% (base inflation rate after the exclusion of regulated prices) to 1.2% (15% end-adjusted mean). The average annual price increase in commodities and services totalled 1.9% in 2002. The sold-products prices in December 2002 rose by 0.1% above those in the previous month. Sales value of industrial products over a twelve-month period rose by 2.2%, pushed up by rising prices in all sectors of industry. Prices rose most steeply on the part of producers in those sectors where market-force rules have not yet taken effect. Electricity, gas and water supply-sector production prices rose 6.8% (as compared to 10.8% during the previous year), and in mining and quarrying the same rose 3.4% (as compared to 2.9% during the previous year). In industrial processing, prices rose by 1.4% (as compared to a 2.6% drop during the previous year). The most significant price rises over the twelve-month period as reported in the manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products, were 20.6% higher 8 than during the previous year (when they dropped by 19.7%). Low inflationary expectations Low inflation strengthens low inflationary expectations. In January 2003 the structure of replies to questions from an Ipsos- Demoskop survey, based on which the analysis is conducted of individuals' inflationary expectations, deteriorated markedly in terms of impact on the quantification of the expected inflation rate. At the same time. January witnessed a further decline in the rate of current inflation, which neutralised the result of undesirable changes in the structure of replies to the questions of the survey. The quantification procedure of inflationary expectations justifies the conclusion that in January 2003 individuals expect a 0.7% rate of price rises this year, which implies that the same declined by 0.1 of a percentage point in comparison with the results of a survey conducted in December last year. Meanwhile, banking analysts expect the inflation rate in the month preceding the same month of next year (i.e. December 2003) to rise by 0.1 percentage point to reach 2.6%, whilst the average annual inflation rate for 2004 is estimated to be 2.7%, or 0.1 percentage point above December's forecast."
United States,2003-01-29,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate unchanged at 1-1/4 percent. Oil price premiums and other aspects of geopolitical risks have reportedly fostered continued restraint on spending and hiring by businesses. However, the Committee believes that as those risks lift, as most analysts expect, the accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with ongoing growth in productivity, will provide support to an improving economic climate over time. In these circumstances, the Committee believes that, against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are balanced with respect to the prospects for both goals for the foreseeable future.

Euroarea,2003-02-06,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I will report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. We have reviewed monetary, financial and economic developments and have incorporated new information into our assessment. Overall, the current monetary policy stance remains appropriate to preserve a favourable outlook for price stability in the medium term. Their low level should help counterbalance the negative effects on economic activity that currently stem from the high degree of worldwide uncertainty and should, thereby, contribute to a sustainable economic recovery in the course of 2003. For the time being, we still assume that the high degree of uncertainty will decline in the course of this year. However, at this juncture it is very difficult, if not impossible, to form a conclusive judgement on the impact of geopolitical developments on the world economy in general, and the euro area in particular. Turning to the analysis under the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 declined to 6.9% in the period from October to December 2002, from 7.1% in the period from September to November 2002. The continued strong monetary growth reflects an ongoing pronounced preference for liquidity in an environment of high financial, economic and geopolitical uncertainty. However, it also mirrors the low level of short-term and long-term interest rates in the euro area. Although liquidity remains ample, it is unlikely at this stage that it will give rise to inflationary pressures, given the current economic environment and the expectation that some of the portfolio shifts will be reversed once the financial market uncertainty diminishes. This assessment is also supported by the continuing moderate growth of loans to the private sector. As regards the information under the second pillar, economic activity in the euro area remained subdued around the turn of the year, as suggested by recently published data and survey information. These indications are broadly in line with previous expectations which suggest a gradual increase, starting in the second half of the year, in real GDP growth rates to levels close to potential. Whereas the appreciation of the euro over recent months may contribute to dampening export growth to some extent, the price competitiveness of euro area companies remains favourable in a medium-term perspective and export growth should benefit from the expected recovery of the world economy. Therefore, recent exchange rate movements should not fundamentally affect the main scenario for the economic outlook. At the same time, several factors contributing to the general climate of uncertainty are still in place. In particular, investors remain risk averse against the background of ongoing geopolitical tension. Further turbulence in the oil markets could have a negative impact on economic activity throughout the world and, thereby, also on euro area employment. Finally, the accumulated macroeconomic imbalances give rise to uncertainty about the strength of the recovery in other major economies. Taken together, there remain downside risks to the outlook for euro area economic activity. Considering price developments, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, annual HICP inflation decreased to 2.1% in January 2003, from 2.3% in the previous month. As usual, these estimates are subject to uncertainty and there is no precise breakdown available as yet. However, it appears that compensating factors played a role: on the one hand, there was upward pressure from the recent hike in oil prices and from various increases in indirect taxes and administered prices at the beginning of 2003; on the other hand, the strengthening of the euro and benign base effects are dampening consumer price increases. These two latter factors should also help to further reduce annual rates of HICP inflation over the next few months. However, given the high volatility in oil markets, short-term forecasts for HICP inflation are currently subject to a particularly high degree of uncertainty. Beyond the immediate future, the gradual pass-through of the appreciation of the euro, together with the expected moderate improvement in economic growth, should reduce inflationary pressures. The most likely outcome remains that inflation will fall and eventually stabilise at a level below 2% in the course of 2003. A major condition for price stability to also prevail in the medium term will be moderate wage developments. Wage moderation would also help improve the prospects for economic growth and further employment creation. It is therefore of particular importance that the upward trend in wage growth finally comes to a halt. However, the indications for this are still mixed, despite weak economic activity throughout last year. As for fiscal policy, the framework laid down in the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact limits the risk of fiscal imbalances occurring, and therefore contributes significantly to favourable financing conditions for the private sector. At the same time, it allows an appropriate medium-term orientation of fiscal policy which fosters confidence and thereby growth. In order to fully reap the benefits of this framework, it is important that countries respect its objectives and implement appropriate consolidation plans where needed. Hence, the commitments made in the stability programmes and the requests to further improve fiscal positions, as subsequently agreed in the ECOFIN Council, must be met in full. These benefits would be magnified if the underlying policy measures were part of a comprehensive reform strategy to support economic growth. It is, in fact, the implementation of structural reforms at the micro level that ultimately raises the production potential, improves flexibility in the economy and makes the euro area more resilient to external shocks. Clearly, lack of progress in structural reform is one of the key factors currently hampering a recovery in confidence. Therefore, the Governing Council welcomes a recent communication by the Commission on the implementation of the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines. It emphasises the need to step up the pace of labour market reform to achieve the Lisbon objectives, to fully implement the Internal Market and to enhance competition in product markets as well as to foster capital market integration, entrepreneurship, a knowledge-based economy, and research and development. We fully share the Commission's assessment that policy inertia and backtracking are widespread. Against this background, renewed momentum in the process of structural reform will be crucial to foster confidence among consumers and investors."
South Korea,2003-02-06,"The economic upswing seems to be continuing, as evidenced by the rapid growth of exports. The pace appears to be decelerating, however, due to weaker consumer and investor confidence. Core inflation remained stable at around the 3 per cent level in January. Consumer prices, in contrast, showed a rapid rise owing to the hikes in petroleum-based products and the increases in agricultural product prices due to seasonal factors. In the financial markets, investor sentiment has become even weaker, as demonstrated by sharp declines in both stock prices and market interest rates, mainly due to increased geopolitical risks. Banks' household lending slowed down remarkably in January, due to the effects of steps taken to reign it in and to seasonal factors. Meanwhile, uncertainty in the external environment is increasing due to the possibility of a war breaking out between the U.S, and Iraq and the tension over North Korea's nuclear program. Taking these into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark overnight call rate at its current level for the inter-meeting period."
Peru,2003-02-06,"BANCO CENTRAL DE RESERVA DEL PERU Press Release MONETARY PROGRAM APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF THE BANK FOR FEBRUARY 2003 The Board of the Bank established that in February the borrowing and lending Central Bank operations remain at: â¢ 4,25 percent: For monetary regulation credits and direct temporary purchase of BCR's papers. â¢ 3,0 percent: for overnight deposits. In February, the range for the banks' current account balance held at the Central Bank will be 170 million to 190 million. The interest rate of monetary regulation credits and direct temporary purchases of BCR's papers bills will equal to the interbank interest rate when this rate be higher than 4,25 percent. In January, the average interbank rate was 3,8 percent, similar to December and within the reference corridor (3,0 to 4,25 percent). It should be noted than when it was observed a upward trend in the interbank rate, the Bank made additional auctions of repos with BCR's papers. Monetary policy decisions are oriented to attain a 2,5 percent rate of inflation with a 1 percent point margin. In January, the rate of inflation was 0,23 percent, due to the price increase of some agriculture products and fuels (such as gas and kerosene). As a result, last 12 month rate of inflation was 2,28 percent. As of November 2002, the rates of GDP and domestic demand growth were 4,8 and 4,1 percent, respectively. For 2003, economic activity is expected to remain high and inflation low. The following interest rates will be used in foreign-currency operations: The effective annual rate for monetary regulation credits will be the 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point. For overnight deposits held by banks at the Central Bank, the rate is equivalent to the average obtained by the Central Bank for similar deposits abroad. For foreign exchange temporary purchase operations (swap operations), the commission is maintained to an implicit effective annual cost of 4,25 percent."
Philippines,2003-02-06,"In line with the inflation targeting framework for monetary policy, the Government has set the official target for average annual inflation for 2004 at 4-5 percent. The 2004 inflation target was set by the Development Budget and Coordination Committee (DBCC), an inter-agency government planning body, in coordination with the BSP. The inflation target is consistent with the Government's objective for growth in economic activity, and reflects the likely developments in the monetary, fiscal and external sectors of the economy in 2004. The inflation targeting framework is now in its second year of implementation by the BSP. Inflation targeting essentially involves the use of a formally announced inflation target set by the Government which the BSP commits to achieve over a two-year horizon. Promoting price stability is the BSP's main priority, and the target serves as an anchor or guide for the public's expectations about future inflation. In the year ahead, the BSP's assessment of the conditions influencing future price developments points to a generally subdued inflation environment. The upside risks that accompany the outlook for 2003 inflationânotably the cost-push factors such as the impact of the El NiÃ±o weather phenomenon on food prices and the impact of geopolitical factors on oil pricesâare expected to be mitigated by subdued demand-pull influences resulting from spare capacity in manufacturing, growing but still relatively subdued demand for credit, and generally soft labor market conditions. Average inflation for 2003 is thus expected to be in line with the Government's previously announced target of 4.5-5.5 percent for 2003. The BSP is fully committed to achieving the government's inflation target through appropriate adjustments in its monetary policy instruments. Over the policy horizon, the monetary stance of the BSP will continue to emphasize prudence and, as such, it will continue to monitor carefully the risks to stable prices and sustained economic activity."
Philippines,2003-02-11,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board, the policy-making body of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), decided to leave the BSP's policy rates unchanged at 7.0 percent for the overnight borrowing rate and 9.25 percent for the overnight lending rate. The BSP's policy rates have been on hold for the past 11 months, with the rates last changed on 15 March 2002 when they were reduced by 25 basis points. In assessing the inflation environment and overall macroeconomic conditions, members of the Monetary Board noted that the inflation path remained consistent with the outlook of a generally subdued inflation environment in the near term. The Monetary Board also noted that the favorable inflation outlook and the marked downtrend in domestic interest rates have contributed to the growth of overall economic activity in 2002 and helped boost domestic demand in the fourth quarter of 2002, with consumer spending expanding briskly during the quarter. In addition, bank lending activity has continued to recover, with the outstanding loans of commercial banks (KBs) growing steadily for the fourth straight month by 2.4 percent year-on-year as of end-December 2002. At the same time, however, there continue to be potential cost-push pressures on inflation arising from the likely impact of the El NiÃ±o weather disturbance on the prices of agricultural products, the expected rise in oil prices due to escalating tensions in the Middle East, and the possible increases in electricity and water rates. In addition, the prospects for the sustained growth of the domestic economy going forward are clouded by the risk of a slower-than-expected global economic recovery and uncertainties emanating from geopolitical events. Against this backdrop, the Monetary Board believes that it would be prudent to maintain current monetary policy settings and keep policy interest rates steady, while continuing to closely monitor any evidence that points to pressures on inflation. The Monetary Board is scheduled to meet again to review the BSP's monetary policy settings on 13 March 2003."
Israel,2003-02-24,"The Bank of Israel's Monetary Program for March 2003. The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for March 2003, according to which the interest rate will remain unchanged at 8.9 percent. The Bank of Israel stated that despite the slow rate of price increases in the second half of 2002 (0.2 percent), inflation expectations for a year ahead derived from the capital market rose, and are above the inflation target set by the government (1-3 percentfor 2003 and subsequently); inflation expectations derived from the capital market for two years ahead and longer have also risen, remaining above the target limit. Private forecasters' predictions are also higher, and are close to the upper limit of the target. The models developed by the Bank of Israel indicate that it is possible to attain the target of price stabilityat the current level of interest, provided the foreign-exchange market is calm. The overall picture, then, indicates a high level of uncertainty, expressed in both the capital and foreign-currency markets, arising from apprehensions regarding the implications of a possible war in Iraq and unanswered questions concerning the 2003 budget. In addition, the background conditions that have enveloped the economy for over two years-the continuation of the global depression and the Intifada, whose effects intensified in 2002-had a contractionary effect. The Bank of Israel added that it is now evident that the budget approved by the Knesset in 2003 is based on an over-estimation of tax receipts, and according to the deficit figures for the beginning of 2003 the national budget is problematic. In order to prevent further expansion of the deficit and the foreign debt it is necessary to adjust the budget forthwith. Uncertainty as regards the size of the deficitin 2003, and the increase in net government borrowing to finance it, are expressed in the 11.7 percent and 5.8 percent increases in capital market yields on Shahar and Galil bonds respectively, similar to theirlevels in June 2002 and significantly higher than the rates prevailing at the beginning of 2002. The Bank of Israel stressed that thenew government will have to adhere to fiscal discipline by introducing substantial measures intended to reduce current expenditure in 2003 and reduceits growth rate in the coming years. This will bring it into line with thegradual reduction of taxes until 2008, increase in infrastructure investment, declining budget deficit path until 2007, and reduction of the government debt/GDP ratio. This policy is a necessary condition for making credit available in the economy, maintaining Israel's credit rating in international markets, reducing the long-term interest on government bonds, and thus lowering the interest on credit for investment and mortgages which is important for reviving growth and stimulating investment. The government must alsoact to restore credibility to the markets and reinforce financial stability while implementing the budget policy described above and stressing its commitment to maintaining the central bank's independence. The Bank of Israelexplained that the continued reduction of short-term interest while maintaining stability, depends to a great extent on public confidence in budget discipline, which is also essential for strengthening the financial system. The Bank of Israel added that uncertainty in the foreign-exchange market has remained high because of the intensity of the main factors adversely affecting the markets-the relaxation of fiscal restraint and apprehensions regarding the security situation. In recent months the implied volatility of the NIS/dollar options issued by the Bank of Israel, serving as a measure of the risk attributed by the market tothe exchange rate, has risen and is now higher than it was in June 2002. The risk premium ascribed by the international markets to the Israeli economy has also remained high. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the market, in order to maintain the inflation ratedefined as price stability while bolstering financial stability. Subject to these conditions, the Bank will act to support the government's policy tofoster employment and shorten the recession. Note that the risk premium is characterized by volatility which is sometimes caused by factors related to Israel's economy, by developments in financial markets abroad and by changes in the degree of tradability in those markets. *** The Open Market Committee of the US Federal Reserve is due to convene on 18 March 2003 for its regular review of interest-rate policy.

Poland,2003-02-26,"Warsaw, 26 February 2003 INFORMATION FROM A MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL, held on 25-26 February 2003 On 25-26 February 2003 the Monetary Policy Council held a meeting. The Council read materials prepared by NBP Management Board and its Departments and also information and analyses furnished by the Ministry of Finance, banks and research institutes. The Council then discussed the external environment of the Polish economy as well as real trends, trends in payments and social welfare benefits, in the public finance sector, the money supply, loans and interest rates and the structures of pricing and inflationary expectations, as well as the anticipated rate of inflation. Decision of the Monetary Policy Council New economic data which emerged since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Council: a) Indicates. Strengthening signs of a continuing low growth rate in domestic demand: - Maintenance of a low salary growth rate in the industrial sector, - a further decline in the employment rate, - a further declining growth rate in construction, reflecting a continuing very low investment demand, - the annual growth rate of monetary aggregates  M3 and loans  remains low, the cash growth rate has levelled off, b) Confirms. That the German economy shows no signs of an upturn: both entrepreneur and consumer optimism have remained low for another month, and the economic results of German industry in January were also poor, c) Shows. That the current inflation has again been reduced, inflationary expectations of natural persons and bank analysts are lower. Factors potentially stimulating inflationary pressure include: - The level to date of interest rate cuts which, allowing for the customary time lag, will gradually stimulate growth in domestic demand in the second half of 2003 and in 2004, 2 - a probable over-run in the level of economic deficit in the public finance sector as envisaged in the draft 2003 Budget Act and uncertainty underlying the fiscal policy for 2004, - risk of escalation in oil prices fuelled by the impending military confrontation in Iraq, - steady growth in the sold industrial production index to 2.5% in January 2003, - confirmation of a tendency towards a gradual increase in industrial output in January. The Monetary Policy Council resolved: to reduce the lombard rate from 8.50% to 8.00% p.a., to reduce the re-discount rate from 7.25% to 6.75% p.a., that the National Bank of Poland will conduct open market operations for 14-day maturities with a profitability rate of at least 6.25% p.a., that the interest rate on term deposits taken by the NBP from banks will be held at 4.50% p.a. The Council confirms its neutral approach in respect of monetary policy. The Monetary Policy Council adopted âThe Monetary Policy Strategy after 2003â The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Council is scheduled for 25-26 March 2003. 3 I Assessment of the economic situation In January and February 2003, consumer and entrepreneur Deterioration in confidence in the USA and the Eurozone continued to be influenced by consumer-confidence political risk. Consumer confidence suffered the most. Both the USA and in the USA and the Europe saw a drop in household confidence indicators (in the USA, the euro zone. University of Michigan ratio dipped from 86.7 in December 2002 to 82.4 in January 2003 and the European Commission indicators for such countries as France and Great Britain fell from 17 and 6 in December 2002 to 20 and 9 in January 2003, respectively. No improvement was observed in the optimism of business circles in the USA and the euro zone. Nevertheless, as in the 4th quarter 2002. American entrepreneurs showed more optimism than their counterparts in Poor industry the Eurozone. performance in the The attitude is evidenced by poor results generated by the euro zone processing industry in the main economies of the Eurozone (for example, in December 2002, the output of the German processing industry fell by 0.5% in comparison with December 2001 in contrast to a 2.8% increase in November (year on year), similarly, there was no major improvement in the industrial orders portfolio in January). Poor demand in the production sector delays the long-awaited break- through in the negative investment growth rate in the Eurozone, which had prevailed since the second quarter 2001. Global oil prices continue to be a big question mark. In January Increase in oil prices 2003 the average price of Brent crude oil reached USD 31.3 a barrel and was 10% higher than in December 2002 and over 60% higher than in January 2002. As in January, further growth in oil prices was fuelled primarily by political factors such as a possible war with Iraq and a strike in Venezuela's oil sector, now in its third month. The likelihood of a war in the Persian Gulf results in serious concerns about continued supply of oil from the region. Thus far the political situation has not had impact on oil production levels. In January 2003 Iraqi oil continued its uninterrupted flow (at 2.5m. The Venezuela crisis gobbled up oil reserves in OECD countries in January 2003 by 90m. barrels down to 2.5bn barrels, the lowest level in five years. It was compounded by a drop in oil product reserves, in particular heating oil, as a result of the inclement cold weather conditions in Growth in industrial the north-eastern part of the USA. The low oil reserves put additional production further pressure on the increase in oil prices, which are already exposed to political fall in construction and risk. assembly production No upturn in the industrial production trends was reported for January 2003. Year to year growth in total industrial output fell from 5.1% in December 2002 to 4.2%, while the growth rate in the processing industry dropped from 6.7% in December 2002 to 4.7% in January 2003; however, the drop rather resulted from imponderables connected with severe weather 4 conditions, rather typical of this time of year, than from changes in the key factors affecting output. In January 2003, sales generated by the âelectricity, gas and water production and supplyâ industry grew by 2.6% compared to January 2002, while sales figures for the industry in the consecutive months of the second half of 2002 were not higher than their last year equivalents. Out of 29 industrial divisions, 18 reported an increase in production and 11 conceded a decline. As in the previous months, the highest production growth was observed in industries with a high and increasing share of export sales. Cold weather conditions in January contributed to a further decline in construction output. The decline again exceeded 10% compared to January 2002. Higher growth rate in trade in 4th quarter 2002 December 2002 saw another drop in the current account deficit, by EUR 50m. against December 2001. It came as a result of a growing positive balance of unclassified current account transactions, a decrease in the commodities trading deficit and an increase in the current transfer surplus; at the same time the negative balance of revenues and services increased. In comparison to December 2001, the commodities trading deficit fell by EUR 76m. in December 2002 (by 14.3% compared to December 2001) as exports growth rate exceeded imports growth rate (compared to December 2001 exports grew by 14.3% and imports by 8.6%). The total receipts from 2002 exports expressed in EUR were 2.9% higher than in 2001, whilst the value of imports payments was 2.4% lower than in 2001. The 4th quarter 2002 saw markedly accelerated growth in both exports and imports, at 7.4% and 2.7% respectively (viewed against 4th quarter 2001). Both payment statistics and tangible statistical indicate accelerated exchange at the end of 2002. Preliminary figures after the first 11 months Rise in exports to show that exports rose by 6.8% and imports by 3.7% compared to the same developed countries period of 2001. Since the beginning of 2002 the strongest increase in sales has been reported in machinery and transportation equipment. The trend continued in the 4th quarter 2002. At that time, high growth rate of exports in this group stemmed primarily from increased sale of car parts, ships (mainly as part of ship overhaul services) and passenger cars (where an almost 18 month downward trend in the value of exports was finally halted). Slightly better assessment of The upturn in exports observed in 4th quarter was fuelled by economic situation continued growth in sales to the developed countries, in particular to European Union member states. Italy and Great Britain. Likewise, high exports rate to France remained stable. By contrast, exports to Germany suffered a decline. Like in the 3rd quarter 2002 there was a considerable slowdown in the growth in exports to the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States. 5 According to a Central Statistical Office survey of a sample of six thousand enterprises conducted at the end of January 2003, the general Stronger confidence of economic situation is not deemed to be good. The same is borne out by entrepreneurs from negative values of the indicators measuring various aspects of the economic the processing industry situation (including domestic and foreign demand, orders portfolio, goods sold, output level and the potential for settlement of financial liabilities, payment delays). However, it should be emphasised that the prevalence of negative opinions over positive ones is declining, especially in the industrial processing section. The trend is manifest when compared to January 2002 and in some cases, also with January 2001 (e.g. the assessment of the financial situation in the processing industry and in trade and the assessment of demand in the processing industry and the volume of goods sold in the commercial sector). The forecasts for the next three months indicate that negative indicators continue primarily in the construction industry and in trade, although the same are less negative than in the same month of last year. On the other hand optimistic forecasts for the future prevail amongst entrepreneurs from the industrial processing sector (with indicators turning positive). In particular, the prospects for demand for this sector's products are deemed to be extremely favourable, and in January the indicator Good condition of the climbed to one of the highest levels in two years. According to this group state budget in of respondents, foreign demand should recover. On the other hand, foreign January 2003 demand-related forecasts are volatile and change from month to month, which is understandable in view of the current political situation around the world. Entrepreneurs of all industrial sectors share the opinion that downward trends in prices and employment will continue in the nearest future. II. Situation of public sector finances In January 2003, the State budget was in a better condition than in January 2001. In addition to tax and non-tax revenues climbing highly above the previous years' levels, expenditures were lower as well. In consequence, the budget deficit remained PLN 2.8 Bn below the January Economic deficit of the 2002 level at PLN 3.36 Bn. public finances sector Both receipts from indirect faxes (115.9%) and corporate income in 2003 higher than taxes (145.3%) showed a very high annual growth. These categories of forecasted by the budget receipts are the most susceptible to economic conditions and their Monetary Fund increase, when compared to the same period of 2002, is partially due to the economic improvement. The continuing low growth of receipts from natural persons (102.6%) reflects the employment market conditions. Rise in non-taxable receipts may be attributable to the additional receipts from the restructuring fee. The state budget expenditures incurred in January 2003 remained below the level of the previous years and reached PLN 15.7 Bn, i.e. by 8.7% below their total for January 2002. The plan was followed in 8.1%, which is considerably below the percentage reported in the past two years. Drop in money supply 6 The estimated economic deficit of the whole public finances sector in January should amount to about 5.2% of GDP, constituting a slight diminution when viewed against the previous year's figure. III. Money supply, loans, interest rates, exchange rate In January 2003, the M3 money supply fell by PLN 3.7 Bn (1.1%) below that of December 2002. The annual growth rate of the M3 aggregate amounted to 1.4% in January 2003. Such a low growth rate of M3 comes as statistical outcome of shifts in the deposit structures caused by the introduction of the interest income tax in November 2001. The drop in the M3 aggregate in January 2002 was mainly caused by the decrease in deposits from enterprises by PLN 2.6 Bn (4.7%), which is a normal January action on the part of enterprises. Compared to the January drops in previous years, this year's drop was definitely smaller, as was the decrease in the amount of cash in circulation (by PLN 0.6 Bn  1.3%). Decrease in cash, a Low growth rate of January standard, was not as strong as such decreases in previous years. loans The annual cash growth rate remains at about 14%, as it has been for the past five months. Household deposits typically grow in January in consequence of seasonal payment of additional fees and salaries, but in the current year dropped by PLN 0.9 Bn (0.5%). The annual growth rate of household deposits included in the M3 aggregate declined to 5.5% and to High volatility of zloty about 1% including deposits with maturity dates of over 2 years. exchange rates in On the money-creation side, the annual growth rate of the amounts January due from households has remained stable at about 8.% for six months (and 8.7% in January 2003) in parallel to the continuously low annual growth rate of the amounts due from corporations at 1% (1.1% in January). In January 2003, the zloty showed high volatility. A slight appreciative trend prevailed in the first half of the month, supported by investors' expectations with regard to the interest-rate reduction, only to decline in the second half of January. General deterioration of market conditions and a drop in the zloty exchange rate at that time was affected by the currency interventions by the Bank of Hungary in order to weaken the forint. Uncertainty on the currency market and the increasing volatility of the Polish currency were additionally undermined by verbal interventions made by the Ministry of Finance aimed at weakening the zloty. The annual consumer price index at 0,4% IV. Prices, inflationary expectations In January 2003, prices of consumer commodities and services grew by 0.4% (against 0.1% in December 2002 and 0.8% one year ago). For 12 months, growth in consumer prices deteriorated further to 0.4% in consequence of decrease in the price of food and non-alcoholic drinks (by 3.5 percentage point at the annual level), alcohol and tobacco (by 3.4 7 percentage point) as well as a drop in the prices of clothes and footwear (by 1.4 percentage point). On the other hand, prices increased in transportation (by 5.7 percentage points) primarily as a result of a considerable increase in fuel prices and in the cost of residential flats and the consumption of Production prices in primary sources of power (by 3.9 percentage points) throughout the year. January at 2,5% Due to annual changes in the weighting system (weightings adapted to the household expenditures structure of the preceding year), the presented CPI figures for January 2003 should be regarded as provisional. The announcement made on CPI for January by the Main Statistical Office comprises no specific price indexes, either. In consequence, base inflation indicators cannot be calculated. A twelve-month sold-product price growth ratio for industry increased by 2.5%. Prices rose most steeply on the part of producers in those sectors where market forces have not yet taken effect. Electricity, gas and water supply-sector production prices rose 6.4% and in mining and quarrying the same rose by 3.2%. In industrial processing, prices grew by 1.9%. January was the fifth subsequent month of deteriorating prices in the construction and assembly production. The reported drop was equal to 0.6% compared to December 2002 and to 0.4 % over the twelve-month period. In February 2003 the structure of replies to questions from an Ipsos- Demoskop survey, based on which the analysis is conducted of individuals' inflationary expectations, improved slightly in terms of the impact on the quantification of the expected inflation rate. At the same time. February witnessed a further decline in the current rate of inflation. Owing to these two factors, the quantified measure of inflationary expectations of individuals declined in comparison with the replies of a survey conducted in January 2003, reaching a level of 0.6%. Meanwhile, the inflation rate expected by banking analysts in the month preceding the same month of next year (i.e. December 2003) fell by 0.3 percentage points to reach 2.3%, whilst the average annual inflation rate for 2004 is estimated to be 2.5%, or 0.2 percentage point below January's forecast. The expected 2003 year-end inflation rate was 2.3%."
Thailand,2003-03-03,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 3 March 2003 Mr. Bandid Nijathaworn. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand announced that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance going forward. The main issues discussed were as follows: 1. The MPC reviewed the latest data on economic conditions in Thailand and deemed that the economy continued to grow satisfactorily in January 2003. Economic activity was buoyed by further expansion in production, consumer spending, as well as improvements in both consumer and business confidence, while export was not hampered by external uncertainties. However domestic investment, especially in machinery and equipment, began to moderate. External stability remained strong with international reserves at a high level, the current account in surplus, and foreign debt on a downward trend. The baht appreciated with respect to the US dollar but remained in line with other regional currencies. The economic recovery thus far had not generated significant upward pressure on prices. Headline inflation fell slightly from 22 per cent in January 2003 to 19 per cent in February as a pickup in agricultural production helped to lower food prices, while core inflation moderated to 03 per cent from 04 per cent in January. Core inflation was expected to remain within the target range over the next 8 quarters. The MPC agreed that the main risks to the Thai economy in the near term emanated from external uncertainties, in particular with respect to economic growth in the industrialized countries, higher oil prices, and increased volatility in financial markets. Nevertheless the momentum of the economic recovery continued to support the Thai economy, while the overall economic environment remained stable facilitating the maintenance of an accommodative monetary policy stance going forward. The MPC decided to maintain the 14-day repurchase rate at 175 per cent per annum. Bank of Thailand 3 March 2003."
Euroarea,2003-03-06,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I will report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. We have comprehensively reviewed monetary, financial and economic developments today. We concluded that the outlook for price stability over the medium term has improved in recent months, owing in particular to the subdued pace of economic growth and the appreciation of the exchange rate of the euro. As a result, the Governing Council has decided to lower the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. Let me explain our assessment of recent economic developments in more detail. As regards the analysis under the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 was 7.1% in the period from November 2002 to January 2003, compared with 6.9% in the period from October to December 2002. The continued strong monetary growth reflects an ongoing pronounced preference for liquidity in an environment of high financial, economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Although liquidity remains ample, it is not expected at this stage to give rise to inflationary pressures, given the current economic context and the expectation that some of the portfolio shifts will be reversed once the financial market uncertainty diminishes. Recent data on loans to the private sector, notably the weak growth in loans to non-financial corporations in late 2002, confirm this assessment. Turning to the analysis under the second pillar, available data and surveys indicate that economic activity in the euro area remained sluggish in late 2002 and in the first months of 2003. In light of recent developments, the outlook for economic growth in the euro area in 2003 has weakened compared with previous expectations, owing especially to the geopolitical tensions and the associated rise in oil prices. Accordingly, only a very modest rate of economic growth should now be expected this year. Considering price developments, according to Eurostat, annual HICP inflation is estimated to have been 2.3% in February 2003, slightly up from 2.2% in January. The main factor behind this change seems to be the rise in oil prices. In addition, some base effects related to food prices may have contributed to the renewed increase in annual inflation in February. The ongoing volatility in oil markets makes it difficult to forecast short-term inflation developments. However, once some normalisation in these markets has occurred, more fundamental factors should dominate price developments. First, the significant appreciation of the nominal effective exchange rate of the euro over the past year is expected to continue to feed through the economy into consumer prices, via import and producer prices. Second, the moderate pace of economic growth should also reduce inflationary pressures, influencing price and cost-setting behaviours. If oil prices moderate in the future, as currently expected by markets, the most likely outcome will be that inflation rates will fall below 2% in the course of 2003 and remain clearly at levels in line with price stability thereafter. This baseline scenario relies on the assumption that, especially in an environment of subdued economic growth, wage moderation will prevail. In fact, some recent indications suggest more modest wage developments towards the end of last year, but this picture would need to be confirmed in the future. Overall. ECB key interest rates have reached levels which are very low. On the basis of the currently available information, this policy stance, while contributing to the preservation of price stability over the medium term, provides some counterbalance to the various factors which are currently having an adverse effect on economic activity. Looking ahead, the most likely scenario is that economic growth will gradually recover once the factors contributing to the high economic uncertainty have diminished. While the expected weak economic activity at the beginning of this year will imply low average economic growth in 2003, a rise in quarterly growth rates should materialise in the course of the year. Over time, the euro area economy should benefit from a global economic recovery and the prevailing low levels of interest rates, as well as from falling inflation supporting real disposable income and underpinning private consumption growth. However, any judgement on future developments is overshadowed at present by the geopolitical tensions and their potential resolution. Depending on further developments, the Governing Council stands ready to act decisively and in a timely manner. The prospects for the euro area economy will depend very much on measures taken in other policy areas. As for fiscal policy, adherence of all countries to the framework laid down in the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact will support stable and sustainable public finances, and will thereby contribute significantly both to confidence and to favourable financing conditions for the private sector. In most cases, the fiscal policy stance implicit in the updated stability programmes strikes a reasonable balance between letting automatic stabilisers operate and seeking further consolidation where needed. In order to further boost confidence in the fiscal framework and the economic environment, it is essential that appropriate consolidation plans are implemented in all countries with remaining imbalances. Hence, the commitments made in the stability programmes and the requests to further improve fiscal positions, as subsequently agreed in the ECOFIN Council, must be implemented in full. In this respect, the measures should be part of a comprehensive and growth-oriented strategy, which for most countries means putting the focus on both restraining the volume, and reforming the structure, of public expenditure. Finally, the outlook for the euro area economy could be significantly improved if governments strengthen their efforts to implement structural reforms in labour and product markets. Such reforms are important to ultimately raise the euro area's production potential, improve the flexibility of the economy, and make the euro area more resilient to external shocks. In particular at the current juncture, when economic activity is subdued, taking measures to make the euro area a more attractive place to invest in can contribute substantially to fostering confidence."
South Korea,2003-03-06,"The Korean economy has continued to slow down, due to contracting private consumption and flagging business investment. The current account shifted into the red last December, and the trade balance registered a deficit for two months in a row this year. Core inflation remains stable at around the 3 per cent level. However, consumer prices rose sharply, driven by the higher crude oil prices. Investor sentiment in the financial markets seems to remain weak, judging from the continuous declines in stock prices and long-term interest rates. On the other hand, credit conditions for the corporate sector are assessed to have been favorable, and roll-overs of household lending proceeded smoothly. In the external environment, growing geopolitical risks reduced the prospect of early recovery of the world economy. Taking these into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark overnight call rate at its current level for the inter-meeting period."
Peru,2003-03-06,"BANCO CENTRAL DE RESERVA DEL PERU Press Release MONETARY PROGRAM APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF THE BANK FOR MARCH 2003 In February, the rate of inflation was 0,47 percent, mainly due to the increase in some non-storable foodstuff due to supply delays as well as the increase in the international oil price. Last 12 month rate of inflation in February reached 2,8 percent. Core inflation, the component that excludes high variability items from the CPI basket, was 0,08 percent in February and 1,7 percent in the last 12 month. In the short term, the main inflationary risk is the increase in the international price of oil. As long as this increase does not affect neither the other prices nor inflationary expectations, the Central Bank will not take any compensatory action. Monetary policy decisions are oriented to attain a 2,5 percent rate of inflation with a 1 percent point margin. The Board of the Bank established that in March the borrowing and lending Central Bank operations remain at: â¢ 4,25 percent: For monetary regulation credits and direct temporary purchase of BCR's papers. â¢ 3,0 percent: for overnight deposits. The interest rate of monetary regulation credits and direct temporary purchases of BCR's securities will equal to the interbank interest rate when this rate be higher than 4,25 percent. In February, the interbank interest rate was 3,8 percent, similar to January. For March, the estimated range for the banks' current account balance held at the Central Bank will is 170 million to 190 million on a daily basis. The following interest rates will be used in foreign-currency operations: â¢ The effective annual rate for monetary regulation credits will be the 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point. â¢ For overnight deposits held by banks at the Central Bank, the rate is equivalent to the average obtained by the Central Bank for similar deposits abroad. For foreign exchange temporary purchase operations (swap operations), the commission is maintained to an implicit effective annual cost of 4,25 percent."
Philippines,2003-03-12,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board, the policy-making body of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), decided to leave the BSP's policy rates unchanged at 7.0 percent for the overnight borrowing rate and 9.25 percent for the overnight lending rate. The BSP's policy rates have been on hold for the past 12 months, with the rates last changed on 15 March 2002 when they were reduced by 25 basis points. In assessing the inflation environment and overall macroeconomic conditions, members of the Monetary Board noted that continuing evidence of a generally subdued inflation environment going forward underlies expectations that average inflation in 2003 will be broadly in line with the government's full-year target of 4.55.5 percent. Recent movements in headline inflation have been linked mainly to food and fuel, which suggest that supply-side factors play a major role in current price movements. The present demand conditions remain consistent with a benign inflation setting in the near term due to the relative absence of broad-based price changes across commodity groups. Prospective risks to inflation likewise relate mainly to cost-push influences, such as those arising from the impact on farm prices of the El NiÃ±o phenomenon and the escalation in world oil prices due to geopolitical developments. Such risks are for the most part expected to be temporary. The Monetary Board also noted that the overall strength of aggregate demand, while improving, remains tentative. Labor market conditions remain soft and capacity utilization in the manufacturing sector is still below normal levels. These indicators suggest that previous monetary easing should still be allowed to work its way through the real sector. The lack of clear-cut signs of a sustained upturn in domestic demand is complicated by indications of weaker economic activity overseas, implying continued sluggishness in external demand. Given the foregoing considerations, the Monetary Board believes that it would be prudent to maintain current monetary policy settings and keep policy interest rates steady, while continuing to closely monitor any evidence that points to pressures on inflation. The Monetary Board also expressed concern over the recent movements of the exchange rate and its willingness in the future to resort to monetary tightening measures should the depreciation of the peso threaten the inflation target. The Monetary Board is scheduled to meet again to review the BSP's monetary policy settings on 10 April 2003."
United States,2003-03-18,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate unchanged at 1-1/4 percent. While incoming economic data since the January meeting have been mixed, recent labor market indicators have proven disappointing. However, the hesitancy of the economic expansion appears to owe importantly to oil price premiums and other aspects of geopolitical uncertainties. The Committee believes that as those uncertainties lift, as most analysts expect, the accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with ongoing growth in productivity, will provide support to economic activity sufficient to engender an improving economic climate over time. In light of the unusually large uncertainties clouding the geopolitical situation in the short run and their apparent effects on economic decisionmaking, the Committee does not believe it can usefully characterize the current balance of risks with respect to the prospects for its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth. Rather, the Committee decided to refrain from making that determination until some of those uncertainties abate. In the current circumstances, heightened surveillance is particularly informative. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were Alan Greenspan. Chairman; William J McDonough. Vice Chairman; Ben S Bernanke; Susan S Bies; J Alfred Broaddus. Jr.; Roger W Ferguson. Jr.; Edward M Gramlich; Jack Guynn; Donald L Kohn; Michael H Moskow; Mark W Olson; and Robert T Parry."
Philippines,2003-03-19,"In a special meeting yesterday, the Monetary Board, the policy-making body of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), decided to remove the three-tiered system for banks' placements with the BSP and to increase the liquidity reserve requirement for universal banks and commercial banks by one percentage point. The overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) transactions with the BSP will be accepted at a flat rate of 7 percent. Term RRPs and special deposit accounts (SDAs) with the BSP will be paid the published rates for corresponding tenors, i.e., at a certain spread over the overnight RRP rate. The removal of the tiering system will be effective starting today, 20 March 2003. Meanwhile, the liquidity reserve requirement against peso demand, savings, time deposit and deposit substitute liabilities of universal banks (UBs) and commercial banks (KBs) will go up to 8.0 percent effective Friday, 21 March 2003. The decision to remove the tiering scheme and raise the liquidity reserve requirement is intended as a preemptive response to inflationary risks. In assessing the inflation environment and overall macroeconomic conditions, the Monetary Board has expressed concern over the recent developments in the foreign exchange market. Monetary Board members are of the view that a sustained weakening of the peso poses risks to the inflation outlook. The Monetary Board believes that the risk of higher future inflation arising from exchange rate movements requires a policy response in order to limit the potential impact on consumer prices. The BSP will continue to closely monitor developments in the foreign exchange market. The Monetary Board is prepared to take further policy action, if necessary, to ensure orderly market conditions which is important in pursuing the BSP's primary objective of price stability."
South Africa,2003-03-20,"In February 2000 an announcement was made by government that an inflation targeting framework had been adopted for monetary policy purposes. This change was made to improve the co-ordination between monetary policy and other macro-economic policies, as well as to make monetary policy more transparent and accountable. Under this framework the Reserve Bank and more specifically the Monetary Policy Committee was given the task to achieve an average rate of increase in the overall consumer price index for metropolitan and other urban areas excluding mortgage interest costs (the CPIX) of between 3 and 6 per cent for the year 2002. The CPIX measure of inflation was chosen to ensure a wide coverage of consumer items, but without the mortgage interest cost component that would perversely fall as monetary policy was relaxed, and vice versa. In 2002 the rate of increase in the CPIX averaged 10 per cent, or 4 percentage points above the upper limit of the target range. In the light of this outcome the Reserve Bank wishes to inform the public in general why the actual inflation rate deviated from the target. The Bank would also like to spell out what measures have been taken to bring the inflation rate within the target band in due course. The Monetary Policy Committee is of the opinion that four factors were mainly responsible for the acceleration in the rate of increase in the general price level in 2002. First and foremost the rapid rise in the prices of consumer goods and services was related to the sharp depreciation in the external value of the rand in the second half of 2001. The nominal value of the rand on a trade-weighted basis declined by 34,3 per cent from the end of June 2001 to the end of that year. Initially the weakness of the rand was mainly linked to the contagion effects of the political situation in Zimbabwe and financial stability problems experienced in emerging-market economies such as Argentina and Turkey. Later developments in the exchange rate of the rand were characterised by typical financial market behaviour under the circumstances which prevailed at the time where further declines in the exchange rate of the rand became a self-fulfilling prophecy based on market expectations. The increased risk aversion of international investors caused asset fund managers to withdraw portfolio investments from South Africa. These sales of South African securities increased the demand for dollars in the domestic currency market, which put downward pressure on the exchange rate of the rand. At the same time, importers made advance payments to avoid paying more in rand for foreign currency denominated purchases of goods abroad at a later stage, while exporters delayed the repatriation of foreign-currency earnings to obtain expected higher rand proceeds from a depreciating currency. The effects of the leads and lags in foreign payments and receipts on the exchange rate of the rand were aggravated by the appearance of a deficit on the current account of the balance of payments during the second half of 2001. A second factor leading to the acceleration in inflation during 2002 was the rise in domestic food prices which had already started from the middle of the preceding year. The prices of food increased by no less than 16,7 per cent in 2002. If the increases in food prices are excluded from the overall CPIX, the rate of increase in the prices of other goods and services averaged 7,8 per cent in 2002. Food prices are generally a highly volatile component in consumer expenditure and can have a significant impact on other price developments in South Africa. The substantial rise in food prices during 2002 can to a large extent be attributed to the depreciated value of the rand. After the liberalisation of agricultural pricing, export and import parity prices have generally set the lower and upper bounds to the prices of domestically produced agricultural goods. The rise in international prices of grain products together with the depreciation of the rand caused the prices of food in South Africa to rise considerably. Moreover, the regional demand and supply of crops in Southern Africa shifted the prices of agricultural goods higher owing to a movement away from export parity pricing to import parity pricing. Thirdly, the acceleration in the prices of consumer goods and services was the result of increases in international oil prices during 2002. After the Brent price of oil had stabilised around US$20 per barrel in January and February 2002, it started to move higher and reached an average of approximately US$28 per barrel in December 2002. This increase was mainly related to concerns about a possible US-led attack on Iraq and disruptions in the supply of oil due to general strikes in Venezuela. Fourthly, the inflation outcome in 2002 was affected by large increases in some administered prices. In particular, the prices of medical and education services and water rates continued to increase at very high rates of approximately 10 per cent or more in 2002, following on even higher increases in 2001. Assessment rates and fees for sanitary services and refuse removal also rose at a high rate in 2002. As a result, the increase in the prices of all administered goods and services averaged 8,4 per cent in 2002, or was about equal to the increase in the preceding year. High increases in administered prices, which have a weight of almost 25 per cent in the CPIX, continue to make it extremely difficult to bring inflation down to the targets set by government. This brief exposition of the major reasons why the inflation target was not met in 2002 indicate that it was largely due to extraordinary events that could not be foreseen and which were beyond the control or influence of monetary policy. At the beginning of 2002, when it had already become apparent that the inflation target would not be met, the Reserve Bank considered whether to make use of the escape clause, which recognises circumstances which could temporarily lead to deviations from the target. In the end the Bank decided that it would be unwise to make use of this clause. Continued monetary discipline was regarded as essential for price stability and sustainable high economic growth. It was also argued at the time that the negative effect of higher interest rates on short-term economic growth would be neutralised to a large extent by the very competitive external value of the rand. Rather than opting for a temporary increase in the inflation target, the Monetary Policy Committee decided that corrective measures should be applied. The Committee affirmed that it was highly unlikely that any measures would bring the inflation rate to within the target range for 2002 because of the long lags between interest rate increases and a slow down in inflation. The objective of the Committee accordingly became focussed on bringing the rate of increase in CPIX within the target range as soon as possible with the least short-term cost to economic growth and employment creation. The first corrective step was already taken at a special meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee early in January 2002. At this meeting the Committee decided to increase the repurchase rate of the Bank by 100 basis points to counter rising inflation expectations. Monetary policy was tightened further at the subsequent three scheduled meetings of the Monetary Policy Committee. At all three meetings the repurchase rate was increased by 100 basis points to bring the level to 13,5 per cent in September 2002. On the basis of expected inflation, this led to a significant increase in real short-term interest rates in South Africa and therefore a tightening in monetary policy. At the November meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee it was decided that the right dose of monetary discipline had been applied and that there were some signs that inflation pressures were abating. The Committee therefore kept the repurchase rate unchanged because this level of the rate was regarded as appropriate to bring the inflation rate within the target range in due course. Since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee the inflation outlook has improved further. This is specifically confirmed by a slowdown in the prices of production goods, which generally precedes similar changes in consumer price inflation. The recent recovery of the rand and a lower rate of increase in food prices have curbed the rise in the prices of both imported and domestic goods. As a result, the year-on-year rate of increase in the all goods production price index declined from 15,4 per cent in September 2002 to 8,1 per cent in January 2003. An even more impressive reduction in the seasonally adjusted and annualised quarter-to-quarter production price inflation has been recorded from 25,8 per cent in the first quarter of 2002 to 5,0 per cent in the fourth quarter. Other factors pointing to an improved inflation outlook, include the following:. A recovery in the exchange rate of the rand. The weighted exchange rate of the rand increased by 26,0 per cent from the end of December 2001 to the end of December 2002 and by a further 5,9 per cent up to 20 March 2003. This brought the level of the nominal effective exchange rate of the rand close to its level at the end of 2000, i.e. just before the weakening of the rand in 2001. Sound macroeconomic policies, relatively high domestic interest rates in comparison to developed countries, a reduction in risk aversion towards emerging market economies, improved international credit ratings of South Africa and the weakness of the dollar were possibly responsible for this recovery of the rand. Food price inflation moderated somewhat from a year-on-year increase of 19,3 per cent in October 2002 to 15,4 per cent in January 2003. Although this latter rate of increase is still very high, the recovery of the rand, the decline in international grain prices and expected good summer crops should bring food price increases to significantly lower levels. Slower momentum in the growth of money supply. The seasonally adjusted and annualised quarter-to-quarter growth in the broadly defined money supply (M3), declined sharply from 32,1 per cent in the first quarter of 2002 to 7,1 per cent in the fourth quarter. Measured over a period of twelve months, the growth in M3 came down from 17,8 per cent in October 2002 to 9,9 per cent in January 2003. Continued moderate growth in bank credit extension. Growth over twelve months in bank credit extension to the private sector declined from 15,6 per cent in January 2002 to only 4,7 per cent in December, but then rose again to 12,7 per cent in January 2003. The January 2003 figure, however, was distorted by regulatory and accounting changes specifying that certain transactions must be reported on a gross rather than a net basis. These changes particularly affected the investments of banks in private sector entities. If these items are excluded, the rate of increase in the loans and advances of banks to the private sector, measured over a period of twelve months, declined from 10,3 per cent in August 2002 to 7,9 per cent in December, and then increased moderately to 8,9 per cent in January 2003. The utilisation of production capacity in manufacturing, which had amounted to 81,1 per cent in the third quarter of 2002, declined to 80,1 per cent in the fourth quarter. The increase in excess production capacity was the combined result of increased capital outlays by manufacturing enterprises and a slowdown in the growth of manufacturing output. It also seems unlikely that capacity constraints will arise in the near future because of an apparent weakening in the demand for manufactured goods as signalled by a recent decline in unfilled orders. Surplus on the current account of the balance of payments. The current account of the balance of payments turned around from a seasonally adjusted and annualised deficit of R2,2 billion in the third quarter of 2002 to a surplus of R4,3 billion in the fourth quarter. The current account was also in surplus to the amount of R3,3 billion for the year as a whole, clearly indicating that there are no signs of excess spending in the South African economy. The improvement in the current account balance was largely the result of the higher gold price leading to a higher value of net gold exports. This development, together with an increase in the prices of exported goods and services, neutralised a decline in the volume of merchandise exports and a rise in merchandise imports. Projections of current account aggregates show that future excess spending also seems unlikely. Although government adopted a more expansionary fiscal policy stance from 2001/02, fiscal discipline continued to be applied. It is estimated that the deficit before borrowing and debt repayment will reach 2,4 per cent of gross domestic product in the fiscal year 2003/04, and that it will be maintained more or less at this level in the next two years. At these levels, the finances of government should not present any difficulties for monetary policy. The above-mentioned promising developments will need to be maintained if a meaningful reduction in CPIX inflation is to be achieved. After the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPIX had accelerated from a low level of 5,8 per cent in September 2001 to 12,7 per cent in November 2002, it retraced only modestly to 11,3 per cent in February 2003. Moreover, the seasonally adjusted and annualised quarter-to-quarter increase in CPIX inflation rose from 11,1 per cent in the second quarter of 2002 to 14,5 per cent in the fourth quarter. These high levels of CPIX inflation leave little room for complacency on the part of monetary policy. Considerable risks still exist that could prevent the rate of increase in the CPIX from moving into the target range during the course of 2003. Among these risks the recent high rates of increase in the average nominal remuneration per worker in the formal non-agricultural sectors of the economy combined with a slowdown in labour productivity growth, are probably the most disconcerting. As a result, average year-on-year growth in nominal unit labour cost reached 7,4 in the first nine months of 2002, which could bring about considerable upward pressure on future price inflation. It has been found in the past that high rates of increase in unit labour costs invariably lead to an acceleration in domestic inflation. In the current circumstances, the insecure international economic environment is a further risk factor to take into consideration when determining monetary policy. Considerable uncertainty exists regarding the economic impact of the war in Iraq and about the pace of the underlying recovery in the world economy. Another major risk factor for monetary policy is that prices of goods and services determined by government agencies have continued to increase rapidly and there are still few signs that these increases are tapering off. As already indicated, these administered prices form a large part of the CPIX. In addition, they also affect other prices indirectly. It is therefore of the utmost importance that macroeconomic and microeconomic policies be co-ordinated closely to achieve optimum results with overall economic policy. Although there are still important risks prevalent that could have a negative effect on the inflation outcome, conditions have become generally more favourable for a decline in domestic inflation. This is confirmed by projections using the Reserve Bank's forecasting models, which indicate that there is a strong likelihood that CPIX inflation will move within the target band during the course of the year. However, the forecasts also indicate that the average rate of increase in the CPIX may only be slightly below the upper band of the inflation target in 2004. Taking this into consideration as well as the risks identified above, the Monetary Policy Committee has decided to maintain the repurchase rate at its current level of 13,5 per cent per annum. In addition, the Reserve Bank wants to confirm that, consistent with our inflation-targeting monetary policy framework, we have no intermediate policy targets or guidelines and we are committed to allowing the value of the rand to be determined by the market. Recently with the recovery of the rand, the Reserve Bank has on occasions taken the opportunity to purchase dollars for our reserves on a moderate scale. These operations have helped to reduce the Bank's net open position in foreign currency from US$1,8 billion at the end of November 2002 to US$1,3 billion on 13 March 2003. Such operations purely represent normal prudent management of the Reserve Bank's balance sheet as is ordinarily the case in central banking. They are in no way directed at seeking to influence a particular level of the rand, whose value will continue to be set by the market."
Israel,2003-03-24,"The Bank of Israel's Monetary Program for April 2003. The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for March 2003, according to which the interest rate will be reduced by 0.2 percentage points, bringing it to 8.7 percent. The Bank of Israel stated that in the last few weeks inflation expectationsfor one year, two years, and longer, derived from the capital market, declined, although they are still above the target set by the government. Private forecasters' predictions of 12-month inflation have also dipped and are within the target range. The models developed by the Bank of Israel indicate that it is possible to attain the target of price stability while reducing the interest rate to some extent. In addition, local-currency appreciation and the decline in long-term interest rates appear to indicate that the public expects the policy measures which the Ministry of Finance has put before the government to be introduced. Against the backdrop of the moderate level of economic activity, it is possible for the Bank of Israel to reduce its key interest rate at this stage, but it should be noted that there is still considerable uncertainty in view of the difficulties that might arise in the implementation of budgetary policy, the global slump, the continuation of the Intifada, and the implications of the war in Iraq for the financial markets, economic activity in Israel, and developments in the region. The Bank of Israel stressed that in recent weeks the yields on unindexed 10-year bonds have declined to less than 11 percent (compared with a peak of almost 12 percent), and the yields on indexed bonds for the same term have fallen to 5.5 percent (compared with a peak of almost 6 percent). This development would seem to express the public's confidence in an improvement in the fiscal situation following the recommendations included in the economicpackage, alongside a possible abatement of the causes of uncertainty listed above. However, the measures introduced must be consistent with a declining budget deficit path, as decided by the government in 2002, expressed in a reduction in the debt/GDP ratio, so that this improvement becomes permanent. This policy is essential for making credit available, maintaining Israel's international credit rating, continuing with the reduction of long-terminterest on government bonds, and hence for reducing the interest rate on credit for investment and mortgages which is vital for reviving growth and stimulating employment. Note, too, that the adoption of reforms with long-term repercussions, as is the case with the reforms of the labor market and pension savings, is necessary in order to create the infrastructure for therenewal of growth once external conditions permit. The Bank of Israel explained that the further reduction of the short-term interest rate while maintaining stability depends to a great extent on the public's confidence in adherence this year and in the medium term to the fiscal restraint which is also required for strengthening the financial system. The Bank of Israel added that a credible blueprint for the development of the infrastructure, while promoting competition in it, is necessary in order to check the contraction of the economy and return to a growth path. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the markets, inorder to ensure that the inflation rate defined as price stability is maintained while bolstering financial stability. Subject to these conditions, the Bank will act to support the government's policy to foster employment and shorten the recession. Changes in NIS and dollar interest rates. ISRAEL.

Poland,2003-03-26,"Warsaw, 26 March 2003 INFORMATION FROM A MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL, held on 25-26 March 2003 On 25-26 March 2003 the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council took place. The MPC read materials prepared by the NBP Management Board and its Departments as well as information and analyses furnished by the Ministry of Finance, banks and research institutes. The MPC discussed the external environment of the Polish economy as well as real trends, trends in wages and salaries and social welfare benefits, in the public finance sector, in money supply, loans and interest rates and in the structures of pricing and inflationary expectations, as well as the anticipated inflation rate. Decision of the Monetary Policy Council New economic data which has emerged since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Council: a) confirms the signs of a gradual economic recovery in industry due to increases in exports and to stable growth in retail sales. b) confirms earlier data that indicated a continuing low growth rate in domestic demand: - a continuing low growth rate of wages in the industrial sector, - a further declining growth rate in the construction industry, - the annual growth rate of monetary aggregates  M3 and loans  is becoming progressively steadier, the cash growth rate has levelled off, c) shows that the current inflation and inflationary expectations of the general public and bank analysts continue to be low. All base inflation indices have fallen. d) indicates that the German economy shows no signs of an upturn: both business and consumer optimism have remained low for another month, the German economy growth rate in 2003 is expected to be lower than it had been anticipated. Factors potentially stimulating inflationary pressure include: - a steady growth in the sold industrial production index to 2.8% in February 2003, - a serious weakening of the zloty, which, in the light of internal and external political instability, may persist long enough to result in price increase. - the risk of escalation in oil prices driven by the military operation in the Persian Gulf, - a probable over-run in the level of economic deficit in the public finance sector as envisaged in the draft 2003 Budget Act and uncertainty underlying the fiscal policy for 2004. The Monetary Policy Council resolved: that the National Bank of Poland will conduct open market operations for 14-day maturities with a profitability rate of at least 6.00% p.a., to reduce the lombard rate from 8.00% to 7.75% p.a., that the interest rate on term deposits taken by the NBP from banks will be held at 4.25% p.a., to reduce the re-discount rate from 6.75% to 6.50% p.a. The Council confirms its neutral approach in respect of monetary policy. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Council is scheduled for 23-24 April 2003. Assessment of the economic situation Pessimism dominated on international markets in February and Deterioration in March 2003. Increasing political tension in the world caused consumer- deterioration in the expectation indicators of all market entities. confidence The USA economy saw the most dramatic drop in consumer in the USA and the confidence with the University of Michigan ratio falling from 82.4 euro zone. in January 2003 to 79.9 in February, whereas the NAMP indicator (showing the level of business confidence) fell from 53.9 to 50.5 in respective months. Parallel indicators for the Euro-zone also fell, yet at much slower rate. According to the analysts, a temporary increase in the German business confidence indicator in February 2003 (to 88.9 from the level of 87.4 in January 2003) was related to the growth in the industrial order portfolio resulting from the need to replenish stocks during wartime. The uncertainty which had prevailed on financial markets before the military operation started also resulted in: a downward trend Less optimistic growth forecasts in on world stock exchanges, an increasing depreciation of the Germany American dollar against the euro, and an increase in oil prices. Therefore, it was fairly unlikely that the level of demand in regions most important for the global economic condition, particularly the Euro zone, would improve in the near future. This opinion is supported by further negative adjustments to the economic growth forecast for Germany for 2003 (German Institute in Kiel forecasts the growth rate of the German GDP in 2003 to be 0.4%, whereas, according to the OECD, it should be 0.8%.) In February 2002, global oil prices continued to rise. The average price of crude oil in February 2003 reached USD 32.8 a barrel and was USD 1.5 higher than in January 2003 and USD 12.5 higher than in February 2002. The increase in oil prices resulted mainly from growing concerns about the continued supply of oil from the Persian Gulf region and diminishing oil and petroleum products stocks in the USA. This drop was caused by a reduced supply of oil from Venezuela and by an increased demand for petroleum products, heating oil in particular, which resulted from hard winter conditions in the eastern part of the USA. All in all, despite the relatively lower demand in Western Europe, since December 2002, the level of reserves in the OECD countries has continued to be at a 5 year low. In February 2002 OPEC increased oil production by 1.5m barrels per day (as agreed in the quotas) as compared with January 2003. The supply level of the cartel members reached the level recorded before the strikes in Venezuela. Most of the OPEC countries have almost reached their maximum production capacity. This means that in the foreseeable future the OPEC countries will not be able to increase the supply to a level which could compensate for the loss of Iraqi oil. Also, faced by military operations in Iraq. Kuwait may close oilfields located near the Iraqi border. The start of the Persian Gulf war caused a fall in oil prices. At the moment the prices are fluctuating. In the nearest future, the war in Iraq constitutes the main source of uncertainty and the cause of fluctuations on global financial markets. The Central Statistical Office has confirmed the initial outlook. Higher production rate, in consistence according to which the GDP growth rate in the 4th quarter of with the current 2002 was 2.1%, and over the whole year 2002 - 1.3%. trend Year-to-year growth in total industrial output in February 2003 amounted to 4.1%. The growth in the processing industry might have been influenced, as in January 2003, by imponderables connected with severe weather. This is shown by the relatively high level of sales in the electricity, gas and water production and supply sector, and by a serious decline in output in the non- metallic raw materials manufacturing industry, which is extremely sensitive to weather conditions. Continuing growth at a level similar to that of January and February confirms the stability of current trends. An increase in growth rates can only be achieved through growing investment demand. Out of 29 industrial sectors, 22 reported an increase in production and 7 conceded a decline. As in previous months, the highest production growth was observed in industries with a high and increasing share of export sales. There has been a further decline in construction output. It was 24% lower than in February 2002. The only sector which did not Further decline in construction output report a decline in production were companies preparing construction sites. As in industrial production, the level of output was influenced by the weather conditions, which this year were much more severe than last winter. Therefore, data concerning construction output in January and February cannot be treated as indicative of a further future decline in the investment demand. According to the Central Statistical Office survey of a sample of six thousand enterprises, conducted at the end of February 2003, the condition of the processing industry has been Significantly better improving since the beginning of this year. The general marker assessment of the for this sector has been positive for the second consecutive condition in processing industry month. According to the majority of respondents both output and demand increased in February. However, when asked about their financial condition, liabilities or foreign demand, their opinions were still negative, though not as pessimistic as in the same period of the previous year, or two years ago. It should be noted that, compared to January 2003, a substantial over-stock of ready-made goods can be observed in enterprises. Entrepreneurs are very optimistic about the nearest future (with indicators turning positive, except those concerning employment). The foreign demand forecast look particularly promising, so it can be concluded that entrepreneurs associate the increase in production and improvement of their economic situation with exports. The general situation in trade and in the construction industry is Continuous negative considered to be really difficult, particularly in trade. All specific assessment of general indicators for February 2003, based on their evaluation by trade situation in trade and and construction companies have again been negative, and, in construction when compared with the data of 2002, they show no signs of industry discernable improvement. Entrepreneurs in all sectors agree that the level of employment will continue to decline. Entrepreneurs in trade and in the construction industry anticipate a fall in their output prices. Only the processing industry companies expect a price increase. January 2003 saw another decline by EUR 290m against January 2002 in the current account deficit which amounted to EUR 680m. As in previous months, a drop in the negative Decrease in the current account balance of the current account results from a decrease in the deficit commodity trading deficit and, as in December 2002, from the growing positive balance of unclassified current account transactions. The commodities trading deficit fell in January 2003 by EUR 170m. This was due to the fact that exports growth rate Exports still increase exceeded (by 8.2%, as compared with January 2002) the imports growth rate (by 1.2%)  a trend that has continued for eleven consecutive months to date. The January data confirms that, since September 2002, exports have increased continuously. The growth in imports, on the other hand, has slowed down as compared with November and December 2002. II. Situation of public sector finance After the first two months of 2003 the nominal and real value of the state budget revenues were higher than in the same period of the previous year, and they constituted 14.3% of the annual plan. PIT receipts remain at a relatively high level. They rose by 7.8% The annual plan of against the figures for the corresponding months of the previous state budget revenues and expenditures year, which is not impressive and constitutes mere 14 % of their followed to a very little extent in the first two substantial annual increase of 13% anticipated in the budget for months of 2003 this year. CIT receipts are 9.8% lower than after the first two months of 2002. This situation was attributable mainly to the February receipts (annual growth in this category in February equalled 83.9%) The state budget receipts from indirect taxes in January and February 2003 were 8.3% higher than in the same period of the previous year. Significantly high were receipts in January, which can be attributed to the introduction of settlements on a quarterly basis for small and medium-sized enterprises. The plan resulted in a 15.2% increase - a result slightly worse than in previous years - which stems from the high budget plan for this year. State budget expenditures this February were 4.2% higher than in February 2002. Yet, because of the very low expenditures in January, the constituted only 17.5% of the budget plan, which is considerably below the percentage reported in previous years. Consequently, the budget deficit amounted to PLN 11.7bn, which equals 30% of the annual limit - much below the result in the previous year. According to the information available concerning other sectors and institutions in the public finance sector, particularly worrying is the situation of the Social Insurance Institution and the Agricultural Market Agency. Here, deficits may be higher than anticipated. On the whole, it can be expected that the state budget deficit will not exceed the statutory maximum, although budget revenues Economic deficit of are lower than planned. The difficult situation in the Social the public finance Insurance Institution and in the Agricultural Market Agency may sector in 2003 may be higher than increase the economic deficit of the public finance sector. planned. III. Money supply, loans, interest rates, exchange rates In February, the M3 money supply rose by PLN 3.3 Bn (1.0%) and the annual growth rate of the M3 aggregate amounted to Increase in the 1.2%. After elimination of exchange rate differences, the M3 amount of money supply in February growth amounted to PLN 2.5 Bn The main source of M3 growth was the increase in the amount of cash in circulation by PLN 1.1 Bn (2.7%) and in the deposits of the local government bodies by PLN 1.3 Bn (14.3%). Other components of the M3 aggregate underwent only slight changes. The annual cash in circulation growth rate reached 12.7% in February 2003, similar to the percentages reported in previous months. The annual growth rate in deposits from local government bodies amounted to 9.6% - a level almost unchanged for the last six months, although the deposits by self governing institutions are usually higher in February, due to subsidies received from central government. Deposits from households increased by PLN 1.2 Bn (0.6%). However, when the differences in exchange rates are eliminated, this growth amounted only to PLN 0.4 Bn. Although the total value of growth in household deposits in February was not very high, it should be noted that it was the first growth in this category reported since June 2002. The low demand for loans, both from companies and from households, continues. The total value of amounts due Small growth in loans increased slightly by PLN 0.9 Bn (0.4%) in February, and when the differences in exchange rates were eliminated, the total value of amounts due decreased by 0.4%. Adjusted to exchange rates differences, the annual growth rate of amounts due from households amounted to -0.3% and from corporations to -0.2%. In February, a strengthening of the euro against the dollar could Weakening of PLN be observed on the global markets. The average monthly value exchange rate of EUR against USD reached a level of 1.08  the highest since March 1999. The Zloty also strengthened against the dollar. The average exchange rate of EUR against PLN in February equalled 4.16 and was the highest since June 2000. The gradual depreciation of the zloty against the dollar and the euro continued in the first half of March. When the war in the Persian Gulf broke out, the exchange rate of the zloty levelled off. IV. Prices, inflationary expectations The twelve-month consumer commodities and services price growth index was the same in February as in January and The annual consumer price amounted to 0.5% (after changes in the weighting system index at 0.5% introduced by Central Statistical Office). As in January 2003, the increase in CPI in February 2003 resulted mostly from the rise in rental and energy costs as well as costs of transport, caused mainly by rising fuel prices. The CPI was also reduced by food prices, non-alcoholic drinks, alcohol and tobacco as well as of clothes and footwear. The sold-product prices in industry increased over the last twelve months by 2.8% (0.2% in the previous year). The growth Increase in the production prices in in sold-product prices resulted from the depreciation of the February effective zloty exchange rate and from the rise in oil prices. The actual growth of prices in industrial production was hampered by the adaptive processes in enterprises directed towards lowering individual labour costs (low increase in nominal wages accompanied by rapid growth in efficiency). Most significant was the growth by 6.3% in electricity, gas and water supply and production prices (10.0% in the previous year). Decrease in Also prices in industrial processing increased by 2.6% (1.7% fall inflationary in the previous year). expectations of natural persons and bank analysts In March 2003 the rate of price growth as expected by natural persons in the coming year decreased by 0.3 percentage point against February 2003 and equalled 0.3%. The inflation rate expected by banking analysts in the month preceding the same month of next year (i.e. February 2004) fell by 0.2 percentage point to reach 2.1% whilst the average annual inflation rate for 2004 equalled 2.4% and was 0.1 percentage point below Februaryâs forecast. The expected 2003 year-end inflation rate was 2.4% which is 0.1 percentage point higher than in the previous month."
Euroarea,2003-04-03,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank today met for the seventh time outside Frankfurt. Let me therefore thank both Governor Fazio for his invitation and generous hospitality, and the staff of the Banca d'Italia for an excellently organised meeting. At our meeting today, which took place in the exceptional circumstances associated with the conflict in Iraq, we comprehensively reviewed monetary, financial and economic developments. We discussed at some length the potential economic implications of the military operations. In the Governing Council's view, it is not possible at this juncture to assess what effect they will have on the global economy, and on economic developments and the medium-term outlook for price stability in the euro area. Overall, the basic elements of our assessment of 6 March on the outlook for price stability remain in place and accordingly we decided to keep interest rates unchanged. We also noted that the outbreak of the war has not affected the functioning of the financial system. As indicated in our press release of 20 March, the Governing Council will act to ensure the proper functioning of financial markets, providing sufficient liquidity in the euro area as needed. Let me now explain our assessment of economic developments in more detail. As regards the analysis under the first pillar of our monetary policy strategy, the three-month average of the annual growth rate of M3 was 7.4% in the period from December 2002 to February 2003, up from 7.0% in the period from November 2002 to January 2003. Given the continued high volatility in financial markets, mainly related to the geopolitical uncertainty. M3 growth continued to be fostered by portfolio shifts away from more risky assets. However. M3 growth appears also to have been affected by the low level of short-term interest rates prevailing in the euro area, as indicated by the strong growth in its most liquid components. At the same time, credit growth showed signs of stabilisation in early 2003, after the moderation observed throughout last year. Turning to the analysis under the second pillar, recent data and surveys continue to confirm that real GDP growth in the euro area remained weak in early 2003. In particular, the persistence of geopolitical tensions continued to negatively affect sentiment and dampen economic activity, thereby adding to the forces which had already depressed the outlook for the euro area before the escalation of tensions in the Middle East. As a result, we should only expect a modest rate of economic growth for 2003. However, the evolution of economic growth for the rest of this year is particularly difficult to foresee at the moment, given the exceptional degree of uncertainty arising from the military conflict. Our baseline scenario continues to be one of a moderate recovery associated with diminishing uncertainty, starting in the second half of 2003. However, we will need to review the economic implications of the war as soon as a clearer picture emerges. A number of scenarios, implying widely different outcomes for economic activity, are conceivable at present. Yet it would be premature to assign specific probabilities to any such exercises, which are mainly of an illustrative nature. Looking at price developments, annual HICP inflation is estimated by Eurostat to have been 2.4% in March 2003, unchanged from February. The recent drop in oil prices is not likely to be reflected in the price statistics until April. As for the outlook for price stability over the medium term, it is particularly important to clearly distinguish between short-term volatility and more fundamental factors. While oil price developments may very much influence the pattern of inflation rates over the coming months, other factors should dominate beyond the short term. The lagged effects of the appreciation of the euro exchange rate since mid-2002 will continue to dampen upward pressure on prices, as will the modest economic growth. If the recent significant reduction in oil prices is sustained, inflation rates will in all likelihood fall below 2% in the course of 2003 and remain in line with price stability thereafter; evidently, this presupposes that wage moderation prevails. Overall, the present policy stance is consistent with the preservation of price stability over the medium term. It maintains a monetary environment that is in itself favourable to economic growth in a situation in which other factors are having an adverse effect on economic activity. Exceptional circumstances are complicating the assessment of economic trends. We will therefore continue to monitor events carefully and evaluate them in the light of our mandate. Regarding fiscal policies, the Stability and Growth Pact provides a robust and flexible framework for addressing any strains on public finances without undermining the principle of budgetary discipline. While letting, where possible, automatic stabilisers operate in reaction to changing economic circumstances, there is no reason to pursue fiscal activism. It remains essential that both the commitments made in the stability programmes and the requests to further improve fiscal positions, as subsequently agreed in the ECOFIN Council, are implemented in full. This will help to build confidence in the fiscal framework and anchor expectations about the future macroeconomic environment. In a highly uncertain environment, it is all the more essential that governments help to boost investor and consumer confidence by taking decisive action to implement structural reforms in labour and product markets and in public finance. On the one hand, there appears to be a broad consensus among policymakers and the public that such reforms are important to ultimately raise the euro area's production potential, improve the flexibility of the economy and make the euro area more resilient to external shocks. On the other hand, notwithstanding some progress in individual countries, the effective pace of reform has so far remained slow and clearly insufficient to meet the Lisbon objectives. Over the past few years this has given rise to an implementation gap. Efforts to overcome structural inefficiencies in the functioning of markets must be stepped up. This would promote confidence in the medium-term production capacity of the euro area and therefore counteract to some extent the current high degree of uncertainty."
Peru,2003-04-03,"BANCO CENTRAL DE RESERVA DEL PERU Press Release MONETARY PROGRAM APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF THE BANK FOR APRIL 2003 In March, the rate of inflation was 1,1 percent (3,4 percent in annual terms), mainly due to specific factors such as the increase in fuels and transportation fares. However, the underlying inflation, which exclude high volatility items from the CPI basket, increased 0,1 percent in March and 1,7 percent through last 12 months. Unless the price increases in fuel and transportation fares migrate to other prices or inflation expectations deviate from the BCR's target, the Central Bank will not take any specific action. Monetary policy decisions are oriented to attain a 2,5 percent rate of inflation with a 1 percent point margin. The Board of the Bank decided to maintain the borrowing and lending Central Bank operations at: 4,25 percent: For monetary regulation credits and direct temporary purchase of BCR's papers. 3,0 percent: for overnight deposits. The interest rate of monetary regulation credits and direct temporary purchases of BCR's securities will equal to the interbank interest rate when this rate be higher than 4,25 percent. In March, the interbank interest rate was 3,8 percent, prevailing from December. For April, the estimated range for the banks' current account balance held at the Central Bank will is 190 million to 210 million on a daily basis. In March, this balance was 200 million, above the estimated range (170 million to 190 million) due to the increase in domestic currency deposits. Considering this liquidity level, the interbank interest rate was 3,8 percent. The following interest rates will be used in foreign-currency operations: The effective annual rate for monetary regulation credits will be the 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point. For overnight deposits held by banks at the Central Bank, the rate is equivalent to the average obtained by the Central Bank for similar deposits abroad. For foreign exchange temporary purchase operations (swap operations), the commission is maintained to an implicit effective annual cost of 4,25 percent."
Chile,2003-04-08,"THE CENTRAL BANK OF CHILE Press Release* Monthly Monetary Policy Meeting April 8, 2003 At its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided, by unanimous vote, to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 2.75% (annual). The developments of the past weeks, particularly the decline in the price of oil and its derivatives, suggest that the increase in inflation of the past few months is essentially transitory. Insofar as this scenario of reduced oil prices remains, inflation can be expected to be shortly within the band. Underlying price pressures continue within the forecast margin, while inflation perspectives for the projection horizon remain in line with the target. News from the real sector continues to be varied. In the international front, beyond the uncertainties associated with the war in Iraq, doubts exist about the pace of the world economy's recovery. Domestically, output and employment are consistent with the perspective of increased growth, although the dynamism of some domestic demand indicators has toned down in the margin. The Central Bank of Chile reiterates that it will continue to conduct monetary policy with the necessary flexibility to address any projected inflation deviations in either direction from the specified target inflation rate."
Philippines,2003-04-09,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board, the policy-making body of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), voted to leave the BSP's policy interest rates unchanged at 7 percent for the overnight borrowing rate and 9.25 percent for the overnight lending rate. The BSP's policy rates have been on hold for the past 13 months, with the rates last changed on 15 March 2002 when they were reduced by 25 basis points. In assessing the inflation environment and overall macroeconomic conditions, members of the Monetary Board noted that present price conditions remain consistent with an outlook of a generally subdued inflation environment in the near term given the absence of demand-side risks to prices and the short-lived nature of foreseeable supply-side pressures. This observation is supported by the indications that the risks to the inflation outlook posed by the threat of El NiÃ±o weather phenomenon appear to be weakening; the surge in international oil prices observed in the previous months has reversed and this has translated into a reduction in the prices of some domestic oil products; and the exchange rate has stabilized. Given these conditions, the outlook for average inflation in 2003 and 2004 is expected to be broadly in line with the government's targets. At the same time, the overall strength of aggregate demand remains quite moderate. Domestic demand indicators continue to show encouraging signs but no evidence as yet of a sustained pickup. Likewise, concerns over the impact of the war in Iraq combined with weak demand conditions in major economies continue to cloud the prospects for global economic recovery. Against this backdrop, the Monetary Board believes that it would be prudent to maintain current monetary policy settings and keep policy interest rates steady. The predominant risk to the domestic macroeconomic environment at present appears to relate more to the moderate though improving pace of economic activity rather than to rising consumer prices. The stance of monetary policy will therefore continue to focus on providing a supportive environment that ensures sufficient liquidity to fuel the economy's growth requirements. However, monetary policy will also continue to be cautious so as to guard against any potential build-up of price pressures that could dampen the present growth momentum. The Monetary Board is scheduled to meet again to review the BSP's monetary policy settings on 8 May 2003."
South Korea,2003-04-10,"The domestic economy has continued to slow down, as demonstrated by shrinking consumption and business investment as well as a substantial increase in inventories. Consumer prices accelerated due to hikes in public and private service charges, and increases in the prices of agricultural products, vegetables in particular, and of petroleum-based products. Despite steadily increasing exports, the current account has continued to record a deficit in a row since last December, due largely to the expansion of imports that has been led by higher international oil prices. Financial markets were temporarily thrown into turmoil due to accounting malpractice at SK Global and growing concern over the deterioration of the soundness of credit card companies. They are gradually recovering stability, however, thanks to the prompt steps taken to counter these developments. In the external environment, the increased likelihood of an early end to the war in Iraq should lower the level of uncertainty. However, the post- war international political situation and pace of recovery of the world economy still remain unclear. Taking these into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark overnight call rate at its current level for the inter-meeting period."
Thailand,2003-04-21,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 21 April 2003 Mr. Bandid Nijathaworn. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand announced that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance going forward. The main issues discussed were as follows: 1. The MPC reviewed the latest data on economic conditions in Thailand and deemed that the war situation did not significantly impact on the Thai economy, which continued to grow satisfactorily in the first 2 months of 2003 notwithstanding substantial economic uncertainties abroad. Economic activity was buoyed by further expansion in production and consumer spending, while export growth continued to be steady. However domestic investment showed signs of moderating and the fiscal deficit was smaller than expected. External stability remained strong with international reserves at a high level despite commencement of the IMF debt prepayment schedule. The current account, which was only marginally affected by the war, continued to register a surplus, while foreign debt declined. The baht remained relatively stable against the US dollar and moved in line with other regional currencies. The steady economic expansion had thus far not generated significant upward pressure on prices with headline inflation picking up from 14 per cent in 2002 Q4 to 19 per cent in 2003 Q1, mostly on the back of increases in energy and food prices. With pressure on service prices moderating, core inflation continued to remain stable, edging up to 03 per cent in 2003 Q1 from 02 per cent in the previous quarter. The MPC expected core inflation to remain within the target range over the next 8 quarters. 4. Although world oil prices have begun to decline, the MPC observed that remaining external uncertainties, in particular with respect to economic conditions in the industrialized countries and the negative impact on regional export and tourism activity from the SARS outbreak, continued to pose important risks to the Thai economy in the near future. Given these uncertainties and in light of the current low inflation environment, the MPC deemed that the monetary policy stance should remain accommodative to support economic growth. The MPC decided to maintain the 14-day repurchase rate at 175 per cent per annum. Bank of Thailand 21 April 2003."
Poland,2003-04-24,"Warsaw, 24 April 2003 INFORMATION FROM A MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL, held on 23-24 April 2003 On 23-24 April 2003 the Monetary Policy Council held a meeting. The Council read materials prepared by NBP Management Board and its Departments and also information and analyses furnished by the Ministry of Finance, banks and research institutes. The Council then discussed the external environment of the Polish economy as well as real trends, trends in salaries and wages and social welfare benefits, matters involving the public financial sector, the money supply, loans and interest rates and the structures of pricing and inflationary expectations, as well as the expected rate of inflation. Decision of the Monetary Policy Council New economic data which has emerged since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Council indicates: a) Decline in global oil prices, falling to below USD 25.00 per barrel and their prospective stabilisation after the end of military operations in Iraq, b) Tighter salary discipline in the corporate sector resulting in low growth of salaries which, combined with low growth of nominal social benefits sustains the forecast growth rate in consumption demand below the level of the 4th quarter 2002, c) Low annual growth rate in the M3 monetary aggregate, the cash growth rate has levelled off, d) Low level of inflationary expectations of individuals and bank analysts, e) Low base inflation rate, f) Poor economic growth prospects in the euro zone; it is expected that the economic revival process will be slower than planned. Factors potentially stimulating inflationary pressure include: - Systematic growth in the price ratio of the industrial production sold chiefly as a result of zloty devaluation, - a probable overrun in the level of economic deficit in the public finance sector as envisaged in the draft 2003 Budget Act and uncertainty underlying fiscal policy for 2004. In addition, the Council took into account the extent of interest rate cuts implemented to date, which, allowing for the normal time lag, will gradually stimulate growth in domestic demand in the second half of 2003 and in 2004. The Monetary Policy Council resolved: that the National Bank of Poland will conduct open market operations for 14-day maturities with a profitability rate of at least 5.75% p.a., to reduce the lombard rate from 7.75% to 7.25% p.a., to reduce the re-discount rate from 6.50% to 6.25% p.a., that the interest rate on term deposits taken by the NBP from banks will be held at 4.25% p.a. The Council confirms its neutral approach in respect of monetary policy. The Monetary Policy Council approves The Annual financial report of the NBP prepared as of 31-12-2002 and The Balance of Payments of the Republic of Poland for 2002. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Council is scheduled for 13 May 2003 (its agenda includes adoption of The Report on the Execution of Monetary Policy Guidelines in 2002 and The Report on the Inflation Rate in 2002) and 27-28 May 2003. Assessment of the economic situation The beginning of war in Iraq trigged international market reactions anticipated by market analysts, including: a drop in the prices of oil and other strategic resources, a decrease in the prices of governmental bonds, rise in share prices and some strengthening of the American dollar. At the moment, in view of the swift completion of the military operation in Iraq, the war has been gradually losing its influential importance and the international market is showing higher stability. In the first half of March 2003, the average price of Brent oil was equal to USD 33.9 per barrel and remained above that price in February 2003 by USD 1.2. Directly after the war broke out, the main price-growth Stabilisation of global factors in the recent month, i.e. fear for the continuity of oil supplies from oil prices after rapid the Persian Gulf region has rapidly lost its significance. The second half of drops March 2003 saw a drop in the average oil price to USD 27.1 per barrel. The trend continued in the first half of April 2003 to stabilise at below USD 25.00 per barrel. Relatively insignificant shortfalls in the global oil supply caused by the war in Iraq were largely compensated by the growth in production of the OPEC countries (on average 26m of barrels a day: unprecedented in the past two years). The production growth stemmed chiefly from the resumption of oil exploitation in Venezuela and a further increase in oil exploitation in Saudi Arabia. A significant rise in USA imports and increased oil reserves in that country contributed to lessening the pressure towards a price-increase. Similarly. American consumers are showing signs of growing confidence reflected by a distinctive growth in retail sales observed in March 2003 (5.3% growth in turnover against 3.1% in February 2003). This trend is also confirmed by the inception results of April questionnaire Improvement in research to measure consumer confidence of the USA households. It is consumer-confidence in anticipated that business circles will share this confidence. the USA At the moment, no information is available on the reaction of the market entities in the euro zone to the outbreak and positive developments of the Iraqi conflict. March 2003 witnessed a substantial deterioration in consumer and business confidence. In March 2003, the industry could partially make up for the losses generated in the first two months of 2003. After January and February growth remained at a level lower than expected. March 2003 saw a rise in Growth in industrial the total industrial output sold by 5.7% against March 2002, and by 7.2% in output processing industry. Despite an improvement observed in March 2003, in the first quarter 2002, the growth of sales was slower than that in the fourth quarter 2002 (4.4% against 4.6%), chiefly due to a slower growth rate in processing industry (growth by 5.0% against 6.2%). 3 Production growth ratios of March and the first quarter 2003 were not affected by the differences in working time. Similarly, the growth trend of the total industrial output volume observed since October 2002, remained below the rate observed between May and September 2002 as well as the stabilising tendency in food processing output volume (at 160% of the 1995 monthly average). Some symptoms of a rebounding high increase in consumer demand to 2002 level were noticeable despite a continued drop in revenues from hired labour  in March 2003, the salary fund in the corporate sector remained lower by 3.3% from the level observed one year ago and by 2.3% lower over the whole 1st quarter 2003. Exports continuously support production, although the foreign trade turnover figures published by the Central Statistical Office in January and February indicate that the exports volume growth in euro terms was equal to 0.1%. At the same time, the Downward trend in payment figures disclose a growth of exports figures in euro terms by 6.8% construction and over the first two months of 2003. installation continues The construction industry showed no signs of upturn, with its output down by 25.3% from the level of March 2002 and by 23.1% below the level observed one year ago. Similarly to January and February trends, the deterioration may be connected with the winter season, with temperatures considerably below the level of 2002. Seasonally adjusted data with respect to the analysis of economic performance conducted by the Central Statistical Office in the end of March 2003 on a sample of approx. 6 thousand companies indicate that, since the beginning of 2003, we have been facing a general downward trend in the processing and construction industry and in trade. Positive opinions as to However, there are many differences in the opinions expressed by the the prospective trends in respondents from each of the above-mentioned sections on their economic the processing industry situation: - in the processing industry  in most cases, positive opinions and forecasts prevail, - in the construction industry  pessimistic views prevail, while comments about the future display optimistic tendency, - in trade - all comments are bleak (both those concerning current situation and the near future), with general market climate ratio the lowest within the whole period covered by the analysis. The construction sector shows slightly more optimism with respect to the No signs of favourable present and future market situation than the trade sector. In March 2003, trends in construction both sectors displayed negative values for the majority of market trends; and trade ratios which indicate that most of respondents were pessimistic when expressing their opinion about demand, output and financial standing of companies. They have shown more optimism when forecasting market developments in the next three months than when assessing current market situation. Research into processing industry points to the positive value of the general consumer confidence index observed for the past three months owing to optimistic forecasts. In March 2003, the majority of respondents agreed that there had been a drop in demand (domestic and foreign) and production, coupled by the deterioration of their overall economic 4 conditions and the potential for on-going settlement of financial liabilities. However, the opinions were not as negative as those expressed 12 and 24 months ago. Entrepreneurs from the industrial processing sectors remained very optimistic about the nearest future (ratios become positive, excluding those related to the employment growth perspectives). The respondents link growing production and prospective improvement of their economic situation with the optimistic forecast regarding the domestic demand pattern. What draws attention is the number of companies signalling a deterioration in their financial condition exceeding the number of companies which believe that their financial standing has improved (to some respect, it also applied to the industrial processing companies). The construction companies anticipate substantial cuts in prices, while processing and trade companies forecast that the prices will grow. In all sections, entrepreneurs share the same opinion on the prolonging downward trend in employment. The first figures collected by the Central Statistical Office with respect to April market trends indicate some improvements in the confidence not only in the processing but also in the construction industry. The trade sector remains pessimistic about future developments. II. Situation of public sector finance Government revenue in the first quarter of 2003 was higher by 6.6% compared to the same period in 2002. A relatively high growth in the receipts from personal income tax (109.3%) and indirect taxes (106.9%) was observed. 40% of the planned Growth in the revenue from personal income tax can be attributed to state budget deficit after additional receipts from the increase in salaries financed from the state and the 1st quarter 2003 local budgets, pensions and invalidity benefits indexed to the inflation rate as well as from extended tax base in consequence of introducing tax on return on some money capitals. Increased revenues in indirect taxation were attributable to such factors as revenues generated from the excise tax on electricity that was introduced after the first quarter of 2002. However, revenues from corporate income tax remain low. The amount that entered the state budget within the first three months of 2003 remained by 5.6% below the amount collected in the same period of 2002. Lower nominal value of CIT stems from such factors as lowering the CIT rate by 1 percentage point (to 27%) as at the year beginning and introduction of preferential depreciation rate on newly purchased fixed assets. In the period covered by the report, high growth of revenues other than from taxes was observed. Their rise of 15% when compared to the same period of 2002 was partially affected by the additional revenues from the restructuring fee. After three months of 2003, the annual revenue plan of the state budget was executed in 21.4%, remaining below the result achieved in the 5 preceding years. In the first quarter of 2003, the state budget expenditures reached approx. PLN 48.8bn, i.e. 2.3% above the former yearâs result. They accounted for 25.1% of the plan included in the Budget Act, i.e. below the level observed in the preceding years. In consequence, the budget deficit amounted to approx. PLN 15.5bn. Deficit in the public translating into 40% utilisation of the annual limit i.e. also below the figure finance sector in 2003 disclosed one year ago. may be higher than To summarise, there are no indications in the state budget results after planned March 2003 that the limit of the deficit defined in the Budget Act will be exceeded. However, the continuing unfavourable situation of the Social Security Fund and the Agricultural Market Agency may aggravate the economic deficit of the public sector finances. III. Money supply, loans, interest rates, exchange rate In March 2003, the nominal M3 money supply fell by 0.05% below March witnessed a fall that of February 2003. Taking substantial changes in exchange rates in money supply observed in March 2003 into account, monthly drop of M3 was higher and reached 0.6%. The annual growth rate in M3 reached 0.5% to fall by  0.05% after elimination of exchange rate differences. The drop in M3 money supply stemmed from the diminishing deposits of households, corporates and non-monetary financial institutions. The annual growth rate in cash money of 13.8% in March 2003 remains at a level similar to that observed in preceding months. Compared to the end of February result. March 2003 witnesses a substantial rise in total amounts due by 1.3%. However, it stemmed primarily from foreign exchange differences. After elimination of exchange rate differences, monthly rise in this category was as low as 0.1%. Within Low demand for loans one month, amounts due from corporations rose by 2%; however, as much as 60% of the rise resulted from weakening of the zloty. After foreign exchange differences, amounts due from coporates grew by 0.8%. Amounts due from households rose by 1.9%; the rise was equal to 0.9% after foreign exchange differences. In general, the March figures confirm a prolonging low demand for loans both in the corporate and household sector. March 2003 saw a discernible weakening of the zloty by reason of intensifying political conflicts in Poland. Compared to February, the zloty depreciated by 3.8% against the euro and by 3.6% against the dollar. The nominal effective exchange ratio dropped by 3.5%, while effective actual Zloty weaker in March exchange rate depreciated as follows: exchange rate deflated with the CPI index by 3.3% and with the PPI in industrial processing by 3%, respectively. At the beginning of April 2003, the zloty was gradually gaining ground. 6 IV. Prices, inflationary expectations Annual CPI reached In March 2003, the twelve-month CPI rose by 0.1% above the 0.6% previous two monthsâ figures. The trend was helped by a substantial increase in transport costs, stemming from continued increases in private vehicle fuel prices as well as housing costs and power carriers. Prices of foodstuffs, non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages and tobacco products as well as articles of clothing and shoes continued to contribute to the drop of the twelve-month CPI. March witnessed sustenance of the growing trend in the PPI. Compared to the same month 2002, production costs rose by 3.4%. The rise Continued increase in observed both in March and in the first quarter 2003 are chiefly attributable production costs to zloty depreciation and increase in oil prices on global markets. In April 2003, the inflation rate expected by bank analysts in the month preceding the same month of next year (i.e. March 2004) rose by 0.1 percentage point to reach 2.2%, whilst the average annual inflation rate Low inflationary projected for 2004 was equal to 2.1% i.e. remained 0.3 percentage point expectations of private below March 2003 estimations. At the same time, the expected inflation individuals and bank rate as at the end of 2003 amounted to 2.0%, i.e. 0.4 percentage point below analysts March forecast. Inflationary expectations of private individuals remain unchanged. The individuals expect prices to grow by 0.4% this year i.e. at the level of March 2003."
Israel,2003-04-28,"The Bank of Israel's Monetary Program for May 2003 The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for May 2003, according to which the interest rate willbe reduced by 0.3 percentage points, to 8.4 percent. In the last few months, one-year inflation expectations derived from the capital market declined, and at about 2 percent they are currently in the middle of the inflation target set by the government. Inflation expectations for the second year ahead and beyond have also declined by about one percentage point, but most of them are still above the target. Private forecasters' predictions of 12-month inflation have also dropped and are close to the lower limit of the target range. In addition, the models developed by the Bank of Israel indicate that it is possible to attain the target of price stability while reducing the short-term interest rate. It appears that the calm in the markets, expressed in the appreciation of the NIS and the reduction of more than one percentage pointin unindexed long-term interest rates, may be explained mainly by reduced uncertainty following the rapid conclusion of the war in Iraq and progress made regarding the receipt of guarantees from the US government. Nevertheless, there is still considerable uncertainty in view of the difficulties in the implementation of budget policy and the assessment that the deficit this year and in the next few years will be higher than the path set by the government, making greater caution necessary in interest-rate policy. There is much uncertainty about the extent to which government decisions on the size of budget cuts will be implemented. There are indications that the cuts in some budget items are onlytemporary and many questions remain regarding the convergence to a downward sloping deficit path and a reducing government debt/GDP ratio. Fiscal discipline is essential for the transfer of sources from private savings to investment and credit, for the preservation of Israel's rating in the international markets, for the continued reduction of long-term interest on government bonds, and hence for the reduction of interest on credit for investment and mortgages that is so important for renewed growth and the encouragement of employment. Further cuts in the short-term interest rate while maintaining price stability depend to a great extent on the public's confidence in the government's ability to ensure fiscal discipline for the current yearand for the medium term, discipline that is also required to strengthen the financial system. Price stability is characterized by relatively low volatility of the monthly indices, and as yet this is not evident in Israel. With the rapid end of the war in Iraq calm returned to the foreign currency market, reflected in NIS appreciation of some 2.6 percent in March and almost 2 percent during April (the exchange rate is similar to that in the first quarter of 2002), and in a reduction in exchange-rate risk as evidenced recently by the fall to below 8 percent in the standard deviation as measured by the prices of Bank of Israel options, compared with close to 10 percent two months ago. With the end of the Iraq war Israel's country risk premium in the markets declined: the interest-rate differentials between Israeli government bonds traded abroad and US government bonds fell by more than 50 basis points, and the premium is currently 1.0 percentage points for half a year and about 1.4 percentage points for ten years, compared with 1.6 and 2.0 percentage points respectivelya month ago. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the markets, in order to ensure that the inflation rate defined as price stability is maintained while bolstering financial stability. Subject to these conditions, the Bank will act to support the government's policy to foster employment and shorten the recession. Note that the risk premium is characterized by volatility which is sometimes caused by factors related to Israel's economy, by developments in financial markets abroad and by changes in the degree of tradability in those markets. *** The Open Market Committee of the US Federal Reserve is due to convene on 6 May 2003 for its regular review of interest-rate policy.

Peru,2003-05-06,"Press Release BOARD OF THE CENTRAL BANK APPROVED MONETARY PROGRAM FOR MAY 2004 REFERENCE INTEREST RATE IS KEPT AT 2,50% In April the Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) decreased 0.02 percent. Cumulative inflation through last 12 month reached 2.78 percent, similar to March (2.76 percent). Core inflation, a price indicator that excludes high volatility items was 2.35 percent over last 12 months. As mentioned in January Inflation Report, inflation was expected to rise temporarily over the first months of the year due to the increase in the international prices of some foods and fuels as well as a shortage in domestic agricultural supply. Once these shocks were over in April, inflation forecasts converged to low monthly rates until the end of the year. Inflation might fall out of the target range in some months, due to the supply shock during the I quarter 2004 and the fact that inflation was negative in similar months over 2003. Cumulative inflation at the end of the year is expected to meet the target range. The average interbank interest rate was 2.49 percent in April, similar to March (2.48 percent). For May, the Board of the Central Bank decided to maintain the reference interest rates for monetary operations off auction: 3.25 percent: for direct repos and monetary regulation credits 1.75 percent: for overnight deposits. The monetary operations regarding injection or withdrawal of liquidity by means of auctions will be made in order to place the interbank interest rate in the center of this corridor of reference interest rates (2,50 percent). In case the market interbank interest rate be higher than 3.25 percent, monetary regulation credits and direct repos will be charged with the market interbank interest rate. For May, the forecasted range for the daily average balance of banks' deposits held at BCRP is 170  190 million. This balance is neither a target nor a monetary policy stance indicator, since it is also affected by seasonal factors as well as liquidity demand changes. The interest rates for Central Bankâs operations in dollars are: Monetary regulation credits: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point Overnight deposits: an interest rate equivalent to the rate for similar BCRP's deposits held abroad Swaps, the commission that implies a minimum annual effective cost of 3.25 percent is maintained June Monetary Program will be approved in the Board of Directors meeting of June 3, 2004."
United States,2003-05-06,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided to keep its target for the federal funds rate unchanged at 1-1/4 percent. Recent readings on production and employment, though mostly reflecting decisions made before the conclusion of hostilities, have proven disappointing. However, the ebbing of geopolitical tensions has rolled back oil prices, bolstered consumer confidence, and strengthened debt and equity markets. These developments, along with the accommodative stance of monetary policy and ongoing growth in productivity, should foster an improving economic climate over time. Although the timing and extent of that improvement remain uncertain, the Committee perceives that over the next few quarters the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth are roughly equal. In contrast, over the same period, the probability of an unwelcome substantial fall in inflation, though minor, exceeds that of a pickup in inflation from its already low level. The Committee believes that, taken together, the balance of risks to achieving its goals is weighted toward weakness over the foreseeable future.

Philippines,2003-05-07,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board, the policy-making body of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), left the BSP's policy interest rates unchanged at 7 percent for the overnight borrowing rate and 9.25 percent for the overnight lending rate. The BSP's policy rates have been on hold for the past 14 months, with the rates last changed on 15 March 2002 when they were reduced by 25 basis points. In assessing the inflation environment and overall macroeconomic conditions, the Monetary Board noted that the inflation environment has continued to be benign in the first four months of 2003, with subdued demand conditions and stable food prices providing a counterbalance to price pressures from movements in oil prices and adjustments in utility charges. Going forward, average inflation is expected to be below the Government's target of 4.5-5.5 percent for 2003 and in line with the 4-5 percent target for 2004. This is based on the assessment that the current state of domestic demand continues to support a benign inflation setting, and supply-related influences such as the El NiÃ±o and fuel prices shown evident signs of tapering off. The subdued state of domestic demand is consistent with currently observed levels of unemployment and capacity utilization in key sectors such as manufacturing. Labor market conditions have also remained soft, with sizeable unemployment levels preventing strong calls from labor groups for wage adjustments. All of these factors suggest that broad-based price pressures are not evident. Against this backdrop, the Monetary Board believes that it would be prudent to maintain current monetary policy settings and keep policy interest rates steady. The key concern to the domestic macroeconomic environment at present appears to relate more to the moderate though improving pace of economic activity rather than to rising consumer prices. The stance of monetary policy will therefore continue to focus on providing a supportive environment that ensures sufficient liquidity to fuel the economy's growth requirements. However, monetary policy will also continue to be cautious so as to guard against any potential build-up of price pressures that could dampen the present growth momentum. The Monetary Board is scheduled to meet again to review the BSP's monetary policy settings on 5 June 2003."
Chile,2003-05-08,"THE CENTRAL BANK OF CHILE Press Release* Monthly Monetary Policy Meeting May 8, 2003 At its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided, by unanimous vote, to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 2.75% (annual). Although core inflation has been increasing in recent months, it is still within the previously projected ranges. For the short run, it is foreseen that the lower oil price and the evolution of the exchange rate will contribute to bring down inflation rates. Beyond these fluctuations, however, inflationary perspectives for the projection horizon standard in the setting of monetary policy remain in line with the midpoint of the target range. The latest indicators on economic performance confirm that the domestic economy is undergoing a phase of higher growth, consistent with the strong monetary stimulus that has been in place for some quarters. However, doubts persist on the future path of world economy, particularly in developed countries. The Central Bank of Chile reiterates that it will continue to conduct monetary policy with the necessary flexibility to address any projected inflation deviations in either direction from the specified target inflation rate."
Euroarea,2003-05-08,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. The first news I can report is that today we successfully concluded our discussions of the ECB's monetary policy strategy. However. I would ask you to postpone any questions you may have on this subject to a little later this afternoon. A press release will be issued on this matter and Mr. Issing will join us for a special press briefing in the form of a seminar on the outcome of our discussions. This seminar will take place in this room immediately after the press conference. You will also note that, as a consequence of the conclusions we reached. I have restructured today's introductory statement somewhat, and I will be following this new structure in the future. The introductory statement will henceforth present first economic analysis, followed by monetary analysis. It concludes by cross-checking the analyses conducted under these two pillars. Turning now to our discussion of monetary policy, we have decided to keep our key interest rates unchanged. Taking due account of new economic and monetary information as well as the latest geopolitical developments, we concluded that the current monetary policy stance remains consistent with the preservation of price stability over the medium term. At the same time it maintains a monetary environment that is conducive to economic growth. With the end of the military action in Iraq, important downside risks to the economic recovery have diminished, and our focus is now again on the other forces that have been shaping the economic outlook. The Governing Council will carefully monitor future developments and assess whether conditions for price stability continue to develop favourably. In the context of our economic analysis, focusing on the short to medium term, recently published survey data and the latest information from conjunctural indicators suggest that economic activity in the euro area has remained subdued so far this year. Looking ahead, we continue to expect a gradual strengthening of real GDP growth to start later in 2003 and to gather more pace in the course of next year. Factors supporting this outlook are an expected recovery of global demand, the prospect of falling inflation benefiting real disposable income growth, and the low level of interest rates. Moreover, the recent unwinding of uncertainties associated with geopolitical tensions should contribute to an economic recovery. Such an assessment also seems to be reflected in recent financial market reactions. Since the end of the war in Iraq, financial market volatility has declined significantly, with a notable increase in stock prices. First, there are the risks originating from the past accumulation of macroeconomic imbalances outside the euro area, and lately concerns have arisen with regard to the SARS virus. Moreover, there is also some uncertainty over the extent of the adjustment still needed in the euro area corporate sector in order to enhance productivity and profitability, which could have an impact on employment growth and thus private consumption. As regards price developments, the annual rate of HICP inflation generally fluctuated at around 2.3-2.4% between the autumn of last year and March 2003. Broadly speaking, declining inflation rates in services and non-energy industrial goods have been offset by rising rates in energy and processed food prices. Conversely, in April energy prices are expected to reflect the decline in oil prices following the developments in Iraq. This expectation is in line with Eurostat's flash estimate for the inflation rate in April, which was 2.1%, i.e. 0.3 percentage point lower than in March. Looking ahead, current indications do not point to further strong declines in the inflation rate in the immediate future, but lower oil prices, an environment of moderate economic growth and, of course, the effects of the significantly higher exchange rate of the euro should all contribute to reducing inflationary pressure beyond the short term. The outlook for inflation will also depend to a significant extent on wage developments. The available indicators suggest that labour cost growth has shown signs of stabilising in the course of 2002. Moderate wage trends are indeed crucial both to maintain price stability and to foster employment growth. In the context of our monetary analysis, focusing on the medium to long term, the broad monetary aggregate M3 has now been growing strongly over a protracted period. Moreover, the data for more recent months do not suggest that a process of correction has started. As a consequence, the euro area economy continued to accumulate liquidity significantly above the amount needed to sustain non-inflationary growth The strong monetary expansion contrasted with the more moderate growth in loans to the private sector. This is consistent with our assessment that monetary developments continue to be fostered by portfolio shifts, reflecting a sustained preference on the part of investors for liquid and secure assets in an environment of high uncertainty. However, the low level of interest rates has also contributed to strong monetary growth. When interpreting monetary trends, particular account needs to be taken of the portfolio shifts towards increased demand for monetary assets for precautionary reasons. The reduction in geopolitical tensions should support an unwinding of these portfolio shifts. A reversal in monetary trends would in any case dampen the concerns regarding the medium to long-term implications of recent monetary dynamics. As a consequence, monetary developments will continue to be monitored closely. Overall, it currently appears that inflation rates should decline to below 2% over the medium term, in particular given the outlook for economic activity and the significant appreciation of the euro. It also appears that the strong expansion of M3 should not adversely affect this outlook, as portfolio shifts have played a prominent role; in particular, the build up of liquidity should not translate into inflationary pressure as long as economic growth remains modest. Hence, cross-checking the information from the two pillars leads us to conclude that the risks to price stability over the medium term remain limited. Regarding fiscal policy, developments in 2002 were generally not satisfactory. In particular, countries that had not achieved sound fiscal positions in earlier years when the economic conditions were more favourable are now struggling to keep their budgets under control. Looking ahead, it is crucial to underpin the fiscal policy framework with decisive action, strong peer pressure and consistent implementation of the rules of the Treaty and of the Stability and Growth Pact. Countries should maintain budgetary positions close to balance or in surplus over the cycle, and, where this is not yet the case, take the required structural consolidation measures. This also creates the necessary room for the operation of automatic stabilisers. At the same time, governments are advised to place the emphasis on growth-oriented consolidation policies that strengthen the productive forces of the economy. By strengthening confidence, a credible medium-term fiscal consolidation strategy will also support economic growth in the short term. Finally, structural reforms are essential to increase the euro area's growth potential and enhance its ability to better withstand external shocks. Indeed, such reforms, which should aim to reduce rigidities in labour and goods markets, could significantly strengthen the degree of resilience of economic activity to such shocks, both in the euro area as a whole and in its regions. Renewed momentum in the process of structural reform will be important to foster consumer and investor confidence in medium and long-term growth and employment opportunities in the euro area. This, in turn, should also have a positive short-term effect on spending and investment decisions in the euro area."
Peru,2003-05-08,"BANCO CENTRAL DE RESERVA DEL PERU Press Release MONETARY PROGRAM APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF THE BANK FOR MAY 2003 In April, the Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima was 0,05 percent, with a last 12 month inflation of 2,6 percent. The monthly decrease reflected the decline in foodstuffs prices. On the other hand, underlying inflation, which excludes high volatility items from the CPI basket, such as fuels, was 0,03 percent in April and 1,6 percent through last 12 months. For the remain of the year. CPI projections indicate lower inflationary pressures. The Central Bank will continue monitoring the general prices behaviour in order to attain the end-of-year inflation target of 2,5 percent with a 1 percent tolerance (up or down). For May, the Board of the Bank decided to maintain borrowing and lending interest rates for Central Bank operations at: 4,25 percent: for monetary regulation credits and direct temporary purchases of BCR's securities. 3,0 percent: for commercial banks' overnight deposits at the. In April, the average interbank interest rate was 3,8 percent, similar to those prevailing since last December (3,8 percent). The interest rate for rediscount operations and direct temporary purchase of securities will be the interbank market interest rate, when this one be higher than 4,25 percent. For May, the estimated range for commercial banks' current account balances held at the Central Bank is 190 million to 210 million, on a daily basis. In April, this balance was 211 million (whereas the estimated range was 190 million to 210 million). Considering this banking liquidity amount, the average interbank interest rate was 3,8 percent. The following interest rates will be used in foreign-currency operations: The effective annual rate for monetary regulation credits will be the 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point. For overnight deposits held by banks at the Central Bank, the rate is equivalent to the average obtained by the Central Bank for similar deposits abroad. For foreign exchange temporary purchase operations (swap operations), the commission is maintained at an implicit effective annual cost of 4,25 percent."
South Korea,2003-05-13,"The economic slowdown has become more evident, as demonstrated by contracting production and accumulating inventories amid the sluggish domestic demand. In addition, the negative effects of the tensions over North Korea's nuclear program and the spread of SARS have gradually emerged. Consumer price inflation has eased substantially due to the decline of international oil prices and the stable movements of agricultural product prices, and the current account deficit is estimated to have narrowed thanks to strong exports accompanied by slower import growth. Housing prices, however, have shown a relatively rapid rise, driven by hikes in the prices of some apartments that may be possibly slated for reconstruction. Financial markets have regained their stability. Fund-raising conditions for corporations with lower credit-ratings, however, have become tighter, due to the continued mood of a flight-to-quality caused by increased sensitivity to credit risk. Taking these points into consideration and in order to avoid an overly sharp contraction of economic activities, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower its target for the overnight call rate from 4., 25 per cent to 4., 0 per cent. While it is expected the determined measures announced by government to stabilize the real estate market will be effective in calming down housing prices, a close eye should be kept on movements of real estate markets and more resolute actions should be taken if necessary."
Israel,2003-05-26,"The Bank of Israel's Monetary Program for June 2003. In the last few months, the decline in one-year inflation expectations derived from the capital market persisted, and they are close to the lower limit of the government's price-stability target (1-3 percent). Inflation expectations for the second year ahead and beyond have also declined, and for most years are now within the target range. Private forecasters' predictions of 12-month inflation are within the range of 1-2 percent, and the models developed by the Bank of Israel indicate that it is possible to attain the inflation target for the coming year and the following year while continuing to reduce the interest rate. The reduction in risk was reflected in the strengthening of the NIS in the last few months and in the continued reduction of the interest rates on unindexed long-term government bonds to about 8.5 percent, down from its peak of about 11.7 percent in February 2003. These developments may be explained mainly by the reduced regional political uncertainty following the conclusion of the war in Iraq and confirmation of the guarantees from the US government. Nevertheless, there is still considerable uncertainty regarding the effects of the implementation of the government's economic program and there is concern that despite the budget cuts, the deficit this year and in the next few years will be higher than the path set by the government. If this does occur, long-term interest will be unable to achieve its full potential reduction, which is necessary to encourage investment and growth in theeconomy. Although the economic program halts the deterioration of the fiscal situation, nevertheless in the light of thetemporary nature of the cuts in some budget items (and the acceptance of agovernment deficit of 5 percent of GDP in 2003), the program does not ensure convergence to a downward path for the deficit and for the debt/GDP ratio, and at this stage is inconsistent with the government decision to adhereto the downward path of the deficit from 3 percent of GDP in 2003 to one percent in 2007. In planning the budget for 2004, therefore, the government must revert to the deficit targets set and to a downward-sloping path for the debt/GDP ratio. Fiscal discipline is an essential requisite for the ability to attract sources from private savings into investment and credit, forthe continued reduction of long-term interest on government bonds, and hence for the reduction of interest on credit for investment and mortgages that is so important for renewed growth and the encouragement of employment. Structural reforms passed by the government, the implementation of which canboost economic growth, are of great importance. In this context, the pensions reform that diverts the pension funds into the capital market with the intention of encouraging investment and growth will be unable to attain itsobjective without a reduction in the government deficit, which will enablesources of finance to be allocated to private-sector investments. Further cuts in the short-term interest rate while maintaining price stability depend to a great extent on the government's ability to ensure fiscal discipline for the current year and for the medium term, discipline that is also required to strengthen the financial system. The Bank of Israel keeps a watchful eye on exchange-rate developments, and in particular analyses their implications for the inflation rate, but it is a long time since the exchange rateat any level, its trend, or its volatility have in themselves constituted targets for monetary policy. Furthermore, the high level of functioning of the foreign-currency market currently encourages the development of financial instruments that provide protection against exchange-rate risk, thus offering companies and individuals improved protection against the risks inherent in the natural volatility of the market. This trend of hedging against risks of exchange-rate volatility has in fact been evident in the behavior of the business sector, including exporters, in the last few years. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the markets, in order to ensure that the inflation rate defined as price stability is maintained while bolstering financial stability. Subject to these conditions, the Bank will act to support the government's policy to foster employment and shorten the recession. Changes in NIS and dollar interest rates. ISRAEL.

Poland,2003-05-28,"Warsaw, 28 May 2003 INFORMATION FOLLOWING THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 27-28 May 2003 The Monetary Policy Council held a meeting on 27-28 May 2003,. The Council reviewed documents drawn up by the NBP as well as information and analytical documents from the Ministry of Finance, banks and research institutes. The Council discussed the current situation in the external environment of the Polish economy and trends in real values, wages and social benefits, public finance, money supply, loans and interest rates as well as the evolving scenario of inflation, price changes and inflationary perspectives. Decision of the Monetary Policy Council New economic information that has appeared since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Council indicates that: I In April 2003, the low inflation level continues. The following factors limiting the future growth of inflation strengthened: (cid:1)(cid:2)the industrial output price index declined, (cid:1)(cid:2)indices of core inflation continued to shrink, the most reliable index  net annual inflation  reached 1.2% in April, 0.2 of a point down on March; (cid:1)(cid:2)the inflationary expectations of natural persons and bank analysts stabilised at a low level; (cid:1)(cid:2)moderate wage growth was maintained. The faster growth in April mainly stemmed from the low baseline. This April, the average wage increased sharply (including wages in the following sectors: production and supply of electricity, natural gas and water and in postal and telecom services) while in 2002 this peak had been observed one month earlier. II. Symptoms of a gradual economic recovery became stronger: (cid:1)(cid:2)Industrial output grew by 8.3% year on year this April. After an adjustment for seasonal effects, the total industrial output growth amounted to 5.6%, and that of the processing industry to 6.6%; (cid:1)(cid:2)Retail sales increased by 11% year on year this April, having fallen by 1.7% this March, and in this March and April, the growth was 4.0% as compared to the corresponding period a year ago; (cid:1)(cid:2)The financial results of enterprises showed a clear improvement in Q1; (cid:1)(cid:2)In Q1 of this year, exports grew by 30.6% in USD terms and by 6.6% in euro terms compared to the first quarter of last year; (cid:1)(cid:2)The assessment of the future condition of the construction and processing industries improved; (cid:1)(cid:2)Construction output continued to fall, but the monthly rate of this fall had clearly slowed; in addition, contractors for construction finishing jobs reported business almost 40% higher this April than a year ago, while the output of companies preparing land for development almost doubled. III. The potential sources of long-term inflationary pressures comprise: (cid:1)(cid:2)The probability of exceeding the economic deficit of the public finance sector as projected in the draft 2003 budget act and uncertainty as to fiscal policy in 2004; (cid:1)(cid:2)Cash in circulation continued to rise quickly. The annual growth rate of this aggregate has been fluctuating around the level of 15% since the middle of last year; (cid:1)(cid:2)World petroleum prices may increase. In May, the forecast of the 2003 annual average price of this raw material was increased. The Council also took account of the scale of interest rates cuts made so far, the delayed impact of which will cause domestic demand to gradually increase in the second half of 2003 and in 2004. 2 The Monetary Policy Council has decided as follows: The National Bank of Poland shall enter into 14-day open market transactions at a rate of return no lower than 5.50% per annum; The lombard loan interest rate shall be cut from 7.25% to 7.00% per annum; The interest rate on time placements accepted by NBP from banks shall amount to 4.00% per annum; The bill-of-exchange rediscounting rate shall be cut from 6.25% to 6.00% per annum. The Council maintains a neutral approach to monetary policy. The Council has also taken the following resolutions: - to accept the âReport on the fulfilment of monetary policy guidelines in 2002â; - to approve the âReport on the activities of the National Bank of Poland in 2002â. The Council accepted the ""2002 inflation reportâ. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Council is scheduled for 24-25 June 2003. Economic situation assessment This April, optimism among Euro-zone companies continued to A lack of deteriorate; indices reflecting the condition of industry and the investment optimism among demand in this sector fell (Reuter's PMI fell to 47.8 pts in April from 48.4 Euro-zone pts in March. IFO dropped to 86.6 pts from 88.1 pts). In May. IFO grew companies slightly to 87.6 pts. German GDP figures for Q1 point to stagnation; market analysts and main research institutes project that this trend will be maintained until the Weak economic end of this year. This is confirmed by the negative data on current activity in economic activity in Germany (in March, industrial production fell, as did Germany industrial purchasing and retail sales, while the number of unemployed increased). In the USA, consumer sentiment clearly improved this April (the Michigan university index rose to 86 points from 77.6 at the end of March), but this has yet to be reflected in business climate (the ISM confidence index slid to 45.4 pts in April from 46.2 in March). After a sharp drop in March, petroleum prices stabilised in April. Oil prices stabilise The average price was USD 24.9 per barrel. USD 5.4 down on March in April 2003 and USD 0.7 lower than in April 2002. The lower price level was mainly caused by the end of the military action in Iraq and the relatively light damage to the oil infrastructure of that country. In May petroleum In May, oil prices remained at around USD 26 per barrel. The prices grow again average price was USD 0.7 up on April. May forecasts indicate that in 2003, the annual average price of petroleum will be USD 26.8 per barrel. The May price growth probably means that the forecast of annual average High industrial oil prices will be raised in June. output growth in In April, industrial output rose at a rate last seen in Q3 2000. Even April though there was one working day less this April than a year ago, the total industrial output was higher by 8.3%, with output of the processing industry up by 10.2%. This strong acceleration, in comparison to the 5.5% growth reported in March, was almost entirely attributable to a very high increase in the sales of food products and beverages  up 15.1%. This was an effect of the late Easter, which changed the dates when retailers purchase foodstuffs and beverages from the food industry. This sector accounts for 20% of the total industrial output and 25% of the processing industry output. Had the food industry production grown at the same rate in April as in previous months, sold industrial output would have risen by 5.8% year-on-year in that month. The April figures had a significant impact on the trends of industrial production volume and processing industry production volume reported after March. Following a period of moderate growth in the entire industry and of stabilisation in processing, a clear rising trend of production volume developed after April. Growth highest in Apart from the exceptionally high increase in the food industry, sectors producing trends in specific industrial sectors have not changed significantly. The for export 4 greatest rises were seen in sectors which have a high and growing markets proportion of export sales (office automation and computer manufacturing, furniture and other production, production of electric machines and instruments, chemicals). Sub-zero temperatures at the beginning of April contributed to the continued drastic fall in construction output, but this fall was lower than in March (13.5% against 25.3%). The internal structure of the construction industry may, however, indicate a certain change in its situation. Compared to the coresponding period last year, this April finishing job contractors reported a 39.7% increase in sales, while the output of companies preparing land for development jumped almost twofold. These production trends were reflected in the financial results of Better company companies. According to preliminary data, the enterprises analysed by the earnings figures in Central Office of Statistics (GUS) achieved after tax earnings of about Q1 2003 PLN 3.1bn in Q1 (against PLN 1.7bn last year). The higher earnings were a result of the sales of products, goods and materials growing faster than costs. In the cost structure, the proportion of gross wages, social insurance contributions and other benefits fell. Better financial results and profitability ratios were recorded in industrial processing, the power industry and the rest of the service sector, while mining, construction and distribution reported worsening figures. The number of companies reporting export sales increased to almost 40% of the total (against 37% a year ago). In 20% of these enterprises, export sales accounted for more than 75% of total sales. The economic situation of exporters improved compared to a year ago, and their basic productivity ratios were better than in the overall analysed population of companies. April production figures indicate that this trend could be maintained in the next quarter, thus boosting the recovery in Better business investments. climate The results of the research on the economic trends conducted by the assessments in Central Office of Statistics at the end of April 2003, using a sample of construction and around 6 thousand enterprises, show that business climate improved processing significantly compared to March in the construction sector, while it industry remained unchanged in industrial processing. For these two sectors, it also shows a significant improvement on April last year and two years ago (particularly for processing). The standing of processing companies strengthened, though some detailed indices still remained negative. In comparison to assessments expressed in previous years in April, opinions on demand (including foreign demand), sold output and the ability to pay financial liabilities on time were better this April than in the entire period from 1998 to 2002. Industrial processing representatives continued to be very hopeful about the near future. Their assessments were better this April than in April last year and two years ago, though the majority of positive forecasts was smaller than in March. Respondents continue to link growing production and the future improvement of their standing with Worse business positive forecasts for domestic demand. climate Unlike in the processing industry and construction, the business assessments in climate in distribution was not only assessed negatively (even though the distribution 5 majority of negative assessments was slightly smaller than in March) but actually this assessment was the worst ever recorded in April of any year covered by this research. II. Situation of the public finance sector This April, the financial situation of the State budget was better than in the respective period last year. Tax revenues growing by 6.9% and spending increasing only slightly - by 0.3% - meant that the proportion of the actual budget deficit to that planned in the budget act was lower than last April. High growth was observed both in indirect tax revenues (109.3%) and in personal taxes (116.7%). The high indirect tax receipts were partially a result of the new system of quarterly VAT settlement by small and medium enterprises, which shifts VAT receipts to the first month of every quarter. Greater personal income tax receipts are attributable to the additional revenue created by salary raises in the public sector and the indexing of old-age and disability pensions as of March, as well as to higher receipts from the tax on selected capital gains. In contrast, the revenues from corporate income tax are low. This April, the State budget received approximately 18.1% less revenue on this account than in the respective period last year. Factors bringing down the volume of CIT included the 1% cut in the rate of this tax at the beginning of this year (down to 72%) and the introduction of a preferential depreciation rate for new fixed assets. After four months of 2003, the revenues of the State budget were 7.0% higher in nominal terms than in the respective period of 2002, while the actual execution of the annual plan reached almost 30%, as in last year. Public spending stood at PLN 64.4bn after four months of 2003 and was up only 1.8% on the expenditure in the respective period of last year, 46.6% of the while the proportion occupied by planning implementation was much planned State lower than in previous years. budged deficit All of this brought the budget deficit to some PLN 18.0bn, which after April 2003 means that approximately 46.6% of the annual limit was used. This is less than in previous years. After four months of this year, an unfavourable situation was The economic reported by the Social Insurance Fund (FUS) and the National Health Fund deficit of the (NFZ). Because of low receipts. FUS increased its liabilities to the banking public finance system (by some PLN 0.8 on December of last year). The receipts of health sector may be contributions are also lower than planned, which means that there may be a higher than shortage of funds available to the National Health Fund for financing the planned in 2003 requirements of health service institutions. If expenditures are not reduced, this may lead to a further increase in the long-term liabilities of the health service. In summary, it can be said that the results of the State budget after April 2003 do not indicate any danger of exceeding the statutory deficit limit set for 2003. However, the difficult situation of the Social Insurance Board and the National Health Fund may increase the economic deficit of h bli fi 6 the public finance sector. III. Money supply, loans, interest and exchange rates Lower money According to preliminary data, the M3 money supply decreased in supply in April April 2003 by PLN 0.4bn compared to the end of March (-0.1%). Changes in the M3 aggregate were significantly affected by exchange rate volatility  if this effect were removed. M3 would increase by PLN 1.6bn in April (0.5%). The annual M3 growth has been accelerating slightly for four months  it amounted to 0.8% at the end of April 2003. The monthly increase of cash in circulation, usually observed in April, was very high this year and amounted to PLN 1.8bn (4%), which is the highest monthly growth of this measure since December 2001. At the same time, the M1 aggregate declined by PLN 5.8bn (-4.3%), which was a result of some current deposits being moved to higher interest time deposits because of the long May weekend. In subsequent months, they can be expected to return to current accounts incorporated in M1. Household In April, household deposits fell by PLN 2.5bn (-1.3%), but if the deposits continue effect of exchange rate differences is excluded, this fall was only PLN to shrink 0.9bn (-0.4%). These figures show the continuing tendency of households to reduce the assets they keep in the banking system. Corporate deposits went up by PLN 0.5bn (1%) in April, and if the effect of exchange rate differences were excluded, this growth would amount to PLN 0.9bn (1.8%). The annual growth rate of corporate deposits remained at 11.5%, a value similar as in March. The total claims of the banking system, comprising mainly loans, decreased by PLN 1.3bn between the end of March and April 2003 (-0.5%), but this drop was a result of exchange rate movements. If their effect were excluded, the total claims would rise by PLN 1.4bn (0.5%) in April. The annual rate of growth of claims on corporations and households did not change significantly, as both measures were rising at some 7% in nominal terms. A substantial increase (PLN 0.8bn, 24.7%) was observed in Zloty strengthens the claims on social insurance funds as a result of the indebtedness of the in April but Social Insurance Board. depreciates again In April 2003, the zloty gradually appreciated against both the euro in relation to the and the American dollar (the average monthly zloty to euro exchange rate euro in May was 4.30 against 4.32 in March. PLN/USD 3.96 compared to 4.00 in March). In the first half of May 2003, movements of the euro/American dollar exchange rate had a strong influence on the exchange rate of the zloty. As euro appreciation speeded up on the global market, the zloty weakened in relation to the common currency. Annual CPI at IV. Prices, inflation expectations 0.3% In April 2003, 12-month inflation dropped to 0.3% against 0.6% in March 2003, mainly as a result of fuel prices, domestic running expenses and energy prices growing more slowly than a month ago. CPI continued to be brought down by the prices of food products and non-alcoholic 7 beverages, liquors, tobacco, clothing and footwear. The scale of these groups' impact on the CPI had been steady since the beginning of the year. Net annual inflation was 1.2% in April 2003, 0.2% down on the previous month. The monthly ânetâ inflation rate was the same a month ago: 0.1%. In April 2003, the annual growth rate of the PPI amounted to 2.9% Production price against 3.6% in March. In comparison to the previous month, the prices of growth lower than industrial output fell by 0.4%, while they rose by 0.9% in March. a month earlier The slower PPI growth stemmed from the falling prices in industrial processing (mainly in coking and petroleum refining, where prices fell by 11%). This decline was mainly a result of lower oil prices on the world market. Had oil prices not gone down and the zloty not weakened, annual PPI growth in April 2003 would have been 3.1%-3.2%. Slight increase in private In May, the distribution of responses to the Ipsos-Demoskop individuals' questionnaire used to analyse the inflation expectations of private inflationary individuals deteriorated in terms of its impact on quantifying the expected expectations inflation rate. Combined with the increasing current inflation rate, this led to a slight increase in the quantified measure of inflation expectations, which went up to 0.5% (i.e. up 0.1% compared to April figures). In May, only a very small number of banks participated in the Low inflation Reuter's questionnaire, which limits the comparability of results. In May expectations of 2003, bank analysts projected that the rate of inflation in April 2004 would bank analysts be 2.0%, 0.2 point lower than their views of a month earlier. The average annual inflation rate for 2004 was estimated at 2.4%, 0.3 points higher than in April. On the contrary, the projected inflation rate for the end of 2003 was 1.7%, i.e. 0.3% less than in April."
Thailand,2003-06-02,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 2 June 2003 Mr. Bandid Nijathaworn. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand announced that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance going forward. The main issues discussed were as follows: 1. The MPC reviewed the latest data on economic conditions in Thailand and deemed that economic growth in the first 4 months of 2003 was satisfactory. Industrial production expanded significantly, income from major crops increased stronglyâreflecting both higher prices and volume, export grew robustly, while domestic demand continued to improve. However tourism and hotel activity was severely impacted by the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). In addition, private consumption showed signs of moderating, private investment growth remained modest, and government expenditures expanded more slowly than expected. External stability remained strong with international reserves at a high level and further declines in foreign debt. The current account remained in surplus, but at a smaller level as sharp reductions in tourism revenue lowered the services account, while the income and current transfers balances also declined. The baht appreciated as the US dollar weakened but remained in line with other regional currencies. The economic recovery thus far had not generated perceptible upward pressure on prices with headline inflation edging up to 19 per cent in May 2003 compared to 16 per cent in April. Core inflation remained subdued at 01 per cent compared to 02 per cent in the previous month. The MPC expected core inflation to remain in the lower half of the target range over the next 8 quarters and recognized the risk that core inflation may fall below target in the future. 4. The MPC assessed that the main risks to the Thai economy in the near term emanated from external uncertainties, in particular with respect to the fragility of economic recovery in the main industrialized countries, the negative impact from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) on regional economies and Thailand's tourism industry, and the possibility of further declines in the US dollar. The MPC stressed the need to closely monitor these developments and take stock of their impact on the economy, while maintaining an accommodative stance of monetary policy supportive of economic growth going forward. The MPC decided to maintain the 14-day repurchase rate at 175 per cent per annum."
Philippines,2003-06-04,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board, the policy-making body of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), left the BSP's policy interest rates unchanged at 7 percent for the overnight borrowing rate and 9.25 percent for the overnight lending rate. The BSP's policy rates have been on hold for the past 15 months, with the rates last changed on 15 March 2002 when they were reduced by 25 basis points. At the same time, the Monetary Board voted to restore the tiering scheme on banks' placements with the BSP under the reverse repurchase (RRP) and special deposit accounts (SDA) windows. Banks' placements with the BSP under the overnight RRP window, will now be subject to the following interest rates: 7 percent for the first P5 billion; 4 percent for additional amounts in excess of P5 billion but below P10 billion; and 1 percent for the amounts in excess of P10 billion. Effective tonight, 5 June 2003, the BSP will implement its tiering scheme starting with its overnight RP/RRP windows. Henceforth, all RP/RRP and SDA transactions will be subject to the tiering scheme. The restoration of the tiering scheme is expected to further enhance the liquidity situation and encourage banks to lend to the public instead of placing their excess funds with the BSP. In assessing the inflation environment and overall macroeconomic conditions, the Monetary Board concluded that, against a backdrop of continuing mixed trends in aggregate demand conditions and receding supply-side risks, the present economic environment continues to support a benign path for future inflation. Average inflation is expected to be below the Government's target of 4.5-5.5 percent in 2003 and well in line with the 4-5 percent target for 2004. At the same time, despite robust consumer spending and improving manufacturing activity, the lack of a discernible momentum for domestic demand and the downside risks in the external environment continue to highlight the efficacy for a supportive monetary policy setting. Moreover, recent monetary conditions and other economic developments have provided added flexibility for the BSP to ease the monetary stance while observing caution towards potential inflationary risks. For these reasons, the Monetary Board decided to preserve the supportive stance of monetary policy by maintaining the policy rates and restoring the tiering scheme on banks' placements with the BSP. The BSP will also keep its ears on the ground by watching for the latest moves by key central banks including the Fed and the European Central Bank. The Monetary Board is scheduled to meet again to review the BSP's monetary policy settings on 3 July 2003."
Euroarea,2003-06-05,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. Following a comprehensive economic and monetary analysis, we have concluded that the outlook for price stability over the medium term has improved significantly since our last decision to lower interest rates in March. As a result, we have decided to reduce our key interest rates by 50 basis points. This decision is in line with our monetary policy strategy, including the aim of maintaining inflation rates below but close to 2% over the medium term. At the same time, this interest rate reduction takes into account the downside risks to economic growth. The Governing Council will continue to monitor carefully all factors which are relevant to its assessment. In the context of our economic analysis, the latest data releases on real GDP growth have confirmed that economic activity in the euro area remained subdued in the first quarter of this year. This outcome also reflects the negative impact of the Iraq crisis on both the global economy and the euro area. However, the survey evidence for April and May does not suggest an immediate improvement after the resolution of this conflict and is at best mixed. Accordingly, economic growth in the first half of 2003 is likely to be very weak, and expectations for annual average economic growth for this year and for 2004 have had to be scaled down. Nevertheless, we still expect a gradual strengthening of real GDP growth in the course of 2003, which should gather more pace next year. All available forecasts as well as recent financial market reactions seem to reflect a similar assessment. The main factors supporting this outlook are both external and domestic in nature. On the external side, the expected upturn in extra-euro area demand should compensate for the dampening effect of the appreciation of the euro. Evidently, the significant and rapid appreciation of the euro over recent months will dampen external price competitiveness. However, the current level of the euro's real effective exchange rate, and thereby the competitive position of euro area exporters, is very close to longer-term averages. Thus, when put into perspective, current euro exchange rate levels are in line with economic fundamentals and with our interest in a strong and stable euro. On the domestic side, private consumption growth should recover further from the second half of 2003 onwards. This would reflect the growth in real disposable income supported by positive terms of trade effects and lower inflation rates. Moreover, there are no significant imbalances in the household sector as a whole that would hinder such a recovery. At the same time, the contribution of investment to growth is likely to remain more modest, although an improvement in the global economic environment and the historically low level of interest rates should contribute to an upswing. The Governing Council is conscious of the continuing downside risks to economic growth. Notably, risks stem from the past accumulation of macroeconomic imbalances outside the euro area, and there are ongoing concerns with regard to the SARS virus. In addition, some uncertainty remains as to the extent of the adjustment still needed in the euro area corporate sector to enhance productivity and profitability. This could also have an impact on employment growth and thus private consumption. Given this environment, the outlook for price developments has become more favourable. Following Eurostat's flash estimate of the inflation rate for May of 1.9%, annual inflation rates are expected to hover broadly around this level for the remainder of this year and to fall significantly in 2004. This assessment is based on the assumption of favourable import prices, reflecting both generally stable oil price developments and the higher exchange rate, as well as lower domestic price pressure in the context of a moderate economic recovery. In particular, wage growth is expected to remain broadly stable. Coupled with productivity gains, this should therefore result in a moderation of unit labour costs. In the context of our monetary analysis, we saw persistent strong growth in the broad monetary aggregate M3. Consequently, the euro area economy has continued to accumulate liquidity significantly above the amount needed to sustain non-inflationary growth. There are, however, several considerations which counterbalance concerns that this ample liquidity will lead to inflationary pressures over the medium term. In particular, monetary developments continue to be fostered by portfolio shifts, reflecting a sustained preference on the part of investors for liquid and secure assets. This is confirmed by evidence from both the components and counterparts of M3. Indeed, loans to the private sector increased at a much more moderate pace than M3. Moreover, higher monetary growth was accompanied by a much lower net acquisition of foreign equity by non-MFI euro area residents, also implying portfolio reallocations away from riskier assets. Consequently, the portfolio shifts that have affected M3 growth over the past two years should unwind over time. Finally, the perspective that economic activity will remain moderate reduces the likelihood of excess liquidity giving rise to increased spending. Nevertheless, one has to bear in mind that monetary growth is also supported by the low level of interest rates. Therefore, monetary developments need to be closely monitored with respect to their implications for price stability over the medium to long term. Summing up our economic analysis, it currently appears that inflation rates should decline to below 2% over the medium term, following recent movements in the exchange rate of the euro and given the sluggish growth performance of the euro area. Our monetary analysis indicates that the strong expansion of M3 should not for the time being adversely affect this outlook. Hence, cross-checking the information from the two pillars leads us to conclude that the outlook for price stability over the medium term has become more favourable. Let me at this point comment on the debate about the hypothetical risk of deflation. As far as the euro area is concerned, it should be recalled that inflation has been hovering around 2% for quite some time and that there are currently no forecasts indicating any deflationary risks. The ECB's monetary policy aims at inflation of below but close to 2% over the medium term. In this respect, inflation expectations should remain well anchored at this level, irrespective of shorter-term developments in prices. At the regional level, a period of relatively low price increases or even price level declines will improve a region's competitiveness within the currency area. Within a monetary union, deflation is not a meaningful concept when applied to individual regions. At this juncture, it may be particularly warranted to stress that monetary policy cannot by itself generate lasting and sustainable growth and employment in the euro area. This can only be achieved by appropriate structural measures that address fundamental weaknesses and tackle urgent adjustment requirements. In this respect, fiscal policies have a great potential for fostering confidence and thereby supporting activity, even in the short run. Establishing a well designed medium-term consolidation strategy in those countries currently struggling with increasing fiscal imbalances would make a major contribution in this direction. This would imply comprehensive and growth-friendly measures including, in particular, a courageous reform of the structure and level of public expenditure. Curbing spending growth would eventually also create further room for manoeuvre to address future pressure arising from pension systems and scope for future tax cuts. Procedurally, it is crucial to underpin the fiscal policy framework with a decisive and consistent implementation of the rules of the Treaty and of the Stability and Growth Pact, and rigorous monitoring and peer pressure amongst Member States. By the same measure, bold structural reforms in the labour and product markets would not only increase the euro area's growth potential and enhance its ability to better withstand external shocks, but it would also eliminate a great deal of the uncertainty currently overshadowing long-term planning and perspectives. This, in turn, would also have positive effects over the shorter term. In particular, renewed momentum in the process of structural reform would foster consumer and investor confidence and thereby greatly facilitate spending and investment decisions in the euro area."
Peru,2003-06-05,"BANCO CENTRAL DE RESERVA DEL PERU Press Release MONETARY PROGRAM APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF THE BANK FOR JUNE 2003 In May, the Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima declined 0,03 percent, reflecting the fall in fuel and transportation prices. Last 12 month rate of inflation was 2,4 percent, lower than in April (2,5 percent), whereas underlying inflation, which excludes high volatility items from the CPI basket, increased 0,02 percent in May and 1,6 percent through last 12 months. Central Bank's May inflation report forecasts fro 2003 and 2004 show less inflationary pressures than in January report which pointed out a range for the rate of inflation of 2,5 to 3,5 percent, the upper side of the target. The current report points out that inflation will lay within the lower side (1,5 to 2,5 percent). The Board of the Bank decided to maintain borrowing and lending interest rates for Central Bank operations at: 4,25 percent: for monetary regulation credits and direct temporary purchases of BCR's securities. 3,0 percent: for commercial banks' overnight deposits at the BCR. In May, the interbank interest rate was 3,8 percent, level prevailing since December 2002. The interest rate of monetary regulation credits and direct temporary purchases of BCR's securities will be the same as the interbank interest rate when the latter exceeds 4,25 percent. For June, the estimated range for commercial banks' current account balances held at the Central Bank is 190 million to 210 million, on a daily basis. In May, this balance was 188 million (the estimated range was 190 million to 210 million). The following interest rates will be used in foreign-currency operations: The effective annual rate for monetary regulation credits will be the 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point. For overnight deposits held by banks at the Central Bank, the rate is equivalent to the average obtained by the Central Bank for similar deposits abroad. For foreign exchange temporary purchase operations (swap operations), the commission is maintained at an implicit effective annual cost of 4,25 percent."
Chile,2003-06-10,"THE CENTRAL BANK OF CHILE Press Release* Monthly Monetary Policy Meeting June 10, 2003 At its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided, by unanimous vote of all its members, to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 2.75 (annual). Domestically, some of the most recent economic data for April has been weaker than expected. For now, it is considered an isolated event and does not modify the outlook that the economy is in a phase of higher growth, supported by the current marked monetary stimulus. Nevertheless, doubts remain with respect to the future path of world growth, especially in the developed countries. The most recent price information suggests that the increase in underlying inflation observed since the beginning of the year is moderating, while inflation has returned to the target range. Both developments have been within the foreseen margins. The Central Bank of Chile reiterates that it will continue to conduct monetary policy with the necessary flexibility to address any projected inflation deviations in either direction from the specified target inflation rate. *This is an unofficial translation."
South Korea,2003-06-12,"The economic slowdown has continued mainly due to the contraction of domestic demand which has more than counteracted the steady growth of exports. In the latter half of this year, however, the state of Korean economy is expected to improve gradually, as last month's interest rate reduction takes effect and the government's supplementary budget boosts the economy. Global economic conditions, and especially those in the U S., , meanwhile, should assist its recovery. In May, consumer price inflation has continued to ease substantially mainly due to the decline in the prices of agricultural products and petroleum-based products. It is estimated that current account has now shifted into a surplus in May thanks to the widened surplus on the goods account. The overheated housing market has shown more stable movements since the government announced a series of resolute measures to stabilize housing prices. In the financial market, both long- and short-term interest rates have continued to decline, stock prices have advanced more rapidly than for some time, and concerns about credit card companies have lessened. Taking the above factors into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea has decided today to maintain the benchmark overnight call rate at its current level (4., 0 per cent) for the inter- meeting period."
South Africa,2003-06-12,"The rate of inflation has declined further since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee. In particular production price inflation slowed down to low levels. Changes in production prices, which generally precede similar changes in consumer prices, fell back from a peak year-on-year rate of increase of 15,4 per cent in September 2002 to 8,1 per cent in January 2003 and to 3,3 per cent in April. In fact the all-goods production price index measured from quarter to quarter declined at a seasonally adjusted and annualised rate of 3,2 per cent in the first quarter of 2003, while it had increased by 5,3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2002 and by 25,8 per cent in the first quarter of 2002. The recovery of the rand, moderating food price inflation and a disciplined monetary policy stance eased price pressures. Even more significant is that the decline in production prices was not only confined to lower prices of imported goods related to the recovery in the external value of the rand, but the prices of domestically produced goods also declined at an annualised quarter-to-quarter rate of 0,9 per cent in the first quarter of 2003. Moreover, all the categories of domestically produced goods experienced disinflation in the first quarter of 2003. Prices of imported goods declined at an annualised rate of 10,0 per cent in the first quarter of 2003. The revised consumer price index for metropolitan and other urban areas excluding the interest cost of mortgage bonds (the CPIX) also improved significantly. The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPIX decelerated from a peak of 11,3 per cent in November 2002 to 9,3 per cent in February 2003 and 8,5 per cent in April. CPIX inflation declined at a faster pace from a seasonally adjusted and annualised rate of 12,1 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2002 to 4,8 per cent in the first quarter of 2003. Had the figures not been revised, the quarter to quarter annualised rate of growth in the CPIX would have amounted to 6,3 per cent in the first quarter of 2003. Measured over a period of twelve months the revision of the CPIX was also significant. However, the turning point and pattern of change between the previous and revised monthly series coincide fairly closely. 2.1 A number of developments favour a reduction in the inflation rate:. Low inflation in the rest of the world. Global inflation is generally expected to remain low and consumer prices in advanced economies could even reach an average rate below 2 per cent in 2003. The sluggish world economic performance and weak household demand, could promote continuing disinflationary pressures. The recovery in the external value of the rand. The nominal value of the effective exchange rate of the rand increased by 26,0 per cent during the year up to the end of December 2002 and by a further 0,9 per cent in the first five months of 2003. Although the pass-through effect of the recovery of the rand is usually much smaller than in the case of a depreciation, the current available information indicates that some of the direct and indirect effects of the changed external value of the rand have already benefited disinflation in the CPIX. The ending of the war in Iraq. The end of the war in Iraq and the fact that oil supplies were not materially affected, has removed some of the uncertainties about the international economic environment. However, tensions in the Middle East persist. The surge in the average oil price per barrel from US$24,50 in November 2002 to US$32,65 in February 2003, came to an abrupt end at the beginning of the Iraq war. Brent crude oil prices then dropped to an average of US$25,76 per barrel in May. Together with the recovering rand, this decline in oil prices led to a considerable reduction in domestic fuel prices in May and June 2003, which should also assist in bringing the rate of inflation down to lower levels. The recent survey by the Bureau of Economic Research of the University of Stellenbosch clearly indicates that inflation expectations of analysts, business, labour and households are subsiding. A decline in long-term inflation expectations is also indicated by a decrease in the break-even inflation rate measured as the difference between the nominal yield on conventional bonds and the real yield on inflation-linked bonds. Expected inflation derived in this way has decreased from 8,0 per cent in February 2002 to just below 6 per cent from April 2003. Inflation expectations play an important role in the inflation containment process. The utilisation of production capacity in manufacturing declined to 80,3 per cent in the first quarter of 2003, or to a level considerably below what would normally be regarded as full capacity utilisation. A clear downward trend is also discernible in total unfilled orders at constant prices from the middle of 2002, which makes any capacity constraints unlikely in the near future. The government remains fully committed to pursuing sound fiscal policies. This is demonstrated by the low level of the non-financial public-sector borrowing requirement of 1,0 per cent of gross domestic product in the fiscal year 2002/03 and by the planning of the fiscus as presented in the Medium Term Budget Policy Statement of the year 2002. Although the borrowing requirement ratio is slightly higher than the ratio of 0,8 per cent recorded in the fiscal year 2001/02, it is very low by any international comparison. Government has also succeeded in reducing its debt as a ratio of gross domestic product from 45,7 per cent at the end of March 2002 to 41,2 per cent at the end of March 2003. The rate of increase in the broadly defined money supply (M3) declined from a peak of 20,6 per cent in May 2002 to 5,9 per cent in March 2003. However it rose to 10 per cent in April. The growth over twelve months in the banks' claims on the domestic private sector, excluding investments and bills, accelerated from 9,1 per cent in February 2003 to 12,7 per cent in April. The household sector was mainly responsible for this rise in bank credit extension. Large pay increases continue to be a major risk factor for the containment of inflation. This risk becomes even more crucial if it is accompanied by a slowdown in labour productivity growth. In 2002 the average nominal remuneration per worker in the formal non-agricultural sectors of the economy amounted to 9,9 per cent, compared with an already high 9,1 per cent in 2001. Over the same period, the growth in total labour productivity in the economy declined from 4,8 per cent to 2,8 per cent. As a result, nominal unit labour costs in the formal non-agricultural sectors increased at a rate of 7,0 per cent in 2002. Increases at these levels, if sustained going forward, could jeopardise the positive inflation outlook. Despite the relatively tight monetary stance, the growth in final domestic demand was sustained. Having increased at an average rate of 4 per cent in 2002, the quarter-to-quarter annualised rate of increase in final domestic demand amounted to 3Â½ per cent in the first quarter of 2003. Real final consumption expenditure by households increased at an annualised rate of 2Â½ per cent in the first quarter of 2003, or at roughly the rate attained in the preceding quarter. The steady growth in real consumption expenditure by households was possibly underpinned by the tax cuts announced in the Budget of February 2003. Consumers incurred debt to maintain consumption expenditure and to acquire assets, which led to an increase in the ratio of household debt to disposable income from 51 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2002 to 53 per cent in the first quarter of 2003. Real government consumption expenditure also increased at the same pace as that recorded in the fourth quarter of 2002. In addition, the increase in real fixed capital formation amounted to 8Â½ per cent in the first quarter of 2003. The growth in capital formation continued in all the sectors of the economy, with the exception of the agricultural sector which was affected adversely by the recovering rand and in some instances by weather conditions. The high growth in domestic final demand was accompanied by a marked slowdown in economic activity. The growth in South Africa's real gross domestic product declined from an annualised rate of 2Â½ per cent in the fourth quarter of 2002 to 1Â½ per cent in the first quarter of 2003. The further slowdown in domestic output growth was evident in all the sectors of the economy, with a decline in the real value added of the primary and manufacturing sectors. This downward movement in economic activity can mainly be attributed to a decline in the volume of exports related to a depressed global economy and the recovery in the external value of the rand. The level of the real effective exchange rate of the rand in the first quarter of 2003 was, nevertheless, still well below the average level in 2000, i.e. before the recent sharp fluctuations in the exchange rate of the rand. In the first quarter of 2003 the current account of the balance of payments moved into a deficit, albeit to the still low level of Â½ per cent of gross domestic product. If the current account deficit continues to widen it could lead to pressures on domestic inflation. Projections of the likely rate of inflation for 2004, calculated by using the Reserve Bank's core and other forecasting models, indicate that on the policy stance to date, the average rate of increase in the CPIX will be close to the midpoint of the inflation target band in 2004. Taking these factors into consideration as well as the widening of the differential between South African interest rates and those of our major trading partners owing to a general decline in international interest rates, the Monetary Policy Committee has decided to reduce the repo rate by 150 basis points to a level of 12 per cent per year effective from 13 June 2003. In taking this decision, the committee recognises the progress achieved so far in reducing inflation and the prospect that inflation may fall within the target range later this year. But the committee will remain vigilant to the risks going forward, particularly those relating to wage settlements, administered prices and the uncertain outlook for the global economy. The committee will be ready to take whatever actions are necessary in either direction in the light of the way future risks materialise."
Israel,2003-06-23,"The Bank of Israel's Monetary Program for July 2003. The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for July 2003, according to which the interest rate will be reduced by 0.5 percentage points to 7.5 percent. This reduction in the interest rate was made possible by the reduction in one-year inflation expectations, the continued calm in the foreign-currency market and in the money and capital markets, and the drop in the rate of actual price rises. In the last two months, one-year inflation expectations derived from the capital market stabilized, and they are below the middle of the government's price-stability target of 1-3 percent. Inflation expectations for the second year ahead and beyond continued to decline, and are now in the upper part of the target range. Private forecasters' predictions of 12-month inflation are within the range of 1-2 percent, and the models developed by the Bank of Israel indicate that it is possible to attain the inflation target for the coming year and the following year while continuing to reduce the interest rate. It is important to bear in mind that the interest policy is directed towards the achievement of price stability for the coming year and for the years thereafter, and not necessarily within a particular calendar year. The reduction inrisk was reflected in the strengthening of the NIS in the last few months and in the continued reduction of the interest rates on unindexed long-termgovernment bonds to about 8.0 percent, down from about 11.7 percent in February 2003, and in the reduction of more than one percentage point in the yield on 10-year indexed government bonds in that same period, to 4.7 percent. These developments may be explained mainly by the reduced regional political uncertainty following the conclusion of the war in Iraq, the confirmation of the loan guarantees by the US government and as part of the worldwide trend of improved demand for bonds in emerging markets. Nevertheless, there is still a feeling of uncertainty, and it seems that despite the budget cuts that accompanied the approval of the economic package, the deficit this year and in the next few years will be significantly higher than the pathset by the government. If this does occur, long-term interest will be unable to achieve its full potential reduction, which is necessary to encourageinvestment and growth in the economy, and under certain circumstances thiscould constitute a source of instability. Although the economic program halts the deterioration of the fiscal situation, nevertheless the acceptance of agovernment deficit of between 5 and 6 percent of GDP in 2003 and similar assessments regarding the deficit in 2004-which is high by all internationalstandards-do not indicate convergence to a downward path for the deficit and for the debt/GDP ratio, and are inconsistent with the government decision to adhere to the downward deficit path from 3 percent of GDP in 2003 to 1 percent in 2007. In planning the budget for 2004, therefore, the government must revert to the deficit targets set and to a downward-sloping path forthe debt/GDP ratio. It must be borne in mind that a rise in the debt meansa rise in the tax burden in the future. Fiscal discipline is an essential requisite for the ability to attract sources from private savings into investment and credit, for the continued reduction of long-term interest on government bonds, and hence for the reduction of interest on credit for investment and mortgages that is so important for renewed growth and the encouragement of employment. Further cuts in the short-term interest rate while maintaining price stability depend to a great extent on the government's ability to ensure fiscal discipline and to return to a downward-sloping deficit and debt path which are also required to strengthen the financial system. The Bank of Israel keeps a watchful eye on exchange-rate developments, and in particular analyses their implications for the inflation rate, but it is a long time since the exchange rateat any level, its trend, or its volatility have in themselves constituted targets for monetary policy. High volatility has been evident in the marketin the last few months, reflected in a rise in the risk premium as calculated from the NIS/$ options issued by the Bank of Israel, as well as in a rise in the intraday volatility and in the margins between banks' foreign-currency buying and selling prices. Foreign-currency markets throughout the world are highly volatile, sometimes exhibiting sharp trend reversals, and the market in Israel, which is highly developed, is similar in this respect to the international markets. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the markets, in order to ensure that the inflation rate defined as price stability is maintained while bolstering financial stability. Subject to these conditions, the Bank will act to support the government's policy to foster employment and shorten the recession. Note that the risk premium is characterized by volatility which is sometimes caused by factors related to Israel's economy,by developments in financial markets abroad and by changes in the degree of tradability in those markets. *** The Open Market Committee of the US Federal Reserve is due to convene on 25 June 2003 for its regular review of interest-rate policy.

Poland,2003-06-25,"Warsaw, 25 June 2003 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 24-25 June 2003 A meeting of the Monetary Policy Council was held on 24-25 June 2003. The Council was provided with the materials prepared by the NBP as well as information and analytical materials developed by the Ministry of Finance, banks and research institutes. The Council discussed recent developments in the external environment of the Polish economy and trends in economic performance with regard to payroll and social benefits, in the public finance sector, with regard to money supply, credits and interest rates, and inflation expectations and price levels as well as inflation prospects. Decision taken by the Monetary Policy Council New economic data that have become available since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Council show that: I In May, the low inflation trend hardened. The year-on-year CPI amounted to 0.4%. Factors that limit inflation growth in the future persist: (cid:1)(cid:2)PPI growth in May decreased to 2.1% from 2.7% in April and 3.6% in March, (cid:1)(cid:2)All core inflation ratios remain low, and the most reliable year-on-year net inflation ratio did not change in May in relation to April and amounted to 1.2%, (cid:1)(cid:2)Payroll discipline in the enterprise sector has been strengthened. In the period from January to May 2003, nominal growth of average salaries in the enterprise sector was markedly weaker than in 2002 and reached 1.8% against 4.6% in 2002. In May, average salaries remained at the previous year's levels and dropped by 2.9% compared to April 2003, (cid:1)(cid:2)Low annual growth of money supply expressed in the M3 aggregate persists (0.2% in May against 0.8% in April and 0.5% in March), (cid:1)(cid:2)Low inflation expectations on the part of households have strengthened, and their expected CPI growth in the course of this year declined in June to 0.3%, down from 0.4% in April and 0.5% in May, (cid:1)(cid:2)Moderate annual growth continues in claims on households (at 7.4% in May against 6.8% in April and 7.2% in March) and enterprises (at 6.3% in May against 7.2% in April and 8.3% in March). II. Despite bleak outlooks for economic growth in the euro area and a downturn in the German economy, symptoms of gradual economic recovery have strengthened: (cid:1)(cid:2)In May 2003, sold industrial output grew by 11.7% year-on-year, including an increase in the processing industry's output by 13.8%. After the elimination of seasonal factors, total industrial output growth amounted to 8.8%, whereas that of the processing industry reached 10.6%. The May figures strengthened the distinctly developing trend in output volume established after April, especially in the processing industry. Indicators of the output volume trend (measured by average monthly value of 1995 output figure in constant prices) show increasingly higher growth (amounting to 6.9% for total industry in May year-on-year, and to 8.5% for the processing industry). Industrial output growth in May was attributable to a high growth of exports. The prospects for further growth in the processing industry have also improved; (cid:1)(cid:2)In May, there was a distinct decline in construction output recorded in the first months of 2003. Compared to May 2002, the construction and assembly output was 6.9% lower (in April and March by 13.6% and 25.3%, respectively). Growth indicators on the construction sector point to a slow improvement; (cid:1)(cid:2)Changes in the sectoral structure of construction output observed in April were confirmed, which may signify an improvement in investment demand in the coming months of the year. For the second month in row, output generated by enterprises involved in site preparation more than doubled, whereas that of enterprises carrying out building completion work grew by approx. 40%; (cid:1)(cid:2)High annual growth of retail sales persists, reaching 9.7% in May. III. Factors constituting a potential source of inflationary pressure include: (cid:1)(cid:2)Persistent high uncertainty as to the directions of fiscal policy in 2004 and the ensuing years; (cid:1)(cid:2)Persistent high growth of notes and coins in circulation. In May, the annual growth rate of that aggregate exceeded 15%, whereas in March and April it amounted to 13.8% and 14.9%, respectively; (cid:1)(cid:2)Possible increases in world oil prices. In June, oil prices exceeded U$28 per barrel, a record level since the beginning of the war in Iraq, while the forecasted average annual oil price in 2003 climbed from U$26.8 per barrel in May to U$27.9 per barrel in June. 2 IV. In its analysis of the factors affecting the future inflation rate, the Council also incorporated events that may have an impact on the PLN exchange rate over a medium term: (cid:1)(cid:2)The June referendum, wherein the Poles decided on Poland's accession to the European Union, should contribute to increased credibility and stability of the Polish economy; (cid:1)(cid:2)A reduction of Poland's future creditworthiness rating by Standard & Poor's from stable to negative due to the deterioration in medium-term fiscal prospects; (cid:1)(cid:2)Instability in the Hungarian foreign currency market and devaluation of the forint. Dramatic changes in the exchange rates of accessing countries' currencies may cause tensions in currency markets of other countries within this group, including Poland; (cid:1)(cid:2)Interest rate cuts by the European Central Bank by 0.5 percentage point, which contributed to the growing disparity of interest rates between Poland and the euro area and increased pressure towards zloty appreciation. The effect of that decision on the PLN exchange rate was offset, to some extent, by the two factors mentioned above. The Council also took account of the scale of the interest cuts made so far which would contribute, with a time lag, to a gradual growth in domestic demand in the second half of 2003 and in 2004. The Monetary Policy Council resolved that: the National Bank of Poland will conduct 14-day open market operations with a minimum rate of return of 5.25% p.a.; the lombard credit rate will be lowered from 7.00% to 6.75% p.a.; Interest on term deposits accepted by the NBP from commercial banks shall be 3.75% p.a.; the rediscount rate will be lowered from 6.00% to 5.75% p.a. The Council maintains its neutral attitude in monetary policy. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Council is scheduled for 17-18 July 2003. Overview of economic situation The data on the euro area's GDP published in early June in Q1 2003 point to a slowdown in all major economies in that region. The levels of current economic activity indicators in April and May Poor economic 2003 show that stagnation is likely to prevail in the euro area until the end activity in the of 2003. euro area Meanwhile, positive signals were recorded in the US economy. US consumer confidence, growing since April and encouraging conditions of monetary and fiscal policy as well as weakening political tensions in the world, resulted in a marked improvement of the investment climate in the Improved US. The ISM index climbed from 45.4 percentage points in April to 49.4 investment percentage points in May 2003. climate in the US The improved investment climate in the US and interest rate cuts effected by the ECB stimulated a recovery in global equity markets. However, they did not bring about the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro. May 2003 saw another increase in oil prices in world markets. The average Brent price amounted in May to U$25.8, being by U$0.9 higher than in April 2003. Price growth continued throughout the first half of High oil prices in June 2003. As a result, prices exceeded U$28 per barrel  a record level global markets since the outbreak of the war in Iraq. Key factors which recently affected price growth included persistently low oil reserves in developed countries and uncertainty regarding the resumption of oil exports by Iraq. The rate of sold industrial output growth in May 2003 markedly exceeded anticipated levels. Compared to May 2002, total industrial output was higher by 11.7%, including that of the processing industry up by High industrial 13.8%. Accelerated growth in May was also attributable to 2003 working output growth in time, being augmented by an extra working day. Nevertheless, growth rate. May taking account of seasonal factors was also high (according to the methodology applied by GUS, total industrial output growth net of seasonal factors stood at 8.8%). Based on the published data on the sectoral structure, such high Highest growth in output growth in May may be attributed entirely to exports. In manufacture industry sections of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers, sales, at constant prices, were with export sales 44.7% higher than the year before, whereas in manufacture of furniture by 36.7%, and in manufacture of electrical machinery and apparatus - by 35.0%. Growth in manufacture of chemicals and chemical products as well as in manufacture of rubber and plastic products exceeded 20%. The value of sales generated in these five sections, with the highest output growth and concurrently high export growth represents 25% of the value of sales generated by total industry. The May figures strengthened the clearly-growing trend in output volume, present since April, especially in the processing industry. Indicators describing the output volume trend (measured by the average monthly value of 1995 output figures at a constant prices) show Smaller fall in increasingly higher growth (amounting to 6.9% for total industry in May construction and ear on ear andto85%fortheprocessingind str ) 4 year-on-year, and to 8.5% for the processing industry). assembly output As expected, the dramatic fall in construction output observed in the first months of the year was slowed down in May. In relation to May 2002, construction and assembly output was by 6.9% lower (in April 2003 against the corresponding month of the previous year by 13.6% lower, whereas in March 2003 by 25.3%). Changes in the sectoral structure of construction output observed in April were confirmed, signalling improved investment demand. For the second consecutive month, output generated by enterprises involved in site preparation more than doubled, whereas that of enterprises carrying out building completion work grew by approx. The decline in the output of enterprises involved in general construction of buildings, civil and water engineering was reduced from 15.4% as recorded in April to 8.3%, whereas that of enterprises involved in building installation from 9.0% to 4.7%. Slowdown in In the period from January to May 2003, nominal growth of average salary growth salaries in the enterprise sector was markedly weaker than in 2002 and reached 1.8% against 4.6% in 2002. In May, average salaries remained at the previous year's levels and dropped by 2.9% compared to April 2003. The above drop was the effect of a dramatically heightened increase in one-off payouts in April. It supported the hypothesis that, unlike in 2002, average salary levels in March. April and May 2003 resulted from transfers Improved of payouts between months. economic Research on market conditions, conducted by GUS at the end of May prospects in 2003 on a sample of some 6,000 enterprises, show improvement in general construction and economic climate. Compared to April 2003, there was clear improvement processing in the economic climate in construction and a slight improvement in the industry; processing industry. In the case of these two sections, and especially the latter one, that signified a considerable improvement over May 2002 and 2001. The figures, net of seasonal effects however, point to slighter improvement in the economic climate than the figures incorporating the seasonal effect would seem to indicate. A marked improvement in assessments and prospects was recorded in the construction sector in relation to April, especially in terms of the expected portfolio of orders for construction and assembly work and output growth. In May, enterprises assessed their current and future construction and assembly activities more positively than in May 2002 and 2001. As far as the processing industry is concerned, there may be a prospect of further improvement in the standing of enterprises, even though some detailed indicators assumed negative values. Assessments and prospects formulated in May 2003 were definitely better than in May 2002 and 2001, although in some cases they proved worse than in April 2003 (in particular with regard to current and future foreign demand and Continuing poor output volume). assessments for The situation in trade was different than that observed in the trade growth processing and construction sectors. There, the economic climate in May was not only assessed as negative but its assessment was also the worst 5 among those recorded to date in May across all years covered by research. It should be pointed out, however, that compared to April 2003 there was some improvement in the perception of those involved in trading activities, expressed in the reduced advantage of negative assessments of the entity's economic standing over the positive ones. Research on economic conditions conducted in June confirmed improved climate in processing industry and construction. Assessments of the general economic climate in the retail trade remain poor. II. Overview of public finance Despite lower taxation receipts after five months of the year in May 2003, the combined revenues of the state budget were higher, in nominal terms, by approx. PLN 2.4 bn, or 5.9%, than in the corresponding period of the previous year. Indirect taxation (up by 6.9%) had the most positive impact on the yield of all revenues. Relatively high growth was also displayed by receipts from personal income tax (8.7%). Meanwhile, receipts generated from corporate income tax remained low. In the course of five months of 2003, the state budget recorded a decline of approx. 11.7% in those receipts compared to the corresponding period of 2002. The annual plan of budget receipts was performed to 36.4% after five months of 2003, signifying a deterioration over previous years. Current forecasts of budget receipts point to a possible non-performance of the 60% of planned volume planned in the budget act. budget deficit Budget expenditure after five months of 2003 stood at some PLN after May 2003 80.0 bn, or 4.4% higher that the year before. It represents 41.1% of the planned figure envisaged in the budget act, and less than in previous years. As a result, budget deficit amounted to ca. PLN 23.2 bn, resulting in 60.0% of the annual limit being used, a level comparable to the deficit recorded in previous years. An unfavourable financial situation persists in some other entities of the public finance sector. Despite growth in receipts from security premiums since May 2003, the Social Security Fund (SSF) may generate lower than planned annual revenues. One of the symptoms of poor financial standing of the SSF is also its high indebtedness to the banking system (PLN 2.8 bn) and the still lower than planned proportion of security premiums being transferred to open-ended pension funds. Due to lower than planned receipts from health security premiums, the situation of the National Health Fund is also difficult. This will probably signify a further build-up of payable and owed claims in the healthcare sector. The Agricultural Market Agency was forced to resort to a bank credit facility, given a dramatic increase in expenditure in the first months of 2003. Economic deficit Summing up, it may be said that the performance of the state budget of public finance after May 2003 does not indicate a risk of exceeding the statutory deficit sector in 2003 limit assumed for 2003. The deficit of the remaining entities of the public higher than finance sector will increase, however, the economic deficit rising to an assumed estimated 5.2% of GDP. In the light of the Assumptions for the 2004 draft budget adopted by the government, there is a risk of a growing imbalance of public finance 6 next year. Changes made to budget revenues (inclusion, against the NBP's recommendation, of the revaluation reserve of PLN 9 bn) and expenditure (exclusion of the subsidy for premiums transferred to open-ended pension funds of PLN 11.9 bn) ostensibly reduce the budget deficit in 2004 from approx. PLN 54 bn (6.3% of GDP) to PLN 33.1 bn (3.9% of GDP). The consequence of a high budget deficit in 2004 and 2005 will be dangerous growth in public debt and violation of the second prudential threshold (55% of GDP) provided for in the Act on Public Finance. This signifies a major accumulation of problems for public finances after 2005, with its negative impact for the economy. III. Money supply, credits, interest rates, exchange rate In May 2003. M3 nominal money supply, according to the figures of preliminary, ad hoc information, grew by PLN 3.0 bn (0.9%) in relation Slight money to April. M3 annual growth follows a weak upward trend and stood at supply growth in 0.2% at month end. The FX impact on M3 fluctuations in May 2003 was May negligible. The key factor determining the money supply growth in May 2003 was the increase in corporate deposits, characteristic for that month and amounting to PLN 2.7 bn (5.3%). Also typical for the month of May was the considerable growth in deposits placed by local government bodies, totalling PLN 0.8 bn (8.3%). A relatively high increase was recorded in the volume of banks' indebtedness to non-monetary financial institutions, climbing since April by PLN 0.7 bn (9.6%). At the same time, however. Further decline in household deposits in May 2003 dropped by PLN 1.5 bn (-0.8%). The household negative annual growth of that category, persistent since July 2002, was deposits at banks further aggravated, to reach 6.5% in May 2003. The decline in household deposits is constantly affected by the persistently high attractiveness of alternative forms of saving such as, for example, the increased value of combined net assets of all investment funds in May 2003 totalling PLN 1.9 bn. Annual nominal growth of banknotes and coinage in circulation reached 15.6%, which represents its highest value since August 2002. On the side of factors contributing to money creation, total receivables of the banking system went up in May by PLN 1.2 bn (0.5%), which was primarily due to an increase in receivables due from households (by PLN 1.3 bn, or 1.4%). After taking out the F/X impact, growth in household receivables amounted to PLN 0.9 bn (1.0%), hitting a record low compared to the corresponding periods of the years 1997-2002. Claims on corporates increased slightly by PLN 0.3 bn (0.2%), whereas claims on social security funds shrank by PLN 0.4 bn (-13.2%). In May 2003, the PLN exchange rate was substantially influenced by fluctuations in the euro/US dollar exchange rate. As a result of a distinctly accelerated appreciation of the euro in the world market (an increase by 6.5% of the euro to US dollar exchange rate), the Polish zloty depreciated against the euro by 0.6%, while strengthening by 5.4% against the US dollar. 7 In June 2003, the PLN exchange rate was affected primarily by Zloty exchange domestic political factors and developments in the Hungarian market. rate fluctuations Because of these, the strengthening of the Polish currency after the successful outcome of the referendum on Poland's accession to the EU expected by market analysts did not take place. IV. Prices, inflation expectations In May 2003, twelve-month inflation rate amounted to 0.4% against 0.3% in April, due to transport price growth, and in particular that of fuel Annual CPI at prices and growing costs of housing maintenance and energy carriers. CPI 0.4% was still lowered by prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages, alcoholic beverages, clothing and footwear. Net inflation in May 2003 p.a. amounted, similarly to April, to 1.2%. Monthly net inflation rate stood at 0.1%, i.e. was the same as in the previous three months of 2003. Similarly to April. May saw a slowdown in PPI growth. Compared PPI growth slower to the corresponding month of 2002, manufacturers' prices in industry than in the were higher by 2.1% (by 2.7% in April). In relation to the previous month, previous month prices of sold industrial output declined by 0.5% (by 0.6% in April). Slower PPI growth was primarily attributable to a decrease in the prices in industrial processing as well as mining and quarrying, and in particular in manufacture of coke and refined petroleum products  by 8.5%. Price decline was due, to a large extent, to falling petrol prices (despite a slight increase in BRENT unrefined oil prices, petrol prices fell on the Amsterdam commodity exchange by over 6% in May, and petrol prices in Poland display a close correlation with the prices recorded on that Decline in exchange). consumer Changes in the pattern of replies to the question of the Ipsos- inflation Demoskop opinion poll, on the basis of which consumer inflation expectations; expectations are examined, point to deterioration in the respondents' deteriorating confidence. In June, the percentage of highly pessimist respondents confidence of claiming that prices will grow faster than to date, increased the most. respondents Public opinion researchers suggest that the deterioration in the manner of formulating inflation expectations by consumers may be linked to the concerns, fairly frequently voiced in public debates, that Poland's accession to the European Union will result in a growth of prices in the domestic market. Falling current inflation rates have led, however, to a decline in the measure of inflation expectations by consumers. Price growth expected by consumers in the course of the coming year amounted to 0.3%, i.e. was by 0.2 percentage point lower than in May 2003. Increased The inflation rate forecast by bank analysts for May 2004 stood at inflation 2.3%, that is was by 0.3 percentage point higher than last month. Since expectations of February, these forecasts stabilise in the 2.0%-2.3% bracket. The inflation bank analysts rate forecast for the year ending 2003 and the average annual price growth projected for 2004 remained at the level recorded in May 2003 and amounted to 1.7% and 2.4%, respectively."
United States,2003-06-25,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 1 percent. In a related action, the Board of Governors approved a 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate to 2 percent. The Committee continues to believe that an accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with still robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing important ongoing support to economic activity. Recent signs point to a firming in spending, markedly improved financial conditions, and labor and product markets that are stabilizing. The economy, nonetheless, has yet to exhibit sustainable growth. With inflationary expectations subdued, the Committee judged that a slightly more expansive monetary policy would add further support for an economy which it expects to improve over time. The Committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal. In contrast, the probability, though minor, of an unwelcome substantial fall in inflation exceeds that of a pickup in inflation from its already low level. On balance, the Committee believes that the latter concern is likely to predominate for the foreseeable future. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were Alan Greenspan. Chairman; Ben S Bernanke; Susan S Bies; J Alfred Broaddus. Jr.; Roger W Ferguson. Jr.; Edward M Gramlich; Jack Guynn; Donald L Kohn; Michael H Moskow; Mark W Olson; and Jamie B Stewart. Jr. Voting against the action was Robert T Parry. President Parry preferred a 50 basis point reduction in the target for the federal funds rate. In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston. New York. St. Louis. Kansas City, and San Francisco."
Thailand,2003-06-27,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 27 June 2003 (special supplementary session) Mr. Bandid Nijathaworn. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand announced that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today in a special supplementary session to assess the latest economic and financial developments in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance going forward. The main issues discussed were as follows: 1. The MPC deemed that economic growth in the first quarter of 2003 was satisfactory, with activity supported by expansions in domestic spending and exports. Despite the negative impact on tourism due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), latest economic indicators pointed towards continued recovery in the second quarter. Going forward, the MPC assessed that external uncertainties may exert a negative influence on the Thai economy in 2 ways: Firstly, despite the recent easing of monetary policy by the European Central Bank and the US Federal Reserve to stimulate growth, it would take some time until the economic recovery process becomes firmly entrenched. Secondly volatility in short-term capital movements has become more pronounced recently, partly as a result of the wider differential between domestic and foreign interest rates, as well as greater inflow of short-term speculative capital. As a result, stability of the money and capital markets may be affected and baht volatility may increase, with possible adverse consequences for economic activity. 3. The MPC observed that with core inflation remaining low, there was room for monetary policy to ease further in order to safeguard the economy against the external uncertainties outlined above, strengthen the growth process of the Thai economy going forward, and reduce the risks of core inflation falling below the target range in the future. The MPC therefore decided to lower the 14-day repurchase rate by 05 per cent per annum from the current level of 175 per cent per annum to 125 per cent per annum, effective today."
Philippines,2003-07-01,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board, the policy-making body of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), voted to reduce the BSP's policy interest rates by 25 basis points (a quarter of a percentage point) to 6.75 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.0 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate, effective 2 July 2003. The BSP's policy rates were last changed on 15 March 2002, when they were reduced by 25 basis points. This reduction brings the BSP's overnight RRP and RP rates to their lowest levels since May 1992, and comes at a time when interest rates are considerably more stable than they were more than a decade earlier. Effective 2 July 2003, banks' placements with the BSP under the overnight RRP window shall be at a base rate of 6.75 percent. Said placements shall be subject to the following tiering scheme: 6.75 percent for the first P5 billion; 3.75 percent for additional amounts in excess of P5 billion up to P10 billion; and 0.75 percent in excess of P10 billion. The tiering scheme shall be applied to the total outstanding placements of a bank, including its subsidiaries and affiliates (under the overnight and term RRPs and SDAs). Effective the same date, banks' borrowings under the overnight RP window shall be at 9 percent. Effective 3 July 2003, banks' transactions under the Term RRP and SDAs, as well as Term RPs, shall be adjusted accordingly. In assessing the inflation environment and overall macroeconomic conditions, the Monetary Board concluded that future inflation is likely to continue to follow a benign path over the policy horizon. Both demand and supply factors point to subdued price conditions going forward, while the main inflationary risks that were considered in setting the targets for 2003 and 2004 have significantly diminished. Average inflation is expected to be well below the Government's target of 4.5-5.5 percent in 2003 and fully in line with the 4-5 percent target for 2004. At the same time, various indicators of economic activity generally point to an overall weakness in aggregate demand conditions, even as credit demand continues to improve with clear evidence of ample liquidity in the financial system. In addition, the policy making body of the BSP noted the modest improvement in the global economic outlook. The Monetary Board thus believed it may be necessary to further ease current monetary policy settings and provide a signal to consumers and the business sector that monetary authorities would like to help sustain the momentum for economic activity and the observed improvement in consumer confidence. These major considerations prompted the Monetary Board to ease the stance of monetary policy of the BSP. The Monetary Board is scheduled to meet again to reassess the BSP's monetary policy stance on 31 July 2003."
Peru,2003-07-03,"Press Release MONETARY PROGRAM APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF THE BANK FOR JULY 2003 In June, the Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima declined 0,47 percent. Last 12 month inflation was 2,2 percent, against 2,4 percent in May. Underlying inflation, an indicator which excludes high volatility items from the CPI basket, was nil in June (1,5 percent through last 12 months). Central Bank's May inflation report forecasted an end-of-year inflation within the lower band of the range (1,5 to 2,5 percent). Recent developments indicate declining inflationary pressures, with increasing probabilities that 2003 inflation will be close to the bottom limit of the range. The Board of the Bank approved to cut off-auction reference interest rates in 25 bps. Therefore, the reference interest rates will be as follows: 4,0 percent: for monetary regulation credits and direct temporary purchases of BCR's securities 2,75 percent: for commercial banks' overnight deposits at the BCR The Board of the Bank will continue watching the evolution of main macroeconomic variables, in order to carried out the necessary actions that reduce the risk of an annual inflation lower than 1,5 percent. The interest rate for rediscount operations and direct temporary purchase of securities will be the interbank market interest rate, when this one be higher than 4 percent. In June, the average interbank interest rate was 3,74 percent, slightly lower than those prevailing since December 2002 (3,8 percent). For July, the estimated range for commercial banks' current account balances held at the Central Bank is 195 million to 215 million, on a daily basis. In June, this balance was 204 million (within the estimated range of 190 million to 210 million). The following interest rates will be used in foreign-currency operations: The effective annual rate for monetary regulation credits will be the 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point. For overnight deposits held by banks at the Central Bank, the rate is equivalent to the average obtained by the Central Bank for similar deposits abroad. For foreign exchange temporary purchase operations (swap operations), the commission is maintained at an implicit effective annual cost of 4,25 percent."
Chile,2003-07-10,"Press Release* Monthly Monetary Policy Meeting July 10, 2003 At its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided, by unanimous vote of its four members that participated at the meeting, to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 2.75 (annual). Despite the fact that the labor market continues to show high rates of employment creation, sectoral indicators have been mixed in general and the most recent information on economic activity shows that growth in the second quarter was lower than expected. Nonetheless, these circumstances are not sufficient to modify perspectives of a gradual drop in excess capacity during the upcoming quarters. The marked monetary policy stimulus and continuing expectations of increased world growth for the second semester are coherent with this scenario. The path followed by prices has been within foreseen margins. In addition, it is estimated that the effects on inflation resulting from the increase of the VAT next October will have a limited and transitory effect, so that forecast inflation towards the end of the projection horizon does not change. The Central Bank of Chile reiterates that it will continue to conduct monetary policy with the necessary flexibility to address any projected inflation deviations in either direction from the specified target inflation rate. *This is an unofficial translation."
Euroarea,2003-07-10,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB, which was also attended by the President of the ECOFIN Council. Mr. Tremonti. Following our regular economic and monetary analysis, we have concluded that the current monetary policy stance is appropriate in view of the favourable outlook for price stability over the medium term. Accordingly, we have decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Interest rates in the euro area are low by historical standards, both in nominal and real terms, thus lending support to economic activity and helping to safeguard against downside risks to economic growth. The Governing Council will continue to monitor carefully all factors that might affect this assessment. In the context of our economic analysis, the latest data and information continue to suggest that economic growth in the euro area remained subdued in the second quarter of the year, after virtually stagnating in the first quarter. The indicators available broadly point to a stabilisation of activity but there are no signs as yet of an underlying strengthening in production and confidence. At the same time, financial market developments seem to reflect a somewhat more optimistic assessment of the economic outlook both inside and outside the euro area. On the whole, we continue to expect a gradual strengthening of economic activity in the euro area. This should be supported by lower inflation and thus higher real disposable income, the low level of interest rates, and a recovery in external demand for euro area goods and services. This assessment is in line with all available forecasts and projections. Nevertheless, downside risks to this main scenario are still relevant. While concerns over the SARS virus have faded, there are risks relating in particular to the accumulation of macroeconomic imbalances outside the euro area and to the extent of the adjustment still needed in the euro area corporate sector to enhance productivity and profitability. Turning to price developments, the outlook over the medium term remains favourable. For the remainder of this year, annual HICP inflation rates are expected to fluctuate around the current level of 2%, the rate recently estimated by Eurostat for June. In early 2004 a significant base effect related to energy prices should lead to a marked fall in annual HICP inflation rates, assuming broadly unchanged oil prices and exchange rates. Subsequently, the exchange rate pass-through and a moderate economic recovery should contain price pressures. In this respect, wage developments in particular are expected to remain consistent with a favourable outlook for price stability. Other price indicators, such as developments in producer prices, tend to support this picture. Moreover, all available forecasts and projections as well as indicators of inflation expectations point in the same direction, namely that price stability in line with our aim of inflation below but close to 2% will be maintained over the medium term. In the context of our monetary analysis, substantial excess liquidity has accumulated in the euro area as a consequence of the extended period of high M3 growth. This strong growth has continued in recent months, as economic uncertainty and the low level of interest rates across the whole maturity spectrum have increased the attractiveness of holding liquid assets. At the same time, the low level of interest rates has helped support recent growth in loans to the private sector. While the large amount of excess liquidity should be less of a concern in a period of moderate economic activity, monetary developments need to be closely monitored in terms of their implications for price stability over the medium to long term. To sum up, our economic analysis confirms the expectation that price dynamics will remain moderate in the euro area in the context of a gradual economic recovery and the strengthened euro exchange rate. The monetary analysis indicates that the strong expansion of M3 should, for the time being, not be seen as adversely affecting this outlook. Hence, cross-checking the information from the two pillars leads to the conclusion that the outlook for price stability over the medium term remains favourable. With medium-term inflation expectations firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability, and with interest rates at historical lows, monetary policy has made a significant contribution to improving the conditions for a recovery in economic growth. However, other policy-makers also have to assume their responsibilities. Part of the weakness in economic growth in the euro area can be linked to a lack of ambition in the areas of fiscal and structural reform to further improve the conditions for investment and employment. A strong commitment to the Stability and Growth Pact and adherence to well designed medium-term fiscal consolidation strategies in those countries currently struggling with increasing fiscal imbalances would make a major contribution to improving confidence. In a similar way, progress in structural reforms in the labour and product markets would not only increase the euro area's growth potential and enhance its ability to better withstand external shocks, but it would also eliminate a great deal of the uncertainty currently clouding long-term planning and prospects. In the current situation, characterised by subdued economic growth and low confidence, structural reform and a steady and reliable course of fiscal policy, in line with the European fiscal framework, are of the highest priority."
South Korea,2003-07-10,"Despite the steady growth of exports, the economic slowdown has become more evident because of the contraction of domestic demand. The pace of the economic recovery is also not expected to pick up to any great degree in the latter half of this year, considering both domestic and global economic conditions. In June, consumer price inflation continued to ease for the third straight month, due to the decline in the prices of agricultural products and petroleum-based products. It is estimated that the current account surplus widened in June in response to the enlarged surplus on the goods account. The overheated housing market cooled in June following a series of the government's resolute measures to stabilize it. Financial markets as a whole have shown stability. However, fund- raising conditions for low-rated corporations remain difficult and there are potentially destabilizing factors present such as liquidity problems of credit card companies and the troubles of SK Global. Taking the above factors into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower its target for the overnight call rate from 4., 0 percent to 3., 75 percent for the inter-meeting period. In a related action, the committee also lowered the interest rate on Liquidity Adjustment Loans of the Bank of Korea by 25 basis points to 3., 50 percent. Meanwhile, for sustainable growth and stability of the economy, a more positive role should be played by fiscal policy, and furthermore, a cautious eye should continue to be kept on the stability of real estate market."
Poland,2003-07-18,"INFORMATION AFTER THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL Held on 17-18 July 2003 On July 17-18, 2003, the Monetary Policy Council held a meeting. The Council read materials prepared by NBP and also information and analyses furnished by the Ministry of Finance, banks and research institutes. The Council then discussed the external environment of the Polish economy as well as real trends, trends in payments and social welfare benefits, matters involving the public financial sector, the money supply, loans and interest rates and the structures of pricing and inflationary expectations, as well as the expected rate of inflation. Decision of the Monetary Policy Council New economic data that has emerged since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Council: I Indicates: that the factors limiting the growth of inflation in the future can still be observed: (cid:1)(cid:2)Inflation remains low; despite the annual CPI of 0.8% in June 2003 against 0.4% in May 2003. June saw a 0.1% reduction in prices compared to May 2003, (cid:1)(cid:2)The salary growth rate in the business sector is kept under stringent control. Between January and June 2003, average monthly salaries in the business sector increased by 2.1% in nominal terms compared to 4.4% observed for the same period in 2002. In real terms, the growth of salaries in the first half of 2003 reached 1.6% and was identical to the growth for the same period in 2002. (cid:1)(cid:2)The annual growth rate of monetary aggregates M3 remains low (at 1.2% in June against 0.3% in May and 0.8% in April), (cid:1)(cid:2)A moderate annual growth rate of dues from households (at 8.4% in June against 7.5% in May and 6.8% in April) and from businesses (at 3.0% in June against 6.5% in May and 7.2% in April), (cid:1)(cid:2)The inflationary expectations of households have steadied at a low level. II. Confirms: the signs of a gradual economic revival: (cid:1)(cid:2)In June 2003, industrial production sold grew by 7.8% year on year, including a 9.6% growth in the processing industry, the June results confirmed an upward trend in the total production volume, (cid:1)(cid:2)An improvement in the condition of the construction industry has been observed with a 16% growth in the production sold of the construction and assembly sector in June against May, and only 1.2% below the June 2002 ratio. (cid:1)(cid:2)June was the third consecutive month witnessing over a twofold growth in construction site production, when measured at the annual level. An accelerated growth rate was observed in companies performing finishing construction work (at 65.3% against nearly 40% in May 2003). Maintaining changes in the sectoral structure of the construction industry promise an improvement in the investment demand. (cid:1)(cid:2)A marked improvement in the economic condition ratios in the construction industry parallel positive outlooks on future market trends in the processing industry. III. Other possible factors creating inflationary pressure include: (cid:1)(cid:2)A considerable uncertainty as to the size of the economic deficit in the public finance sector in 2003 coupled by even higher uncertainty regarding the shape of fiscal policy in 2004 and subsequent years, (cid:1)(cid:2)Maintaining high growth rate in cash in circulation. In June 2003, the annual growth rate of the aggregate amounted to 14.9% (15.7% in May and 14.9% in April), (cid:1)(cid:2)Increasing oil prices. June 2003 saw the average price of a Brent oil barrel at 27.6 USD translating into growth by 1.8 USD when compared to May prices and by 3.5 USD when viewed against prices in June 2002. The forecasted average annual oil prices in 2003 increased from 27.9 USD/barrel in June to 29.04 USD/barrel in July 2003. Furthermore, the Council took into consideration the size of interest rate cuts performed so far, as they will affect the gradual increase in national demand in the second half of 2003 and in 2004. The Monetary Policy Council resolved: To leave the monetary policy parameters unchanged and maintain its neutral approach in respect of monetary policy. The Council discussed the topic of mandatory reserve of banks. The discussion will be continued at the next meeting of the Council, which is scheduled for 26-27 August 2003. Assessment of the economic situation In June and July 2003, evidence of re-established optimism and trust on the international markets were growing stronger. Phenomena Improvement of giving the strongest indication of these symptoms included: a distinctive investment increase of global stock exchange indexes, falling prices (from the second climate in the half of June) on the T-bond market and the USD markedly gaining against USA and other currencies. Germany The phenomena were accompanied by the continued increase in trust of business circles. In the USA, the ISM ratio attained 49.8 in June 2003 against 45.4 in April and 49.4 in May. Germany witnessed a similar improvement in the IFO Institute indicator: from 86.6 in April to 87.6 in May and 88.8 in June 2003, while the ZEW index assessing investors' anticipation for the next six months grew from 18.7 in May to 21.3 in June to reach a record 41.9, unseen in the previous 11 months. Market analysts believe that continuation of these positive trends is conditional to increasing stabilisation in the global political situation in order to consolidate the temporarily volatile consumer trust (in the USA, the Michigan ratio declined in June to 89.7 compared to 92.1 in May). In June 2003, the rising trend in global oil prices was maintained. This trend dates back to May 2003. The average price of a Brent oil barrel came to USD 27.6 in June 2003, exceeding its May price by USD 1.8 and USD 3.5 year on year. High oil prices on Primarily, growth in prices stemmed from: global markets - a continued delay in reestablishment of exports by Iraq, - a threat of strike in the oil producing sector in Nigeria, - a distinctive deterioration in oil production in OPEC countries in June 2003. The drop in production is estimated at over 800 000 barrels/day compared to the production in May 2003, - a continuously low level of oil reserves in developed countries, in particular in the USA., which causes increasing volatility in oil prices. The high level of oil prices prevailing also in the first days of July 2003 lead to yet another verification of the oil price forecast. The forecasted annual average oil prices in 2003 increased from USD 27.9/barrel in June to USD 29.04/barrel in July 2003. In June 2003, the industrial production sold grew by 7.8% year on year, including 9.6% growth attributed to the processing industry. At the same time, mining and quarrying production fell (by 5.8%) similarly to the Increase in the power, gas and water production and to distribution sector (by 1.7%). The industrial slowdown in production growth viewed against May 2003 was caused by a production sold higher base (June 2003 was the first month of distinctive growth in the industrial sector after over a year-long period of falls and stagnation in production) and higher number of working days in May when compared to the previous year. 3 Results for June 2003 came as a confirmation of an upward trend in the production volume, particularly visible in the processing industry. High annual growth of the trend was maintained with further growth perspective (7.6% in the general industrial sector and 9.1% in the processing sector). June 2003 saw a decelerating decline in construction industry Slowdown in production. Compared to June 2002 figures, construction and assembly declining production shrank by 1.2% (annual declines in May and April at 6.9% and construction 13.5%, respectively). Continuation as from April of changes in the sectoral industry structure of the construction industry gives promising prospects with production respect to investment demand. June was the third consecutive month witnessing over two-fold growth in the production of construction sites, when measured at an annual basis. Accelerated growth rate was observed in companies performing finishing construction work (at 65.3% against nearly 40% in May 2003). Marked Analysis of economic performance carried out by the Central improvement in Statistical Office at the end of June 2003 on a group of nearly 6 thousand assessment of companies indicated that positive opinions on the overall economic market performance in the construction and processing industry continue to performance in prevail. Seasonally adjusted data indicate even a marked improvement in the construction the perception of economic conditions in the construction sector. Not only industry, has the construction sector seen more optimistic opinions than those continuous expressed in May, but a significant improvement in the assessment of the optimism in the overall condition was noted in comparison to year on year and June 2003 processing sector. to the June 2001 assessment. The processing sector witnessed a slight deterioration of the economic performance, while there is an evident improvement when compared to the assessment noted one and two years ago. The situation in retail trade was visibly different from the condition of the processing and construction industry. In June, assessment of market Continued bleak performance was very pessimistic and bleaker than the assessment made in assessment of May 2003, it was also the most discouraging of all assessments prepared in trade May for all the years covered by research. The ratio was highly affected by performance very negative assessment of economic condition of trade units. II. Situation of public sector finances In the first half of 2003, the aggregate state budget revenue exceeded the revenue for the corresponding part of 2002 by PLN 6.8 bn. In nominal terms, i.e. by 10.4% (growth by 3.2% when excluding NBP's dividend). Receipts from personal income tax have increased by 9.5% compared to moderate growth in indirect taxes (2.8%). Corporate income tax receipts remain at a low level. In consequence, within six months of 2003 receipts to the state budget were 15.8% below the receipts from CIT in the preceding year. This chiefly stemmed from: a reduction in the nominal taxation rate, introduction of a 30% depreciation rate to be applied to some fixed assets within their first taxable year, settlement of losses incurred in the prior years by companies. 4 After June 2003, the annual plan of the state budget revenue was performed in 46.2%. State budget performance has improved considerably when compared to the results of preceding years (when adjusted by the NBP dividend, the planned result was achieved in 43.2% i.e. below last year's figure). After June 2003, the state budget expenditure amounted to PLN 95.7 bn. i.e. 6.3% over the June 2002 figure to reach 49.2% of the figure stipulated in the budget act. Primarily, the increase in expenditure was connected with higher amounts of subsidies paid to the Social Security Fund and Labour Fund as well as with high costs of servicing the domestic 61.5% debt. The second quarter of 2003 saw a marked growth in state budget of the planned expenditure at 10.8% year to year and at 2.3% in the first quarter of 2003. state budget In consequence, at the end of June 2003, the state budget deficit deficit after June reached PLN 23.8 bn. This translates into a budget performance at 61.5% 2003 of the annual limit, i.e. at a level comparable to the deficit of preceding years. Judging from state budget results after June 2003, there are no indications that its size may threaten to exceed the statutory limit of the deficit planned for 2003. However, deficit of the remaining units of the public finance sector will add to economic deficit to reach an estimated 5.2% of GDP. III. Money supply, loans, interest rates, exchange rate Preliminary data indicate that the M3 money supply rose by PLN 2.8 Slight growth in bn (0.9%) in June 2003 against the end of May 2003. In June, the money supply in monetary figures were strongly affected by the FX differences. After June elimination of their effect. M3 growth would reach approx. In June 2003, the annual M3 money supply rate was equal to 1.2%. M3 increase stemmed primarily from: growth of cash in circulation and an increase in corporate deposits. Cash grew by PLN 1.3 bn. (2.9%) â the growth of cash in circulation at the end of June is an annually reoccurring phenomenon and results from the start of summer vacation. The annual growth rate of cash has been maintained at a high 14.9%. Corporate deposits increased by PLN 1.7 bn. (3.2%), and their growth after elimination of FX differences stood at approx. PLN 0.2 bn. (0.1%) growth in household deposits observed in June 2003 resulted fully from FX differences. After their elimination, household deposits shrank by approx. At the same time, a considerable inflow of household funds to investment funds is still observed to reach approx. In addition, households invested in bank bonds, the phenomenon reflected by PLN 0.4 bn. (11%) increase in the remaining M3 components in June 2003. 5 The PLN 1.6 bn. growth in total loans (0.6%) observed in June was fully triggered by the zloty depreciation. After elimination of FX differences, the category shrank by PLN 0.1 Bn. (-0.04%). After elimination of FX differences, the amounts due from households plummeted by PLN 0.6 Bn (0.6%), and corporate dues fell by PLN 1 Bn. (- 0.7%). The annual growth rate of loans remains moderate (with amounts due from households and corporates increasing by 8.4% and 3.0%, respectively, within the year). In June 2003, the zloty depreciated both against the euro (by approx. 2.5% when compared to May 2003) and the USD (by 1.3%, respectively). The depreciation of the Polish currency was chiefly affected by such factors as: strong depreciation of the Hungarian forint, which translated into an increase in the currency risk for the currencies of our region. Standard and Poor's lowered rating perspective for Poland as well as a fall in bond prices on the global and Polish market in the wake of the FED's decision on the interest rate reduction below market expectations. In view Weaker zloty of discernible appreciation of the USD on the world market. July saw the zloty weakening against the USD and gaining ground against the euro. IV. Prices, inflationary expectations In June 2003, the twelve-month inflation rate grew to 0.8% against 0.4% in May 2003. The trend arose mainly from a markedly weaker drop in the prices of foodstuffs and non-alcoholic beverages when compared to May 2003 (by 1.9 percentage point). The growth rate of transportation prices slowed (by 1.0 percentage point) with increasing fuel prices (by 2.3 The annual percentage point) as the main growth stimulant. No variations in the group growth rate of prices of other commodities and services were observed between June and CPI at 0.8% May prices. In June 2003, ânetâ inflation totalled 1.1% (0.1 percentage point below the level of May 2003), while the monthly ânetâ inflation indicator was equal to 0.0%. May 2003 saw a slight growth of the PPI. Compared to May 2002, producer prices in industry rose by 2.1% (by 2.0% in May). When compared to April 2003, the sold-product prices in the industry increased Annual growth by 0.4% (0.6% fall in May 2003). rate of PPI at The PPI growth is attributed chiefly to increasing prices in the 2.1% industrial processing sector as well as in mining and quarrying. June 2003 saw the largest monthly growth in prices in the coke production and oil refining products sector by 2.7%. Rising prices in Poland came as a consequence of growing prices of BRENT crude oil coupled by growing prices of petrol at the Amsterdam exchange (over 3% growth in June 2003), and was additionally affected by the depreciation of the zloty. 6 In July 2003, the inflationary expectations of households increased to Steadying 0.4% i.e. by 0.1 percentage point when compared to the June figure. The inflationary inflation rate in June 2004 forecasted by banking analysts amounted to expectations 2.2% i.e. 0.1% below the level indicated a month ago. Since February 2003, the forecast has been showing a steadying tendency within the range of 2% to 2.3%. The end of the 2003 price growth forecast and the annual average price growth forecasted for 2004 decreased when compared to June 2003 by 0.1 percentage point to 1.6% and 2.3%, respectively."
Thailand,2003-07-21,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 21 July 2003 Mr. Bandid Nijathaworn. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand announced that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance going forward. The main issues discussed were as follows: 1. The MPC reviewed the latest data on economic conditions in Thailand and deemed that economic growth in the first 5 months of 2003 was satisfactory. Growth was buoyed by further expansions in export and domestic consumption, although private investment did not accelerate much and government expenditure was below target. On the production side, the agricultural and manufacturing sectors continued to expand robustly, while the services sector was hampered by a reduction in tourism receipts following the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). External stability remained strong with the current account remaining in surplus, international reserves at a high level, and further declines in foreign debt. The baht moved in line with regional currencies and the MPC expected Thailand's international reserves position to remain strong after the completion of IMF debt repayment at the end of July. The economic recovery thus far had not generated perceptible upward pressure on prices with headline inflation averaging 18 per cent in the first 6 months of the year, mostly reflecting higher energy and food prices. Core inflation was subdued at 03 per cent and was expected by the MPC to remain in the lower half of the target range over the next 8 quarters. The MPC felt that the probability of core inflation falling below the target range had declined somewhat following the additional easing of monetary policy in June. 4. The MPC assessed that external factors, in particular with respect to the uncertainty regarding economic recovery in the main industrialized countries, as well as economies in Asia, continued to pose risks to the Thai economy. The MPC stressed the need to closely monitor these developments and assess their impact on the economy, while maintaining an accommodative stance of monetary policy supportive of economic growth going forward. The MPC decided to maintain the 14-day repurchase rate at 125 per cent per annum."
Israel,2003-07-28,"The Bank of Israel's Monetary Program for August 2003. The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for August 2003, according to which the interest rate will be reduced by 0.5 percentage points to 7.0 percent. This reduction in the interest rate was made possible despite some increase in one-year inflation expectations,against the background of the continued calm in the foreign-currency market and in the money and capital markets, and the drop in the rate of actual price rises. In the last two months, one-year inflation expectations derived from the capital market rose slightly, but remained around the middle of the government's price-stability target of 1-3 percent. Thus real short-term interest went down in this period due to the decline in nominal interest as well as the rise in inflation expectations. Inflation expectations for the second year ahead and beyond continued to decline, and are now in the upper part of the target range. Private forecasters' predictions of 12-month inflation are close to the middle of the target range, and the models developed by the Bank of Israel indicate that it is possible to attain the inflation target for the coming year and the following year while continuing to reduce the interest rate. The reduction in risk in the financial markets was reflected in the strengthening of the NIS in the last few months, that has slowed down recently, in the continued reduction of yields on unindexed long-term government bonds to below 8.0 percent, a cumulative reduction of about 4 percentage points since February 2003, and a reduction of 1.5 percentage points in the yield on 10-year indexed government bonds in that same period, to 4.4 percent. These developments may be explained mainly by the reduced regional political uncertainty following the conclusion of the war inIraq, the confirmation of the loan guarantees by the US government, and aspart of the worldwide trend of increased demand for bonds in emerging markets. Nevertheless, uncertainty still prevails, because despite the budget cuts, the deficit this year and in the next few years will be significantly higher than the path set by the government. If this scenario becomes a reality, it will prevent long-term interest from achieving its full potential reduction, which is needed to encourage investment and growth in the economy, and under certain circumstances it could constitute a source of instability. The Bank of Israel's interest-rate policy is aimed at achieving price stability in the coming year and the nextfew years, in accordance with the government decision taken in 2000 which set the inflation target for 2003 and thereafter: and not necessarily for any particular calendar year: at between 1 and 3 percent (defined as price stability). In this context it should be noted that a change in the price-stability target is likely to be interpreted by the market as the first sign that the government was backing out of its commitment to price stability, and this could raise Israel's country risk premium, increase the cost of government borrowing, and make it difficult to continue the process of reducing the short-term interest rate. Although the economic program halts the deterioration of the fiscal situation, nevertheless a government deficit of 6 percent of GDP in 2003 and of a similar size in 2004: which is high by all international standards: are inconsistent with the government decision to adhere to a downward deficit path, reducing from 3 percent of GDP in 2003 to 1 percent in 2007. The reduction in market yields reflects the public's confidence that the government will revert to a downward-sloping path for the deficit and the debt/GDP ratio. To achieve this, a decision must be made regarding a significant cut in the budget for 2004, which will be judged, in the final analysis, by the degree of its implementation. If the public assesses that the required cuts will not be carried out, the downward yield trend is likely to halt and could even change direction.Such a development would undermine the credibility of the government's ability to revert to fiscal discipline, and would itself also cause a rise in interest rates for all periods, which would damage the economy's chances ofreverting to a path of growth and increased employment. Continued reductions in the short-term interest rate alongside the maintenance of price stability depends to a great extent on the government's ability to observe fiscal discipline, with a return to a downward deficit and debt path required tostrengthen the financial system. The Bank of Israel keeps a watchful eye on exchange-rate developments, and in particular analyses their implications for the inflation rate, but it is a long time since the exchange rateat any level, its trend, or its volatility have in themselves constituted targets for monetary policy. Foreign-currency markets throughout the world are highly volatile, sometimes exhibiting sharp trend reversals, and the market in Israel, which is highly developed and which offers derivative financial instruments that enable investors to contend with volatility, is similar in this respect to the international markets. Capital flows into and outof the economy are affected inter alia by interest rates in Israel and abroad, changes in which do not necessarily coincide with changes in interest rates determined by central banks. At the beginning of the year, for example, the yield spread between Israeli and US long-term government bonds contracted by more than 3 percentage points, while the differential between the interest rates of the Bank of Israel and the Fed declined by only 1 percentage point. The significance of this is that the market interest rates indicate less pressure to import capital than that reflected by the interest-rate differential between the central banks. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the markets, in order to ensure that the inflation rate defined as price stability is maintained while bolstering financial stability. Subject to these conditions, the Bank will act to support the government's policy to foster employment and shorten the recession. Table 1: Interest rates inIsrael and the US. <strong>End of year.

Philippines,2003-07-30,"In today's meeting, the Monetary Board, the policy-making body of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), voted to keep the BSP's policy interest rates at 6.75 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.0 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate, effective 31 July 2003, the rates that prevailed after the 25 basis point-reduction on 2 July 2003. The current policy rates represent the lowest levels since May 1992. In its assessment of the outlook for inflation and the overall macroeconomic environment, the Monetary Board was of the view that the current monetary policy stance continues to be supportive of the economy's growth path. In particular, inflation going forward is likely to remain moderate for the rest of the year and expected to fall broadly in line with the 4.0-5.0 percent average inflation target for 2004. There are no broad-based price pressures on consumer prices over the near term given the moderate aggregate demand condition. Moreover, while there are already some encouraging signs of pick-up in manufacturing activity in the US, there are still some elements of fragility in global economic recovery such as large spare capacity in the US and soft labor market conditions in other major economies which could pose downside risks to the country's prospects for a strong recovery in external demand. The Monetary Board also agreed that the July 27 incident affected the financial markets but the expected impact on output and inflation is minimal. Based on these major considerations, the Monetary Board believed that the monetary policy should continue to help establish a firm footing for sustained economic growth while remaining vigilant against any possible resurgence of price pressures. Thus, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the current BSP's overnight RRP and RP rates at 6.75 percent and 9.0 percent, respectively. The Monetary Board is scheduled to meet again to review the BSP's monetary policy stance on 28 August 2003."
South Korea,2003-08-07,"Despite the continuing sluggishness of domestic demand, the economy appears to be partly improving, mainly due to the steady growth of exports and the increase in industrial production. In July, consumer price inflation continued to ease for the fourth consecutive month, partly because of the decline in the prices of manufacturing industry products directly affected by the reduction of excise taxes. The upward pace of housing prices has also eased. It is estimated that the current account moved back into a balance from last month's large surplus primarily because of the substantial reduction in surplus on the goods account. Long-term interest rates have risen, causing the term structure to return to a normal, and liquidity conditions are also relatively favorable. Overall, financial markets have shown stability. Taking these domestic and global economic conditions into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark overnight call rate at its current level (3., 75 percent) for the inter-meeting period."
Peru,2003-08-07,"Press Release BOARD OF THE CENTRAL BANK APPROVED MONETARY PROGRAM FOR AUGUST 2003 BCR REDUCES REFERENCE INTEREST RATES IN 50 BASIS POINTS In July, the Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) decreased 0,15 percent. Therefore, last 12 month inflation was 1,98 percent, down from June (2,2 percent). On the other hand, core inflation, a price indicator that excludes high volatility components from the CPI basket, was null in August and 1,4 percent through last 12 months. The decisions of monetary policy are oriented to obtain an annual accumulated inflation rate of 2,5 percent, with a rank of tolerance of one percentage point upwards and downwards (1,5 3,5 percent). These decisions are based on inflation forecasts in order to foresee inflationary or deflationary pressures. May Inflation Report presented an end-of-year inflation forecast near the lower limit of the announced range (1,5  2,5 percent). According to the more recent inflation forecasts, the probabilities that the end- of-year inflation rate falls near the lower limit of the range has increased. The Board of the Central Bank approved the reduction of the reference interest rates for off auction monetary operations in 50 basis points. Therefore, the reference interest rates will be: 3,50 percent: for direct temporary purchases of securities and monetary regulation credits 2,25 percent: for overnight deposits. These reductions of the active and passive interest rates of the BCR with banks imply a flexibility of the monetary policy stance. When the economy is under downward inflation pressures, the Central Bank looses the monetary policy to achieve the inflation target (2,5 percent, with a rank of tolerance of one percentage point upwards and downwards). In case, the interbank interest rate exceeds 3,5 percent, monetary regulation credits and direct temporary purchases of security operations will be charged with the market interbank interest rate. In July, the interbank interest rate was 3,47 percent, down from June (3,74 percent), following the reduction of 25 basis points in the reference interest rates for monetary regulation credits and overnight deposits that month. In July, the daily average balance of banks' current account deposits at the Central Bank was 194, slightly under the estimated range (195 millions to 215 millions). For August, the forecasted range for the daily average balance of banks' deposits held at BCR is 190 million to 210 million, in line with a seasonal demand. It should be noted that this balance is not a target, nor a monetary stance indicator, since it is affected by seasonal factors as well as liquidity requirement changes. The reference interest rate for BCR's operations in dollars are: Monetary regulation credits: LIBOR at 1 month plus one percentage point Overnight deposits: an interest rate equivalent to the rate for similar BCR's deposits held abroad Swaps, the commission that implies an annual effective cost of 3,5 percent is maintained."
Chile,2003-08-12,"THE CENTRAL BANK OF CHILE * Press Release August 12, 2003 At its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided, by unanimous vote, to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 2.75% (annual.) Recent economic activity figures confirm that growth in the second quarter was lower than expected. This is partly explained by the higher international oil price and by world market conditions, especially in the region, that have undermined the dynamism of some areas of the manufacturing sector. Despite the above news, future forecasts continue to consider a gradual reduction in the output gap over the upcoming quarters. This scenario is supported by the strong stimulus of monetary policy and the consolidation of increased world growth prospects for the second semester, especially in the US and Asia. However, significant risks remain in the foreign scenario. The most recent data shows core inflation returning to its expected path. This, combined with other available information, keeps projected inflation around 3% in the policy forecast horizon. The Central Bank of Chile will continue to conduct monetary policy with the necessary flexibility to address any projected inflation deviations in either direction from the specified target inflation range."
United States,2003-08-12,"The Committee continues to believe that an accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with still-robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing important ongoing support to economic activity. The evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period shows that spending is firming, although labor market indicators are mixed. Business pricing power and increases in core consumer prices remain muted. The Committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal. In contrast, the probability, though minor, of an unwelcome fall in inflation exceeds that of a rise in inflation from its already low level. The Committee judges that, on balance, the risk of inflation becoming undesirably low is likely to be the predominant concern for the foreseeable future. In these circumstances, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan. Chairman; Ben S Bernanke; Susan S Bies; J Alfred Broaddus. Jr.; Roger W Ferguson.

South Africa,2003-08-14,"Since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee the rate of inflation has slowed down further to a level just above the upper limit of the inflation target range. The sharp decline in inflation in the first half of 2003 has been a major accomplishment of the prudent monetary policy stance adopted during 2002 combined with the recovery in the external value of the rand. The increase in short-term interest rates in 2002 served to contain inflation and inflationary expectations. Aggregate production began to grow at a slower rate from the middle of 2002. Although aggregate domestic demand continued to increase strongly, supported by government spending, sections of the business sector have experienced some pressure on their earnings and profitability largely as a consequence of a reduction in exports. The rate of increase in the consumer price index for metropolitan and other urban areas excluding the interest cost of mortgage bonds (the CPIX), slowed down further in May and June 2003. The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPIX, which had decelerated from a peak of 11,3 per cent in November 2002 to 8,5 per cent in April 2003, came down to 6,4 per cent in June. Although this slower growth was largely a result of a lower rate of increase in food prices and an actual decline in fuel prices, the prices of other consumer goods and services also increased at a slower pace. The twelve-month rate of increase in the CPIX excluding food and energy prices amounted to 6,8 per cent in June 2003, compared to 8,0 per cent in November 2002. Measured from quarter to quarter at seasonally adjusted and annualised rates, there was an even more significant decline in CPIX inflation from 11,9 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2002 to 2,1 per cent in the second quarter of 2003. In fact, the prices of a number of categories of consumer goods and services, such as grain products, meat, clothing, footwear, transport goods and reading matter, actually declined in the second quarter of 2003. Despite the stickiness in the prices of services when inflation began to subside, the quarter-to-quarter seasonally adjusted and annualised rate of increase in the prices of all services slowed down from 13,2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2002 to 3,8 per cent in the second quarter of 2003. Measured on a year-on-year basis, the inflation in services amounted to 9,5 per cent in June 2003. This still high rate of inflation was mainly due to the low level of the base for year-on-year growth calculations in the preceding year. Changes in the all-goods production price index fell back considerably from a peak year-on-year rate of 15,4 per cent in September 2002 to 1,2 per cent in May 2003, but then rose slightly to 2,3 per cent in June. However, the latter rise in production prices could mainly be attributed to an increase in electricity tariffs for the high-demand winter months, and probably will have only a temporary effect on domestic inflation. Measured from quarter to quarter, the overall production price index has declined in both the first and second quarters of 2003. This decline was to a large extent related to the recovery in the external value of the rand and low inflation rates in South Africa's main trading partner countries, which brought about a decrease in the prices of imported goods throughout the first half of 2003. The prices of domestically produced food products also declined in the first two quarters of 2003. Despite this actual decline in production prices of food, the consumer prices of most types of food are still rising, albeit at low rates. The full advantage of the lower food prices has therefore not as yet been passed on to the consumer. Not only did the inflation outcome improve over the past two months, but the inflation outlook generally remains promising. Most commentators and economists expect inflation to come down over the short term and to remain at this lower level over the long term. The expected further improvement in long-term inflation is confirmed by the decrease in the break-even inflation rate, measured as the difference between the nominal yield on conventional bonds and the real yield on inflation-linked bonds. Expected inflation derived in this way has decreased from 8,0 per cent in February 2002 to 5,9 per cent in April 2003 and 5,1 per cent in July. A number of other developments also favour a further decline in consumer price inflation. First, the fiscal discipline applied by government has materially contributed to the lowering of inflation in the immediate past and will continue to be supportive of monetary policy in the future. Second, the recovery in the external value of the rand favours future moderate price increases in South Africa. The nominal effective exchange rate of the rand has increased by approximately 13 per cent in the first seven months of 2003. Even after this increase, the level of the real effective exchange rate of the rand was still below the index values in early 2000, leaving domestic producers in a more competitive situation in export markets than at the turn of the century. Third, the generally low inflation in the rest of the world is assisting South Africa in combating domestic inflation. In addition, international oil markets are somewhat more stable. Fourth, the slowdown in aggregate production has led to a decline in the utilisation of production capacity in manufacturing from 81,1 per cent in the third quarter of 2002 to 80,3 per cent in the first quarter of 2003. It seems unlikely that capacity constraints will arise in the near future taking the international and domestic economic conditions into consideration. Although the inflation outlook generally still seems to be favourable, there are certain developments in the domestic economy which require the Monetary Policy Committee to remain vigilant. Of particular concern were the recent wage settlement rates of around 10 per cent. Nearly all the salary and wage increases in 2003 have been above the current inflation rate and have been negotiated in an environment of declining productivity. High nominal unit labour costs will therefore inevitably put pressure on price increases. In addition, high rates of increase in some administered prices are also a cause for concern. Another development in the domestic economy which could lead to increasing inflation pressures has been the continued strong aggregate domestic demand for goods and services. National accounts statistics are not yet available for the second quarter of 2003. However, many indicators, such as wholesale and retail trade at constant prices, new and used vehicle sales, real value of buildings completed and electricity consumed, signal that domestic final demand was sustained at a relatively high level in the first half of 2003. The strong performance of domestic demand combined with a slowdown in total domestic production, have led to a reversal in the balance on the current account of the balance of payments from a surplus to a deficit of about Â½ per cent of gross domestic product in the first quarter of 2003. In the second quarter of 2003, a moderate decline in merchandise imports could not neutralise a much larger fall in exports. This caused the trade balance to shrink from a seasonally adjusted and annualised value of R32 billion in the first quarter of 2003 to R23,5 billion in the second quarter. However, the consequent larger current account deficit was financed by inflows on the financial account without putting any significant pressure on the exchange rate of the rand. Going forward if the current account continues to behave in the same fashion it could lead to pressure on domestic inflation. The high domestic demand in the first half of 2003 has been financed to some extent by means of bank credit. The year-on-year growth in underlying bank credit extension to the private sector (i.e. private sector credit extension excluding investments and bills discounted) amounted to 12,7 per cent in June 2003, compared with 7,8 per cent in December 2002. The quarter-to-quarter growth rate in underlying bank credit extension to the private sector rose even more sharply from 12,4 per cent in the first quarter of 2003 to 22,4 per cent in the second quarter. Money supply has also recently accelerated. Although the twelve-month growth rate of the broadly defined money supply (M3) has remained at single-digit levels in the first six months of 2003, the momentum of growth in M3 has accelerated considerably over the past three months. This is clearly reflected in the quarter-to-quarter annualised growth rate in M3 which rose from 2,0 per cent in the first quarter of 2003 to 13,5 per cent in the second quarter. These developments clearly demonstrate that a careful balance needs to be struck in the determination of monetary policy. The welcome fall in inflation, and the prospect going forward that inflation will remain in line with the target range of 3-6 per cent, gives scope for an easing of the monetary policy stance. But against that there needs to be balanced the continuing buoyancy of final domestic demand, and the risks to inflation from the specific sources of cost pressures identified above. Taking all this into account the Monetary Policy Committee has decided to reduce the repo rate by 100 basis points to a level of 11 per cent effective from 15 August 2003. The course of any future movements in the repo rate, in either direction, will continue to be judged by the committee in the light of the outlook for inflation against the inflation target."
Israel,2003-08-25,"The Bank of Israel's Monetary Program for September 2003. The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for September 2003, according to which the interest rate will be reduced by 0.5 percentage points to 6.5 percent. The continuation of the process of reducing the interest rate is made possible by the fact that the level of one-year inflation expectations is within the government's price-stability target of 1-3 percent; at the same time the current background is made up of the continued decline in the rate of actual price rises, the stabilization of real activity at a modest level, and the relative calm in the foreign currency, money and capital markets. This calm prevailed despite a certain rise in the exchange rate and in nominal and real long-term yields in the last few weeks. One-year inflation expectations derived from the capital market in August remained at a similar level to that in July, and expectations for the second year ahead and beyond rose slightly, but most of them are still in the upper part of the target range. Privateforecasters' predictions of 12-month inflation are in the middle of the target range, and the models developed by the Bank of Israel indicate that itis possible to attain the inflation target for the coming year and the following year while continuing to reduce the interest rate. The interest policy is directed towards achieving durable price stability in accordance withthe government's decision that set the inflation target for 2003 and thereafter: and not necessarily for any particular calendar year: at between 1 and 3 percent (defined as price stability). Accordingly, the Bank of Israel's policy at all times in the year is aimed at attaining pricestability over a period of one and two years forward. In the last two months, with the cuts in the Bank of Israel interest rate, real and nominal long-term yields rose, after a persistent decline since February 2003 that was supported by the reduced uncertainty on the regional security and political front and the confirmation of the loan guarantees by the US government. It is not yet clear whether the change evident in the last two months in the trend in the exchange rate: from appreciation to depreciation: and in real and nominal long-term yields, from decline to a rise, is a temporary deviation from the trend of stability that has characterized the markets. In the current regime of convergence to price stability, temporary deviations aboveand below the range of price stability may be tolerated without an immediate response via the interest rate, provided the assessment is that other factors are acting to bring the prices path back to the target. In the currently prevailing circumstances, these factors could be the slowdown in the economy and a credible fiscal policy for 2004 that will bring the rates of the deficit and debt back onto a downward path. Although the most recent economic package did halt the fiscal deterioration, the expected budget deficit in 2003 of 6 percent of GDP is high by any international standards and is inconsistent with government decisions to strive to return to a downward path for the deficit and the share of debt in GDP. Hence government decisions regarding the size of the budget and the deficit for 2004 will constitute a crucial test of the government's fiscal control. The absence of a suitable budget cut and a lack of determination to revert to a downward deficit path thatexpress fiscal discipline are likely to lead to a continuation of the risein real and nominal long-term yields, indications of which have been evident recently, and this would damage the economy's chances of returning to a path of growth and increased employment. In this context, it is unreasonable to assume that the markets will come to terms with a reality in which theBank of Israel's interest rate is falling while long-term interest rates are rising. The Bank of Israel keeps a watchful eye on exchange-rate developments, and in particular analyses their implications for the inflation rate, but the exchange rate at any level, its trendand its volatility do not in themselves constitute a target for monetary policy. Capital flows into and out of the economy, which have slowed in the last two months, are affected inter alia by interest rates for different terms in the markets in Israel and abroad, changes in which do not necessarily coincide with interest-rate changes determined by central banks. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the markets, in order to ensure that the inflation rate defined as price stability is maintained while bolstering financial stability. Subject to these conditions, the Bank will act to support the government's policy to foster employment and shorten the recession. Table 1: Interest rates inIsrael and the US. End of year.

Malaysia,2003-08-27,"Despite a difficult global environment marked by geopolitical uncertainty and the outbreak of SARS, the Malaysian economy exhibited underlying strength. Inflation has remained low, with strong current account surplus, rising external reserves, low debt and strengthened banking sector. These strong fundamentals have accorded flexibility for monetary policy. Bank Negara Malaysia reduced the Intervention Rate by 50 basis points in May as a pre-emptive measure to support growth amidst the less favourable global economic outlook. Forward looking economic and monetary indicators on both the external and domestic fronts have now turned more positive. Many of the negative factors constraining growth in the first half-year have largely dissipated. On the external front, global growth is improving while global equity markets have strengthened. The more positive external developments have improved the near-term outlook for Malaysia's export performance. On the domestic front, consumer and business confidence is improving. Overall, economic policies continue to support the enhancement of long-term productivity growth. Growth in the Malaysian economy is expected to be more favourable in the second half of the year. Inflation is low and is expected to remain low given the sufficient capacity in the economy. There is also no risk of asset inflation. While underlying conditions favour an improved outlook, the low interest rate environment will remain to ensure that the recovery is firmly entrenched. Bank Negara Malaysia 27 August 2003."
Philippines,2003-08-27,"In today's meeting, the Monetary Board, the policy-making body of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), decided to maintain the BSP's policy interest rates at 6.75 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.0 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate, effective 28 August 2003. The BSP's policy rates were last adjusted on 2 July 2003 when the rates were cut by 25 basis points. Based on its overall assessment of economic and financial indicators, the Monetary Board believes that the conditions for future inflation and economic activity remain essentially unchanged since its last discussion on monetary policy on 31 July 2003. Moderate improvements in aggregate domestic demand conditions and manageable cost-push risks to aggregate consumer prices continue to suggest a benign inflation environment over the policy horizon. These conditions provide room for a continued accommodative monetary stance to help spur the economy towards sustainable growth. The Monetary Board believes that maintaining policy interest rates thus helps ensure adequate liquidity to support growth in demand while guarding against future price risks. At the same time, the Monetary Board noted with concern the recent movements in the bilateral exchange rate and their possible implications for the inflation target. Although the recent nominal depreciation has been largely the result of temporary, non-economic and seasonal factors, members of the Monetary Board felt that persistent large daily movements in the exchange rate may serve to raise the public's expectations about inflation. Therefore, as a preemptive measure to prevent adverse changes in inflation expectations, the Monetary Board decided to remove the three-tiered system for banks' placements with the BSP. The overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) transactions with the BSP will be accepted at a flat rate of 6.75 percent. Term RRPs and special deposit accounts (SDAs) with the BSP will be paid the published rates for corresponding tenors, i.e., at a certain spread over the overnight RRP rate. The removal of the tiering system will be effective starting today, 28 August 2003. The BSP will continue to closely monitor developments in the foreign exchange market. The Monetary Board is prepared to take further policy action, if necessary, to ensure orderly market conditions consistent with the pursuit of the BSP's primary objective of price stability. The Monetary Board is scheduled to meet again to review the BSP's monetary policy stance on 25 September 2003."
Poland,2003-08-27,"Warsaw, 27 August 2003 INFORMATION FROM A MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL, held on 26-27 August 2003 On 26-27 August 2003 the Monetary Policy Council held a meeting. The Council read materials prepared by NBP and also information and analyses furnished by the Ministry of Finance, banks and research institutes. The Council then discussed the external environment of the Polish economy as well as real trends, trends in payments and social welfare benefits, matters involving the public financial sector, the money supply, loans and interest rates and the structures of pricing and inflationary expectations, as well as the expected rate of inflation. Decision of the Monetary Policy Council In July 2003 inflation remained low and the annual CPI was not different than in June 2003 reaching 0.8%. Similarly, the base inflation rate indicators stabilised at a low level. Other economic data, which has emerged since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Council: I Indicates: continuous presence of future inflation-limiting factors: (cid:1)(cid:2)A low growth rate of industrial production prices; at 1.8% in July 2003 against 2.0% in June 2003, (cid:1)(cid:2)A continuous strict salary discipline. Between January and July 2003, the average monthly salary in the corporate sector grew by 2.1% in nominal terms comparing to 4.4% year on year. After seven months 2003, a real growth in salaries was equal to 1.6%. (cid:1)(cid:2)In addition, the annual growth rate of monetary aggregate M3 remains low (at 0.7% in July 2003 against 1.2% in June and 0.3% in May), (cid:1)(cid:2)A continuous moderate annual growth rate of dues from households (at 7.7 in July 2003 against 8.4% in June and 7.5% in May). Following a growth period (March to May), the annual corporate credit growth bounced back to a low level to reach 1.7% in July, (cid:1)(cid:2)The inflationary expectations of households and bank analysts have steadied at a low level, (cid:1)(cid:2)In the 2Q 2003, the GDP growth rate (year on year) in the euro zone fell to 0.4% against 0.9% and 1.2% in the 1Q 2003 and 4Q 2002, respectively. In Germany, the GDP in the 2Q 2003 was 0.2% lower than in the 2Q 2002. (cid:1)(cid:2)The August forecast of the annual average oil price in 2003 decreased from 29.4 USD/barrel to 27.6 USD/barrel. II. Confirms: strengthening signs of the economic revival: (cid:1)(cid:2)In July 2003, the PPI grew by 10.3% year on year, including a 11.1% growth in the processing industry; the July results consolidated the upward trend in the production volume, which is particularly evident in the processing industry, (cid:1)(cid:2)For the first time in over three years July 2003 saw a positive annual growth in construction and assembly production at 1.6%; all groups of construction and assembly companies completed works above the level noted in July 2003. As in the preceding months, an over two-fold increase in the production of the companies responsible for preparing construction sites was reported as well as a 50% increase in the production of the construction and finishing companies, (cid:1)(cid:2)Some other signs of investment revival can be observed; following a decrease experienced since the first half of 2000, the first half of 2003 witnessed an increase in investment outlays in the industrial processing sector (by approx. 16% annually in current prices). At the same time, some improvements in the financial condition of companies could be seen. In the first half of 2003, net financial result amounted to PLN 8.8 bn (against PLN 1.5 bn year on year). Sales income on products, goods and materials grew faster that their inherent costs, (cid:1)(cid:2)The assessment of the market situation climate in the industrial processing and construction sectors prepared in July and August clearly offer a more positive picture when compared with the same period in the past two years, (cid:1)(cid:2)In the first half of 2003, a 26.9% growth of exports expressed in dollar terms and a 3.3% growth in exports expressed in euro terms (based on the customs statistics) and by 29.5% and 5.2% according to the payment statistics, respectively, year on year. It was reflected by positive financial results achieved by exporters in the first half of 2003. The share of export sales in the sales income on products, materials and goods grew from 14.9% in the first half of 2002 to reach 16.8% in the first half of this year, (cid:1)(cid:2)Retail sales have been growing steadily with a growth rate of 5.4% in July 2003. III. Other possible factors creating inflationary pressure include: (cid:1)(cid:2)Considerable uncertainty as to the size of economic deficit in the public finance sector in 2003 coupled by even higher uncertainty underlying the fiscal policy profile in 2004 and subsequent years. The estimates prepared by the NBP signal that an increased deficit in public finance in 2004 combined with some additional transfers from the European Union may create a significant demand impulse, (cid:1)(cid:2)A continuous high growth rate of cash in circulation. In July 2003, the annual growth rate of the aggregate reached 13.9% (14.9% in June 2003 and 15.7% in May 2003), (cid:1)(cid:2)High oil prices. In July 2003, the average price of Brent oil amounted to 28.5 USD/b, translating into a growth of 0.9 USD against June 2003 price. At the same time, it was the third consecutive month of growing oil prices. Since the beginning of the month, oil prices have remained at approx. USD 30.00/barrel, (cid:1)(cid:2)Increasing food prices. Experts' estimates concerning the size of future agricultural production indicate that the coming months will see a weakening influence of supply factors that have been contributing to the decreasing prices of foodstuffs for over two years. Drought as well as crop yields below the past 2 years' average will cause shortages in the domestic grain supply from this year's crops. Due to poor crops throughout Europe, it will be difficult to import grain to cover the shortages, avoiding an increase in prices. Furthermore, the Council took into consideration the size of interest rate cuts made to date, as they will effect a gradual increase in the national demand in the second half of 2003 and in 2004. The Monetary Policy Council resolved: To leave the monetary policy parameters unchanged and maintain its neutral approach towards monetary policy. The Council approved âReport on Inflation in 2Q 2003â The discussion will be continued at the next meeting of the Council, which is scheduled for 29-30 September 2003. Assessment of the economic situation July 2003 saw a continuous improvement in investors' optimism in Improvement in the USA. The ISM ratio, which reflects a corporate demand, grew to 51.8 the investment pt in July against 49.8 pt in June 2003. climate in the The improvement in the entrepreneurial climate was not USA accompanied by any improvement in consumer optimism as the Conference Board ratio reflecting the USA consumer climate dropped from 83.5 pt in June 2003 to 76.6 pt in July, predominantly in consequence of the lack of any improvement observable on the labour market. Ever stronger signs of the growing confidence of corporates, confirmed by some favourable economic results generated in the USA (a GDP growth of 2.3% on the annual basis in the 2Q 2003 and 1.7% growth in orders for the American industry compared to May 2003), were accompanied by such phenomena as the dollar gaining ground against the euro and the continued bull market on world exchanges. Contrary to the USA economy, the euro zone corporates' more optimistic expectations (with the German IFO Institute indicator growing up to 90.8 pt in August 2003 from 89.3 pt in July and 88.8 pt in June and the PMI Index for the euro zone reaching 50.2 pt in July compared to 48.2 pt in June) were not reconfirmed by any improvement of the economic Slowdown in the figures. In 2Q 2003, the GDP (annual) growth rate in this region decreased economic growth to 0.4% against 0.9% and 1.2% in the 1Q 2003 and 4Q 2002, respectively. rate in the euro In Germany, the GDP in 2Q 2003 remained lower than in 2Q 2002 by zone countries 0.2%. Furthermore, the 2Q 2003 saw a GDP drop in France. Italy and Holland. According to the European Commission, some signs of revival will be seen only in the last quarter of 2003, with economic growth in the euro zone in 2003 not exceeding 0.6%. The average price of Brent oil was USD 28.5/barrel in July 2003, that is USD 0.9 above the June 2003 price. At the same time, it was the third consecutive month of increasing oil prices. Since the beginning of August. Continuing high oil prices have remained at about USD 30.00 per barrel. prices on global July saw a drop in OPEC production by 60,000 b/d when compared oil markets to June and amounted to 25.4 m b/d, i.e. nearly 0.2% above the oil production limits effective since 1 June 2003. At the same, prompted chiefly by favourable oil prices, the cartel held the official limits at their existing level. Since the beginning of August, the price of oil from the OPEC basket remains above the top target ceiling (28 USD/b). The average oil price forecast in 2003 published by the State Department for Power was subject to a decrease from 29.4 USD/b to 27.6 USD/b in August 2003. In June 2003, the current account deficit fell to EUR 83 m. i.e. to the lowest level seen since August 1998. Compared to June 2002, the negative current account balance decreased by EUR 368 m (and by over EUR 2 bn since the beginning of 2003). A substantial reduction in the deficit stemmed from both a decrease in the negative commodities balance of 4 payments as well as by an increase in the surplus of non-classified Decrease in the payments. the current The commodity payments deficit of EUR 487 m in June 2003 was the account deficit lowest since 1997 (the first publication of the monthly figures on the balance of current payments in ECU and EUR). Reduction in the negative balance is attributed to growing receipts from exports by 8.4% (the highest witnessed in 2003) and combines with payments for imports growing by 0.3% when compared to June 2002. Since 1 January 2003, exports have increased by 5.2% and imports declined by 1.5%. In accordance to the data presented in the item-based statistics, the growth in the Polish exports in the first half of 2003 was predominantly affected by increasing sales to Germany. Within this period, the value of exports (expressed in EUR) grew by 3.3, year on year (compared to a 0.3% reduction in the first half of 2002). This distinctive change of trends in Increasing exports Polish exports to Germany stemmed mainly from some shifts in the import to Germany demand structure of the latter country towards an increasing share of less expensive products; in addition, imports of semi-finished products and raw goods developed faster when compared to imports of finished products. In view of the above, a rise in German imports from the CEE countries and China was observed. At the same time, the growth of exports to other EU states remained markedly below the 2002 level. In July 2003, the PPI growth rate remained at a level exceeding its trend observed so far. Seen against July 2002, total production output grew High growth of by 10.3% compared to the expected growth of approx. 7%. In all sectors of PPI industry, the production exceeded last year's levels: by 11.1% in the processing industry, by 6.9% in electric energy, gas and water production and distribution and by 2.1% in mining and quarrying. It is indicated by the data published on the sectoral structure that the high growth in production observed in July comes as a consequence of The highest increasing exports, although some considerable growth in sales observed growth in sectors in the machine and equipment industry and metal products industry (by producing for 18.0% and 18.8%, respectively) indicate an increasing domestic export investment demand. Compared to the same month in 2002, growth in production of mechanical vehicles, semi-trailers and trailers exceeded 40% and was attributed to the growth in sales of parts and semi-finished products for the motor industry and full production capacity reached by the Opel small engine capacity car, almost entirely designated for export. High growth in furniture production is maintained. The results of July 2003 reinforced the growing trend in the production volume. It is particularly visible in the processing industry. The annual high and increasing growth of the trend have been maintained (growth from 7-8% after June to 8-9% in industry in general and from 8- Growth in the 9% to 10-11% in the processing industry). construction In July 2003, after over three years of decline, production in the industry construction industry exceeded the level reported a year ago (by 1.6%). In production all groups of enterprises, the level of works completed was higher in July 2003 than in July 2002. As in the preceding months, the production of the 5 companies responsible for preparing construction sites more than doubled and a 50% increase in the production of the construction and finishing companies was noted. The first half of 2003 saw a markedly better picture of the financial condition of enterprises when compared to the condition last year and in Improvement in 1Q 2003. The companies included in the research carried out by the the financial Central Statistical Office, generated net financial result of PLN 8.8 bn conditions of (compared to PLN 1.5 bn in the first half 2002). The improvement is enterprises attributed to an increase in the sales of products, goods and materials. Exporters achieved more favourable results. In the first half of 2003, the share of export sales in sales income of products, materials and goods grew to 17% compared to 15% generated in during the first six months of 2002. Research into the economic situation carried out in August 2002 indicates a continuous improvement in market conditions in the industrial processing sector, with better assessment of new orders and current Positive opinions production as well as the financial standing of enterprises. The general on economic economic situation ratio in the construction industry remains positive and situation in the exceeds the equivalent ratios obtained in the same month in the past two processing and years. Opinions about business conditions in the retail trade were slightly construction less pessimistic in July 2003 but worse than in August 2002. Although still industry sectors negative, the opinions concerning current and future sales and current financial standing are considerably better. II. Situation of public sector finances In July 2003, the state budget revenue remained below the level reported for the same period in 2002 (by 14.6%) in consequence of last July's transfer of the NBP dividend (adjusted by the NBP dividend, the state budget revenue in July 2003 exceeded the last year's revenue by 3.6%). State budget expenditures grew by 6.9% chiefly owing to increased subsidies to the Social Insurance Fund and the Labour Fund. It led to a high state budget deficit, significantly above the level of June 2003. In July 2003, receipts from all taxes increased above last year's level, with receipts from corporate income tax increasing for the first time in the past few months (by 1.0%). Within 7 months, the total state budget revenue grew by PLN 4.6 bn in nominal terms, year on year, i.e. by 5.8%. Receipts from personal income tax showed high growth (9.3%), while receipts from indirect taxes rose by 3.5%. However, performance of the indirect taxed annual plan remains poorer than expected (55.4% against 56.8% in 2002) in connection with higher than expected VAT returns resulting from high exports in the first months of 2003. Despite a growth in the CIT receipts witnessed in July, they remain quite low, as the state budget revenue received on this account within 7 months of 2003 was lower by 12.9% than the amount of revenue received in the same period of 2002. After July 2003, state budget expenditure amounted to PLN 112.2, i.e. by 6.4% in nominal terms and by 5.6% in real terms above the year on earfig res andreached577%ofthefig restip latedintheb dget act 6 year figures, and reached 57.7% of the figure stipulated in the budget act. As at the end of July, the state budget deficit reached approx. It translates into a budget performance of 71.5% of the annual limit, i.e. above the level of previous years. There has been no observable improvement in the condition of the 71.5% of the Social Insurance Fund (FUS) after 7 months of 2003 despite the receipts planned state from insurance premiums growing since March 2003. The amounts due budget deficit from FUS to the banking system have almost reached their permissible after July 2003 limit and were equal to PLN 3.5 bn. Moreover, the planned volume of premiums transferred to the Open Pension Funds remains below its performance expectations (52.4%), indicating a current threat of transferring a smaller amount of the funds. The condition of the National Health Fund is also difficult and it is caused by lower than planned receipts from health insurance premiums. In all probability, it will translate to a growing volume of due and payable amounts from the health service. Current information on the financial standing of other public sector finances units indicate that an increase in the economic deficit of the public finance sector in 2003 will reach an estimated 5.4% of the GDP. Deficit of the translating into a 0.3 percentage point growth in the deficit year on year. public sector The threat of an increasing lack of balance in the public finance finances in 2003 at sector in 2004 is approaching. The government assumes an increase in the 5.4% of GDP state budget deficit of 6.7% GDP from 4.8% GDP in 2003 (and 5.3% and 3.6%, respectively, when not taking into account subsidies to the FUS to finance the shortage of insurance premiums to the Open Pension Funds). It means a large-scale fiscal expansion in spite of the expected continuation of the economic revival and return to the GDP fast growth. In part, the expansion is caused by the increasing expenditures connected with the EU accession; however, primarily it stems from the failure to reform the budget expenditures. The high state budget deficit in 2004 will result in a threatening growth in the public debt, the level thereof approaching the second prudential threshold (55% of the GDP), stipulated in the public finance act. III. Money supply, loans, interest rates, exchange rate Preliminary data indicate that the M3 money supply grew slightly in July 2003 (by PLN 0.1 bn) to reach PLN 0.5 bn after the FX differences. The annual M3 growth rate was equal to 0.7%. Compared to June 2003, the volume of cash in circulation outside banks' vaults increased by 0.4%. The annual cash growth rate reached 13.9%. Household deposits growth has been declining for 12 months to reach an annual growth rate of 7.2% in July 2003. At the same time, there was a A slight growth in PLN 1.9 bn increase in the value of the net assets of total investment money supply in funds, which indicates the popularity enjoyed by this form of investment. July offering an alternative to bank term-deposits. The annual growth rate of corporate deposits at 12.2% has maintained its level of the past four months. On the money-creation side, the monthly increase in the total amounts 7 due was equal to PLN 0.5 bn (0.2%), to reach PLN 1.5 bn (0.6%) after elimination of FX differences. It was caused primarily by an increase in the debt of social insurance funds. The annual growth rate of amounts due from households remained at 7.7%. Following an increase (between March and May), the annual rate of growth in amounts due from corporations returned to a low level to reach 1.7% in July. In August, the exchange rate of the zloty was predominantly affected by changes in the EUR/USD relationship on the global market. Over this Weaker zloty period, the trend towards depreciation of the euro consolidated â the against the dollar EUR/USD exchange rate depreciated by approx. 4.4% within 24 days of August. It consequence, the zloty weakened against the American dollar by 4.7% while gaining ground against the euro slightly by 0.5%. IV. Prices, inflationary expectations In July 2003, as in the preceding month, the twelve-month inflation The annual CPI at rate reached 0.8%; its level remaining unchanged since June 2003. For the 0.8% first time since May 2002. July 2003 saw an annual growth in the prices of foodstuffs and non-alcoholic beverages indicating a falling impact of this group of prices on a reduction in the overall CPI level. In July 2003, the ânetâ annual inflation totalled 0.8% (by 0.3 percentage point below the inflation in June 2003), while the monthly Drop in the PPI ânetâ inflation rate reached 0.2%. annual growth July 2003 saw a slight drop in the annual PPI growth rate. The rate industrial producer prices were higher by 1.8% year on year (by 2.0% in June and by 2.0% in May). In August 2003, the structure of responses to the question in the questionnaire, which underlies the analysis of the inflationary expectations of private individuals, remained neutral in terms of its impact on the quantification result of the expected inflation rate. Due to a strong increase in current inflation, the quantified measure of the inflationary expectations Steadying low rose to 0.8% (i.e. by 0.4% against the July figures). inflationary expectations In August 2003, the inflation rate forecast by banking analysts for the month preceding the analogous month of the subsequent year (i.e. July 2004) amounted to 2.2%, i.e. was identical to the inflation rate noted in July 2003. Similarly, the inflation rate forecast as at the end of 2003 remained at the previous month's level of 1.6%. In turn, the annual average price growth forecast for 2004 decreased by 0.1% percentage point when compared to July 2003 to reach 2.3%."
Chile,2003-09-04,"The Central Bank of Chile * Press Release September 4, 2003 At its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided, by unanimous vote, to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 2.75% (annual) Although domestic activity has continued showing some weakness, in the most likely scenario a strengthening is expected for the coming quarters, together with a gradual reduction in the output gap. This has begun to show in better expectations and financial market indicators. The consolidation of an improved international scenario, especially in the United States and Asia, combined with the marked impulse of monetary policy, support this outlook. Overall, some signs of fragility in domestic activity and risks associated to the international environment still persist. The latest price information available shows core inflation slowing down significantly in the past few months, and returning to the lower part of the target range. This means that for now inflationary pressures are limited, which when combined with the rest of the available indicators, yields an inflation forecast of around 3% over the next 24 months. The Central Bank of Chile will continue to conduct monetary policy with the necessary flexibility to address any projected inflation deviations in either direction from the specified target inflation range."
Euroarea,2003-09-04,"Ladies and gentlemen. I would like to report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. Today the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Following our regular economic and monetary analysis, we concluded that the current level of ECB interest rates remains appropriate, as the medium-term outlook for price stability continues to be favourable. The historically low interest rates are lending support to economic activity. The Governing Council will carefully monitor all factors that might affect this assessment. I will now explain the considerations underlying our decision in more detail. Starting with the economic analysis, recent data confirm that real economic activity in the euro area was very weak in the second quarter of 2003, with the Eurostat flash estimate suggesting zero quarterly real GDP growth. However, survey data  which indicate that confidence is growing  as well as recent financial market developments are in line with our main scenario of a gradual upturn in economic activity. In line with available forecasts and projections, we continue to expect this upturn to start in the second half of the year and then to strengthen further in the course of 2004. The factors supporting the expected pick-up in activity are both external and domestic. As regards external factors, recent data signal that a recovery is already underway in several parts of the world. This should lead to an increase in euro area export demand, counteracting the effects of the loss of price competitiveness. On the domestic side, ongoing adjustment efforts by companies to enhance competitiveness and profitability should improve the conditions for an economic upswing. In this environment, the low level of interest rates is strengthening incentives to invest. Furthermore, real disposable income in the euro area should be positively affected by terms-of-trade effects stemming from the past appreciation of the euro. Downside risks to this main scenario for economic growth have declined over the past couple of months but have not disappeared. Macroeconomic imbalances in some regions of the world persist. Although these may not affect the short-term economic dynamics, they constitute risks over the longer run. In addition, high oil price levels may continue to have adverse effects on economic activity in the euro area. As regards price developments. Eurostat's flash estimate for annual HICP inflation in August was 2.1%. While recent oil price developments imply some short-term upward pressure on inflation rates, the broad picture of annual HICP inflation hovering around 2% during the remainder of this year remains unchanged. In 2004 annual inflation rates should fall below 2%, stabilising at levels consistent with price stability. This expectation is based on the assumption of moderate wage developments in the context of a gradual economic recovery. Moreover, the significant past strengthening of the external value of the euro should continue to have lagged effects which will limit upward pressure on prices, despite some recent corrections in the level of the euro exchange rate. Over longer time horizons, inflation expectations in the euro area seem to be well anchored at levels below but close to 2%. Turning to the monetary analysis, monetary growth remained strong in recent months and there is significantly more liquidity available in the euro area than is needed to finance non-inflationary growth. In part, this is due to past portfolio shifts and possibly to an increase in monetary holdings related to precautionary motives. Moreover, the low level of interest rates has contributed to the high demand for liquid assets. The current level of interest rates is also counterbalancing the negative impact of subdued economic growth on credit demand. In fact, the growth of loans to the private sector has remained relatively robust since the beginning of the year. At the current juncture, the ample liquidity is not expected to translate into inflationary pressure. However, monetary growth needs to be closely monitored as the significant amounts of excess liquidity could become a source of concern if they were to persist when economic activity strengthens significantly. Summing up and cross-checking the information from the two pillars, our economic analysis confirms the expectation that price pressures will remain subdued in the coming years, in the context of a gradual economic recovery and moderate import price and wage developments. The strong monetary expansion should, in view of the economic situation, not be seen as adversely affecting this outlook for the time being. Overall, therefore, the medium-term outlook for price stability remains favourable. The Governing Council took note with great concern of recent fiscal developments. In order to maintain the credibility of the institutional and economic underpinnings of EMU, it is fundamental to abide in all respects by the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact. As concerns the upcoming budget plans for 2004, a correction of excessive deficits within the agreed time frame is essential, with an annual structural consolidation effort of at least 0.5% of GDP for countries with fiscal imbalances. Fiscal plans need to be part of a comprehensive and credible medium-term strategy with emphasis on expenditure restraint and growth-oriented restructuring. Sound fiscal policies will help to boost investor and consumer confidence and enhance the prospects for stronger economic growth in the euro area. Progress in implementing structural reforms is as important as fiscal prudence. Efforts to bring public pension systems onto a sustainable path and to further develop private pension schemes deserve support. At the same time, more reforms are needed to reduce structural rigidities in labour and goods markets. Such reforms are essential for addressing what is perceived to be the main economic problem of the euro area, namely the high level of structural unemployment."
Peru,2003-09-04,"Press Release BOARD OF THE CENTRAL BANK APPROVED MONETARY PROGRAM FOR SEPTEMBER 2003 Monetary policy decisions are based on inflation forecasts in order to foresee inflationary or deflationary pressures. August Inflation Report presents an end-of-year inflation forecast near the lower limit of the announced range (1,5 percent) for 2003 and within the lower band (1,5 to 2,5 percent) for 2004. This forecast reflects the lower dynamism of domestic demand, a domestic currency appreciation and an increased supply of agricultural products. In August, the Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) increased 0,01 percent. Therefore, last 12 month inflation was 1,89 percent, down from July (1,98 percent). On the other hand, core inflation, a price indicator that excludes high volatility components from the CPI basket, was 0,08 percent in August and 1,4 percent through last 12 months. Interbank interest rate averaged 3,01 percent in August, down from the previous month (3,47 percent), following the 50 basis point reduction in BCR's reference interest rates. The daily average balance of banks' current account deposits at the Central Bank was 188 million, below the range projected for that month (190 million to 210 million). The Board of the Central Bank approved the reduction of overnight deposit interest rates in 25 basis points. Therefore, the reference interest rates for off auction monetary operations will be: 3,50 percent: for direct temporary purchases of securities and monetary regulation credits 2,00 percent: for overnight deposits The monetary operations regarding injection or withdrawal of liquidity by means of auctions are made in order to place the interbank interest rate within the reference corridor (2,75 percent). In case, the interbank interest rate exceeds 3,5 percent, monetary regulation credits and direct temporary purchases of security operations will be charged with the market interbank interest rate. For September the forecasted range for the daily average balance of banks' deposits held at BCR is 180 million to 200 million, in line with the lower liquidity requirements recorded in August. It should be noted that this balance is not a target, nor an monetary stance indicator, since it is affected by seasonal factors as well as liquidity requirement changes. The reference interest rate for BCR's operations in dollars are: Monetary regulation credits: LIBOR at 1 month plus one percentage point Overnight deposits: an interest rate equivalent to the rate for similar BCR's deposits held abroad Swaps, the commission that implies an annual effective cost of 3,5 percent is maintained."
South Korea,2003-09-09,"Domestic demand remained sluggish and the increasing rate of industrial production fell sharply. Meanwhile, exports have continued to grow steadily and global economic conditions, especially those in the U S., , have improved gradually. In August, consumer price inflation shifted to a rise following four months of decline, as prices of agricultural products rose due to frequent torrential rains. Housing prices also showed a relatively rapid rise, mainly driven by seasonal demand. The current account surplus is estimated to have widened in August mainly thanks to the enlarged surplus on the goods account. In the financial markets, the aversion to credit risks appears to have been declining in part, although fund-raising conditions for low-rated corporations have not improved markedly. The liquidity problems of credit card companies have also shown gradual amelioration. As a whole, financial markets have shown stability. Taking the above financial and economic conditions into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark overnight call rate at its current level (3., 75 percent) for the inter-meeting period."
South Africa,2003-09-10,"The Monetary Policy Committee of the South African Reserve Bank has held a special meeting on Wednesday, 10 September. The impetus for this meeting came from the regular Governors' Committee meeting where amongst other things, recent economic developments are reviewed as part of the Bank's continuous assessment of economic and financial conditions. Although the monetary policy stance is generally set at the MPC meetings that are scheduled on alternate months, there is in fact a continuous process of keeping the monetary stance under review, taking account of any new information or developments. In the interest of transparency and to keep the market informed, the decision to hold an extra MPC meeting today (10 September) was announced last Friday (5 September). There are signs that the international economy is beginning to recover from its extended period of low growth, although the process is proving to be slow and protracted. Second quarter growth in the United States was revised to above 3 per cent, and the prospects for the Asian economies, including Japan, have improved. The outlook for the major European economies however remains less certain. Despite the nascent recovery, its sustainability is not yet assured and there remain significant downside risks. Against this background, world inflation is not expected to be a cause for concern in the near future. Domestically, growth performance has been weak during the first half of the year. Growth in gross domestic product moderated from 1Â½ per cent in the first quarter to 1 per cent in the second quarter. Although there are signs of a revival of output growth following the 3 per cent increase in manufacturing production and the 11Â½ per cent increase in mining production in July 2003, manufacturing production over the 3 months to July declined by 0,9 per cent compared to the previous 3 months. On a year-on-year basis, manufacturing output declined by 1Â½ per cent. The increasing gap between actual output growth and potential growth was further illustrated by the decline in capacity utilisation in manufacturing to 79 per cent in the second quarter of 2003. Domestic expenditure, on the other hand, appears to have held up well so far: for example, the demand for new motor vehicles recorded month-on-month increases of 8Â½ per cent in July and 5Â½ per cent in August. Statistics on South Africa's international trade indicate an improvement in merchandise export earnings, probably reflecting the improved international environment, whereas merchandise imports remained broadly unchanged from June to July. The seasonally adjusted trade surplus improved significantly in July. South Africa's total gold and other foreign exchange reserves rose further from US$18,5 billion (R138,9 billion) at the end of June 2003 to US$19,0 billion (R141,6 billion) at the end of July. The exchange rate of the rand has continued to display greater stability, despite the recent variability in the major currencies. The nominal effective exchange rate stood at 55,1 on 14 August and rose to 57,4 on 4 September, before receding to 54,5 on 9 September 2003. Year-on-year growth in M3 money supply remained below 10 per cent in July 2003. In fact, the seasonally adjusted level of money supply declined by 0,6 per cent from the end of June to the end of July. Bank loans and advances to the domestic private sector recorded a seasonally adjusted increase of only 0,1 per cent in July, bringing the twelve-month growth rate to 13 per cent. During the second quarter of 2003 non-residents were net purchasers of both bonds and shares on the South African exchanges. But in July and August they reduced their holdings by a combined total of R7,6 billion. There was also a reduction in non-residents' foreign-currency deposits with South African banks in July. Fairly buoyant conditions continued to prevail in the real-estate market, while equity prices continued to recover. Share prices have risen by more than 6 per cent from 14 August to date. House prices increased by more than 18 per cent in the year to August 2003. Data on national government finances during the first four months of the current fiscal year indicate an increase of 3,7 per cent in government revenue and an increase of 10,1 per cent in expenditure compared with the corresponding period of the previous year. CPIX inflation, measured over periods of twelve months, picked up slightly from 6,4 per cent in June to 6,6 per cent in July 2003. The increase from month to month picked up from minus 0,3 per cent in June to 0,8 per cent in July, mainly on account of an increase in municipal rates and taxes. Despite this slight increase, the previous downward trend is expected to resume. Production price inflation continues to indicate further future declines in CPIX inflation with the twelve-month rate of production price inflation decelerating from 2,3 per cent in June to 1,5 per cent in July, while the month-on-month increase in July was 0,6 per cent. In the bond market, long yields continue to reflect declining inflation expectations. Consistent with that. CPIX inflation expectations as measured by the Bureau for Economic Research quarterly survey declined across the board for the coming three years, and the levels of CPIX inflation expectations are below those of the same time last year. Against this background the MPC discussed underlying trends in both the international and the domestic economies. There is growing evidence that the recovery in the international economy is proceeding. It is becoming clearer, too, that the pace of activity in the domestic economy is slowing. Helped by the recovery in the rand, prospects for lower inflation remain encouraging: there is continued evidence of declining inflationary expectations and CPIX inflation should fall within the target range of 3-6 per cent. Going forward, the Bank's most recent forecasts show that, all things remaining the same, the inflation target should be achieved for the forecast period. Taking all these factors into account the Monetary Policy Committee has decided to lower the repo rate by 100 basis points to a level of 10 per cent effective from 11 September 2003. This reduction should not be interpreted as a move to a more aggressive lowering of interest rates. Should the inflation outlook deteriorate in the near future, the Committee will not hesitate to take the appropriate action."
Thailand,2003-09-11,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 11 September 2003 Mr. Thirachai Phuvanatnaranubala. Deputy Governor. Monetary Stability. Bank of Thailand announced that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance going forward. The main issues discussed were as follows: 1. The MPC reviewed the latest data on economic conditions in Thailand and deemed that economic growth in the first 7 months of 2003 had been strong, as export and domestic consumption continued to expand, while private investment started to pick up. At the same time, agricultural and manufacturing production grew steadily, while the services sector, especially tourism, began to recover from the effects of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak. Internal stability remained satisfactory. The steady pickup in growth had not generated perceptible upward pressure on prices with headline inflation averaging 19 per cent in the first 8 months of the year, mostly reflecting higher energy and food prices. Core inflation in August was flat year-on-year, mostly due to lower rents and the impact of government administered prices on certain goods and services. The MPC did not view this development as an indication of imminent deflation as economic growth remained robust and headline inflation continued to edge up. The MPC also emphasized the importance of building public understanding of the issue as well as continued monitoring of price developments. External stability remained strong with the current account continuing in surplus, international reserves at a high level, and further declines in foreign debt. 4. The MPC assessed that external factors continued to pose risks to the Thai economy and should be followed closely. The level of interest rate was deemed to be low and appropriate for current economic conditions, and the maintenance of an accommodative stance of monetary policy going forward was viewed as appropriate. The MPC decided to maintain the 14-day repurchase rate at 125 per cent per annum. With respect to the baht, the MPC assessed that additional measures are appropriate for managing short-term capital movements."
United States,2003-09-16,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 1 percent. The Committee continues to believe that an accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing important ongoing support to economic activity. The evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period confirms that spending is firming, although the labor market has been weakening. Business pricing power and increases in core consumer prices remain muted. The Committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal. In contrast, the probability, though minor, of an unwelcome fall in inflation exceeds that of a rise in inflation from its already low level. The Committee judges that, on balance, the risk of inflation becoming undesirably low remains the predominant concern for the foreseeable future. In these circumstances, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan. Chairman; Ben S Bernanke; Susan S Bies; J Alfred Broaddus. Jr.; Roger W Ferguson. Jr.; Edward M Gramlich; Jack Guynn; Donald L Kohn; Michael H Moskow; Mark W Olson; Robert T Parry; and Jamie B Stewart. Jr."
Israel,2003-09-22,"The Bank of Israel's Monetary Program for October 2003. The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for October 2003, according to which the interest rate will be reduced by 0.4 percentage points to 6.1 percent. This brings the cumulative reduction in the Bank of Israel's interest rate since December 2002 to 3.0 percentage points. The continuation of the process of reducing the interest rate is made possible by the fact that the level of one-year inflation expectations is within the price-stability target of 1-3 percent, against the background of a moderate rate of actual price increases, the stabilization of real activity at a modest level, and the relative calm in the foreign currency, money and capital markets. One-year inflation expectations derived from the capital market in September remained at a similar level to that in August, at about the middle of the target range (a little below 2 percent), and expectations for the second year ahead and beyond are still in the upper part of the target range. Private forecasters' predictions of 12-month inflation rose slightly, but are also in the middle of the target range, and the models developed by the Bank of Israel indicate that it is possible to attain the inflation target for the coming year and the following year while continuing to reduce the interest rate. In accordance with the government's decision taken in 2000, the interest policy is directed towards achieving long-term price stability and not necessarily for any particular calendar year. Accordingly, the Bank of Israel's policy at all times in the year is aimed at attaining price stability over a period of one and two years forward. In the last month the rise in real and nominal yields on government bonds that had started in July halted. These yields had declined between February and June 2003 due partially to the reduced uncertainty on the regional security and political front, the confirmation of the loan guarantees by the US government, and the government's economic program for 2003. The current stabilization apparently reflects a waiting position in the financial markets in their assessment of decisions regarding the 2004 budget and the possible effects of uncertainty related to the security situation on the renewal of economic activity. The government's budget for 2004 must clearly indicate a convergence to a downward trend for the deficit and government debt. It would be appropriate in this context for the government to adopt a system of monthly monitoring of budget performance and of attainment of deficit targets to enable deviations, if any, to be rectified duringthe year. According to Bank of Israel estimates, the probability of achieving the deficit target for 2004 of 4 percent of GDP is low, but even that deficit level means a rising share of government debt in GDP. In addition, it is unclear whether the overall program of infrastructure investment and the plan for reducing the number of foreign workers by raising the cost of employing them can be implemented. The budget as approved contains some positive steps that have long-term implications and that help provide a basis for stability and lead the economy back to growth. On the other hand, whittling away at the budget framework while approving it and a lack of determination to revert to a downward deficit path that reflects fiscal discipline are likely to undermine stability and lead to a rise in nominal and real long-term yields, obstructing the process of economic recovery. It is unreasonable to assume that the markets will accept an ongoing situation in which the Bank of Israel's interest rate is coming down while long-term interest is rising. The Bank of Israel keeps a watchful eye on exchange-rate developments, and in particular analyses their implications for the inflation rate, but the exchange rate at any level, its trendand its volatility do not in themselves constitute a target for monetary policy. Capital flows into and out of the economy, which have slowed in the last two months, are affected inter alia by interest rates for different terms in the markets in Israel and abroad, changes in which do not necessarily coincide with interest-rate changes determined by central banks. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the markets, in order to ensure that the inflation rate defined as price stability is maintained while bolstering financial stability. Subject to these conditions, the Bank will act to support the policy to foster employment and shorten the recession. Table 1: Interest rates in Israel and the US. Central banks' interest rates.

Poland,2003-09-30,"Warsaw, 30 September 2003 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 29-30 September 2003 A meeting of the Monetary Policy Council was held on 29-30 September 2003. The Council was provided with the materials prepared by the NBP as well as information and analyses furnished by the Ministry of Finance, banks and research institutes. The Council discussed recent developments in the external environment of the Polish economy and trends in economic performance with regard to payments and social welfare benefits, in the public finance sector, with regard to money supply, credits and interest rates, inflation expectations and price levels as well as inflation prospects. Decision taken by the Monetary Policy Council August 2003 saw a deterioration of the annual CPI from 0.8% to 0.7% reported in July and June 2003. Similarly, the base inflation rate indicators stabilised at a low level. Other economic data, which emerged since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Council indicates: I Continuous presence of future inflation-limiting factors: (cid:1)(cid:2) A low growth rate in industrial production prices; at 1.9% both in July and August 2003, (cid:1)(cid:2) Continuing strict salary discipline. Between January and August 2003, the average monthly salary in the corporate sector grew by 2.1% in nominal terms comparing to 4.2% on a year-to-year basis. After eight months 2003, a real growth in salaries was equal to 1.6%. (cid:1)(cid:2) In addition, the annual growth rate of monetary aggregates M3 remains low (at 1.4% in August against 0.7% in July 2003 and 1.3% in June 2003), (cid:1)(cid:2) A continuous moderate annual growth rate of receivables from households (at 8.4% in August against 7.9% in July 2003 and 8.5% in June). The annual corporate credit growth remained low at 1.8% both in August and July 2003, (cid:1)(cid:2) The inflationary expectations of households and bank analysts have steadied at a low level. II. Confirms strengthening signs of the economic revival:: (cid:1)(cid:2)August 2003 witnessed a 5.8% growth in PPI on a year-to-year basis. The slow-down in the production growth rate was affected by working time in August 2003 being shorter by one working day; net of seasonal factors, the PPI grew by 8.8% and the processing industry PPI grew by 10%, (cid:1)(cid:2)In August 2003, construction industry production fell by 3.0% on a year-to- year basis, falling by 2.2% net of seasonal factors in the production, i.e. by the same amount as reported for July 2002. A 50% growth in the production of finishing construction companies has been sustained, (cid:1)(cid:2) September opinions on the economic situation in the industrial processing sector improved against opinions reported for August 2002 and 2001. (cid:1)(cid:2)On a year-to-year basis, a growth in exports was reported; by 4.9% EUR- denominated exports and by 26.5% in USD-denominated exports, after eight months 2003 (in accordance with payment statistics), (cid:1)(cid:2)Retail sales have been growing steadily, with a growth rate of 5.5% in August 2003. III. Other possible factors creating inflationary pressure include: (cid:1)(cid:2)Developments in the 2004 fiscal policy and unclear budget perspectives for the coming years increase uncertainty as to the future FX rate level, as indicated by current developments on the FX market. The preliminary budget for 2004 poses a threat to continuous and sustainable economic growth. The high crediting needs of the budget stimulate an increase in long-term market interest rates which, in turn, will result in âpushing outâ funds for companies, (cid:1)(cid:2)A continuous high growth rate of cash in circulation. In August 2003, the annual growth rate of the aggregate reached 15.7% (13.9% in July 2003 and 14.9% in June 2003), (cid:1)(cid:2)High oil prices prevailing despite a drop in the average oil price to 27.0 USD/b in September 2003. In consequence of the OPEC decision on reducing the oil production quota, the prices may bounce back to a high level. Furthermore, the Council took into consideration the scale of interest rate cuts performed so far, as they will affect a gradual increase in the national demand at the end of 2003 and in 2004. 2 After a discussion, the Monetary Policy Council resolved to leave the NBP interest rates unchanged. At the same time, the Monetary Policy Council decided to reduce the required reserve rate for banks from 4.5% to 3.5%. The resolution on the reduction will become effective on 1 October 2003 and applies to the required reserves to be maintained starting from 31 October 2003. Furthermore, the Monetary Policy Council: (cid:1)(cid:2)Adopted a resolution on approving âMonetary Policy Guidelines for 2004â (cid:1)(cid:2)Approved âThe Balance of Payments of Poland Forecast for 2004â (cid:1)(cid:2)Approved âThe Balance of Payments based on Transactions and Balance of Foreign Assets and Liabilities of the Republic of Poland for 2002â. (cid:1)(cid:2)Approved âThe Balance of Payments of the Republic of Poland for the first six months 2003â. The next meeting of the Council is scheduled for 28-29 October 2003. Overview of the economic situation In August 2003 positive signals of the approaching economic revival in the international economic situation continued. This was confirmed by Improvement in growing prices on international stock markets and improving corporate the investment confidence indexes. In the USA, the ISM has been rising on four climate in the consecutive occasions up to 54.7 in August against 45.4 in April 2003; in USA and the euro the euro zone, the PMI reached 49.1 in August against 46.6 in June 2003. zone Increased optimism of the business circles was noticeable in all large economies of the euro zone: in France. Germany and Great Britain. The improving investment climate in Germany is reflected by the Ifo index, reaching 91.9 in September 2003 against 90.8 in August 2003. August and September 2003 witnessed a decrease in market expectations of interest rate reductions both in the USA and the euro zone. In August 2003, the average price of Brent oil/barrel equaled USD 29.8 and was higher by almost 1.5 USD than the price reported in July and by almost USD 5.00 than in April 2003. In the first and third decade of August 2003, oil prices remained above USD 30.00/barrel and reached the highest level quoted since the beginning of war in Iraq. The rising oil prices stem from political situation in Iraq and from persisting low oil High oil prices on stock level in the developed countries. global markets in The first half of September 2003 witnessed a marked drop in oil August  drop in prices following decreasing demand for petrol and reconstruction of oil prices in the distillated fuel stock, including fuel oil. Over the period, the average oil first half of price remained at USD 27.5/barrel. Moreover, news from Iraq contributed September to the decrease in oil prices. It is estimated that in the first half of September 2003, oil production in Iraq increased to 1.5 m.b./d, i.e. it is realistic to anticipate a bounce of the oil production to the pre-war level from the beginning of 2004. According to GUS estimates the GDP growth rate in the second quarter 2003 reached 3.8%, i.e. it exceeded the expected level. PPI growth of Total PPI grew by 5.8% in August 2003 viewed on a year-to-year 5.8% basis. Compared to last year, production growth was observed in the processing industry (by 7.1%) and in electricity, gas and water production and supply (by 1.6%), while there was a fall in mining and quarrying (by 8.4%). A slower PPI growth rate compared to the PPI growth rate reported in the two preceding months was affected by working time in August being shorter by one working day (after seasonal factors, the total PPI growth rate reached 8.8% and the processing industry PPI reached 10.0%). Another factor that has begun to affect deterioration in the production growth is so-called statistical base effect (in subsequent months growth rates will be computed in relation to the growing level of production in 2003). As in the preceding months, the PPI growth reported in August is chiefly attributed to the favourable developments in sectors of high and 4 increasing share of exports, including motor vehicles, trailers and semi- trailers sector, furniture sector, rubber and plastic articles sector and metal articles sector. Since March 2003, a production growth in the motor vehicle sector High growth in exceeds 21% on a year-to-year basis, to reach 44.1% and 42.7% in May export production and July 2003, respectively. The growth comes as a consequence of a high, and sales in the approx. 50% growth in the exports of car parts and accessories and motor industry continuously increasing growth in the exports of passenger cars. The value of passenger car exports lower by 20% in January and February 2003 than the value reported for the same months of 2002, exceeded the level reported for March 2002 by 35.1% and almost doubled in May 2003 when compared on a year-to-year basis. After a growth reported in July 2003 (by 1.7% on a year-to-year basis), construction industry production fell again below the level reported in August 2002 (by 3.0%). There is little doubt that the fall was affected by a shorter working time when compared to August 2002 (a decline of 2.2% similar to the decline observed in July 2003 after seasonal effect elimination) but, primarily, it reflects a continuously low growth in the investment demand. An over two-fold growth in the production of the companies responsible for preparing construction sites observed in the previous months dropped to 67%, while over 50% growth in the production of finishing construction companies was maintained. The research into the economic situation carried out by the Main Positive Statistical Office indicate that September is yet another month of assessment of maintained favourable trends in industrial processing and still favourable, market trends in but in the respondentsâ opinion, worse market conditions in the the processing and construction industry. The respondentsâ negative assessment of the general construction business climate in retail trade is continued, with no noticeable signs of industry improvement. Despite a slight deterioration of the respondentsâ optimism, the general business climate ratio in the processing industry is one of the highest reported in September since the beginning of research conducted by the Main Statistical Office. II. Situation of public sector finance After 8 months 2003, the state budget revenue was higher by 4.7% in nominal terms when measured on a year-to-year basis. After August 2003, only 61.8% of the plan specified in the budget act was executed, i.e. below the level reported for the past years. It indicates that the state budget revenue in 2003 will be below the volume planned in the act. In consequence of low receipts from CIT and non-tax revenue, the revenue generated in August remained 3% below the revenue of August 2002. A slight growth in indirect taxes and receipts from PIT was reported. Subsequently, despite expenditures remaining below the last yearâs level, a 15% growth in the budget deficit was reported when measured on a year- to-year basis. After 8 months of 2003, budget expenditures amounted to PLN 5 126.1 bn. i.e. grew by 5.6% when compared to the budget expenditures for the same period of 2002. Execution of the expenditure plan after August 2003 is comparable to the level reported in the preceding years and equal to 64.7%. After August 2003, the budget deficit reached approx. PLN 29.61 bn, translating into utilisation of approx. 76.4% of the annual limit, i.e. above the level reported in preceding years. No observable improvement in the financial condition of the National Social Insurance Fund (FUS) was reported. Financial difficulties of the entity are indicated by receipts from insurance premiums below the planned level, a debt level close to the acceptable limit and the fact that only a part of funds due is transferred to the Open Pension Funds. The financial condition of the National Health Fund is also difficult in connection with lower than expected receipts from health insurance premiums. In addition, the NHF is struggling with due and payable dues of the patientsâ fund and possible compensation to hospitals arising from the provisions of the â203 Actâ. Deficit of the Summarising, it can be anticipated that failure to execute the state public finance budget revenue plan will result in adjustment of expenditures to a level sector in 2003 at ensuring realisation of the deficit defined in the Budget Act as well as in 5.4% GDP the increasing deficit of remaining units in the sector. In the opinion of the NBP, economic deficit of the public finance sector in Poland in 2003 will remain at 5.4% GDP. The draft Budget for 2004 Act predicts very high growth in the budget deficit from 4.8% of GDP in 2003 to 6.6% of GDP in 2004, including a subsidy to FUS to cover for the shortage of the premiums Increasing fiscal transferred to the Open Pension Funds. Despite continuation of the expansion in 2004 economic upward trend and return to the GDP rapid growth path anticipated in the governmental draft of the plan, it translates into a large- scale fiscal expansion. The scale of the expansion is larger than it would be required in order to finance budget expenditures connected with the membership of Poland in the European Union. The draft plan does not offer any system solutions to restrict growth in expenditures and most expenditures remain rigid. In consequence of a rapid growth in the state budget deficit and its credit needs in 2004, there is a serious threat that the public debt will exceed the second prudential threshold of 55% of GDP. The draft budget for 2004 increases the threat to continuous and sustainable economic growth. Increasing economic risk will translate into a growth in the long-term interest rates and increased uncertainty as to the FX rate level. III. Money supply, loans, interest rates, exchange rate A slight growth in Figures presented in the accelerated information indicate PLN 0.7 bn money supply in (0.2%) growth in nominal terms in the M3 money supply in August 2003. August After the FX differences, the annual M3 growth rate in August remained unchanged, while the annual M3 growth rate reached 1.4%. Following up on the trend observed in the preceding months. August 6 2003 witnessed a PLN 1.1 bn. growth in cash in circulation, resulting in an annual cash growth rate of 15.7%. Total deposits  the M3 component  deteriorated by PLN 0.4 bn. (- 0.2%) in September 2003, i.e. by PLN 1.2 bn when adjusted by FX rate fluctuation. Corporate deposits were subject to a slight drop by PLN 0.8 bn. i.e. -1.4% since they were only slightly affected by the FX rates, while a drop in the household deposits by PLN 01. bn. (-0.1%) in nominal terms increased considerably when adjusted by FX rate fluctuations to reach PLN 0.7 bn. August 2003 saw the annual household deposit growth rate at - 6.9%, with a slowdown in this categoryâs growth rate observable since March 2002. The trend is parallel to continued development in other forms of savings alternative to bank deposits. July 2003 witnessed a PLN 1.9 bn. growth in the value of net assets of investment funds followed by an Moderate growth approx. PLN 1.7 bn. growth of same in August 2003. in household In August 2003, total dues increased by PLN 1.4 bn. (0.6%), i.e. PLN loans; low growth 1.2 bn. after the elimination of FX differences. The highest share in the in corporate loans growth is attributed to the growth in household loans at PLN 1 bn. The annual growth rate of household loans in August 2003 amounted to 8.4%. Housing loans have constituted nearly 90% of the growth in private loans reported for the period of the past 12 months. A slow growth in corporate loans was reported with its annual growth rate in August at 1.8%. In August 2003, the exchange rate of the zloty in nominal terms gained ground against the euro and depreciated towards the dollar. It stemmed from a change in the USD/EUR cross exchange rates; the average monthly value of the euro against the dollar deteriorated to 1.12, reaching the lowest level in the past four months. Weaker zloty in September September 2003 saw increasing fluctuation in the zloty exchange rate. Zloty was losing ground and the trend grew stronger in the second half of the month. Polish currency displayed stronger depreciation against the euro; EUR/PLN exchange rate went up to approx. 4.41 in the first half of September to reach 4.52 in the second half. On average, the zloty weakened against the euro by 2.3%. The weakening came as a result of uncertainty with respect to the public finance perspectives; moreover, the effect of the euro gaining ground again against the dollar on the global markets (the EUR/USD exchange rate improved from 1.08 at the beginning of September to 1.14 in the last week of September). Iv. Prices, inflationary expectations The annual CPI at In August 2003 the twelve-month inflation rate reached 0.7% against 0.7% 0.8% in July 2003. The insignificant CPI growth was affected by reductions in the prices of foodstuffs and non-alcoholic beverages (by 0.4%), prices of clothes and footwear (by 2.7%) and prices of alcohol and tobacco (by 3.0%). At the same time, an increase in transport prices (by 3.8%) was reported caused by fuel prices rising (by 2.0%) in consequence of high oil prices on international markets. The annual PPI at In August 2003, the ânetâ annual inflation rate totaled 0.8%, while 1.9% the monthly ânetâ inflation indicator reached 0.1%. The level of the annual PPI remained unchanged in August 2003, 7 while producer prices grew by 1.9% on a year-to-year basis, and production sold price index grew by 0.4% (against 0.7% in July 2003). September 2003 saw a decline in the inflation rate expected within the coming year by private individuals to 0.7% i.e. by 0.1 perc. point Steadying low against the level reported in August 2003. inflationary In September 2003, the inflation rate forecast by banking analysts for expectations August 2003 reached 2.3% i.e. by 0.1 perc. point above the level reported for August 2003. There was a 0.2 perc. point drop in the inflation rate expected at the end of 2003 to 1.4%, while the annual average price growth forecast for the end of 2004 remained at its August 2003 level of 2.2%."
Philippines,2003-10-01,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board, the policy-making body of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), voted unanimously to maintain the BSP's key policy rates at 6.75 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.0 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. In its assessment of the prevailing inflation environment and overall macroeconomic conditions, the Monetary Board was of the view that the current monetary policy stance remains supportive of the economy's growth path. The near-term outlook for inflation remains essentially unchanged since the last monetary policy meeting on 28 August 2003. Over the policy horizon, price dynamics should remain benign with the average inflation for 2004 expected to track broadly the Government's announced target of 4.0-5.0 percent. The Monetary Board's expectations of benign inflation are based on subdued improvements in aggregate demand, particularly credit demand, soft labor market conditions, along with the moderate influence of cost-push factors such as energy prices. Nevertheless, the Monetary Board recognized that the outlook for inflation still contains an undercurrent of risk in the form of possible adverse cost-side developments and adjustments in the foreign exchange market, which have a bearing on public expectations about future prices. Given these considerations, the Monetary Board believes that the BSP's monetary policy stance should continue to ensure the presence of adequate liquidity to support the growth in domestic demand. At the same time, it should remain sufficiently cautious to guard against any possible renewed price pressures that may emerge over the near term. The Monetary Board is scheduled to meet again to review the BSP's monetary policy stance on 23 October 2003."
Euroarea,2003-10-02,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank today met for the eighth time outside Frankfurt. I would like to thank both Governor ConstÃ¢ncio for his invitation and generous hospitality, as well as the staff of the Banco de Portugal for an excellently organised meeting. Turning to business, we have decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The basic components of our economic and monetary analysis remain in place. In particular, the medium-term outlook for price stability continues to be favourable, allowing us to conclude that the historically low level of ECB interest rates remains appropriate. We will continue to carefully monitor all developments which might affect our assessment. The more detailed considerations underlying our decision are as follows:. Starting with the economic analysis, real GDP growth in the euro area was virtually stagnant in the first half of this year. However, the latest data and information are consistent with a moderate pick-up in activity in the second half. In particular, there are signs that economic activity might have firmed somewhat in the third quarter, and confidence indicators available up to September generally point to some improvement in economic expectations. In line with available forecasts and projections, this upturn should gradually strengthen in the course of 2004. Externally, the recovery in world economic activity appears to be proceeding. This should support demand for euro area exports, counteracting the effects of the deterioration in price competitiveness. Domestically, companies seem to be continuing their adjustment efforts to enhance productivity and profitability. This, together with the low level of interest rates, should contribute to a recovery in investment. Furthermore, terms-of-trade effects stemming from the past appreciation of the euro should positively affect real disposable income in the euro area, and thereby private consumption. Developments in financial markets are generally consistent with this overall picture. The short-term risks to our main scenario of a gradual recovery appear to be broadly balanced. However, some risks to the sustainability of economic growth at the global level remain. These are related to the medium-term sustainability of public finances in major industrialised countries and, in this connection, the adjustment of external imbalances in some regions of the world. Turning to the outlook for prices, according to Eurostat's latest flash estimate. HICP inflation in September was 2.1%. For the remainder of this year. HICP inflation should hover at around 2%. Exchange rate developments help to contain short-term upward pressure on prices, while higher unprocessed food prices related to the hot and dry weather conditions in some euro area countries could imply some limited upward risk over the next few months. For early 2004, there is still some uncertainty about the precise impact on HICP inflation of planned increases in indirect taxes and administered prices in a number of euro area countries. Looking beyond the short term, however, we continue to expect inflation to fall below 2% in 2004 and to remain in line with price stability thereafter. This expectation is based on the assumption of moderate wage developments in the context of a gradual economic recovery. In this respect, we note that inflation expectations in the euro area are anchored at levels below but close to 2% over the medium to long term. Turning to the monetary analysis, the strong monetary growth over the past two years has been fuelled by past portfolio shifts, precautionary saving and the low level of interest rates. The latter factor also provided a counterweight to the negative impact of weak economic growth on loan developments. In fact, there are signs of a pick-up in the growth rates of loans to the private sector. At the current juncture, the accumulation of excess liquidity is not a cause for concern given the subdued economic growth in the euro area. However, if it were to persist in conjunction with a significant strengthening of economic activity, it could lead to inflationary pressures in the medium term. Summing up and cross-checking the information from the two pillars, our economic analysis continues to confirm the expectation that price pressures will remain subdued in the coming years, in the context of a gradual economic recovery and moderate import price and wage developments. In view of the economic situation, the strong monetary expansion should not be seen as adversely affecting this outlook for the time being. Overall, therefore, the medium-term outlook for price stability remains favourable. As regards fiscal policy, we would like to reiterate our serious concerns. There is growing evidence that most countries will miss their budgetary targets for 2003 by a significant margin and, in a number of cases, budgetary plans for 2004 are not reassuring. While the deterioration of budgetary balances mainly reflects the lower-than-anticipated economic growth, it is worrying to see that not all countries with severe imbalances have so far introduced sufficient consolidation measures. It is fundamental that the credibility of the institutional underpinnings of EMU be maintained. In this respect, let me stress that the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact provide an appropriate framework for maintaining fiscal discipline within adequate bounds of flexibility. Far from being a mechanical scheme to constrain fiscal policies, the excessive deficit procedure establishes a sequence of incentives for countries to prevent and correct severe budgetary imbalances. At each instance of this sequence, a country's fiscal efforts and changes in the economic environment are assessed and taken into account in the design of further steps. Countries are therefore continuously made aware of the risks and costs arising from any delay in taking policy action to preserve the sustainability of public finances. To maintain the credibility of the fiscal policy framework it is essential to fully abide by its rules and to implement them in every respect. Doing so and complying with the requirements of the ECOFIN Council will lead to positive confidence and growth effects, which can be strengthened if fiscal plans are part of a comprehensive and credible medium-term strategy with emphasis on structural expenditure reform. Finally, although it might mean stating the obvious here in Lisbon, the Lisbon Strategy, which was agreed upon back in March 2000, is of the utmost importance in the process of implementing structural reforms. More reforms are urgently needed to reduce structural rigidities in labour and goods markets so as to address the main economic problem of the euro area, namely the high level of structural unemployment. At the same time, current efforts to set in motion important changes in pension and health systems and in other areas in order to prepare for the ageing of society are of immense significance in ensuring the sustainability of our social security systems. As you are aware, this will most probably be the last press conference following a meeting of the Governing Council that I will chair. From my perspective, these press conferences have been a success. Their purpose is to inform the media and the general public in detail, and on an almost ""real-time"" basis, about the outcome of Governing Council meetings. They have allowed us to communicate and clarify our policy decisions in an open and transparent manner. Indeed, in my view, this practice makes the ECB one of the most transparent central banks in the world. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the media for their work over the five-and-a-half years in which I have had the privilege of being at the helm of the Governing Council."
Peru,2003-10-02,"Press Release BOARD OF THE CENTRAL BANK APPROVED MONETARY PROGRAM FOR OCTOBER 2003 In September, the Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) increased 0,56 percent. Therefore, last 12 month inflation was 1,98 percent, up from August (1,89 percent). On the other hand, core inflation, a price indicator that excludes high volatility components from the CPI basket, was 0,01 percent in August and 0,68 percent through last 12 months. Interbank interest rate averaged 2,77 percent in September, down from the previous month (3,01 percent), following the 25 basis point reduction in BCR's reference interest rates. The August Inflation Report presented an end-of-year inflation forecast near the lower limit of the announced range (1,5 percent) and within the lower band (1,5  2,5 per cent) for 2004, forecasts that are maintained. The Board of the Central Bank approved the maintenance for off auction monetary operations interest rates: 3,50 percent: for direct temporary purchases of securities and monetary regulation credits 2,00 percent: for overnight deposits The monetary operations regarding injection or withdrawal of liquidity by means of auctions are made in order to place the interbank interest rate within the reference corridor (2,75 percent). In case, the interbank interest rate exceeds 3,5 percent, monetary regulation credits and direct temporary purchases of security operations will be charged with the market interbank interest rate. For October the forecasted range for the daily average balance of banks' deposits held at BCR is 180 million to 200 million. It should be noted that this balance is not a target, nor an monetary stance indicator, since it is affected by seasonal factors as well as liquidity requirement changes. The reference interest rate for BCR's operations in dollars are: Monetary regulation credits: LIBOR at 1 month plus one percentage point Overnight deposits: an interest rate equivalent to the rate for similar BCR's deposits held abroad Swaps, the commission that implies an annual effective cost of 3,5 percent is maintained."
Romania,2003-10-06,"The assessment of recent developments and perspectives on strengthening macroeconomic stabilization in the period to come was on the agenda of the National Bank of Romania Board meeting. In order to mitigate temporary inflationary pressure generated by the adjustment of energy product prices, the NBR Board decided to increase policy rate by one percentage point. This measure is part of the proactive actions strategy stated by the central bank in August already, with the goal of keeping the 14 percent inflation target for 2003 as established together with the Government."
South Korea,2003-10-09,"Industrial production activities remained sluggish due to the contraction of domestic demand, whereas exports and construction investment have continued to grow steadily and the economic recovery in advanced countries including the U S., has become more apparent. In September, consumer price inflation rose more steeply than last month, as prices of agricultural products surged due to typhoon damage. Housing prices, especially those of medium-and-large sized apartments, also showed a more rapid rise. It is estimated that the current account surplus has continued to widen, owing to the enlarged surplus on the goods account. In the financial markets, overall demand for funds is low and liquidity conditions are favorable, although fund-raising conditions have remained difficult for some small-and-medium sized corporations. Taking the above financial and economic conditions into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark overnight call rate at its current level (3., 75 percent) for the inter-meeting period. The Committee will consider appropriate policy reactions, reflecting the overall economic situation including the speed of economic recovery and the development in the real estate markets."
Chile,2003-10-14,"The Central Bank of Chile PRESS RELEASE* October 14, 2003 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided, by unanimous vote, to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 2.75% (annual). Since the last policy meeting, a better international scenario has continued to consolidate. This includes prospects of increased world growth next year, particularly in the U.S. and Asia, an increase in prices of commodities, and improved financial conditions. These factors, combined with positive expectations for the Chilean economy, have been reflected strongly in domestic financial markets. These favorable developments are expected to translate gradually in better activity indicators for the coming quarters, although for now they have not been reflected t into actual output data. In fact, the latest information shows weak growth for August, related to some factors that are considered to be temporary. Regarding inflation, recent indicators show price pressures lower than initially forecasted. Both CPI and core inflation are in the lower half of the target range, and the former is even expected to be transitorily below 2% in some coming months. However, with all the information at hand the inflation projection remains around 3% over the next 12 to 24 months. The Central Bank of Chile reiterates that it will continue to conduct monetary policy with the necessary flexibility to address any projected inflation deviations in either direction from the specified target inflation rate."
South Africa,2003-10-16,"Issued by Mr T T Mboweni. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank. The Monetary Policy Committee on 15 and 16 October 2003 undertook a detailed assessment of recent economic and financial developments in South Africa and the rest of the world. The main findings of the Committee were that:. the international economy is continuing to recover, albeit in a protracted and uneven fashion;. there seems to be little reason for inflationary pressures to rise in South Africa's main trading-partner countries;. there has been a major realignment of currencies in the world as a result of developments around the US dollar;. domestic economic growth has slowed down;. the external value of the rand has recovered to levels last seen in the middle of 2001;. domestic final demand is continuing to increase, supporting domestic production as well as the growth in the volume of imported goods, although there are imbalances particularly in the externally-exposed sectors;. employment creation remains one of the main problems in South Africa; and. most importantly from a monetary policy perspective, inflation pressures have abated further and this is expected to continue. The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPIX (the overall consumer price index for metropolitan and other urban areas, excluding the interest cost of mortgage bonds), which had dropped from 11,3 per cent in October 2002 to 6,4 per cent in June 2003, picked up marginally to 6,6 per cent in July before falling again to 6,3 per cent in August. Although this brought the rate of increase in the CPIX to its lowest level in twenty-one months, it was still above the upper boundary of the inflation target. The deceleration in CPIX inflation was mainly due to a slower rate of increase in food prices and transportation costs. If energy and food prices are excluded from the CPIX, the twelve-month rate of increase in the prices of other goods and services declined from 7,7 per cent in October 2002 to 6,8 per cent in June 2003. Subsequently, this rate of increase rose to 7,0 per cent in July and then declined to 6,9 per cent in August. More disconcerting, however, is the fact that the year-on-year rate of increase in the prices of services included in the CPIX has continued to accelerate from 7,4 per cent in October 2002 to 8,0 per cent in June 2003 and 8,4 per cent in August. This acceleration in service prices excluding mortgage costs was mainly due to increases in rental costs and in the prices of medical, communication and education services. Moreover, the rate of change over one month in the CPIX accelerated markedly in July and August 2003 to levels last recorded in the closing months of 2002. The recent more rapid rise in CPIX inflation was to a large extent the result of increases in the running costs of motor vehicles, which can fluctuate considerably from month to month. The prices of a number of other goods, however, also rose at somewhat higher rates. However, the average month-on-month annualised percentage changes in CPIX for the latest three months amounted to 4,83 per cent. Recent developments in production prices have been far more promising. The twelve-month rate of increase in the all-goods production price index, which had dropped from 14,6 per cent in October 2002 to 2,3 per cent in June 2003, fell further to 0,2 per cent in August. The driving force behind this slowdown in production prices was the recovery in the international exchange value of the rand from about the second half of 2002. As a result of this recovery in the exchange rate of the rand, the prices of imported goods generally declined in absolute terms from March 2003. The year-on-year rate of increase in the prices of goods produced domestically also decelerated markedly from 14,2 per cent in October 2002 to 4,4 per cent in June 2003 and 2,6 per cent in August. Most of the prices of the various categories of domestically produced goods showed similar slower rates of increase, with the notable exception of the prices of tobacco and metal products which continued to rise at increasing rates. Food prices fell by 11,4 per cent in the year to August 2003, as the prices of grain, fruit, meat and some other agricultural products declined. At the manufactured level, food prices decreased at a year-on-year rate of 0,5 per cent in August 2003, whereas the corresponding rate of increase in September 2002 amounted to 30,1 per cent. The decline in the production prices of food and the slower rate of increase in the all-goods production price index bode well for a slowdown in consumer price inflation in the coming months provided that discipline is applied, particularly in the determination of administered prices. Changes in production prices generally affect consumer prices with a lag before the benefits of lower production price inflation are passed on to consumers. A number of other developments also suggest that consumer price inflation could subside further. Among these, the most important is probably that inflation expectations, which are of great importance in the price determination process in South Africa, have improved considerably during 2003. This is clearly illustrated by the decrease in the break-even inflation rate, measured as the difference between the nominal yield on conventional bonds and the real yield on inflation-linked bonds. Expected inflation derived in this way has decreased from 8,0 per cent in February 2002 to 5,0 per cent in September 2003. The inflation expectations survey of the Bureau for Economic Research (University of Stellenbosch) substantiate these findings. According to this survey. CPIX inflation is expected to fall in the next three years. In addition, there are at present no signs of any supply constraints in the economy which could have an impact on prices. The increase of 1Â½ per cent in gross domestic product in the first half of 2003 was well below the potential growth rate of the economy, while manufacturing output declined in the first eight months of 2003. The increasing gap between actual output growth and potential growth is clearly illustrated by the capacity utilisation index of manufacturing which came down to 79 per cent in the second quarter of 2003. The fiscal discipline applied by government also favours a further decline in the inflation rate. Although a more expansionary fiscal policy stance has been adopted, the fiscus still projects a deficit before borrowing and debt repayment for the fiscal year 2003/04 that should have little effect on prices. The results of national government finance for the first five months of the fiscal year confirm government's commitment to prudence. A further development signalling lower future inflation is the slowdown in the growth of the monetary aggregates. The increase over twelve months in the broadly defined money supply (M3) came down from 9,1 per cent in June 2003 to 5,1 per cent in August 2003. The narrower monetary aggregates on the whole showed a similar pattern, but the loans and advances of the banks to households and business enterprises increased at a year-on-year rate of 12 per cent in August. This was probably a reflection of the sustained domestic final demand for goods and services. Large increases in mortgage advances reflecting the expansion in the real estate market made a major contribution to the rise in bank credit extension to the private sector. Finally, the recovery in the nominal effective exchange rate of the rand from the exceptionally low level at the end of 2001 should be of assistance in containing inflation. The trade-weighted value of the rand increased by 24 per cent in 2002 and by nearly 16 per cent in the first nine months of 2003. At its current level the nominal effective exchange rate of the rand is close to levels attained in the middle of 2001. Although this has somewhat affected the profitability of exports and the price competitiveness of domestically produced goods, the recovery in the external value of the rand has contributed materially to the lowering of the inflation rate. The impact of the rand recovery on the current account of the balance of payments has so far been moderate and has been easily financed. The projections of our econometric models confirm this favourable domestic inflation outlook. These projections, based on the current policy stance, indicate that it is likely that CPIX inflation will move below the upper boundary of 6 per cent of the inflation target during the fourth quarter of 2003 and remain well within the target range in 2004 and 2005. A major risk to this projected inflation outcome is the recent wage settlement rates of around 10 per cent. These settlements have been made after the year-on-year rate of increase in nominal remuneration per worker in the formal non-agricultural sectors of the economy averaged 10,6 per cent in the first quarter of 2003. At the same time productivity growth has continued to slow down. In the first quarter of 2003 the year-on-year rate of increase in labour productivity amounted to 1,7 per cent, with the result that the corresponding rate of increase in nominal unit labour cost came to 8,7 per cent. Such a rate of increase in nominal unit labour cost can be absorbed over the short term without an acceleration in inflation. Over the long term it will inevitably lead to an acceleration in price increases. However, since wage negotiations have been backward looking, the recent improvement in the inflation rate could bring about a moderation in wage demands in the coming months. In view of this generally favourable inflation outlook and taking into consideration the positive impact of the current monetary policy stance on inflation in South Africa going forward, the Monetary Policy Committee has decided to reduce the repo rate by a further 150 basis points to a level of 8,5 per cent effective from 17 October 2003. The Monetary Policy Committee will continue to monitor all the risk factors to the inflation outlook. If the outlook deteriorates, the Committee will not hesitate to change the monetary policy stance. Dates of Monetary Policy Committee Meetings for 2004. The Governor's Committee has scheduled six MPC meetings for 2004, which will take place on the following dates:."
Philippines,2003-10-22,"In today's meeting, the Monetary Board, the policy-making body of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), decided to keep the BSP's key policy rates steady at 6.75 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.0 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. Based on the review and assessment of the prevailing macroeconomic and financial conditions bearing on future inflation and economic activity, the Monetary Board believes that the near-term outlook for inflation remains subdued. Average inflation is expected to fall significantly below the 4.5-5.5 percent target for 2003 as cost-push pressures and market uncertainties have diminished significantly while demand-side influences on prices remained limited. Over the policy horizon, average inflation is expected to be broadly in line with the Government's announced target of 4.0-5.0 percent in 2004. The prospects for a generally favorable inflation environment beyond the near-term are based on the steady-though-still modest improvements in aggregate demand, particularly credit demand, soft labor market conditions, broad stability in the foreign exchange market, as well as moderate influence of cost-push factors. The Monetary Board held the view that the monetary policy stance should remain well balanced given the ample liquidity in the market and limited possible upward pressures on the inflation outlook. Such policy stance would cushion the negative impact on inflation expectations should there be a resurgence in price pressures arising from adverse cost-side developments and adjustments in the foreign exchange market. At the same time, the Monetary Board highlighted the need to provide adequate liquidity in the system to help ensure a steady pace of economic expansion. The Monetary Board is scheduled to meet again to review the BSP's monetary policy stance on 20 November 2003."
Poland,2003-10-26,"Warsaw, 26 October 2003 INFORMATION FROM A MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL, held on 25-26 November 2003 On 25-26 November 2003, the Monetary Policy Council held a meeting. The Council read materials prepared by the NBP and also information and analyses furnished by the Ministry of Finance, banks and research institutes. The Council then discussed the external environment of the Polish economy as well as real trends, trends in payments and social welfare benefits, matters involving the public financial sector, the money supply, loans and interest rates and the structures of pricing and inflationary expectations, as well as the expected rate of inflation Decision of the Monetary Policy Council In October 2003, the annual CPI reached 1.3% when compared to 0.9% reported for September 2003. Similarly, a growth was reported by the base inflation rate indicators; however, they remain low within the range from 0.6 to 1.2%. Other economic data, which emerged since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Council indicates: I Continuous presence of future inflation-limiting factors: (cid:1)(cid:2) Continuing strict corporate salary discipline. Between January and October 2003, the average monthly salary in the corporate sector grew by 2.3% in nominal terms comparing to 3.7% on a year-to-year basis. After ten months 2003, a real growth in salaries was equal to 1.6% and was identical to the growth reported for the same period of 2002, (cid:1)(cid:2) The supply of the monetary aggregate M3 remains moderate; in October 2003, the annual growth of the aggregate reached 4.7% against 3.1% reported for September 2003, (cid:1)(cid:2) A continuous low annual growth rate of corporate credit (at 3.2% in October against 1.6% in September 2003). September witnessed a slight increase in the annual growth in dues from households up to 12.0% from 10.3% in September 2003. II. Confirms: upward economic trends grow stronger, increasing inflationary pressures gradually. However, the Council does not see as a threat to the attainment of the inflationary goal in 2004. (cid:1)(cid:2)October 2003 witnessed a 12.1% growth in the PPI on a year on year basis, including a 13.8% growth in the processing industry. A growth trend in the production grew stronger after October 2003. The annual growth of the trend in the processing industry exceeded 11% and 10% for the industry in total, (cid:1)(cid:2)A considerable improvement in the financial results of enterprises was reported for nine months 2003 with net financial result at PLN 15.1 bn i.e. almost a fivefold growth year on year. Growth in the sales revenue generated on products, goods and materials exceeded a growth in the cost of the revenue, (cid:1)(cid:2)Within three quarters 2003, capital expenditures of enterprises grew by 1.2% (against a drop of approx. 2% observed in the first half of 2003). In general, the growth in total expenditures stemmed mainly from investment activity of companies operating in the processing industry, (cid:1)(cid:2)Continuing positive opinions on the market climate in the industrial processing sector, (cid:1)(cid:2)Continuing high (over a twofold) growth in production reported in October 2003 by the companies preparing construction sites and companies performing finishing construction works (at 74, 5%), (cid:1)(cid:2) Continued high growth in the exports, after nine months 2003 at 5.8% in the exports denominated in the euro and a 26.9% in the USD-denominated exports year-on-year (in accordance with the payment statistics), (cid:1)(cid:2)A 10.3% growth in retail sales reported in October 2003 (and 9.7% in September 2003). III. The Council upholds his opinion expressed in the previous information, that another possible factor creating inflationary pressure is: (cid:1)(cid:2)uncertainty with respect to the current and future condition of the public finance. Increasing budget disequilibrium, rapid growth of the public debt, deteriorating mid-term public finance perspective may have unfavourable effect on financial market by causing further growth of the yield of treasury securities and depreciation of the zloty exchange rate. There has been a noticeable increase in the yield of t treasury bonds since the last meeting of the Council. Fast and effective reforms healing the public finance would erase the uncertainty by eliminating disruptions on financial markets, particularly since other macroeconomic rations of the Polish economy do not justify a permanent depreciation of the zloty exchange rate. IV. Other possible factors creating inflationary pressure include: (cid:1)(cid:2)depreciation of the zloty exchange rate connected with a difficult condition of the public finance, (cid:1)(cid:2)a high and increasing growth rate of cash in circulation. In October 2003, the annual growth rate of the aggregate reached 17.0% (and 16.0% in September). (cid:1)(cid:2)A possible increase in the oil prices. Despite a reduction in the annual average oil price in 2004 from 26.6 USD/b to 25.9 USD/b, a continuing high political risk in the Middle East causes oil prices to fluctuate and move them upwards to a high level. 2 After a discussion, the Monetary Policy Council resolved to leave the monetary policy parameters unchanged and maintain its neutral approach to monetary policy. The next meeting of the Council is scheduled for 2 December 2003 and it will be devoted to the NBP accounting principles and the NBP financial plan for 2004. Assessment of the economic situation External factors October 2003 witnessed continuation of improvement in the current activity Improvements ratios of the USA economy reflected in a noticeable growth of optimism both in the market among consumers and investors. conditions in the Economic revival in the domestic demand of the USA was confirmed by the USA results of the GDP growth in the 3rd quarter 2003. High growth in investment, a considerable reduction of inventory, accelerated retail sales growth and improvement of the employment market conditions in October, a large influx of orders address to the processing industry combined with favourable conditions of corporate financing allow us to expect a further acceleration of the economic growth rate in the USA economy. Demand in the economies of the euro system remain low as confirmed by the GDP results in the 3rd quarter 2003  the annual growth rate reached 0.3% against 0.2% in the 2nd quarter 2003. In October 2003, the average price of a Brent oil barrel rose to USD 29.6 i.e. it showed a growth of USD 2.5 against September 2003. In November 2003, oil prices remained high, exceeding 28 USD/b. After subsequent terrorist attacks, the High oil prices atmosphere on the oil market is nervous and each coming attack may not only send on global the oil prices flying to over 30 USD/b for a certain period of time but also leave markets them at this level. In November 2003, the Department of State for Energy adjusted downwards the forecasted annual average oil price in 2004 from 26.6 USD/b to 25.9 USD/b Economic situation in Poland In September 2003, a surplus on the balance of current payments was reported A surplus on the for the first time since August 1998 (EUR 61 m.) translating into an improvement balance of in the balance of current payments by EUR 590 m. against September 2002, current whereas a deficit on the balance of current payments fell by EUR 2.65 bn. to reach payments in EUR 2.72 bn. since the beginning of 2003. The improvement in the balance of September current payments stemmed primarily from a reduction in a negative balance of commodity payments and an increase in the surplus of unclassified current payments. The improvement in the balance of commodity payments observed in September 2003 came in consequence of a very high growth of export receipts at 13.4% against September 2002. Since the beginning of 2003, the value of export receipts grew by 5.8% (and by not more than 1.2% on a year-to-year basis). In addition. September 2003 witnessed a rise in the value of disbursements by 0.3% year-on-year. A growth in the value of disbursements for the imports reported for the second time in the 3rd quarter 2003 may indicate a growth tendency arising on the import side. Preliminary figures published by the Main Statistical Office indicate that the Good financial financial condition of corporates within the three quarters 2003 was considerably condition of the more favourable than their condition in the same period of 2002, as it is reflected by corporate sector the improvement in the key effectiveness ratios and an increase in the percentage of net profit reporting companies. Financial results grew several times over the period; between January and September 2003, an over two-fold growth in the financial result was reported on a 4 year-on-year basis and an almost fivefold growth in the net financial result. Moreover, an improvement in the corporate sector effectiveness ratio on a year- on-year basis was witnessed with the total operating costs reduced by 1.7% due to a more rapid growth in the total operating revenue (a growth of 11.6%) than the operating costs (a growth of 9.7%). An increase of the 1st degree liquidity exceeded the level regarded as safe in terms of cash liquidity. All industry sections reported an improvement in the cost level ratios and net and gross profitability of current operations except for the mining and quarrying section. A particular improvement in the economic and financial standing was experienced by exporters, with key effectiveness ratios more favourable in these corporate groups than in the group of total corporates. The IPP growth October 2003 was a subsequent month of the PPI remaining below expectation of 12.1% and a as the total PPI grew by 12.1% against October 2003. Again, over a 40% annual stronger growth increase was reported in the sales of mechanical vehicles, trailer and semi-trailer trend of the production sector. Similarly, a very high growth in the production of machines and index equipment, furniture, metal, rubber and plastic goods, electrical machines and devices was maintained. As a result, the industrial processing production in October 2003 exceeded its figure reported in October 2002 by 13.8% and was twice as high as the monthly average in 1995. After October 2003, a growing trend in the production industry strengthened. The annual growth of the trend in the processing industry exceeded 11% and 10% in the total industry. In October 2003, the construction and installation production remained 4.8% below its level generated in October 2002 and the drop was larger than in September 2003 (3.8%). October 2003 witnessed continuation of the growing trend in production in the companies preparing construction sites (over a twofold growth) and companies performing construction and finishing works (by 74.5%). II. Situation of public sector finance Unfavourable condition in the public finance sector continues. After 10 months 2003, the aggregate state budget revenue amounted to PLN 123.4 bn, which translated into a 5.0% growth in nominal terms year-on-year. After October 2003, the execution of the budget act plan reached 79.3% i.e. below the level reported in the preceding years. After 10 months 2003, budget expenditures amounted to PLN 158.2 bn i.e. grew by 4.4% when compared to the budget expenditures in the same period of 2002. After October 2003, the budget plan realization is comparable with the realization reported in the preceding years and is equal to 81.4%. After October 2003, the budget deficit reached approx. PLN 34.83 bn, translating into utilization of approx. 89.9% of the annual limit i.e. above the utilization reported in the preceding years. No significant improvement in the financial condition of the remaining units of the public finance sector was observed. A shortage of funds in the Social Security Fund forecasted in 2003 will be financed with a banking loan and a lower than planned transfer of contributions to the Open Investment Funds. The last months of 2003 will see an increase in the debt of the Labour Fund to the banking Deficit of the system. The condition of the National Health Fund remains very difficult, as funds public finance 5 collected from the health insurance contributions are insufficient to finance medial sector in 2003 at services rendered by health care units, translating into a continued increase in the 5.4% of the amounts due and payable by the health sector. GDP Present condition of the public finance sector units indicates the economic deficit of the whole public sector in 2003 will reach approx. 5.4% of the GDP i.e. 0.3% above the deficit reported in 2002. A moderate III. Money supply, loans, interest rates, exchange rate growth of money supply in Figures presented in the accelerated information indicate PLN 5.4 bn (1.6%) October growth in the M3 money supply in October 2003 against the end of September 2003. After exchange rate differences, the M3 aggregate rose by PLN 4.9 bn (1.5%). The annual M3 growth rate reached 4.7%. The October growth in the M3 aggregate was mainly stimulated by an increase in corporate deposits by PLN 3.0 bn (5%) i.e. PLN 2.9 bn when adjusted by the FX rate differences. In this category, the annual growth rate was equal to 22.8%. In October, a monthly growth in household deposits reached PLN 0.2 bn (0.1%); however, it resulted from the exchange rate fluctuations. When adjusted by the FX rate, the total household deposits fell by PLN 0.2 bn. The annual growth rate in this category reached -5.2%. Furthermore. October 2003 witnessed an approx. PLN 0.6 bn drop in the value of investment fund assets held by households. Moderate Compared to the cash in circulation status as at the end of September 2003, a growth of growth of PLN 0.5 bn (1.1%) was reported for cash in circulation outside banks, household while the annual growth rate of the aggregate reached 17%. loans; low A nominal growth in total dues was equal to PLN 3.2 bn (1.2%) and PLN 2.5 bn growth of (1.0%) after FX rate differences in October 2003. Household loans increased by corporate loans PLN 1.4 bn (1.4%) i.e. by PLN 1.1. bn (1.2%) after FX rate differences. The annual growth rate in this category reached 12%. Housing loans accounted for over 75% of growth in the household loans. October 2003 saw a PLN 0.9 bn (0.6%) increase in corporate loans i.e. PLN 0.5 bn. (0.3%) after FX rate differences. The annual growth rate in this category was equal to 3.2%. The zloty In October 2003, the monthly average zloty exchange rate weakened against the stronger in euro by 2.7% in nominal terms and improved against the dollar by 1.5% in nominal November terms. However, within the first three weeks of November 2003, the zloty exchange rate gained ground both against the euro and the dollar by 0.7% and 2.7%, respectively. A stronger appreciation of the zloty against the dollar came as a result of the euro gaining ground against the dollar on the global market (from 1.16 EUR/USD as at the end of October 2003 to approx. 1.19 EUR/USD on 21 November 2003. In consequence of uncertainty regarding condition of the public finance, an increase in long-term interest rates was observed. Since the latest meeting of the Council, the yield of 2- and 10-year treasury bonds rose by 64 b.p., while an increase in the yield on 5-year bonds was even higher to reach 103 b.p. IV. Prices, inflationary expectations In October 2003, the twelve-month CPI reached 1.3% against 0.9% reported in September 2003. A growth in the twelve-month inflation rate stems from a rise in The annual CPI the prices of rent and media (by 3.2%), prices in transport and particularly fuel at 1.3% 6 prices (3.0%) and the prices of foodstuffs and non-alcoholic beverages (1.2%). At the same time, the prices of clothes and footwear remained below their October The annual PPI level. at 2.% In October 2003, the ânetâ inflation rate was equal to 1.2% year-on-year, while a monthly net inflation indicator reached 0.3%. In October 2003, the annual PPI reached 2.7% (compared to 2.1% in September 2003 and 1.8% in August 2003). A particularly high growth in prices was reported by the mining and quarrying section and specifically in the group of metal ore Less optimistic quarrying (iron and copper) with 18.1% of price increase against October 2002. The inflationary increase came as an effect of a significant and lasting rise in the global prices of expectations, copper. Since April 2003, the copper prices on international markets grew by over however their 20%. An accelerated growth of prices (by 2.4% year-on-year) was also witnessed in level remains the processing industry. low In consequence of deterioration in the response structure to the questionnaire underlying the analysis of the inflationary expectations of private individuals and an increase in the current inflation rate reported for November 2003, the price growth rate expected by the private individuals in the coming year was equal to 0.9% i.e. exceeded the level reported for the preceding month by 0.2%. In November 2003, the inflation rate forecast by banking analysts for October 2003 reached 2.3% i.e. was identical to the inflation rate forecast of the two preceding months. However, the inflation rate forecast for the end of 2003 rose by 0.2% to reach 1.5%. The annual average growth of prices forecast for 2003 amounted to 2.2% i.e. remained 0.2% below its October level."
Israel,2003-10-27,"The Bankof Israel's Monetary Program for November 2003. The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for November 2003, according to which the interest rate will bereduced by 0.5 percentage points to 5.6 percent. This brings the cumulative reduction in the Bank of Israel's interest rate since December 2002 to 3.5 percentage points. The continuation of the process of reducing the interest rate is called for due to the level of one-year inflation expectations which are within the price-stability target of 1-3 percent, against thebackground of the actual reduction in the Consumer Price Index in the last twelve months, the continued modest level of real economic activity, and the relative calm in the foreign currency, money and capital markets. The cut in the interest rate thus supports the government's policy to encourage economic growth and boost employment, while maintaining price and financial stability. One-year inflation expectations derived from the capital market declined slightly in October to a little below the middle of the target range (i.e., just below 2 percent), and expectations for thesecond year ahead and beyond are still in the upper part of the target range. Private forecasters' predictions of 12-month inflation went down slightly, but are also in the middle of the target range, and the models developed by theBank of Israel indicate that it is possible to attain the inflation target for the coming year and the following year while continuing to reduce the interest rate. The interest policy is directed towards achieving price stability on an ongoing basis, and not necessarily for any particular calendar year. Any attempt to achieve the target of price stability by the end of 2003, following the fall in prices at the beginning of the year,would require rapid acceleration of inflation in the short term, with steep cuts in the interest rate, which would probably endanger price stability, financial stability and the fragile process of economic recovery. Accordingly, the Bank of Israel's policy at all times is aimed at attaining price stability over a period of one and two years forward. In the last few months the yields on government bonds started declining again, so that nominal yields have dropped by about 4 percentage points since the beginning of the year to a level of about 7.8 percent, and real yields by some 1.5 percentage points in that period to a level of about 4.4 percent. The reduction in long-term interest on government bonds apparently indicates that the public considers that the (relatively large) budget deficit derives mainly from the temporary effect of the low level of economic activity in reducing government tax revenues, and that it is to a lesser degree a structural deficit constituting a long-term problem. The reduction of the short-term interest rate per se cannot bring about the renewal of growth. A precondition is the maintenance of fiscal discipline, and indeed, the government's budget for 2004 submitted to the Knesset indicates the start of convergence to a downward trend for the deficit and government debt, following their three-year upward trend. This, together with the reform in the labor market and the reduction in the number of foreign workers, the implementation of the plans for infrastructure investment and other steps with long-term implications related to curbing public expenditure may be expected to help buttress stability and steerthe economy back to a path of growth. It is important that in the course ofapproving the budget there should be no whittling away at the budget framework orweakening of the determination to revert to a downward deficit path that reflectsfiscal discipline; such would be likely to undermine stability and lead to a rise in nominal and real long-term yields, obstructing the process of economic recovery. Calm continues to prevail in the foreign currency market, reflected in the implied standard deviation of the options issued by the Bank of Israel, which averaged about 6.5 percent in October compared with close to 9 percent in June. Moreover. Israel's risk premium as measured by the 5-year credit-default-swap (CDS) market went down in October to 70 basis points, continuing the downward path that started in the first quarter of 2003. The calm in the market may be due to the US government loan guarantees and the credibility of macroeconomic policy in the eyes of the public, despite the recent rise in the level of security-related uncertainty. The Bank of Israel monitors developments in the markets, in order to ensure that the inflation rate defined as price stability is maintained while bolstering financial stability. Subject to these conditions, the Bank will continue acting to support the policy to foster employment and shorten the recession. Table 1: Interest rates in Israel and the US.

Thailand,2003-10-28,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 28 October 2003 Mr. Bandid Nijathaworn. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand announced that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance going forward. The main issues discussed were as follows: 1. The MPC reviewed the latest data on economic conditions in Thailand and deemed that economic growth in the first 8 months of 2003 had been strong, supported by growth in export and domestic consumption, and improvements in consumer and business confidence. Nonetheless in August, there was some moderation in growth rates in certain sectors such as private consumption, investment, and export, from very high levels in the first half of the year. External stability remained strong with the current account continuing in surplus, international reserves at a high level, and further declines in foreign debt. Improved confidence in Thailand's internal and external stability contributed to further appreciation of the baht. With respect to speculative short-term capital flows that may affect the baht, the MPC observed that the measures already implemented have helped to curtail the risks of fluctuations in the baht that may impact on the real economy. Internal stability remained satisfactory. Headline inflation in the first 9 months of the year averaged 18 per cent, driven by higher energy and food prices. Core inflation remained flat year-on-year in September for the second consecutive month, reflecting lower rents. Excluding the latter, core inflation was 05 per cent. The MPC expected core inflation in the next 8 quarters to remain in the lower range of the target band. While there is a risk that core inflation may fall below the target band in the near term, this is not construed as deflation since headline inflation remains positive and economic growth continues to be robust. 4. While the MPC expected economic growth in Thailand to remain strong, uncertainty regarding economic recovery in the main industrialized countries continued to pose risks to the Thai economy going forward. The MPC deemed that the policy interest rate was at an appropriate level for current economic conditions, and that an accommodative stance of monetary policy should be maintained. The MPC decided to maintain the 14-day repurchase rate at 125 per cent per annum."
United States,2003-10-28,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 1 percent. The Committee continues to believe that an accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing important ongoing support to economic activity. The evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period confirms that spending is firming, and the labor market appears to be stabilizing. Business pricing power and increases in core consumer prices remain muted. The Committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal. In contrast, the probability, though minor, of an unwelcome fall in inflation exceeds that of a rise in inflation from its already low level. The Committee judges that, on balance, the risk of inflation becoming undesirably low remains the predominant concern for the foreseeable future. In these circumstances, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan. Chairman; Ben S Bernanke; Susan S Bies; J Alfred Broaddus. Jr.; Roger W Ferguson. Jr.; Edward M Gramlich; Jack Guynn; Donald L Kohn; Michael H Moskow; Mark W Olson; Robert T Parry; and Jamie B Stewart. Jr."
Poland,2003-10-29,"Warsaw, 29 October 2003 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 28  29 October 2003 A meeting of the Monetary Policy Council was held on 28  29 October 2003. The Council was provided with the materials prepared by the NBP as well as information and analyses furnished by the Ministry of Finance, banks and research institutes. The Council discussed recent developments in the external environment of the Polish economy and trends in economic performance with regard to payments and social welfare benefits, in the public finance sector, with regard to money supply, credits and interest rates, inflation expectations and price levels as well as inflation prospects. Decision taken by the Monetary Policy Council In September 2003, the annual CPI reached 0.9% when compared to 0.7% reported for August and 0.8% reported for July and June 2003. Similarly, the base inflation rate indicators stabilised at a low level. Other economic data, which emerged since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Council indicates: I Continuous presence of future inflation-limiting factors: (cid:1)(cid:2) a low growth rate in industrial production prices; at 1.9% in September 2004 as against 1.8% reported in August and 1.9% reported in July 2003; (cid:1)(cid:2) continuing strict corporate salary discipline. Between January and September 2003, the average monthly salary in the corporate sector grew by 2.2% in nominal terms compared to 4.1% on a year-to-year basis. After nine months 2003, a real growth in salaries was equal to 1.6% against 1.9% reported for the same period of 2002, (cid:1)(cid:2) in addition, the annual growth rate of monetary aggregate M3 remains low; September saw the aggregate growing up to 3.1% on an annual basis (compared to 1.7% in August 2003); however, the growth was stimulated chiefly by the zloty losing ground against the euro, (cid:1)(cid:2) a continuous moderate annual growth rate of corporate credit (at 1.6% in September against 1.9% in August and 1.8% in July 2003). September witnessed the annual growth in receivables from households up to 10.2% from 8.5% in August and 7.9% in July 2003; however, the growth can be partly attributed to fall in the value of the zloty, (cid:1)(cid:2) the inflationary expectations remain at a low level. II. Confirms: strengthening signs of the economic revival; nevertheless, the Council does not see they exert an excessive inflationary pressure: (cid:1)(cid:2)September 2003 witnessed an 11.1% growth in PPI on a year-to-year basis, including 12.6% of growth in the processing industry PPI. Net of seasonal factors, the PPI grew by 8.3% and the processing industry PPI grew by 9.6% and was consistent with the trend observed over the recent months, (cid:1)(cid:2)continuation of a high, over a two-fold growth in production reported in companies preparing construction sites and performing finishing construction works (at 74.6%), (cid:1)(cid:2)continuing positive opinions on the market climate in the industrial processing sector. (cid:1)(cid:2)a 4.9% growth in the exports denominated in the euro and a 26.5% growth in the exports denominated in the dollars after eight months 2003 on a year-to- year basis (as reported in the payment statistics), (cid:1)(cid:2)a 9.7% growth in retail sales reported in September 2003 against 5.5% on a year-to-year basis. III. Another possible factor creating inflationary pressure can be: uncertainty with respect to the current and future condition of public finances reflected by an increased return on treasury securities and the zloty depreciation against the euro. Difficulties experienced by the government to maintain the liquidity of the budget, increasing public debt in relation to GDP and uncertain prospects of a swift and effective reformation of public finance contributed chiefly to deprecation of the zloty against the euro (compared to PLN/EUR exchange rated as of the last day of August, on 28 October the zloty lost 6.9% to the euro, while it grew by 0.5% against the dollar). However, other macroeconomic ratios of the Polish economy (a higher rate of the economic growth, low inflation, low deficit of the balance of payments, safe relation of the short-term foreign debt to the foreign reserves and a swift increase in the exports) do not justify a permanently weaker zloty. It means that fast and effective reforms to improve Poland's public finance of would remove uncertainty, eliminating distortions on financial markets. IV. Other possible factors creating inflationary pressure include: (cid:1)(cid:2)A continuous high growth rate of cash in circulation. In September 2003, the annual growth rate of the aggregate reached 16.0% (15.7% in August 2003 and 13.9% in July 2003), (cid:1)(cid:2)Continuing high oil prices. A forecast annual average price of oil in 2004 rose from 26.0 USD/b to 26.6 USD/b. The Monetary Policy Council resolved to leave the monetary policy parameters unchanged and maintain its neutral approach to monetary policy. The next meeting of the Council is scheduled for 25-26 November 2003. Overview of the economic situation In September 2003, positive market trends in the corporate sector Improvement in continued. The euro zone saw a growth in the ratios, reflecting business the investment confidence. In the USA, the ratios steadied at a high level and the optimism of the business circles was confirmed in PPI exceeding the climate in the market expectations (of 0.4% in September against a drop of 0.1% in USA and the euro system August). A gradual increase of consumer optimism could be seen in the euro zone. Due to a marginal improvement in employment trends in the USA, ratios reflecting household confidence remained unstable. High oil prices on global markets In September 2003, the average price of Brent oil was 27.1 USD/b and was higher by 2.8 USD/b compared to the price reported in August 2003. In October 2003, the OPEC decision to reduce oil production limits sent oil prices up to reach 31.8 USD/b on 10 October 2003. In October, the Lower deficit of oil prices forecasts were subject to a verification: forecast for 2003 was the balance of brought down to 29.2 USD/b (due to prices in 3Q 2003 remaining below the expected level), while an upward adjustment from 26.0 USD/b to 26.6 payments in USD/b was made for 2004. August Following a temporary deterioration reported in July 2003. August 2003 witnessed an improvement in the balance of current payments. Compared to August 2002, the negative balance of current payments fell by EUR 100 m. and by nearly EUR 2 bn since the beginning of 2003. Increase in the value of export revenue (by 5.4% against August 2002) exceeded the average reported since January 2003 (4.9%), thus confirming favourable export trends observed in preceding months. At the same time, a considerable growth in import payments reported in July 2003 did not recur in August 2003, when the value of the import payments decreased by 1.1% against the August 2002 figure and by 0.2% when calculated since January 2003. The favourable trends observed in the foreign trade are confirmed by the Main Statistical Office (GUS) figures, which indicate a reduction of the negative balance of trade payments by EUR 1.2 bn between January  August 2003 against the corresponding period in 2002. Preliminary data indicate a 4.3% growth in the value of exports denominated in euros in eight months of 2003 (and by 3.4% during seven months of 2003) combined with a slighter drop in the value of the imports (by 0.1% against 1.0%). The exports growth to the EU quickened; however, so far, the highest pace of growth was reported in exports to the Central and Eastern European countries. PPI growth of In September 2003, the total PPI grew by 11.1% including a 12.6% 11.1% growth in the processing industry year-on-year. The higher PPI growth rate is partially attributed to a higher number of working days as compared to September 2002 (by one day). After seasonal trends, the total PPI growth rate reached 8.3% and the processing industry PPI reached 9.6% and remained in line with the trend observed in recent months. Output growth measured in fixed prices in September 2003 was the highest of the monthly output figures in Poland reported so far both in the production 3 sector and the processing section, exceeding the level of the average monthly output of 1995 by 74.3% (total production sector) and by 93.7% Highest growths (processing industry). in the export- Data published on the processing industry structure by sectors do not producing sectors indicate any changes in existing trends, including a continued highest rate of the economy of growth in sales reported by the industries with a high and growing share of exports. Again, the highest growth (by 35.1%) was reported for the motor vehicle, trailers and semi-trailers sector. Continued high growth is reported by the enterprises preparing construction sites (over a two-fold growth) and enterprises performing finishing construction works (growth by 74.6%), although September saw further deterioration of the total construction and installation output (by 3.8%). The research into the economic situation published by the Main Positive Statistical Office on 22 October 2003 indicates a sustainment of the assessment of positive outlook for the business climate in the processing industry. market trends in Opinions are better than those opinions voiced in the same months of the processing and previous five years and their level was slightly below the level observed in construction September 2003. However, the market trend ratio for the construction industry industry deteriorated against its September figure, while maintaining its negative level. Still, a marginal improvement in the ratio could be observed viewed against October 2002 and October 2001. Assessment of market trends in the retail trade was slightly improved as compared to the assessment for September and October 2001 and 2002. A steady improvement in the market trend in this section has been noticed since March 2003, i.e. the proportion of negative opinions is declining. A 9.7% growth in retail sales was reported for September 2003 year- on-year (against 5.5% in August and 5.4% in July 2003), stemming from growing sales volumes as well from organisational changes in trading companies resulting in an increasing number of trade units covered by the monthly research, and a change in shopping locations for household purchases. II. Situation of public sector finance After 9 months 2003, the total state budget revenue was higher by PLN 4.9 bn in nominal terms when measured on a year-to-year basis (i.e. The nominal growth in the budget revenue in 2003 was equally affected by tax and non-tax revenues. After September 2003, 68.6% of the planned tax revenue specified in the budget act was generated i.e. below the level reported in 2002. After September 2003, budget expenditures amounted to PLN 142.4 bn, i.e. 6.6% more compared to the budget expenditures for the same period of 2002 to reach 73.2% of the figure specified in the budget act. As at the end of September, the budget deficit reached approx. PLN 33.1 bn, i.e. approx. 85.4% of the annual limit and markedly above the utilisation observed in preceding years. The budget revenue figure reported after 9 months 2003 indicates a possibility of non-achievement of the budget figures planned in the budget act (in 2003 shortage of revenues 4 may reach approx. PLN 5 bn). However, retention of the budget deficit within its statutory limits is not threatened conditional on appropriate adjustments being performed on the expenditure side. No significant improvement in the financial condition of the remaining units of the public finance sector was observed. Despite high transfers from the state budget and moderate revenues, the Social Security Office has not fully transferred contributions due to the Open Pensions Funds and maintains a considerable debt to the banking system. Since May 2003, the financial condition of the Pension and Invalidity Fund (FER) deteriorated, which operates within the framework of the Agriculture Social Security Fund (KRUS). There is a threat that revenues and Deficit of the expenditures planned for 2003 will not balance. Similarly, the National public finance Health Fund has difficulties in connection with lower-than-expected sector in 2003 at receipts from health insurance premiums. It will probably result in a the level of 5.4% further growth in the amounts due and payable by the health sector. GDP The present condition of the public finance sector units indicates an economic deficit of the whole public finance sector reaching approx. 5.4% of GDP in 2003, i.e. it grew by 0.3% when compared to the level reported for 2002. III. Money supply, loans, interest rates, exchange rate Figures presented in the accelerated information indicate PLN 1.9 bn (0.6%) growth in the M3 money supply in September 2003 against the end A moderate of August 2003. The annual M3 growth rate reached 3.1%, which is the growth in money highest figure reported since May 2002; however, the M3 growth was supply in primarily prompted by the zloty losing ground against the euro. After the September FX differences, the monthly M3 growth rate amounted to PLN 1.0 bn (0.3%). The September growth in the M3 aggregate was mainly stimulated by an increase in corporate deposits by PLN 3.2 bn (5.5%) i.e. PLN 2.8 bn (4.9%) when adjusted by FX rate fluctuations. The annual growth rate in corporate deposits reached 20.9% in September 2003, which is the highest figure reported since July 2000. Such a high growth in receivables to the corporate sector is not normal in September. September 2003 saw a further decrease in household savings deposits by PLN 0.6 bn (i.e.-0.3%). When adjusted by FX rate differences, the total household deposits fell by PLN 1.2 bn (-0.6%). A negative annual growth rate in the receivables to households, prevailing since July 2002, was -6.3% in September 2003. The fall was only slightly associated with households deploying their funds to alternative forms of savings. September witnessed a PLN 0.4 bn growth in the value of investment fund assets held by households and connected with the acquisition of new participation units, i.e. the lowest growth observed for a period longer than one year. A slight drop in cash in circulation (of -0.1%) was observed in September 2003 compared to the cash in circulation status as at the end of August; however, the annual growth rate of cash in circulation remains high, reaching 16% as at the end of September. 5 On the money-creation side, there was a growth of PLN 3.6 bn Moderate growth (1.4%) in total receivables in nominal terms, which was entirely due to the in household zloty FX rate fluctuations. A growth in receivables from households loans; low growth reached PLN 2.6 bn (2.7%) equal to PLN 1.1 bn (1.2%) when adjusted by in corporate loans FX rate differences, resulting in the annual growth rate in this category equal to PLN 10.2%. The growth in receivables from households can be chiefly attributed to the growth in loans financing real estate purchase. Corporate receivables increased by PLN 0.9 bn (0.7%) in nominal terms; however, they deteriorated by PLN 0.9 bn (-0.6%) after the elimination of FX differences. The annual growth rate of loan exposure in corporate sector fell from 1.9% in August 2003 to 1.6% in September 2003. In September 2003, the average exchange rate of the zloty in nominal terms lost ground against the euro and the dollar by 2.3% and 1.6%, respectively. Within three weeks of October 2003, the average zloty exchange rate against the euro again weakened by 2.4% fixed at PLN 4.57 compared to Weaker and the average EUR/PLN exchange rate of 4.47 of September 2003. A highly fluctuating different trend in the exchange rate of the dollar was observed, which zloty averaged at PLN 3.90 against PLN/USD exchange rate fixed at 3.98 in September 2003, signifying the zloty gaining ground by 2.0%. The zloty exchange rate was markedly affected by the EUR/USD cross-exchange rate averaging at 1.17 for the three weeks of October against 1.13 EUR/USD exchange rate average reported in September 2003. On 28 October 2003, the zloty weakened against the euro by 6.9% and gained ground against the dollar by 0.5% as compared to the exchange rates quoted on the last day of August 2003. The annual CPI at IV. Prices, inflationary expectations the level of 0.9% In September 2003, the twelve-month CPI reached 0.9% against 0.7% reported in August 2003. A growth in the twelve-month inflation rate is attributable to a rise in fuel prices (of 5.1%), prices of rent and media (by 2.8%) as well as prices of foodstuffs and non-alcoholic beverages (0.5%). At the same time, a drop in the prices of clothes and footwear and prices of alcohol and tobacco was observed. In September 2003, the ânetâ inflation rate was equal to 0.9% year-on-year, while a monthly net inflation The annual PPI at indicator reached 0.1%. the level of 1.9% The level of the annual PPI increased by 1.9% on a year-to-year basis (against 1.8% growth reported for August and a 1.9% growth reported for July). A growth in the sold production price index remained at its August level of 0.4%. Low inflationary In October 2003, the inflation rate forecast by banking analysts for expectations September 2004 reached 2.3% and was identical to the inflation rate forecast for September 2003. The annual average price growth forecast for 2004 totaled 2.0% i.e. by 0.2% below its level reported for September 2003. The inflation rate expected at the end of 2003 fell by 0.1% to 1.3%. In October 2003, a price-growth rate expected by private individuals over the coming year remained at its September level of 0.7%."
Euroarea,2003-11-06,"Today marks the first time that I had the honour and the pleasure of chairing the meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. I am delighted to now proceed with our well-established practice of real-time communication and to report on the outcome of our meeting, together with the Vice-President. Following our regular economic and monetary analysis, we have decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged at their low levels. Overall, we anticipate some further stickiness of inflation rates in the shorter term, while the medium-term outlook for price stability remains favourable. Against this background, we continue to judge the current stance of monetary policy as appropriate. At the same time, we see additional signs of a gradual economic recovery in the euro area. We will carefully monitor all developments that might affect our assessment of risks to price stability. Starting with the economic analysis, new data and other information show that the recovery of the world economy is clearly making progress. Also for the euro area, the indicators are increasingly pointing towards some improvement in economic activity in the second half of this year. For the time being, this is primarily reflected in business surveys and leading indicators, but we expect that forthcoming data on euro area production and demand will confirm that a gradual recovery has started. Taken together, we see further confirmation of our main scenario of a gradual improvement in economic activity this year, and a broadening and strengthening in the course of 2004. This assessment has received support from recently published forecasts of official and private sources, as well as from developments in financial markets. Externally, the expansion of global economic trade and real GDP growth should counteract the changes in the effective exchange rate of the euro, which is back to its level of early 1999. Domestically, the conditions for investment should improve further, given the continued adjustment efforts of firms to enhance productivity and profitability, the low level of interest rates and generally favourable financing conditions. Moreover, private consumption should benefit from real disposable income growth, fostered by positive terms-of-trade effects stemming from the past appreciation of the euro. The short-term risks to our main scenario appear to be balanced. Over a longer horizon, we remain concerned about the sustainability of global economic growth being undermined by persisting imbalances. This relates, in particular, to the sustainability of public finances and to external imbalances in some regions of the world. Recent inflation rates, measured by the HICP, developed broadly as anticipated. The annual rate of inflation was 2.1% in October, according to Eurostat's flash estimate. When looking ahead over the shorter term, it appears that inflation rates may continue to hover around this level for several months to come and, hence, may not fall as quickly and strongly as had been expected up to the summer. Three factors can be identified as contributing to this stickiness of inflation rates. First, in the remainder of 2003 and early 2004, unprocessed food prices could imply some limited upward pressure as a consequence of this summer's heat wave. Second, oil prices remain higher than expected, owing to political uncertainties in the Middle East. Last but not least, in the course of 2004, planned increases in indirect taxes and administered prices in some euro area countries will have an upward impact on inflation. However, when taking into account more lasting factors, we continue to expect inflation rates to moderate over the medium term and to develop in line with price stability. This expectation is based on the assumption that wage developments will not be affected by the current inertia of inflation rates, and will remain moderate in the context of a gradual economic recovery. Moreover, the past appreciation of the euro should continue to dampen price pressures. These views are also reflected in recently released forecasts. At the same time, inflation expectations warrant close monitoring. Turning to the monetary analysis, after an extended period of strong M3 growth, liquidity in the euro area remains ample, despite a certain slowdown in monetary expansion over recent months. This situation of persistently more liquidity than is needed to finance non-inflationary economic growth reflects past portfolio shifts, precautionary savings and the low level of interest rates. The low level of interest rates also supported the annual growth of loans to the private sector, which fluctuated between 4Â½% and 5% in recent months. At the current juncture, the accumulation of excess liquidity is not of concern for price stability, given the economic outlook. However, if it were to continue in conjunction with a significant strengthening of economic activity, it could lead to inflationary pressures in the medium term. Cross-checking the information from the two pillars, our economic analysis indicates that the medium-term outlook for price stability remains favourable, in the context of a gradual economic recovery and moderate import price and wage developments. In view of the economic situation, the strong monetary expansion should not, for the time being, be seen as adversely affecting this outlook. Fiscal developments and the Stability and Growth Pact are now at a critical point at which the credibility of the institutional underpinnings of EMU must be maintained. The Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact provide an appropriate framework for ensuring fiscal discipline, within adequate bounds of flexibility. The deficit reference value of 3% of GDP, which is laid down in the Maastricht Treaty itself, is the nominal anchor for the rules and procedures governing fiscal policies in the EU. This anchor must not be placed in doubt. Fully abiding by the rules and implementing them in every respect has very solid economic justifications, and is not a mere procedural matter. Upholding trust in the soundness of public finances enhances confidence of all economic agents and thereby contributes to sustainable growth in consumption and investment. Stability and growth are thus not conflicting objectives, but rather reinforce each other  a fact which is very well captured in the title of the fiscal framework called the ""Stability and Growth Pact"". Concerning recent developments in the context of the excessive deficit procedure, it is the view of the Governing Council that the proposals of the Commission push the room for interpretation of the rules and procedures to the limit. As regards future decisions, which are expected in the course of November, the Governing Council strongly urges each institution and government concerned to live up to their responsibilities. It is the overall credibility of the fiscal framework and, hence, the prospects for economic growth in the euro area that are at stake. Fiscal consolidation plans are best placed within a comprehensive and credible medium-term strategy. This requires strong emphasis on structural expenditure reforms and the adaptation of public pension and health systems to the challenges arising from the ageing of the population. Moreover, structural reforms in the labour and product markets are needed to allow a better allocation and utilisation of capital and human resources, and to enhance the euro area's growth potential. The Governing Council strongly supports current efforts by a number of governments in this direction and also encourages social partners to fully commit themselves to the objective of making the euro area a more dynamic and innovative economy."
South Korea,2003-11-06,"Despite the continuing sluggishness of domestic demand, industrial activities are showing signs of moderate improvement, as exports and construction investment have continued to be strong, with the economic recovery in advanced countries including the U S., becoming more evident. In October, consumer prices rose slightly, mainly due to the increase in agricultural product prices led by the damages done by the typhoon of last month. Underlying inflation rate, however, has declined slightly. The current account surplus is estimated to be similar in scale to the previous month's, owing to the continued large surplus on the goods account. In the financial markets, overall liquidity conditions were relatively favorable, although the turnaround of some credit card companies has been delayed and risk aversion toward corporations with low credit-ratings has continued. Taking the above financial and economic conditions into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark overnight call rate (uncollateralized basis) at its current level (3., 75 percent) for the inter-meeting period. The Committee will take a close look at the effect on the real estate market of the comprehensive package of measures to stabilize housing market announced by the government."
Chile,2003-11-13,"The Central Bank of Chile PRESS RELEASE* November 13, 2003 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided, by unanimous vote, to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 2.75% (annual). Since the last policy meeting, the increase in the terms of trade has strengthened, and perspectives of increased world growth have continued, while positive international financial conditions prevail. These factors, combined with better domestic expectations, support the increased output growth forecast for the coming quarters. Regarding inflation, the latest information reveal subdued price pressures. CPI inflation is below 2%, while core inflation is at the bottom of the defined target range. Inflation rates have declined more than expected, because of a temporary incidence of supply-side factors, particularly the exchange rate and retail margins. Therefore, the inflation forecast for next year is now around one percentage point below the figures presented in the last Monetary Policy Report. All considered, the projected inflation rate converges to 3% toward the end of the policy horizon In light of all the available information, the Board considers that the expansionary monetary conditions can be extended for a longer time period than previously foreseen. Notwithstanding, the Board reiterates that it will continue to conduct monetary policy with the necessary flexibility to address any projected inflation deviations in either direction from the specified target inflation range, centered at 3%."
Malaysia,2003-11-19,"Recent economic and financial indicators provided firmer evidence that the global economic recovery is gaining momentum. On the domestic front, stronger aggregate demand has been reinforced by recovery in external demand, allowing GDP to expand at a stronger pace in the third quarter. Going forward, the broad-based economic expansion would be positive on the labour market. Sustained high commodity prices would also provide further support to domestic demand. Investment is expected to increase as capacity utilisation is higher in selected sectors. Market confidence has improved with renewed interests by domestic and foreign investors in the equity market. The more favourable developments have provided stronger grounds for better growth prospects. Economic conditions, however, point towards inflation remaining subdued. Higher demand can be met without a build-up in inflationary pressures given the existence of excess capacity, the ability to increase supply, the competition on prices, and the stable labour market conditions. Under these circumstances, the current accommodative monetary policy will be maintained to support and sustain the growth momentum. On the exchange rate front, underlying fundamentals continue to support the ringgit, which remains at a fair value. The exchange rate peg continues to facilitate international trade and investments and support expansion in overall economic activities. Bank Negara Malaysia 19 November 2003."
Philippines,2003-11-19,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board, the policy-making body of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), decided to keep the BSP's key policy interest rates unchanged at 6.75 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.0 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. During its review of the prevailing macroeconomic and financial conditions that bear directly on future inflation and economic activity, the Monetary Board was of the view that the prevailing balance of risks for consumer prices has not changed significantly over the past six months. The inflation environment remains very benign because of moderate demand and generally favorable supply conditions. In addition, there appear to be no major foreseeable cost-push risks to consumer prices in the near term. Going forward, therefore, economic conditions continue to suggest an on-target path for inflation for the next several quarters, and average inflation is expected to be broadly in line with the Government's announced target of 4.0-5.0 percent in 2004. At the same time, the Monetary Board believes that aggregate demand, while improving, is still likely to follow a subdued path over the policy horizon, based on indicators of manufacturing activity, employment, and export performance. Moreover, money and credit demand continued to be modest as bank lending, despite steady growth, has not risen as strongly as expected. Expectations of a subdued path for both inflation and domestic demand over the next several quarters support the argument for preserving the ongoing monetary stimulus without undue risk of demand-pull inflation. The monetary policy stance of the BSP will thus continue to recognize the liquidity needs of economic growth against a backdrop of essentially benign inflation, and policymakers will continue to ensure that the macroeconomic environment remains conducive to credit demand and investment activity. Nevertheless, market concerns over emerging domestic political developmentsâwhich could have an adverse impact on market sentiment and inflation expectationsâ suggest the need for caution in formulating the monetary policy stance. Prospective decisions on the monetary policy stance will, therefore, maintain a careful balance between caution and the need to support a sustainable path for economic activity. The Monetary Board is scheduled to meet again to review the BSP's monetary policy stance on 18 December 2003."
Romania,2003-11-20,"In line with its proactive action strategy, which was announced already in August, aiming to reach an inflation target of 14 percent in 2003 and of 9 percent in 2004, the National Bank of Romania has decided to increase the policy rate by one percentage point from 20.25 percent to 21.25 percent, starting 20 November 2003. Spokesman for the NBR."
Israel,2003-11-24,"24.11.03 The Bank of Israel's Monetary Program for December 2003 The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for December 2003, according to which the interest rate will be reduced by 0.4 percentage points to 5.2 percent. This brings the cumulative reduction in the Bank of Israel's interest rate since December 2002 to 3.9 percentage points. The continuation of the process of reducing the interest rate is made possible by the fact that one-year inflation expectations are within the price-stability target of 1-3 percent, against the background of the actual reduction in the Consumer Price Index in the last twelve months, the continued modest level of real economic activity, and the relative calm in the foreign currency, money and capital markets. The cut in the interest rate thus supports the government's policy to encourage economic growth and boost employment, while maintaining price and financial stability. One-year inflation expectations derivedfrom the capital market declined in November, and are currently in the lower part of the target range (i.e., just above 1 percent), and expectations for the second year ahead are stillin the upper part of the target range. Private forecasters' predictions of 12-month inflation are still in the middle of the target range, and some ofthe models developed by the Bank of Israel indicate that it is possible to attain the inflation target for the coming year and the following year while slowly proceeding to reduce the interest rate. The interest policy is directed towardsachieving price stability on an ongoing basis, and not necessarily for any particular calendar year. Any attempt to achieve the target of price stability by the end of 2003, following the fall in prices at the beginning of the year, would require rapid acceleration of inflation in the short term, with steep cuts in interest rates, which would probably endanger financial stability, the process of economic recovery, and in the final analysis price stability itself. Accordingly, the Bank of Israel's policy at all times is aimed at attaining price stability over a period of one and two years forward. In the last few months the yields on government bonds started declining again after edging up in the months from June to August. Since the beginning of the year nominal yields have dropped by more than 4 percentage points to a level of about 7.4 percent, and real yields by more than 1.5 percentage points to a level of about 4.2 percent. The reduction in long-term interest on government bonds apparently indicates that the public considers that the (relatively large) budget deficit derives mainly from the temporary effect of the low level of economic activity in reducing government tax revenues, and that it is to a lesser degree a structural deficit constituting a long-term problem. The reduction of the short-term interest rate per se cannot bring about the renewal of growth. A precondition is the maintenance of fiscal discipline, and indeed, the government's budget for 2004 submitted to the Knesset indicates the start of convergence to a downward trend for the deficit and government debt, following their three-year upward trend. This, together with the reform in the labor market and the reduction in the number of foreign workers, the implementation of the plans for infrastructure investment and other steps with long-term implications related to curbing public expenditure may be expected to help buttress stability and steer the economy back to a path of growth. It is important that in the course of approving the budget there should be no whittling away at its framework or weakening of the determination to revertto a downward deficit path; such would be likely to undermine stability and lead to a rise in nominal and real long-term yields, obstructing the process of economic recovery. Despite the intermittent weakening of the NIS in the foreign currency market in the last few months, there was a fall in the implied standard deviation of the options issued by the Bank of Israel to an average of about 6.5 percent in November from close to 9 percent in June. Moreover. Israel's risk premium as measured by the 5-year credit-default-swap (CDS) market went down in November to 60 basis points, continuing the downward path that started in the first quarter of 2003. The calm in the market may be due to the US government loan guarantees and the credibility of macroeconomic policy in the eyes of the public, the security-related uncertainty notwithstanding. Nonresidents' short-term capital inflow to Israel is affected among other things by changes in interest rates in other advanced and emerging economies and not only in the US and Europe. This can be seen from Table 3:the Bank of Israel's interest rate is currently similar to the upper level of interest rates of central banks in other advanced economies (Australia and New Zealand: 5 percent), and is in the middle of the range of interest rates of central banks in emerging and other developing economies. The Bank of Israel monitors developments in the markets in order to ensure that the inflation rate defined as price stability is maintained while bolstering financial stability. Subject to these conditions, the Bank will continue acting to support the policy to foster employment and shorten the recession.

Euroarea,2003-12-04,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB. Following a comprehensive economic and monetary analysis, we concluded that the monetary policy stance remains appropriate to preserve price stability over the medium term. Accordingly, we left the key ECB interest rates unchanged at their low levels. While annual inflation rates are likely to fluctuate around 2% over the coming months, a gradual and limited decline should take place later on. We also noted that the economic recovery in the euro area has started and that confidence has strengthened further. We will continue to carefully monitor all developments that might affect our medium-term assessment of risks to price stability. We also discussed the potential implications of the deeply regrettable developments at the ECOFIN Council meeting on 25 November. As we already stressed in our statement on the same day, these developments risk undermining the credibility of the institutional framework and the confidence in sound public finances of Member States across the euro area. Let me add that a credible fiscal framework is key not only to stability but also to growth, and is a precondition for low risk premia in financial markets to be preserved. In the context of our economic analysis, the latest data releases confirmed that economic activity in the euro area has picked up. Real GDP growth in the third quarter reflects the strong momentum of the world economy, which we assume will continue next year. Private consumption should be supported by positive terms-of-trade effects due to the past appreciation of the euro. With the usual lag, it should also profit from an increase in employment growth. Business investment is expected to recover gradually, mainly helped by an expansion of external demand, the low level of interest rates and generally favourable financing conditions. Moreover, it should increasingly benefit from the adjustment efforts of the corporate sector to enhance productivity and profitability. Taken together, we look forward to a gradual recovery in euro area economic growth over the next quarters, leading to a broader and stronger upswing in the course of next year and the year after. Over a longer horizon, we remain concerned about the sustainability of global economic growth being undermined by external imbalances in some parts of the world economy. Concerning prices, the latest information is in line with earlier expectations. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 2.2% in November, following a rate of 2.0% in October. Similar rates have prevailed for most of this year and this inertia of inflation rates at around 2% is likely to continue in the coming months. Due to adverse food price developments, the evolution of oil prices and planned increases in indirect taxes and administered prices, inflation rates will fall neither as quickly nor as strongly as was expected earlier in the year. However, when assessing price trends over the medium term, a number of factors should dampen inflationary pressures. First, given the past appreciation of the euro, import prices should contribute to this effect. In particular, wage growth should be contained in the context of a recovery which, for the time being, is expected to remain gradual. Provided that wage moderation can be preserved, which is indispensable for fostering employment, a cyclical recovery in productivity tends to dampen growth in unit labour costs, which has thus far been relatively high when judged against the weakness of the economy. Overall, these views are also reflected in recently released forecasts and seem to be in line with survey data and financial market expectations. Accordingly, there is a rather broad consensus on the main scenario. At the same time, this outlook for price stability is conditional on quite a number of assumptions, such as those on global developments, oil prices, exchange rates, wage developments and fiscal measures. Therefore, elements of risk to the outlook for price stability need to be kept in mind. In this respect, we noted that financial market indicators for inflation expectations have shown some upward momentum over recent months. While technical factors might also have played a role in the movement of these indicators, and other indicators have remained broadly unchanged, inflation expectations warrant close monitoring. Turning to the monetary analysis. M3 growth has been very strong over the past two years, reflecting portfolio shifts, precautionary savings and the low level of interest rates. The low level of interest rates has also supported the growth of credit demand. In our assessment, the accumulation of excess liquidity is not of concern for price stability at the current juncture, given that, for the time being, the economic recovery is only gradual. However, should high excess liquidity continue to prevail once there is a significant strengthening of economic activity, it could lead to inflationary pressures in the medium term. We will therefore continue to carefully examine monetary developments. In summary, the economic analysis indicates that the main scenario for price developments in the medium term continues to be in line with our definition of price stability. This picture is confirmed by cross-checking with the monetary analysis. Turning to fiscal policies. I have already mentioned that we expressed deep regret following the ECOFIN Council meeting on 25 November. Furthermore, we stressed our support of the Commission's views on the ECOFIN Council's Conclusions. We also took note of the commitments made by France and Germany to correct their excessive deficits as rapidly as possible and at the latest by 2005. Moreover, we noted that the ECOFIN Council stands ready to take a decision under Article 104, on the basis of the Commission recommendation, should the two governments fail to act in accordance with their own commitments. We strongly urge the governments concerned to live up to their responsibilities. Confidence in the soundness of public finances is essential for sustainable growth in consumption and investment. The overall fiscal framework of the Stability and Growth Pact remains of central importance and should be fully respected. The same applies to the requirement to avoid excessive deficits, laid down in Article 104 of the Treaty, and to the reference values of 3% and 60% for the deficit and debt-to-GDP ratios respectively, specified in the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty. Trust and confidence are also crucial in the context of structural reform. Enhancing the competitiveness of the euro area, in particular in labour and product markets, increasing the efficiency of the tax systems and ensuring the sustainability of social security schemes all foster a better allocation and utilisation of capital and human resources. There is no doubt that measures in these respects improve the growth perspectives of the euro area. However, in order to foster confidence in the shorter term, convincing assurance must be given that these challenges are indeed being tackled in a decisive manner and that clear action is being taken. While some progress has been made, the Governing Council strongly encourages governments to accelerate the implementation of structural reforms and also calls upon social partners to fully commit themselves to the objective of making the euro area a more dynamic and innovative economy."
United States,2003-12-09,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 1 percent. The Committee continues to believe that an accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing important ongoing support to economic activity. The evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period confirms that output is expanding briskly, and the labor market appears to be improving modestly. Increases in core consumer prices are muted and expected to remain low. The Committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal. The probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation has diminished in recent months and now appears almost equal to that of a rise in inflation. However, with inflation quite low and resource use slack, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan. Chairman; Timothy F Geithner. Vice Chairman; Ben S Bernanke; Susan S Bies; J. Alfred Broaddus. Jr.; Roger W Ferguson. Jr.; Edward M Gramlich; Jack Guynn; Donald L Kohn; Michael H Moskow; Mark W Olson; and Robert T. Parry."
Chile,2003-12-11,"THE CENTRAL BANK OF CHILE Press Release* December 11, 2003 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided, by unanimous vote, to reduce the monetary policy interest rate from 2.75% to 2.25% (annual). Since the last monetary policy meeting, price pressures have been lower than expected. Annual inflation of both the CPI and the core inflation index CPIXâthat excludes some more volatile pricesâ are below 2%. The former may even be negative in some months of the first half of next year. Although the recent evolution of inflation rates is explained by supply-side factors, its present low level, its persistence and its impact on longer-term inflation expectations combine to generate a significant risk of having unwanted low inflation for too long. The reduction in the monetary policy interest rate is consistent with limiting this risk, and keeping inflation forecasts around 3% over the usual 24-month policy horizon. Regarding output, the latest information confirms higher terms of trade, particularly the price of copper, and a better outlook for world growth next year, while positive international financial conditions have strengthened. These factors, combined with better domestic expectations and expansionary monetary policy, consolidate the increased output growth forecast for the coming quarters. The Central Bank of Chile reassures its objective of attaining an inflation rate centered around 3%, in the usual policy horizon, and reiterates that it will continue to conduct monetary policy with the necessary flexibility to address any projected inflation deviations in either direction from the specified inflation rate target."
South Korea,2003-12-11,"Despite the continuing sluggishness of private consumption and machinery and equipment investment, industrial production has continued to rise, owing to strong exports and construction investment. Overall, the real economy shows signs of gradual improvement. Consumer price inflation remained stable in November, due to the fall in prices of some agricultural and industrial products. Housing prices have also declined following the government's comprehensive package of measures to stabilize the housing market. The current account surplus is estimated to have widened compared to the previous month's, owing to the continued large surplus on the goods account. In the financial markets, overall liquidity conditions have been relatively favorable due to the low demand for funds. However, the problems of a few credit card companies are a potential destabilizing factor and risk aversion from low-rated corporations has not lessened to any considerable extent. Taking the above economic and financial conditions into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (3., 75 percent) for the intermeeting period."
South Africa,2003-12-11,"In the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement released on 12 November 2003 it was announced that the Bank's inflation target, previously specified as an annual average, will henceforth take the form of a continuous inflation target of between 3 and 6 per cent for CPIX inflation measured over a period of twelve months. It is the well-considered view of the Government and the South African Reserve Bank that this change should lead to a more effective management of monetary policy and inflation expectations. Since September. CPIX inflation has been within the target range and the Bank's task will continue to be to keep it within the lower and upper boundaries of the band. Twelve-month CPIX inflation declined from a peak of 11,3 per cent in October 2002 to 5,4 per cent in September 2003. It then declined further to 4,4 per cent in October 2003. The inflation rate was brought to the mid-point of the target range by the sustained maintenance of prudent monetary and fiscal policies together with the recovery in the international exchange value of the rand and a moderation in food price increases. The quarter-to-quarter rate of change in CPIX inflation also declined sharply from a seasonally adjusted and annualised rate of 12,1 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2002 to 2,2 per cent in the second quarter of 2003, before rising to 5,1 per cent in the third quarter. More particularly, a slower rate of increase in the prices of consumer goods was mainly responsible for the improvement in overall inflation. Measured over periods of twelve months, the rate of increase in the prices of consumer goods came down from a recent high of 13,0 per cent in October 2002 to 2,1 per cent in October 2003. The most significant deceleration was displayed by changes in food prices. The twelve-month rate of increase in food prices declined from 20,9 per cent in October 2002 to 2,4 per cent in October 2003. As the prices of services respond with a delay to exchange rate changes and a number of service providers do not face much competition in the domestic market, the rate of increase in the prices of services excluding mortgage costs has on balance risen during 2003. Measured over a period of twelve months, service inflation rose from a low of 6,2 per cent in March 2002 to 8,6 per cent in September 2003, before declining marginally to 8,3 per cent in October. Household costs and the prices charged for communication, education and health services were mainly responsible for the rise in service price inflation. The stickiness of administered prices was therefore to a large extent responsible for the persistence of higher service price inflation. The inflation outlook over the coming months as well as over the long term can be described as promising. The favourable short-term outlook is confirmed by recent developments in production price inflation, which generally affects consumer price inflation with a short lag. As the result of declines in the prices of imported goods and a considerable slowdown in the rates of increase in the prices of domestically produced goods, the year-on-year rate of increase in the all-goods production price index slowed down from 15,4 per cent in September 2002 to 0,2 per cent in August 2003. In September and October the twelve-month rate of change in production prices even became negative. These declines should contribute to a continuing moderation in consumer price inflation over the short term. Over the longer term most conditions also seem favourable for the containment of CPIX inflation. The international economic environment has improved considerably in recent months. Indicators generally seem to signal stronger economic performance in the United States and a number of Asian countries, especially China. A stronger world economy should benefit international commodity prices, in particular, and South African exports in general. The acceleration in global growth is expected to have only a small impact on prices and world inflation will probably remain at low levels. The expected acceleration in global economic growth will probably be accompanied by rising international interest rates. Both the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Bank of England have already increased their official interest rates. Oil prices are not expected to be a major threat to domestic inflation in the coming months. The world oil demand and supply generally seem to be in balance, with relatively large oil inventories in OECD countries. Moreover conditions favour a more rapid increase in production than in demand. Most analysts therefore expect oil prices to decline somewhat in the next two years. Domestically, most conditions also seem to endorse the maintenance of price stability. The growth in real gross domestic product at 2 per cent in the first nine months of 2003 compared to the same period in the preceding year, is clearly well below the growth potential of the country. This is confirmed by the ample spare capacity in the manufacturing sector where the utilisation of production capacity amounted to 80,6 per cent in the third quarter of 2003. In view of the success achieved with the lowering of the inflation rate, inflation expectations in South Africa have declined during the past year. The results of the Survey of Inflation Expectations undertaken for the South African Reserve Bank by the Bureau for Economic Research (University of Stellenbosch) show that inflation expectations have come down further in the fourth quarter of 2003. However, at 6,4 per cent in 2004 and 6,7 per cent in 2005, the public on average still expect the inflation rate to remain above the upper boundary of the inflation target in the next two years. In addition, monetary conditions signal a continued positive environment for low inflation. Measured over twelve months, growth in the broadly defined money supply (M3) registered a ten-year low rate of 5,1 per cent in August 2003 before picking up somewhat to 5,5 per cent in September and 6,2 per cent in October. However, bank credit extension continued to increase at rates of about 12 per cent over a twelve-month period. Bank credit extension to households has increased strongly related to a corresponding relatively high growth in personal disposable income, lower interest rates and a prolonged period of high house price increases. In addition, companies made use of alternative sources of finance such as corporate bonds and commercial paper. Fiscal policy is expected to remain disciplined. Although the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement 2003 sets out a strategy to endorse growth and development through investment in infrastructure, education and skills development, poverty reduction and public service delivery, the increased expenditure will be financed in such a way as not to threaten price stability. The national government deficit is projected to average about 3 per cent of gross domestic product over the next three fiscal years and will be financed mainly from domestic sources without crowding out the needs of the private sector. Despite these favourable international and domestic conditions, projections made with the Reserve Bank's forecasting models indicate that inflation pressures could start to build up in 2005. These forecasts show that the rate of inflation in CPIX could reach a lower turning point during the course of 2004 and edge up to higher levels in 2005. CPIX inflation should, however, remain below the upper boundary of 6 per cent of the inflation target. The main reason for this projected increase in inflation pressures is the strong domestic final demand for goods and services. In the first nine months of 2003, compared with the same period in the preceding year, the growth in domestic final demand amounted to no less than 4 per cent. Growth in personal disposable income and an increase in bank credit extension caused real private consumption expenditure to rise by about 3 per cent over this period, while real government consumption expenditure increased by 4 per cent and fixed capital formation by 9 per cent. The reduction of the repo rate by 500 basis points between June and October 2003 is expected to contribute to further increases in domestic final demand in 2004. Although some of this increased demand will be met by imported goods, domestic economic performance should eventually move closer to potential growth and start to put pressure on prices. The foreseen strong domestic demand could also impact on the current account of the balance of payments through increased imports. However, this should be countered to a large extent by the expected international economic recovery and an increased demand for South African exports and rising international commodity prices. The projected deficit on the current account of the balance of payments should therefore not lead to inflation pressures provided that it continues to be financed by financial inflows. Other risks to the forecasted inflation outcome over the next two years include:. Changes in the rate of increase of food prices. A slowdown in the rate of increase in food prices was a major contributing factor to the lower rate of CPIX inflation achieved during 2003. At present, climatic conditions are generally viewed as being unfavourable and thus expectations are that crop output could be poor. Even if this situation should improve, it is unlikely that developments in food prices will again make such a major contribution to the lowering of inflation in the next year. The recovery in the external value of the rand during both 2002 and 2003, had a major impact on the lowering of inflation during the course of the latter year. The appreciation in the exchange rate of the rand together with low international inflation contributed to a decline in the measured prices of imported goods over twelve months since April 2003. It is impossible to predict what the external value of the rand will do over the coming months. Wage settlements which exceed increases in labour productivity with a considerable margin can give rise to substantial increases in unit labour costs and price pressures. Wage settlements during the past year averaged around 9 per cent, while growth in labour productivity has continued to slow down to low levels. It is anticipated that wage settlement rates could decelerate significantly during 2004 as they will be negotiated against the background of lower rates of inflation. Wage increases could nevertheless still be well above productivity increases, leading to further increases in nominal unit labour costs. As already indicated, interest rates have been reduced significantly during the last half of 2003. These decreases in interest rates were undertaken after careful consideration of the inflation outlook at the time to ensure that CPIX inflation moves into and remains within the inflation target. With inflation expected to remain within the target range in the forecast period looking ahead, and taking the above-mentioned risks into account, the Monetary Policy Committee has decided to reduce the repo rate by 50 basis points to 8,0 per cent per annum as of 12 December 2003. The MPC will continue to monitor all the risk factors to the inflation outlook. If the outlook deteriorates, the Committee will not hesitate to change the monetary policy stance."
Thailand,2003-12-12,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 12 December 2003 Mr. Bandid Nijathaworn. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand announced that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance going forward. The main issues discussed were as follows: 1. The MPC reviewed the latest data on economic conditions in Thailand and deemed that economic growth in the first 10 months of 2003 had been strong, supported by robust domestic and external demand. With further increases in the private investment and consumption indices in October, on the back of heightened economic activity and improved confidence, the strength of domestic spending should provide a solid basis for future growth. External stability remained strong with the current account continuing in surplus, international reserves at a high level, and the level of foreign debt steady. Measures already implemented helped to ensure stability in movements of the baht. Internal stability remained satisfactory. Headline inflation in the first 11 months of the year averaged 18 per cent, on account of higher energy and food prices. Core inflation picked up slightly in November to 01 per cent year-on-year after remaining flat for three consecutive months previously, reflecting lower rents. The MPC expected economic growth to continue in the foreseeable future supported by strong domestic spending and reduced external risks. Inflation should remain low and not pose a threat to economic stability. Nonetheless the movements of major currencies and domestic asset price developments associated with continued economic growth are areas that need to be monitored closely. The MPC deemed that the current policy stance and prevailing rates of interest are appropriate for current economic conditions and the outlook going forward. The MPC decided to maintain the 14-day repurchase rate at 125 per cent per annum."
Philippines,2003-12-17,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board, the policy-making body of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), decided to keep the BSP's key policy interest rates unchanged at 6.75 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.0 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. During its review of the prevailing macroeconomic and financial conditions, the Monetary Board noted that the balance of risks for consumer prices has not changed significantly since the previous review of the monetary policy stance. Present cyclical conditions continue to support a moderate, on-target path for headline inflation over the policy horizon. In addition, expected cost-push risks to consumer prices do not appear to pose a major threat to the inflation objective. Average annual headline inflation for 2003 is expected to settle at around 3 percent in 2003, well below the Government's target of 4.5-5.5 percent for the year. Meanwhile, the observed slowdown in money and credit demand and the restrained pace of bank lending as well as the generally uneven character of the trends in other economic indicators tend to suggest downside risks for the overall strength of economic activity. Taken together, expectations of on-target inflation and subdued domestic demand conditions over the next several quarters support the argument for maintaining the policy stimulus without any undue risk of demand-pull inflation. Consequently, the Monetary Board is of the view that the decision to maintain the monetary policy stance would continue to ensure adequate liquidity to support growth in domestic demand while helping guard against potential price risks. Prospective decisions on the monetary policy stance will continue to preserve a careful balance between caution and the need to ensure that the macroeconomic environment remains conducive to credit demand and investment activity. The Monetary Board is scheduled to meet again to review the BSP's monetary policy stance on 15 January 2004."
Poland,2003-12-17,"INFORMATION FROM A MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL, held on 16-17 December 2003 On 16-17 December 2003 the Monetary Policy Council held a meeting. The Council read materials prepared by the NBP and also information and analyses furnished by the Ministry of Finance, banks and research institutes. The Council then discussed the external environment of the Polish economy as well as real trends, trends in payments and social welfare benefits, matters involving the public financial sector, the money supply, loans and interest rates and the structures of pricing and inflationary expectations, as well as the expected rate of inflation. Until the meeting of the Council the November figures relating to the industrial and construction sector output, retail sales, the PPI, the unemployment rate, base inflation and inflationary expectations were not disclosed. Decision of the Monetary Policy Council In November 2003, the annual CPI reached 1.6% as compared to 1.3% reported for October 2003. Other economic data, which has emerged since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Council indicates: I The continuation of factors encouraging low inflation: Continuing strict corporate salary discipline. Between January and November 2003, the average monthly salary in the corporate sector grew by 2.6% in nominal terms comparing to 3.5% on a year-to-year basis. After eleven months 2003, a real growth in salaries was equal to 1.9% compared to 1.5% year-on-year. The higher growth of salaries in November 2003 (4.1% in nominal terms and 2.5% in real terms) is related to the low growth of salaries reported for November 2002 (the base effect). Despite an increase in the annual growth rate of the money supply at 5.7% in November against 4.7% in October 2003, its level remains moderate. Despite its growth in November, the low annual growth rate of corporate credit continues. The annual growth rate of corporate loans in November 2003 reached 3.6% against 3.5% in October and loans to households grew up to 13.5% and 12.2%, respectively. Confirms: upward economic trends are growing stronger, increasing inflationary pressures gradually. However, the Council does not see this as a threat to the attainment of the inflationary goal in 2004. The preceding months saw a growing trend in the PPI, improvement in the financial results of enterprises, increasing capital expenditure by enterprises and growth in retail sales. The figures received after the Council's meeting held in November. A high growth in the exports continues: after ten months of 2003, the euro-denominated exports grew by 6.5% and dollar-denominated exports grew by 27.7%, year-on-year (in accordance with the payment statistics). In addition, more optimistic forecasts regarding foreign demand were reported: November 2003 witnessed an improvement in consumer and entrepreneurial moods in the USA and the euro system. III. Nevertheless, the significance of factors inhibiting the stabilisation of inflation at a low level remained unchanged. The Council maintains its opinion that one of these is the uncertainty with respect to the current and future condition of public finance. Increasing budget disequilibrium, the rapid growth of public debt and the deteriorating mid-term public finance perspective result in a growing yield from treasury securities and depreciation of the zloty exchange rate The uncertainty as to the zloty exchange rate may be additionally increased by diverging from the announced The Public Debt Management Strategy for 2004  2006: shortening of the average debt redemption term and financing of a part of the budget deficit from foreign sources as planned by the government. IV. Other possible factors creating inflationary pressure include: the high and increasing growth rate of cash in circulation. In November 2003, the annual growth rate of the aggregate reached 18.2% (and 17.0% in September). A possible increase in oil prices. In December, the forecast annual average oil price in 2004 was subject to a considerable rise from 25.9 USD/b. to 27.9 USD/b. A possible increase in the price of foodstuffs in 2004 indicated by current forecasts. After a discussion, the Monetary Policy Council resolved to leave the monetary policy parameters unchanged and maintain its neutral approach to monetary policy * * * (cid:1)(cid:2)In addition, the Council adopted the Resolution on accounting principles, the structure of assets and liabilities of the balance sheet, profit and loss account of the National Bank of Poland and the Resolution on the principles for creating and releasing a reserve for the risk of the zloty to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations at the National Bank of Poland. A summary of the resolutions will be published in the Official Journal of the NBP. (cid:1)(cid:2)The Council adopted The financial plan of the National Bank of Poland for 2004. In accordance with the predictions of the financial plan, the NBP should close 2003 with PLN 4.189.6 m. and 2004 with 4,869.6 m. (cid:1)(cid:2)Moreover, the Council adopted the Balance of Payments of the Republic of Poland for the first 3 quarters of 2003. The next meeting of the Council is scheduled for 20-21 January 2004. Assessment of the economic situation External factors November 2003 saw a consolidation of revival signals in the global economy. In the USA, the indices reflecting both current and expected market conditions Stronger revival reached historically high levels, with an increase both in the industrial activity signals in the index and the American consumer-confidence ration. A high growth rate in retail global economy. sales in the USA confirmed the optimism of households (remaining at 6% to 7% since August 2003). In the euro system, a gradual improvement in the optimism of enterprise has been noticeable since August 2003. Furthermore, a rise in consumer optimism was signalled, though it is weaker than the trend observed in the USA. In November 2003. Brent oil prices remained at a high level, periodically rising up to 30 USD/b. The average price of Brent oil per barrel was 28.8 USD/b. High oil prices High oil prices are sustained as a consequence of another decrease in crude oil on global reserves. In the end of November 2003, their level in the USA was lower by 9.3 bn markets b/d compared with the end of October 2003. In December 2003, the Department of State for Energy increased its forecast of the annual average oil price in 2004 from 25.9 USD/b. to 27.9 USD/b. Economic situation in Poland October surplus October 2003 was the second month in a row reporting a positive balance of on the balance the current account, with a surplus of the balance of current payments reaching of current EUR 200 m., translating into EUR 780 m. improvement in the balance of current account payments against October 2002. After ten months 2003, a negative balance of the current account amounted to EUR 2.5 bn., indicating a reduction of EUR 3.4 bn. against the period January  October 2003. The improvement in the balance of the current account stemmed primarily A high growth from a reduction in a negative balance of commodity payments caused by a high of receipts from growth in receipts from exports. The value of receipts from exports increased by export 12.1% year-on-year, i.e. the growth was twice as rapid as the growth reported for the whole period from January to October 2003 (6.5%). Compared to October 2002, the value of imports deteriorated by 0.9% and by 0.2% since beginning of the year. Between January and November 2003, the average monthly salary in the corporate sector showed a nominal growth of 2.6% against 3.5% year on year. Over 11 months of 2003, salaries grew by 1.9% in real terms compared to 1.5% year-on- year. The increase in the annual growth of salaries witnessed in November (4.1% in nominal and 2.5% in real terms) is related to the low growth of salaries in November 2002 (the base effect). II. Situation of public sector finance After 11 months 2003, the aggregate state budget revenue increased by PLN 6.8 bn (i.e. 5.2%) in nominal terms year-on-year; however, the implementation of the budget plan reached not more than 88.2%, i.e. below the level reported for 2002. Despite increased receipts from income tax reported for the past two months of 2003: increased receipts from personal income tax and indirect taxes, their planned annual volumes will not be realised. Similarly, receipts from corporate income tax 3 will remain lower than planned. After November 2003, the tax income plan was realised to 87.5% i.e. below its level reported for 2002. After November 2003, the state budget expenditures amounted to PLN 172.8 bn i.e. 3.2% above their level reported in November 2003 to reach 88.9% of the figure stipulated in the budget act. As of the end of November 2003, the state budget deficit reached approx. PLN 35.5 bn, translating into a realisation of 91.8% of the annual limit, i.e. below the level reported for 2002. It is estimated that the realised budget deficit will remain within its limits as stipulated in the budget act owing to the adjustment of expenditure that has already been introduced to a forecast lower revenue. No significant improvement in the condition of the remaining parts of the public finance sector was observed after 11 months 2003. Both the Labour Fund and the Social Security Fund show a deficit and continue to owe high-level debts to the banking sector. Furthermore, the Social Security Office will not transfer the full amount of the insurance premiums planned for 2003, which will cause an increase in the economic deficit of the public finance sector. The National Health Fund is also experiencing difficulties due to receipts from health insurance contributions Deficit of the being below the planned level, which is likely to translate into the continued growth public finance of payable dues by the health sector. sector in 2003 The current condition of the public finance sector units indicates that in 2003 will remain at the economic deficit of the overall public finance sector will reach approx. 5.4% of 5.4% GDP the GDP, i.e. 0.3% above the figure reported for 2002. III. Money supply, loans, interest rates, exchange rate Figures presented in the advance information indicate PLN 0.05 bn (0.0%) growth in the M3 money supply in November 2003 as compared with the end of October 2003. After elimination of exchange rate differences, the M3 aggregate rose by PLN 0.6 bn (0.2%). The annual M3 growth rate reached 5.7%; however, predominantly in consequence of the base effect. In November 2002, purchase of bank bonds, the outflow of funds from bank deposits to investment funds and exchange rate differences caused a deterioration in the M3 monetary aggregate. In November 2003, the situation was reversed due to the redemption of a part of the bank bonds issued last year and some funds were withdrawn from bond funds and transferred to bank accounts. The M3 growth reported for November 2003 stemmed predominately from a growth in the deposits of non-monetary financial institutions by PLN 1.5 bn (18.7%). The growth reflected a rise in the short-term deposits made by non- banking brokerage offices and investment funds from the funds collected from subscriptions for investment certificates, redemption of bank bonds issued one year ago and from other sources. In November 2003, the monthly growth in household deposits rose by PLN 0.3 bn (0.1%) and by PLN 0.7 bn (0.4%) after elimination of FX differences. The increase in the value of the zloty-denominated deposits was connected with redemption of participation units in bond funds and redemption of bank bonds. In November 2003, a drop in the net assets of all investment funds was reported at approx. PLN 1.0 bn, including PLN 0.5 bn in consequence of fund outflow. A negative annual growth rate of household deposits continued, reaching  3.3%. 4 The value of corporate deposits reported its first fall since March 2003 (of PLN 0.3 bn. i.e. by 0.5%); however, the annual fluctuation rate in this category remained high at 25.1%. Compared to the cash in circulation status as at the end of October 2003, a growth of PLN 0.6 bn (1.2%) was reported for cash in circulation outside banks, while the annual growth rate of the aggregate reached 18.2%. The growth in cash was connected with the maturity of 2-year bank term deposits opened in November A moderate 2001 in order to avoid a tax payable on interest income, redemption of bank bonds growth in issued in 2002 as well as withdrawal of funds from bond funds by private household individuals. loans; low On the money creation side. November 2003 saw an increase in total dues by growth in PLN 3.2 bn (1.2%) in nominal terms. Dues from corporates grew by PLN 1.4 bn corporate loans (1.0%). The annual growth rate in this category reached 3.6%. A growth in household dues amounted to PLN 1.2 bn (1.2%) and stemmed chiefly from an increase in loans for real-estate purchase. The annual growth rate of this category Consolidated reached 13.5%. and stablilised Following the period of high fluctuation, the zloty exchange rate has stabilised zloty exchange since the beginning of December. A surplus in the balance of current payments rate reported for September and October has a stabilising effect on the currency market (compared to the status reported on the last day of October 2003, the zloty exchange rated gained 0.3% against the euro and 5.9% against the dollar (a change High volatility in the exchange rate of 31 October 2003 against 12 December (Reuters  mid)). of T-bond prices The volatility of T-bond prices remains vary high. The subsequent drastic falls and increases in T-bond prices indicate continuing uncertainty with respect to the public finance condition, while continued demand from foreign investors resulted in their stabilisation. The annual CPI IV. Prices at 1.6% In November 2003, the twelve-month CPI reached 1.6% against 1.3% reported in October 2003. A growth in the twelve-month inflation rate stems from a rise in the prices of apartment rents (3.2%), stipulated mainly by an increase in the prices of media (3.3%), prices in transport (2.8%) and particularly fuel prices (4.0%) as well as the prices of foodstuffs and non-alcoholic beverages (2.1%). However, the prices of clothes and footwear remained below their November level."
Israel,2003-12-29,"The Bank of Israel's Monetary Program for January 2004. The Bank of Israel today announced its monetary program for January 2004, according to which the interest rate will be reduced by 0.4 percentage points to 4.8 percent. This brings the cumulative reduction in the Bank of Israel's interest rate since December 2002 to 4.3 percentage points. The continuation of the process of reducing the interest rate is made possible by the fact that one-year inflation expectations are slightly below the price-stability target of 1-3 percent, against the background of the actual reduction in the Consumer Price Index in the last twelve months, the continued moderate level of real economic activity, and the relative calm in the foreign currency, money, and capital markets. The cut in the interest rate serves to support the encouragement of economic growth and increase employment: short-terminterest declined from 7.2 percent in December 2002 to 4.5 percent in December 2003: while maintaining price and financial stability. One-year inflation expectations derived from the capital market declined in December, and are currently slightly below the lower boundary of the target range (i.e., just below 1 percent), and expectations for the second year ahead are still within the target range. Private forecasters' predictions of 12-month inflation are down slightly and are below the middle of the target range; some of the models developed by the Bank of Israel indicate that it is possible to attain the inflation target for the coming year and the following year while slowly continuing to reduce the interest rate. The changes in the composition of the public's asset portfolio derive inter alia from the process of interest-rate reduction by the Bank of Israel. Most prominent among them this year is the rise in the proportion of shares in it due to the increasein their price, and this accounted for about two-thirds of the increase in the portfolio between the beginning of the year and October 2003. The decline in short- and long-term interest rates led to a rise in the value of tradable assets, and their proportion expanded relative to bank deposits. Furthermore, despite the marked reduction in the interest-rate differential between Israel and the rest of the world as a result of Israel's interest-rate reduction process, there has been a gradual alignment between the share of local-currency and foreign-currency assets in the portfolio, alongside the continued sound functioning of the markets. The interest-rate policy is directed towards achieving price stability on an ongoing basis, and not necessarily for any particular calendar year. Any attempt to achieve the target of price stability by the end of 2003, following the fall in prices since the beginning of the year, would have required the rapid accelerationof inflation in the short term, alongside steep cuts in interest rates, which could have endangered financial stability, the process of economic recovery, and in the final analysis price stability itself. Accordingly, the Bank of Israel's policy at all times is aimed at attaining price stability over a period of one and two years forward. In the last few months the decline in yields on government bonds has persisted, albeit at a slower rate: since the beginning of the year nominal yields (on 10-year bonds) have dropped by more than 4.5 percentage points to a level of about 7.0 percent, and real yields by more than 1.5 percentage points to a level of about 4.2 percent. The reduction in long-term interest on government bonds apparently indicates that the public considers that the budget deficit (which is relatively large and greater than in 2002) derives mainly from the temporary effect of the low level of economic activity in reducing the government's tax revenues, and that it is to a lesser degree a structural deficit constituting a long-term problem. The approval of the government's budget for 2004 and the avoidance of any departure from the budget framework is vital for maintaining the stability that has been attained. Adherence to this stance, and the determination to return to a declining government deficit and debt path, together with the reform of the labor market and the implementation of the plans for infrastructure investment, contribute to steering the economy back to a growth path. Departure from this path, in view of the large government debt, could lead to a rise in nominal and real yields, and hamper the process of economic recovery that has recently begunto emerge. The calm in the foreign currency market, expressed in the strengthening of the NIS relativeto the dollar and its depreciation against the euro, reflects shifts in the international currency markets. Israel's risk premium, as measured by the 5-year credit-default-swap (CDS) market, remained at 60 basis points in December, after the downward path evident since the first quarter of 2003. The calm in the market appears to be due to the US government loan guarantees and the credibility of macroeconomic policy in the eyes of the public. Nonresidents' short-term capital inflow to Israel is affected among other things by changes in interest rates in other advanced and emerging economies (not only the USand Europe) to which international capital flows are directed. This can be seen from Table 3: the Bank of Israel's interest rate is already slightly below the upper level of interest rates of central banks in the advanced economies (Australia and New Zealand: 5 percent), only one percentage point higher than in the UK, and in the mid-range of central-bank interest rates in emerging markets and other developing economies. The Bank of Israel monitors developments in the markets and will continue to act to turn the inflation rate back to the price stability range while bolstering financial stability. Subject to these conditions, the Bank will continue to act to support the policy of fostering employment and bolstering economic activity. Table 1: Interest Rates in Israel and the US.
