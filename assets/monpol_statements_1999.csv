Chile,1999-03-09,"Santiago. March 9, 1999 Press Release The Board of the Central Bank today decided to lower the monetary policy interest rate by twenty-five basis points from an annual UF plus 7.25% to UF plus 7%. The liquidity credit lines are also lowered by the same amount. The monetary policy rate has thus been reduced by seven hundred basis points since September last year and the effects on domestic spending should make themselves felt in the coming quarters. At the same time, medium- and long-term market interest rates are around their average rate this decade which has been compatible with substantial economic growth, reduction of inflation and a prudent current-account deficit. The strong adjustment that had to be made to the Chilean economy, because of the external crisis together with the worst drought this century and the lowest copper price since the '30s, was possible thanks to the solid foundations of our economy. After a year and a half, despite the intensity and persistence of external problems, these foundations are still soundly in place: - the financial system remains solvent with only a modest increase in past due loans, - inflation continues falling with no risk to macroeconomic stability, - fiscal accounts register a surplus despite reduced income, - foreign-currency reserves still cover almost one year of imports and constitute 50% of money and quasi-money (M2), - the foreign debt does not exceed 45% of GDP, excluding reserves, which is equivalent to just over a year of exports, - the current-account deficit has returned to a prudent level, - Chile maintains its rating according to international credit risk-rating agencies, - the real exchange rate has adjusted to prevailing economic conditions and this has helped exports, despite recessive situations in some parts of the world. In short, there are no important reasons why the economy should not recover its dynamism in the coming months as various indicators foresee. The Central Bank will maintain its flexible approach to monetary policy in order to facilitate this recovery which should lead to a moderate growth rate in line with the world situation and with inflationary and external account targets."
Israel,1999-06-28,"June 28,1999 Monetary program for July 1999 The Bank of Israel announced its monetary program for July 1999, according to which the Bank's interest rate remains unchanged. The Bank of Israel explained that the decision to keep the nominal interest rate at its current level derives from the need to ensure that the long-term inflation rate is consistent with the 4 percent target set bythe government for 1999. The particularly low consumer price indices at the beginning of the year, following the interest-rate hike in November 1998, partly reflect the nonrecurring correction of the especially high indices in the last few months of 1998 as a result of the shocks on world financial markets at that time. These developments regarding the price indices increase the chance of attaining a low rate of inflation in 1999; however, the various forecasts of inflation beyond 1999 still indicate a rate of price increases that is higher than 4 percent, indicating that dangers still exist in this sphere. These trends illustrate the need to continue closely monitoring the inflation environment in order to ensure further adherence to a policy aimed at preserving economic stability. This is essential for attaining sustainable growth, in the context of the need for Israel's successful economic integration within the global economy. The Bank of Israel pointed out that the main challenge confronting economic policy continues to be the revival of stable and sustainable growth. This will also provide the right solution to the problem of unemployment. In order to achieve this, the composition of the government's expenditure must accord priority to investment in the physical infrastructure, human capital, and R&D, as well as to the reduction of the tax burden, while adhering to the declining path of the budget deficit as a proportion of GDP. This must go hand in hand with a far-reaching and determined policy of structural reforms. The Bank of Israel announced its monetary program for July 1999, according to which the Bank's interest rate remains unchanged."
Israel,1999-07-25,"July 25,1999 Monetary program for August 1999 The Bank of Israel announced its monetary program for August 1999, according to which the interest rate is reduced by 0.5 of a percentage point. The Bank of Israel explained that the decision was made possible by progress in reducing inflation, expressed in a reduction of inflation expectations twelve months forward and beyond-as measured by various forecasters and the capital market-to an environment slightly above 4 percent. The progress in lowering inflation was also expressed in the very low rises in price indices at the beginning of the year, which reflect a partial correction for the very rapid rises in the indices towards the end of 1998. The Bank clarified, however, that great caution must be exercised in adjusting the interest rate, particularly in the light of the high sensitivity of international financial markets. Against this background, when an opportunity to lower the interest rate arises, the reduction must be by a responsible and appropriate amount. The Bank of Israel also noted that the money supply increased relatively fast in 1998. To ensure that the achievement in reducing inflation and maintaining stability is consolidated, it is vital that the rate of increaseof the money supply be consistent with the attainment of the inflation targets. The Bank repeated that the main challenge of monetary policy continues to be to bolster economic stability-a sine qua non for sustainable growth. What is required, therefore-at this time in particular, in the light of the expected deviation from the target budget deficit for the current year-is a responsible budget policy which will incorporate taking the earliest possible measures to ensure a return to the deficit path decided on by the government. At the same time, it is vital that the composition of government expenditure should give priority to investment in the physical infrastructure, in human capital, and in R&D. A comprehensive and determined policy of structural reforms should be pursued, including such that will reduce the tax burden without causing a deviation from the target deficit, and continue the policy aimed at bolstering economic stability. Monetary program for August 1999 The Bank of Israel announced its monetary program for August 1999, according to which the interest rate is reduced by 0.5 of a percentage point."
Israel,1999-08-23,"August 23, 1999 Monetary program for September 1999 The Bank of Israel announced its monetary program for September 1999, according to which the Bank's interest rateremains unchanged, after reductions totaling 2 percentage points since the beginning of the year. The Bank of Israel clarified that the decision not to change the rate of interest this month was the outcome of the need to continue monitoring inflation developments. Inflationary risks currently present are expressed, among other things, by the fact that inflation expectations fora twelve-month horizon and beyond, as reflected by several indices, are higherthan 4 percent. It is also important that the relatively high rate of increaseof the money supply should in the long run be consistent with the attainment of the inflation targets. The Bank of Israel also notes that there are indications of upward pressures on prices in international commodities markets, and that international financial markets are very sensitive. The Bank noted that a situation must be avoided in which one-off price rises- which may result from fluctuations in the exchange rate of the NIS, for example-are translated into a deviation from the inflation environment. The policy goal is to ensure that the rate of inflationshould be consistent with the target of 3-4 percent per year set by the government for 2000-2001, and thereby to contribute to sustainable growth. The Bank of Israel explained that determining a long-term framework for the budget and inflation targets and fully implementing them serve to buttress economic stability and create the conditions essential for sustained growth. Adopting and carrying out economic reforms and fixing a budget composition which is growth-oriented will in the long run act to improve efficiency and competition and create an infrastructure for continued expansion of business-sector activity and for reduced unemployment.

Israel,1999-09-27,"September 27,1999 Monetary program for October 1999 The Bank of Israel announced its monetary program for October 1999, according to which the Bank's interest rateremains unchanged. The Bank of Israel pointed out that the developmentand the nature of the current risks regarding inflation must be continuously and closely examined; this derives from the commitment to act to achieve the inflation target of 3-4 percent per year set by the government for the nexttwo years. These risks are reflected, inter alia, in various assessments of inflation for the next year and beyond, and in the long-term rate of increase of the money supply, which is still higher than it should be. The Bank of Israel also emphasized that exceptionaldevelopments in the foreign-currency market must not be allowed to cause a deviation from the inflation targets decided upon. It is therefore essential that a comprehensive budget and interest policy be operated, consistent with the long-term framework for the government's deficit and inflation targets. This policy of maintaining economic stability is fundamental to the attainment of sustained growth. The Bank of Israel announced its monetary program for October 1999, according to which the Bank's interest rateremains unchanged."
Israel,1999-10-25,"October 25, 1999 Monetary program for November 1999 The Bank of Israel announced its monetary program for November 1999, according to which the Bank's interest rate remains unchanged The Bank of Israel explained that this decision wastaken in the light of the dangers in the area of inflation, which are reflected mainly in inflation expectations for a twelve-month horizon and beyond. These are still higher than the path required to ensure the attainment of the inflation target of 3-4 percent per year set by the government for the nexttwo years. Gradual progress has been made recently, however, regardingthe inflation environment, and this must be allowed to run its course. These developments must be watched meticulously. It is especially important to observe the nature of the connection between exchange-rate changes andprice changes-a connection which seems to have weakened recently-in the light of the great flexibility of the exchange rate in the system of the wide exchange-rate band in which the markets currently operate. The Bank pointed out that it is important that the budget be approved by the Knesset in accordance with the framework set by thegovernment, in order to reduce the uncertainty surrounding this vital issue. The pursuit of a budget policy in accordance with government decisions, with the implementation of a policy of structural reforms, will contribute to renewed growth. It is therefore vital for the maintenance of economic stability, which is essential for sustained growth, that a comprehensive economicpolicy-particularly regarding the budget and the rate of interest-be implemented, consistent with the long-term framework determined by the government's deficit and inflation targets. The Bank of Israel announced its monetary program for November 1999, according to which the Bank's interest rate remains unchanged The Bank of Israel explained that this decision wastaken in the light of the dangers in the area of inflation, which are reflected mainly in inflation expectations for a twelve-month horizon and beyond."
Israel,1999-11-22,"November 22, 1999 Monetary program for December 1999 The Bank of Israel announced its monetary program for December 1999, according to which the Bank's interest rate is reduced by 0.3 of a percentage point. The Bank of Israel explained that the decision to reduce the interest rate was taken in the light of recent progress in lowering the inflation environment. This progress was mainly expressed in the gradual and continued reduction in expected inflation for a one-year horizon and beyond-as reflected in expectations derived from the capital market and invarious inflation forecasts-to a level close to the path consistent with the attainment of the inflation target of 3-4 percent per year set by thegovernment for the next two years. Furthermore, the rate of increase of the money supply also moderated again, so that it is now compatible with the desired rate. The Bank pointed out that there are still dangers regarding inflation and financial stability which require continued caution in interest policy, basedon keeping a close watch on and detailed analysis of the inflation environment. The Bank of Israel emphasized that it is important that the budget be approved by the Knesset in accordance with the framework andcomposition set by the government, in order to reduce economic uncertaintyand continue advancing towards renewed and sustainable growth. To achieve this, the budget policy should be accompanied by determined implementation of structural reforms which increase competition. All the above forms part of the macroeconomic strategy designed to maintain economic stability, while opening the economy and integrating it into the global economy, providing the impetus to sustainable growth. The Bank of Israel announced its monetary program for December 1999, according to which the Bank's interest rate is reduced by 0.3 of a percentage point."
South Korea,1999-12-02,"Although the real economy showed a rapid expansion and is expected to continue this trend, consumer prices, which had been showing a rising trend for the previous three months, declined a little in November mainly due to the stability of agricultural, livestock and fishery prices. Long-term market interest rates rose significantly, despite the reduction of much of the financial market uncertainty as the Daewoo's restructuring and rehabilitation of the investment trust companies made progress. The rise in interest rates is partly attributable to market expectations of higher interest rates as a result of the faster-than- anticipated economic growth. Another contributing factor was the heightened interest rate volatility arising from the lack of demand for bonds on the part of investment trust companies which continued to suffer a net outflow of funds. Meanwhile, there is the possibility that financial markets may be destabilized in December by any sudden call for funds to secure liquidity in anticipation of possible Y2K problems. Taking these factors into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea has decided to maintain its current monetary policy stance in December, focusing on stabilizing the financial market. Overnight call rate will be maintained at around its current level and liquidity will be supplied in a flexible manner."
Israel,1999-12-27,"December 27, 1999 Monetary program for January 2000 The Bank of Israel announced its monetary program for January 2000, according to which the Bank's interest rateis reduced by 0.5 of a percentage point. The Bank of Israel explained that the decision to reduce the interest rate reflects further progress in lowering the inflationenvironment, expressed chiefly in the continued reduction in expected inflation for a one-year horizon and beyond-as seen in expectation indices derived from the capital market and from various inflation forecasts-and in the rate of increase of the money supply, which is consistent with the target rate ofinflation. The Bank of Israel stressed the importance of continuing with the cautious interest policy which takes account of the dangers on the financial and inflation fronts, while focusing on bolstering economic stability and securing the low inflation environment. All the above is necessary to ensure the attainment of inflation target set by the government for the years 2000 and 2001.
