Romania,2013-01-07,"The NBR will closely monitor domestic and global economic developments so as, via an optimal dosage of its instruments, to ensure the fulfilment of its objectives to achieve price stability over the medium term and to maintain financial stability. The analysis of the latest developments in macroeconomic indicators points to a halt in the upward trend of the annual inflation rate, as well as to a slow recovery in Romania's economy amid the recession in euro area economies. The annual inflation rate fell to 4.56 percent in November 2012 from the 5.33 percent peak of September 2012, thereby confirming the gradual fading of the inflationary effect coming from supply-side factors. The annual adjusted CORE21 inflation rate remained at 3.3 percent in November 2012. The feeble dynamics of industrial production and retail trade, as well as the protracted euro area recession entailing adverse effects on Romanian exports suggest the persistence of the negative output gap. At the same time, similarly to the economic developments in most EU Member States, the expansion in lending to the private sector is slowing down. Its components show diverging trajectories, with a reduction in foreign currency-denominated loan dynamics. The monetary policy remained prudent, seeking to anchor inflation expectations and pave the way for the annual inflation rate to near the medium-term target. The NBR's firm liquidity management in the recent period, together with the compliance with the assumed fiscal and budgetary parameters, completion of the electoral process and the new government taking office, contributed to an improvement in investors' sovereign risk perception, which helped alleviate pressures on the exchange rate and interbank rates. Prospects remain favourable for the annual inflation rate to return inside the target band by the end of the year, but risks and uncertainties related to the developments in the external environment, capital flows, administered prices and some volatile prices still persist. In this context, the NBR Board decided to keep the monetary policy rate unchanged at 5.25 percent per annum, to ensure an adequate liquidity management in the banking system and to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. These decisions are aimed at resuming and consolidating disinflation, whose outlook is further marked by risks and uncertainties related to domestic developments, including the persistence of structural rigidities across the Romanian economy as well as the euro area and global economic recovery. Maintaining a prudent stance of monetary policy, also through an optimal dosage of the central bank's instruments, is essential for achieving medium-term objectives on price stability and financial stability, paving the way for sustainable economic growth. Both processes will help ensure the necessary conditions for a lasting reduction in the interest rate on leu-denominated loans, foster saving in local currency and secure sustainability of the external deficit by containing the reliance on external financing. The NBR Board reiterates that the NBR closely monitors domestic and global economic developments so as, via an adequate dosage of its instruments, to ensure price stability over the medium term and financial stability. In line with the announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for 5 February 2013, when the new quarterly Inflation Report is to be examined. 1 Calculated by excluding administered prices, volatile prices, as well as tobacco and alcohol prices from the consumer price index.

Poland,2013-01-09,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 9 January 2013 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 8-9 January 2013 The Council decided to decrease the NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage points:  reference rate to 4.00% on an annual basis;  lombard rate to 5.50% on an annual basis;  deposit rate to 2.50% on an annual basis;  rediscount rate to 4.25% on an annual basis. Incoming data show that global economic activity was still weak in 2012 Q4. Economic activity in the United States stayed moderate, while the euro area most probably remained in recession. The economic slowdown observed over recent quarters in some major emerging economies appears to have decelerated. Weak global economic activity is conducive to a decline in inflation in many countries. Global financial market sentiment has improved recently, supported by further monetary policy easing by the major central banks. In Poland, incoming data and the economic sentiment indices show that the economic activity remained weak over the recent months. In particular, industrial and construction output decreased in November, whereas the annual growth of retail sales in real terms continued to run only slightly above zero. Furthermore, labour market figures confirm an economic slowdown. November saw a continued decline in the corporate sector employment accompanied by a persistently slow growth in wages and unemployment rate continuing to rise. Over the recent months, both household and corporate lending growth continued to weaken. In November. CPI inflation decreased and amounted to 2.8% y/y, being close to the NBP's inflation target (2.5%). At the same time both the core inflation measures and producer price growth continued to decline, which confirms weakening of demand and cost pressures. Declining inflation was accompanied by lower inflation expectations of households. In the opinion of the Council, incoming data confirm a considerable economic slowdown in Poland, which results in limited wage and inflationary pressures. At the same time, the Council assesses that GDP growth will remain moderate in the coming quarters, which poses a risk of inflation running below the NBP's inflation target in the medium term. Therefore, the Council decided to lower the NBP interest rates further. The decrease in interest rates should support economic activity and reduces the risk of inflation falling below the target in the medium term. 00-919 Warszawa, ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, tel. (22) 653 28 88, fax (22) 653 13 28 The Council does not rule out further monetary policy easing should the incoming data confirm a protracted economic slowdown and should the risk of increase in inflationary pressure remain limited."
Thailand,2013-01-09,"No 1/ 2013 Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 9 January 2013 Mr. Paiboon Kittisrikangwan. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting today as follows. The global economy overall continued to recover gradually since the last meeting led by the US and China. The recent agreement to avert the US fiscal cliff also helped bolster global financial market sentiment. Nevertheless the eurozone and the Japanese economies remained weak and resolution of their structural problems would likely take time. Economic performance of most Asian economies turned more positive on the back of strong domestic demand as well as modestly improving exports. The Thai economy in the fourth quarter likely expanded more than previously assessed, leading to an upward growth revision for both 2012 and 2013. Private consumption and investment continued to be the key growth drivers supported by consumer and business confidence, favourable household income, full employment as well as accommodative monetary conditions with continued high rates of credit growth. Exports sector showed incipient signs of a broad‐based recovery while the service sector and tourism expanded robustly. Inflationary pressure remained stable close to the previous meeting. Nevertheless the impact of the second‐round minimum wage increase warranted monitoring. The MPC assessed that the accommodative monetary policy stance throughout the previous year had significantly shored up private sector confidence, supported post‐flood recovery, and helped cushion the economy from the global economic headwinds. The MPC viewed that, with remaining uncertainties in the global economy and inflation forecast within target, the current monetary policy stance was appropriate in supporting domestic demand to sustain growth momentum. The MPC will, however, continue to closely monitor financial stability risks that may arise from persistently high credit growth, rising household debt, and volatile capital flows. The MPC thus voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 275 percent per annum."
Euroarea,2013-01-10,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. HICP inflation rates have declined over recent months, as anticipated, and are expected to fall below 2% this year. Over the policy-relevant horizon, inflationary pressures should remain contained. The underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be subdued. Inflation expectations for the euro area remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. The economic weakness in the euro area is expected to extend into 2013. In particular, necessary balance sheet adjustments in financial and non-financial sectors and persistent uncertainty will continue to weigh on economic activity. In particular, our accommodative monetary policy stance, together with significantly improved financial market confidence and reduced fragmentation, should work its way through to the economy, and global demand should strengthen. In order to sustain confidence, it is essential for governments to reduce further both fiscal and structural imbalances and to proceed with financial sector restructuring. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Following a contraction of 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2012, euro area real GDP declined by 0.1% in the third quarter. Available statistics and survey indicators continue to signal further weakness in activity, which is expected to extend into this year, reflecting the adverse impact on domestic expenditure of weak consumer and investor sentiment and subdued foreign demand. However, more recently several conjunctural indicators have broadly stabilised, albeit at low levels, and financial market confidence has improved significantly. Later in 2013 a gradual recovery should start, as our accommodative monetary policy stance, the significant improvement in financial market confidence and reduced fragmentation work their way through to private domestic expenditure, and a strengthening of foreign demand should support export growth. The risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area remain on the downside. They are mainly related to slow implementation of structural reforms in the euro area, geopolitical issues and imbalances in major industrialised countries. These factors have the potential to dampen sentiment for longer than currently assumed and delay further the recovery of private investment, employment and consumption. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 2.2% in December 2012, unchanged from November and down from 2.5% in October and 2.6% in August and September. On the basis of current futures prices for oil, inflation rates are expected to decline further to below 2% this year. Over the policy-relevant horizon, in an environment of weak economic activity in the euro area and well-anchored long-term inflation expectations, underlying price pressures should remain contained. Risks to the outlook for price developments are seen as broadly balanced over the medium term, with downside risks stemming from weaker economic activity and upside risks relating to higher administered prices and indirect taxes, as well as higher oil prices. Turning to the monetary analysis, the underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be subdued. The annual growth rate of M3 remained broadly unchanged at 3.8% in November 2012, after 3.9% in October. M3 growth continued to be driven by a preference for liquid assets, as M1 growth increased further to 6.7% in November, from 6.5% in October, reflecting inflows into overnight deposits from households and non-financial corporations. Following our non-standard monetary policy measures and action by other policy-makers, a broadly based strengthening in the deposit base of MFIs in a number of stressed countries was observed. This allowed several MFIs to reduce further their reliance on Eurosystem funding and helped to reduce segmentation in financial markets. M3 growth was also supported by an inflow of capital into the euro area, as reflected in the strong increase in the net external asset position of MFIs. There has been little change in credit growth, which remained weak in November. The annual rate of decline in loans to the private sector (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) remained at -0.5% in November. This development reflects further net redemptions in loans to non-financial corporations. Net redemptions, however, were less pronounced than in previous months, amounting to €4 billion in November, after €7 billion in October and €21 billion in September. The annual rate of decline in loans to non-financial corporations was -1.4% in November, after -1.5% in October. The annual growth in MFI lending to households also remained broadly unchanged at 0.7% in November. To a large extent, subdued loan dynamics reflect the current stage of the business cycle, heightened credit risk and the ongoing adjustment in the balance sheets of households and enterprises. In order to ensure adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions in euro area countries, it is essential to continue strengthening the resilience of banks where needed. The soundness of banks' balance sheets will be a key factor in facilitating both an appropriate provision of credit to the economy and the normalisation of all funding channels. Decisive steps for establishing an integrated financial framework will help to accomplish this objective. The future single supervisory mechanism (SSM) is one of the main building blocks. It is a crucial move towards re-integrating the banking system. To sum up, the economic analysis indicates that price developments should remain in line with price stability over the medium term. A cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. Other economic policy areas will need to make further contributions to ensure a firm stabilisation of financial markets and an improvement in the outlook for growth. Further structural reforms should be rapidly implemented to make the euro area a more flexible, dynamic and competitive economy. In particular, product market reforms to increase competition and competitiveness are essential, accompanied by measures to improve the functioning of labour markets. Such reforms will boost the euro area's growth potential and employment and improve the adjustment capacities of the euro area countries. They will also add further momentum to the progress being made with regard to unit labour costs and current account imbalances. As regards fiscal policies, the recent significant decline in sovereign bond yields should be bolstered by further progress in fiscal consolidation in line with the commitments under the Stability and Growth Pact."
South Korea,2013-01-11,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.75% for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.75% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information, the Committee considers the moderate economic recovery in the US to have continued but the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area to have persisted, while economic indicators in emerging market countries have shown signs of improvement. The Committee expects the global economy to exhibit a modest recovery going forward but judges that the uncertainties related for instance to the fiscal crisis in the euro area and to fiscal consolidation in the US have not lifted and remain as downside risks to growth. In Korea, the Committee appraises economic growth to have remained at a weak level, with indicators related to exports and domestic demand alternating between improving and worsening. On the employment front, the increase in number of persons employed in December was somewhat smaller than that the month before, a result mainly of weak construction sector employment due to bad weather conditions. Going forward, the Committee anticipates that the negative output gap in the domestic economy will persist for a considerable time, due mostly to the slow recovery of the global economy in consequence chiefly of the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area. 1 Consumer price inflation fell to 1.4% in December, from 1.6% the previous month, owing primarily to the stability in prices of livestock products and industrial goods, and core inflation excluding the prices of agricultural and petroleum products continued to run at a low level at 1.2%. The Committee forecasts that inflation will remain low for the time being, owing primarily to the easing of demand-side pressures. As for housing prices, those in Seoul and its surrounding areas continued on their downtrend and those in the rest of the country on their uptrend. In the financial markets, stock prices have risen and the Korean won has appreciated against the US dollar, due mostly to the additional quantitative easing policies of major advanced countries and to international financial market stability. Long-term market interest rates have fallen from their end-November levels, fluctuating in response mainly to the economic outlook and to developments in the negotiations on fiscal consolidation in the US. Looking ahead, the Committee will closely monitor external risk factors and the consequent changes in financial and economic conditions at home and abroad, continue its efforts to lower inflation expectations, and conduct monetary policy so as to keep consumer price inflation within the inflation target range over a medium-term horizon while ensuring that the growth potential is not eroded due to the continuation of slow growth."
Peru,2013-01-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JANUARY 2013 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 4.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference rate at 4.25 percent. This decision is based on the fact that inflation continues to decline due to the reversal of the shocks on the side of supply, in a domestic context characterized by an economic pace of growth close to the economy's potential growth and a still complicated external context. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants to consider future adjustments in monetary policy instruments. Inflation in December registered a rate of 0.26 percent, which reflected the seasonal rise observed in transport and food in the period of the year-end festivities. Inflation in the last 12 months fell from 2.66 percent in November to 2.65 percent in December. Core inflation showed a rate of 0.18 percent and thus accumulates a rate of 3.27 percent in the last 12 months. Inflation excluding food and energy showed a monthly rate of 0.40 percent and an annual rate of 1.91 percent. In 2013 inflation would gradually converge to the 2 percent target due to the improvement of food supply conditions and due to a pace of growth of economic activity close to the economy's level of potential output, in a context in which global economic activity continues to show weak indicators. Some current and advanced indicators of activity show that the growth of the Peruvian economy has stabilized around its long-term sustainable level of growth, although the indicators associated with the external market still register a weak performance. The Board also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as described below: Overnight deposits: 3.45 percent. Direct repo and rediscount operations: 5.05 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.05 percent. In 2013, the Monetary Program approved by the Board for each month will be announced according to the following schedule: February 7 March 7 April 11 May 9 June 13 July 11 August 8 September 12 October 10 November 7 December 12 Moreover, in 2013 the BCRP will publish its Inflation Reports on the following dates: March 22 June 21 September 20 December 20."
Russia,2013-01-15,"The Board of Directors' Decision on the Bank of Russia Interest Rates (Unofficial translation). The Bank of Russia External and Public Relations Department informs that on 15 January 2013 the Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia decided to maintain the refinancing rate and the interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations unchanged (table “Interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations”). The decision was supported by the assessment of inflation risks and economic growth prospects. In December 2012 and at the beginning of January 2013 the pace of inflation increased to some extent and as of 9 of January was estimated at 6.8% over a year ago, which exceeded the target range. Core inflation declined to 5.7% in December 2012. The acceleration of consumer price inflation was mainly driven by higher growth rates of food and passenger transport services prices, while the nonfood goods inflation remained moderate in December. The inflation rate staying above the target range for a prolonged period of time may affect economic agents' expectations and thus poses inflation risks, despite the absence of any significant demand-pull price pressures, according to the Bank of Russia estimates. The dynamics of the key macroeconomic indicators in November 2012 was in line with the previous trend towards gradual cooling of economic activity. The growth rates of industrial production and retail sales stabilized but remained subdued. The growth of investment in production capacity decelerated. At the same time, economic confidence indicators remain overall positive and labour market conditions together with credit expansion provide support to the domestic demand. According to the Bank of Russia estimates, the gross output remains close to its potential level. Taking into account still relatively high bank lending growth rates, the risks of a significant economic slowdown stemming from the tighter monetary conditions are considered minor. The Bank of Russia will continue to monitor inflation risks, global economic developments and the consequences of the monetary conditions tightening for the Russian economy. In making monetary policy decisions the Bank of Russia will be guided by medium-term inflation goals and economic growth prospects, as well as the dynamics of inflation expectations. The next meeting of the Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia on monetary policy issues is planned to be held in the first half of February 2013.

Chile,2013-01-17,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 17 January 2013 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 5% (annual). Internationally, financial conditions are more favorable than they were a month ago. However, the risks from the fiscal and financial situation in the Eurozone remain high, and the fiscal risk in the United States, having moderated, is still significant. Weak growth continues in developed economies, while more positive signs are observed coming from China. Fuel prices have picked up, while the prices of copper and foods are fairly unchanged from last month. Domestically, recent output and demand indicators have evolved in line with forecasts in the last Monetary Policy Report. The labor market is still tight. Job creation increased and wage growth remained stable. Headline and core inflation are below 2% y-o-y, while inflationary expectations in the policy horizon are aligned with the target. In the last month, the peso appreciated slightly with respect to the dollar. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. * The Spanish original prevails."
Nigeria,2013-01-21,"Central Bank of Nigeria Communique No. 87 of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting of Monday. January 21, 2013 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on. January 21, 2013 with ten (10) out of the twelve (12) members in attendance. The Committee reviewed the domestic economic conditions in 2012 and the challenges therefrom against the backdrop of the international financial and economic environment in order to chart the course of monetary policy in 2013. The International Economic Situation The Committee noted that global economic growth remained largely uneven and subdued in most economies in 2012. Latest data from the IMF indicate that global output was weaker than previously forecast due to continued contraction in the Euro zone and Japan as well as the less than anticipated growth in Brazil and India. The fragility in the global economy was further compounded by the uncertainties surrounding resolution of the “fiscal cliff” and debt ceiling challenges in the US and the difficulties associated with China's attempts to “rebalance” its growth. These developments adversely affected private sector confidence, worsened the unemployment situation and further tightened financing conditions in both the periphery and core economies. In the euro area, economic and 1 financial conditions remained severely weak. Although the European Central Bank (ECB) attempted, through its intervention scheme, to halt the downward trend in economic activities in the zone, the effort did not record much success. Overall global output was estimated to have expanded by 32 per cent in 2012 against the earlier projection of 33 per cent made in the October 2012 IMF World Economic Outlook. Growth in the advanced economies was estimated at 13 per cent in 2012 and projected at 15 per cent in 2013, reflecting an upward revision of 02 percentage point, respectively, from the initial estimates. The Committee noted that the decline in global investment was mainly traced to the fiscal standoff in the US and its implications for the paltry expansion in output of 20 per cent in Q3, 2012. Emerging European economies, which had previously shown signs of strong rebound from the credit crisis, have now been hit hard by slow exports growth and a halt to real GDP growth. On the whole, the Committee is of the view that while the decisions of the ECB considerably reduced the probability of a Eurozone-wide financial crisis, the condition of country-level financial systems remained difficult and could constitute significant challenge to output expansion in 2013. Latest data from the Asian economies suggest that a gradual recovery may be underway. China's economy, which had previously recorded a slowdown over seven consecutive quarters to Q3, 2012, witnessed improved economic activity in Q4, 2012. Recent fiscal and monetary easing operations have increased investment in 2 infrastructure with signals of further spending into 2013. The Indonesian economy, after recovery from the severe flooding in 2011, continued to show resilience against the global slowdown as investment and strong domestic demand contributed more to growth. It is expected that these twin drivers of growth would further sustain output expansion in 2013, although recent reports indicate that severe flooding has once again hit the economy during January 2013. The sub-optimal performance of the Japanese and Indian economies, however, was a major drag on recovery in the region. The Indian economy was hampered by slow approvals for new projects, deterioration in business sentiment largely due to the rising current account deficit, uncertainty over the selling of government stakes in state owned enterprises, fiscal deficits, depreciation of the Rupee and a high debt burden, as well as slow implementation of structural reforms. Japan's drawback was largely due to a combination of declining exports and sluggish domestic demand. There are, however, expectations that the growth decline would bottom-out in 2013 as anticipated rebound in major trading partner economies like China and the US would translate to a recovery in the demand for Japanese goods and services. The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region continued to record mixed performance, evidenced by the divergence between the economies of oil-exporting and oil-importing countries. Oil-importing countries experienced subdued economic performance with an estimated growth of 20 per cent in 2012 while the oil-exporting countries grew at an average rate of 66 per cent. Growth in oil-exporting 3 countries was driven largely by high oil output and prices coupled with the early post-conflict recovery of Libya. Growth for the entire region in 2013 has been projected at 375 per cent, which is 135 percentage points below the estimate for 2012. The Committee noted that the challenges confronting these countries is how to strengthen the resilience of their fragile economies against major oil price shocks through diversification and expansion of the private sector. Economic conditions in sub-Saharan Africa remained generally robust despite the sluggish growth in the global economy. Prudent policies and improved fundamentals in most countries provided additional impetus for increased economic activity in the region. The Committee noted that the main risks to the outlook for the region come from their trading partners including the possible intensification of the financial stress in the euro zone and a sharp fiscal adjustment in the US. In light of the uncertainty about the direction of fiscal policy in the US, particularly with regard to the yet to be resolved issue of debt ceiling, and the persisting euro zone financial and economic crises, the Committee was of the view that the global economic environment was still fragile and highly vulnerable to a further contraction, although the downside risks appeared to be less severe relative to conditions in the last two years. Domestic Economic and Financial Developments Output 4 The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) estimated real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate at 661 per cent for 2012, which is lower than the level recorded in 2011 by 084 per cent. The estimated real GDP growth rate at 709 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2012 was higher than the 648 per cent in the third quarter but lower than the 768 per cent recorded in the corresponding period of 2011. The non-oil sector remained the major driver of growth recording 823 per cent increase in contrast to the oil sector, which contracted by 017 per cent during the period. The Committee expressed concern about the continued decline in the contribution of the oil sector to growth due to lower production relative to the corresponding period of 2011 and enjoined the Federal Government to fast track the passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill to halt the trend. The relatively robust growth projections despite the slowing global economy reflected the relatively favourable performance of wholesale and retail trade; the services sectors; outcome of banking sector reforms; and initiatives by government to stimulate the real economy. Despite the developments in the international oil market where the US is now the second largest oil producer, the Committee observed that the growth projection remained promising, anchored on the recent improvements in power supply. The Committee noted with satisfaction the Federal Government's efforts to sustain the current initiatives to boost power generation, particularly the progress made in reforming the power sector. The Committee, however, observed that the severe flooding in several parts of the country in 2012, which damaged housing, agricultural and oil assets, could pose 5 downside risks to growth and feed into food supply deficits and inflation in the near term. Also the continuing security challenges as well as delays in reform of the oil sector could undermine investor-confidence and output growth in the near-term. Prices The Committee observed that, on the average, inflationary pressure was elevated in 2012. The yearonyear average headline inflation rate in 2012 stood at 1224 per cent, while the average core and food inflation year-on-year stood at 1387 and 1132 per cent, respectively. The major drivers of headline inflation in December 2012 included food and non-alcoholic beverages, housing, water, electricity and transport. The pickup in food inflation in the later part of 2012 was accounted for by imported food items and food shortages due to the impact of flood on farmlands along the major agricultural belt of the country. However the Committee was of the view that the pass-through effects of imported food inflation to domestic prices may have been subdued owing to the relatively stable exchange rate during the period under review. Monetary Credit and Financial Markets Developments Broad money supply (M2) grew by 1372 per cent in December 2012 over the level at end-December 2011. Aggregate domestic credit (net) grew by 198 per cent in December 2012, which was substantially below the benchmark of 5217 per cent for the year. Credit to Government contracted between September and December 2012; occasioned by the sustenance of government as a net creditor to the banking system, 6 reflecting more prudent fiscal measures, including the introduction of the Treasury Single Account. Interest rates in all segments of the money market moderated between 19th November 2012 and 3rd January, 2013. This reflected in increased liquidity in the banking system including the release of statutory revenue to sub- national governments, absence of repo transaction during the review period, repayments of matured CBN Bills and banks' desire to maintain optimum liquidity position on their balance sheets at the end of their common financial year. The interbank call and OBB rates, which opened at 1399 and 1395 per cent on November 19, 2012, closed at 1032 and 1045 per cent, respectively, on January 3, 2013. The average interbank call and OBB rates for the period were 1109 and 1103 per cent, respectively. The average prime lending rate increased slightly to 1654 per cent in December 2012 from 1648 and 16. 51 per cent in October and November 2012, respectively. In contrast, the average maximum lending rate fell marginally to 2461 per cent in December 2012 from 2465 and 2470 per cent, respectively, in October and November, respectively while the weighted average savings and term deposits rate decreased to 550 per cent in December from 557 per cent in the preceding month. The Committee, therefore, encouraged the Bank to fast track the financial inclusion strategy to improve financial intermediation and the effectiveness of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy and to adopt ways of moderating the high spread between deposit and lending rates. The Committee observed that the rally in the Nigerian capital market continued as equities market indicators trended upwards in the review period. Market Capitalization (MC) also increased, by 3738 per cent, from N653 trillion to N897 trillion during the same period. The positive performance of the ASI and MC was due to the sustained increase in the demand for blue-chip stocks particularly in the banking and consumer goods sectors following improvements in earnings and growing investor-confidence. The Committee, however, noted that the significant factor responsible for the recovery was strong portfolio flows and cautioned that the capital market remained structurally vulnerable to external shocks until its funding basis was changed. External Sector Developments At the Wholesale Dutch Auction System (wDAS), the exchange rate opened at N15731/US$ on November 20, 2012 and closed at N15733/US$ on December 31, 2012 representing a depreciation of N002 or 001 per cent. The average wDAS exchange rate during the period was N15732/US$. At the BDC segment of the foreign exchange market, the selling rate opened at N16000/US$ on November 20, 2012 and closed at N15950/US$ on December 31, 2012, representing an appreciation of N050 or 031 per cent for the period. At the interbank segment, the selling rate opened at N15795/US$ on November 20, 2012 and closed at N15625/US$ on December 31, 2012, representing an appreciation of N170 or 108 per cent. Overall the relative stability recorded in the foreign 8 exchange market could be attributed to the combined effects of improved supply of foreign exchange by the oil companies and enhanced capital inflows from portfolio investors during the period under review. Also oil revenue increased at an average of 273 per cent monthly throughout 2012. In the first eleven months of 2012, oil receipts totaled US$40087 billion. The Committee noted with satisfaction that the premium between wDAS and the interbank rate narrowed towards the end of the review period. However the premium between the wDAS and BDCs widened towards the end of the review period from N1682/US$ to N2172/US$ suggesting the need to sustain and further complement existing measures to discourage speculative activities in the foreign exchange market. In general, the Committee noted that decisions at previous MPC meetings were yielding the desired results. The Committee expressed satisfaction with the sustained accretion to external reserves which stood at US$43849 billion as at December 31, 2012, representing an increase of US$1682 billion or about 398 per cent from the level of US$42167 billion at end-October 2012. Relative to the end- December 2011 level of US$32915 billion, the external reserves at the end of December 2012, had risen by US$10934 billion or 3321 per cent. The increase in the level of foreign reserves was driven mainly by proceeds from crude oil and gas exports and crude-oil related taxes as well as reduced funding of the wDAS on account of the huge inflow of foreign portfolio investments, which was about 770 per cent of total inflows through the CBN. The foreign reserves level could finance about 9 months of imports. The Committee's Considerations The Committee observed that the performance of the global economy remained largely subdued and was characterized by uncertainty and contraction in the Euro zone and Japan, as well as lower than expected growth in the large emerging and developing economies. The Committee notes with caution that the partial resolution of the Fiscal Cliff in the US offers some hope for gradual global economic recovery as indicated by the rebound of many global financial markets in the wake of the staving off of automatic tax increases and expenditures cuts on 1st January, 2013. The Committee further observed that the robust prospects for energy independence of the US could pose downside risk for global oil prices in the medium-to- long term which could threaten fiscal sustainability in many oil- dependent economies around the world. The Committee noted that in spite of the slow progress made in the resolution of the Euro zone crises, the prospect of a deepening recession in the near term has not been completely averted. Developments in the domestic economy in the past three months highlighted some new pressure points to macroeconomic stability. The Committee was of the view that shocks to the economy could come from significant fall in the demand for oil, leading to a fall in oil prices and government revenues, weaker exchange rate, rising inflationary pressures and depletion in external reserves. The Committee also noted the drop in headline inflation in December 2012, although it also recognized that core inflation had risen; driven mainly by cost-push factors even in the face of sluggish growth in the monetary aggregates. 10 With regard to the budget of the Federal Government, the Committee cautioned against complacency over government revenues; despite the high level of oil prices. The Committee noted uncertainty in global demand and supply of crude oil, and weak performance of non-oil and VAT revenues. The Committee, however, noted with satisfaction the efforts the Federal Government aimed at keeping deficits within the threshold prescribed by the Fiscal Responsibility Act and advocated sustenance of the effort. On expenditure, the Committee noted that there was still the need to continue to drive down recurrent expenditure in favor of capital expenditure in view of the infrastructure deficit that continued to constrain growth performance. The Committee noted that the oil price benchmark for the 2013 budget which was increased from US$75 to US$79 may pose downside risk to the inflation objective and, therefore, constituted a pressure point for the low inflation objective and effective monetary policy in 2013. The Committee reaffirmed its commitment to respond appropriately if public spending in 2013 ultimately adds to inflationary pressures. In view of these developments, the Committee was faced with three choices: An increase in the MPR in response to the higher oil price benchmark for fiscal 2013; A reduction in MPR in view of the declining GDP growth trajectory and headline inflation; and Retaining the current monetary policy stance in view of the conflicting price signals, global uncertainties and the need to preserve the stability of the system. 1 12 The Committee's Decisions Given the stability achieved in the last twelve months with average year-on-year headline inflation rate at 1224 per cent, in 2012, the MPR of 12 per cent was considered to be just about right. The Committee considered the calls for a reduction in the MPR because of the benign inflation outlook other things being equal. However this may be undermined by the increased sub-national government spending and Federal Government high expenditure in 2013, the higher benchmark oil price in the 2013 budget and the US debt ceiling with possible impact on commodity prices. In view of the foregoing, the Committee decided that it was prudent to hold and monitor developments between now and the next meeting of the MPC. The Committee, therefore, decided by a majority vote of 8::2 to maintain the current policy stance ie., to retain the MPR at 120 per cent with a corridor of +/- 200 basis points around the midpoint; retain the CRR at 120 per cent; and to retain the Liquidity Ratio at 300 per cent. Two members voted for a reduction of the MPR by 25 basis points. Thank you. Sanusi Lamido Sanusi. CON Governor Central Bank of Nigeria 21st January, 2013 13."
Turkiye,2013-01-22,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to adjust the short term interest rates as follows: a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) has been kept at 5.5 percent. b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate has been cut from 5 percent to 4.75 while lending rate has been cut from 9 percent to 8.75 percent. Interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions has been cut from 8.5 percent to 8.25 percent. c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent while lending rate has been cut from 12 percent to 11.75 percent. Recent data confirm that the rebalancing between the domestic and external demand continues as envisaged. Domestic demand follows a moderate pace while exports continue to increase despite weak global activity. Overall, current account deficit continues to decline gradually. The Committee has indicated that the recent credit growth has been faster than envisaged, amid accelerating capital inflows. In order to contain the risks on financial stability, the proper policy would be to keep interest rates at low levels while continuing with macroprudential measures. Accordingly, it was deemed appropriate to implement a measured tightening through reserve requirements, while delivering a limited downward shift in the interest rate corridor. Ongoing uncertainties regarding the global economy necessitate the monetary policy to remain flexible in both directions. Therefore, the impact of the measures undertaken on credit, domestic demand, and inflation expectations will be monitored closely and the funding amount will be adjusted in either direction, as needed. The Committee has indicated that inflation may increase slightly in January due to adjustments in tobacco prices, but will resume its downward trend afterwards. Core inflation indicators are expected to continue their downward trend. In the meantime, the impact of increases in administered prices on the pricing behavior will be monitored closely. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Philippines,2013-01-23,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the BSP's key policy interest rates at 3.50 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 5.50 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs and RPs were also maintained accordingly. The reserve requirement ratios were kept steady as well. The Monetary Board's decision is based on its assessment that the inflation environment remains manageable. Latest baseline forecasts continue to track the lower half of the 3-5 percent target range for 2013 and 2014, while inflation expectations also remain firmly anchored. Risks to the inflation outlook also appear to be evenly balanced around the baseline forecast path. Although global economic activity has stabilized in recent months, uncertainty surrounding the ongoing fiscal consolidation and lingering financial market stresses in advanced economies continue to weigh down on global growth prospects, thus mitigating upward pressures on commodity prices. However, pending domestic power rate adjustments and the strong inflow of capital continues to pose upside risks to the inflation outlook. The Monetary Board also noted the solid growth of the economy which is expected to continue. At the same time, the Monetary Board decided to set the interest rates on the Special Deposit Account (SDA) facility at 3.00 percent regardless of tenor, effective immediately, consistent with the BSP's continuing efforts to fine-tune the operation of its monetary policy tools. Previously, the SDA rate was priced at a premium over the policy rate. The Monetary Board decided to rationalize the BSP's SDA facility consistent with international central banking practice. Amid manageable liquidity growth and a benign inflation outlook, the operational refinement in the SDA facility will help enhance the ability of the BSP to ensure that liquidity remains adequate to meet the requirements of the growing economy. Going forward, the BSP will continue to monitor emerging demand and price developments to ensure that monetary policy settings remain consistent with price stability while being supportive of economic growth. The BSP also stands ready to deploy additional macroprudential measures to address any potential misalignment in asset prices."
South Africa,2013-01-24,"Issued by Gill Marcus. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank. Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) there has been some improvement in global financial market sentiment, but economic growth prospects in a number of the major advanced economies or regions remain constrained. Downside risks to the outlook persist as the structural problems in many countries, and in the Eurozone in particular, are still unresolved. Monetary policy in most countries is likely to remain accommodative in the absence of clear evidence of a sustained recovery, particularly against the backdrop of a relatively benign global inflation environment. Despite a generally positive reaction to the ANC elective conference, ongoing labour conflict, the proposed scaling down of mining operations and ratings agency downgrades are symptomatic of the challenging domestic outlook. In the absence of coherent and consistent structural policy initiatives domestic economic growth is expected to continue to be well below both what is possible and required to make significant inroads into unemployment. In contrast to the situation in most advanced economies, the risks to the inflation outlook remain on the upside, due in large part to continued exchange rate and wage cost pressures. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas was 5,7 per cent in December 2012, up from 5,6 per cent in November. The categories of food and non-alcoholic beverages, housing and utilities, and transport together accounted for 3,5 percentage points of the inflation outcome. Food price inflation moderated from 7,5 per cent in November to 7,0 per cent, mainly as a result of lower meat and grain price increases. Core inflation, as measured by the exclusion of food, petrol and electricity from CPI, which had been unchanged at 4,7 per cent since September, increased to 4,9 per cent in December, mainly as a result of increases in services price inflation, and in line with the Bank's forecast. Administered prices increased by 8,8 per cent, and by 7,6 per cent excluding petrol. Having reached a recent low of 4,2 per cent in September 2012, year-on-year producer price inflation increased to 5,2 per cent in both October and November. This reversal of the previous downward trend was mainly due to price increases in mining and quarrying, agricultural products and manufactured food. Agricultural prices increased at year-on-year rates of 6,3 per cent and 5,9 per cent in October and November respectively, while manufactured food prices increased at rates of 10,9 per cent and 11,1 per cent in these months, respectively. The inflation forecast of the Bank reflects a further deterioration in the inflation outlook for 2013 compared with the previous forecast. The forecasts do not yet incorporate the new CPI weights and rebasing recently announced by Statistics South Africa, but these changes will be incorporated formally into the Bank's next forecast. The impact on the inflation trajectory is likely to be marginal. Having averaged 5,6 per cent in 2012, inflation is now expected to average 5,8 per cent in 2013, and 5,2 per cent in 2014 compared with the previous forecasts of 5,5 per cent and 5,0 per cent for the respective years. Inflation is expected to peak at 6,1 per cent in the third quarter of 2013 and then to moderate gradually to 5,1 per cent in the final two quarters of 2014. This deterioration is largely due to higher expected food price inflation, the lagged effects of the depreciation of the rand and higher expected unit labour costs. The forecast of core inflation is more or less unchanged, indicating the continued absence of significant demand pressures. This measure is expected to peak at 5,0 per cent in the first two quarters of 2013, and to average 4,9 per cent and 4,5 per cent in 2013 and 2014, respectively. Inflation expectations remain anchored at around the upper end of the inflation target range. According to the Survey of Inflation Expectations conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research in the fourth quarter of 2012, inflation is expected to average 6,1 per cent in 2013 and 6,2 per cent in 2014. This represents a marginal increase of 0,1 percentage point for 2013 compared with the previous survey, while the forecast for 2014 is unchanged. Business executives are the most pessimistic about inflation, having raised expected inflation rates to 6,6 per cent and 6,7 per cent in 2013 and 2014, while trade union respondents reduced their forecasts to 6,1 per cent and 6,6 per cent respectively for these years. The forecasts of financial analysts increased marginally but remain within the target range for the forecast period. For the past four quarters expectations for the next 5 years have remained unchanged at 6,2 per cent. The global growth outlook remains challenging, notwithstanding improved sentiment in global financial markets following the interim deal related to the fiscal cliff in the US. The fiscal issues have not been fully resolved, with decisions on expenditure cuts and the debt ceiling delayed till later this year. While the worst-case fiscal scenario has been avoided, the uncertain fiscal outlook is likely to contribute to continued sub-trend US growth. On the positive side, there are continued signs of a recovery in the US housing market and improved corporate profitability. Although sovereign debt risks in the Eurozone have subsided for now and bond spreads on peripheral European debt have narrowed significantly, the region is likely to remain in recession for much of the year, as fiscal tightening and balance sheet repair by banks and households continue. The unemployment rate has now reached 11,8 per cent with youth unemployment at 24 per cent. The outlook for Germany, the main growth driver in the region, has also deteriorated. Growth prospects in the UK remain relatively weak, while the outlook for Japan is uncertain despite the announcement of substantial fiscal and monetary policy stimuli. The outlook for emerging markets, particularly those in Asia, is more positive. The Chinese economy appears to have stabilised following concerns about a possible hard landing, and consensus forecasts suggest some growth acceleration in 2013 in both China and India. Growth in Africa is expected to be sustained at rates in excess of 5 per cent, while Latin American growth is expected to be more restrained, but an improvement on 2012. The rand exchange rate continues to pose an upside risk to the inflation outlook. The exchange rate has been impacted by the widening deficit on the current account of the balance of payments during 2012 and changing global and domestic risk perceptions, particularly relating to the adverse developments in the South African labour market, and the downgrades by the various ratings agencies. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand has been fairly volatile, having appreciated initially from R8,94 to the US dollar, to R8,45 at the end of the year, but subsequently depreciated to current levels of around R9,00. Since the beginning of the year, the rand has depreciated by 6,1 per cent on a trade weighted basis and by about 6,6 per cent against the US dollar. While the rand is expected to remain sensitive to domestic and global developments and continued volatility can be expected, most analysts do not expect significant further sustained depreciation in the coming months. The depreciation of the rand is expected to help moderate the current account imbalance, although platinum export growth may be undermined to some extent by possible shaft closures. However, financing of the deficit may be more challenging despite relatively high domestic nominal bond yields, as sentiment towards South Africa has deteriorated, and non-residents already hold over one-third of the stock of outstanding government bonds. Non-resident net purchases of domestic bonds totalled R88,6 billion during 2012 due in part to South Africa's inclusion in the Citibank World Government Bond Index. However the pace of inflows declined substantially in the final quarter of the year, when net purchases amounted to R10,6 billion. Since the beginning of 2013, net purchases by non-residents have amounted to R4,3 billion. While non-residents were net sellers of equities during 2012 to the value of R3,4 billion, they were net buyers to the value of R7,3 billion in November and December. Year to date, however, the negative trend regarding equities has continued with net sales of R2,3 billion as growth prospects remain weak. Domestic economic growth remains fragile and below potential following an annualised growth rate of 1,2 per cent in the third quarter of 2012, and an estimated growth rate of around 2,5 per cent for the year. A similar outcome is expected in 2013 with growth of 2,6 per cent forecast, revised down from 2,9 per cent in the previous forecast. A more favourable outcome of 3,8 per cent is forecast for 2014, compared with 3,6 per cent previously, driven in part by a more favourable global outlook. However, the risks to these forecasts are assessed to be on the downside, given uncertainties and instability in parts of the mining and agricultural sectors in particular. Constraints to growth are both external and internal. To achieve a higher internally-generated growth rate would require a serious commitment to implementing a range of structural reforms and making the necessary trade-offs as outlined in the National Development Plan. The outlook for parts of the mining sector is bleak, following continued labour disputes and announcements of possible closures of shafts and mines, a consequence of increased cost pressures, weak global demand and prices. Although mining output increased on a month-to-month basis in November, on a three-month-to-three-month basis a contraction of 10,4 per cent was recorded. There are mixed signals pertaining to the outlook for the manufacturing sector. The real volume of manufacturing production increased by 2,3 per cent in November, its highest month-on-month rate in 4 years, due in part to a rebound from widespread strike activity in previous months, and growth in the fourth quarter is estimated to have been relatively robust. However, the Kagiso PMI declined to below the 50 index point level to 47,4 in December, indicating an expectation of some contraction in the sector. The negative business sentiment evident in the confidence indicators is also reflected in the continued weakness in private sector gross fixed capital formation. Recent developments in the mining sector are likely to reinforce this weakness as plans are scaled back. Investment expenditure is likely to remain underpinned by the government and state-owned enterprises. In the third quarter of 2012, gross fixed capital formation grew at an annualised rate of 7,2 per cent, but private sector capital formation, which accounts for just under two thirds of the total, only grew at a rate of 2,8 per cent. Growth in consumption expenditure by households moderated as expected in the third quarter of 2012 when it increased by 2,6 per cent. The main driver of the moderation was the decline in expenditure growth on services and non-durable goods. However there are also signs of moderation in the growth of expenditure on durable and semi-durable goods, and the depreciated exchange rate is likely to sustain this trend. Growth in motor vehicle sales has slowed in recent months, and there was a marked decline in the confidence of new vehicle traders reported by the BER. Despite the higher-than-expected increase in retail trade sales in November, the quarterly rates suggest further moderation in growth. The FNB/BER Consumer Confidence Index declined by 2 index points to -3 index points in the final quarter of 2012. On balance, the MPC does not assess growth in household consumption expenditure to be excessive or to pose significant inflationary risks, and further moderation is possible. Factors that affect the outlook for consumption expenditure, both positively and negatively, include concerns regarding employment, wage settlements, credit extension particularly unsecured lending, and administered price increases which impact on discretionary spending. The upward momentum of banks' total loans and advances to the private sector has continued, with twelve-month growth of 9,9 per cent recorded in November, the highest growth rate since February 2009. Excluding mortgage advances, which remain subdued, the increase in November was 18,3 per cent. Bank credit extension to the household sector increased by 10,4 per cent. General loans to households, which is mainly unsecured lending, while still exhibiting rates of growth in excess of 30 per cent, shows some signs of moderation amid reports that banks are becoming more cautious in extending new loans in this category. Access to new loans may also be constrained by the increased size of outstanding debt. However, despite rising debt levels, household debt to disposable income appears to have stabilised at around 76 per cent. The MPC remains concerned about the potential impact of the higher level of wage settlements on employment and inflation. There are indications that wage increases are trending higher, with growth in nominal remuneration per worker increasing from 7,2 per cent in the second quarter of 2012 to 8,1 per cent in the third quarter. Once productivity increases are accounted for, this translates into unit labour cost increases of 6,1 per cent and 6,7 per cent in these respective quarters. According to Andrew Levy Employment Publications, the overall average wage settlement rate in collective bargaining agreements amounted to 7,4 per cent in the first nine months of 2012. The MPC is mindful of the danger of a possible wage-price spiral and further employment losses should unaffordable real wage demands be granted while economic growth remains constrained. The risk to inflation should this scenario play itself out are significant in the absence of productivity gains. The subdued pace of employment creation in the private sector has been further undermined by the fractious nature of recent wage negotiations and the announcement of further possible restructuring in the mining sector which would involve the closure or mothballing of mines or shafts. According to the Quarterly Employment Statistics survey of Statistics South Africa, non-agricultural formal sector employment grew by 1,0 per cent or 82,000 employees in the year to September 2012. Almost two thirds of this increase was accounted for by the public sector, while net job losses over this period were experienced in the manufacturing and construction sectors, with employment in the mining sector unchanged. However, in the third quarter of 2012, 15,000 jobs were shed in the mining sector and there are fears that this trend could continue. Employment in the agricultural sector, which is not covered by the survey, is also at risk. Food prices continue to pose a significant near-term risk to the inflation outlook, although there are signs that these price pressures may moderate during the year as a result of favourable base effects, as well as the recent moderation in global and domestic wheat and maize prices. The price of these commodities will also be influenced by developments in the exchange rate of the rand and unpredictable weather patterns. Administered prices remain on average well in excess of the upper end of the target range, and there is as yet no clarity about the new Eskom tariffs to be implemented later this year. At this stage a 16 per cent tariff increase is assumed in the forecast. International oil prices have remained relatively stable for the past few months and are more or less unchanged from the previous meeting of the MPC. Futures prices reflect an expectation of some moderation in coming months, but some volatility can be expected. The domestic price of petrol, which is also impacted by the exchange rate, declined by a cumulative 34 cents per litre since early November, but much of this decline is likely to be reversed in February. The MPC continues to assess the balance of risks to the inflation outlook to be on the upside. While the risks to the forecast emanating from food prices may have diminished somewhat, particularly over the medium term, the exchange rate and wage settlements remain the key upside risk factors. While the reweighting and rebasing of the CPI is still to be finalised, the impact is likely to be marginal, but on the upside. Core inflation trends indicate that demand pressures are relatively contained, and household consumption expenditure has continued to moderate. Risks to economic growth are assessed to be on the downside, particularly given the uncertain outlook for the mining industry and ongoing unsettled labour relations. The negative output gap is therefore expected to persist. The MPC remains concerned about the possibility of a wage-price spiral and its potential to exacerbate the high level of unemployment in the economy. As we noted in the previous MPC statement, concerted action is needed on the part of all the parties involved. We need cohesion of policy and decision making to provide the necessary certainty for sustainable economic growth and development. The monetary policy stance remains accommodative and appropriate, with the real policy rate remaining slightly negative, notwithstanding the expected temporary breach of the inflation target. However, further accommodation at this stage is constrained by the upside risks to the inflation outlook. The MPC has therefore decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 5,0 per cent per annum. As always, the MPC will monitor developments closely and will not hesitate to act in a manner consistent with its mandate."
Mongolia,2013-01-25,"THE BANK OF MONGOLIA MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Cutting the policy rate by 0.75 percentage point Number: 2013/01 Effective date: 25 January 2013 On 25 January 2013, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut the policy rate by 0.75 percentage point to 12.5 percent. Expectations of the inflation outlook consistent with its target, and expected decreases in the demand-pull inflationary pressure and supply-driven inflation have enabled to reduce the policy rate. The MPC anticipates that cutting the policy rate shall provide stable monetary and credit growth, ensure smooth functioning of financial system, and promote economic activity. Although, macroeconomic outlook enables policy rate reduction, the MPC acknowledges cautious easing of monetary policy, considering uncertainties in foreign trade and foreign investment environment. Concise minutes of the MPC meeting will be released in two weeks on the Bank of Mongolia's website. MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE."
Hungary,2013-01-29,"At its meeting on 29 January 2013, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by 25 basis points from 5.75% to 5.50%, with effect from 30 January 2013. In the Monetary Council's judgement, economic growth is likely to resume this year following last year's recession. The level of output will be below its potential and unemployment will remain above its long-term level determined by structural factors. The Council expects weak demand conditions to persist, which will ensure that inflation returns to rates close to the 3% inflation target as the impact of temporary shocks wanes. Inflation slowed in December, with declines in the prices of durable goods, processed foods and fuels being the major contributing factors. The moderate pace of underlying inflation reflects the disinflationary impact of weak domestic demand. There has recently been a significant improvement in the short-term outlook for inflation, due mainly to the government measures affecting the prices of non-core items. However, if companies pass on higher production costs into prices in response to the government measures, it may pose an upside risk to the medium-term outlook for inflation. The Monetary Council will therefore continue to monitor closely developments in underlying inflation. Hungarian economic growth is likely to resume following last year's recession as the country's export markets recover; however, both external and domestic demand factors point to only modest growth over the period ahead. The Council judges that there remains a degree of spare capacity in the economy, output continues to be significantly below its potential level and the labour market remains loose. At the same time, the weakness in investment and persistently high unemployment suggest that the potential growth rate of the economy is significantly below its pre-crisis level. The improvement in global risk appetite has continued over the past month, but the contrast between buoyant sentiment in international financial markets and the subdued outlook for global growth continues to pose a risk. Meanwhile, domestic risk premia have not moved significantly in either direction. In the Council's judgement, it remains crucial that an agreement between the Government and the European Union and International Monetary Fund is reached, as this would contribute to further falls in risk premia and yields, which in turn would contribute to the sustainability of government debt and would help support lending activity and enhance the predictability of the investment environment. The Monetary Council emphasises that the monetary policy instruments currently available allow enough room for manoeuvre to maintain a monetary policy stance consistent with the current outlook for inflation and the real economy, and that under domestic circumstances expanding the range of unconventional policy tools may provide effective support only during times of acute financial market stress. The Council judges that there remains a substantial margin of spare capacity in the economy. Once the effects of last year's cost shocks wane, the disinflationary impact of weak demand conditions is expected to dominate, therefore companies will have limited ability to pass on higher production costs into prices. The inflation target can be met on the horizon relevant for monetary policy. The improved global financial market environment and the Government's commitment to maintaining a low fiscal deficit path may contribute to a sustained decline in risk premia on domestic assets. These factors warranted and allowed a further cautious easing of monetary conditions. The Council will only consider a further reduction in the policy rate if the medium-term outlook for inflation remains consistent with the Bank's 3% target and the improvement in financial market sentiment is sustained. The Council's assessment of performance in meeting the inflation target in 2012. Average annual inflation was 5.7% in 2012, with the twelve-month change in consumer prices not falling below 5% in any month of the year. The MNB's monetary policy has its impact on inflation with a lag of several months, which should be taken into account when assessing performance in meeting the inflation target. Accordingly, deviations of the consumer price index from the 3% inflation target of at most ±1 percentage point are acceptable, ex post, in terms of price stability. Taking account of these factors, the inflation target was not met in 2012. Significantly above target inflation in 2012 mainly reflected the effects of increases in indirect taxes and rises in the prices of non-core items. The pace of underlying inflation was more moderate but slightly higher than in the period 20102011. This may suggest that companies' spare production capacity was partly reduced, and as a result the disinflationary impact of weak domestic demand became smaller in 2012. The indirect tax increases at the start of 2012 allowed coordinated price hikes, with companies presumably bringing forward other price increases as well. This may have been reflected in the sharp rise in services inflation at the beginning of the year, which, however, slowed gradually during the course of the year. Developments in tradables inflation show a similar pattern, where the depreciation of the forint in the second half of 2011 also contributed to the higher indices at the beginning of the year, in addition to the coordinated price increases. Food prices, susceptible to cost shocks, were raised significantly by unfavourable weather conditions last year. However, the slow pass-through of cost shocks into processed food prices suggests that weakening consumer demand may restrain companies' intentions to raise prices in the food market as well. To summarise, government measures resulted in a significant increase in the consumer price index in 2012. The increases in VAT and excise duties at the start of the year, followed by the increase in the telecommunications tax in the middle of the year and another increase in excuse taxes directly raised consumer prices. In addition to the tax increases directly affecting prices, fiscal policy contributed indirectly to rising inflation. In the weak economic environment, the administrative wage increases raised unit labour costs sharply, which in turn put upward pressure on inflation from the cost side. However, as in 2011, developments in administered prices were moderate in 2012, exerting downward pressure on inflation."
India,2013-01-29,"Third Quarter Review of Monetary Policy 2012-13 - Statement by Dr.D. Subbarao. Governor. Reserve Bank of India ""First of all, on behalf of the Reserve Bank, a warm welcome to you all to this Third Quarter Review of Monetary Policy for 2012-13. Earlier this morning, we put out the Policy Review document. Based on an assessment of the current macroeconomic situation, we have decided to reduce the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 25 basis points from 8.0 per cent to 7.75 per cent. Consequent to this, the reverse repo rate under the LAF, determined with a spread of 100 basis points below the repo rate, gets calibrated to 6.75 per cent. Similarly, the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate, determined with a spread of 100 basis points above the repo rate, and also the Bank Rate stand adjusted to 8.75 per cent. These changes have since come into effect immediately after the announcement. We have also decided to reduce the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks by 25 basis points from 4.25 per cent to 4.0 per cent of their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) effective the fortnight beginning February 9, 2013. This reduction in the CRR will inject primary liquidity of around 180 billion into the banking system. Considerations Behind the Policy Move 7. Today's decision to further ease the monetary policy stance was informed by three considerations. First, both headline wholesale price inflation and its core component, non-food manufactured products inflation, have softened through the third quarter. This provided some relief from the persistence that dominated the first half of the year. Several indicators such as the weaker pricing power of corporates, excess capacity in some sectors, the possibility of international commodity prices stabilising as well as inflation momentum measures suggest that inflationary pressures have peaked. However, further moderation in inflation going into the next fiscal year is likely to be muted as the correction of under-pricing of administered items is still incomplete and food inflation remains elevated. Accordingly, the setting of monetary policy has to remain sensitive to these conflicting pressures and attendant risks.2 9. Second, growth has decelerated significantly below trend through the last fiscal year and through this year so far, and overall economic activity remains subdued. On the demand side, investment activity has been way below desired levels and consumption demand too has started to decelerate. External demand has also weakened due to languid global growth. On the supply side, constraints in the availability of key raw materials and intermediates are becoming binding. While the series of policy measures announced by the Government has boosted market sentiment, the investment outlook is still lacklustre, especially in terms of demand for new projects. The third consideration that informed our decision is that liquidity conditions have remained tight. Although the Reserve Bank lowered the cash reserve ratio. CRR, successively in September and October 2012, and carried out open market operations (OMO) injecting systemic liquidity of 470 billion during December and January to augment liquidity, the average net LAF borrowings at 910 billion in January have been above the Reserve Bank's comfort level. This tightness could potentially hurt credit flow to productive sectors of the economy. The structural deficit in the system provided a strong case for injecting permanent primary liquidity into the system. Monetary Policy Stance 11. The policy document also spells out the three broad contours of our monetary policy stance. These are: first, to provide an appropriate interest rate environment to support growth as inflation risks moderate; second, to contain inflation and anchor inflation expectations; and third, to continue to manage liquidity to ensure adequate flow of credit to the productive sectors of the economy. Guidance 12. As has become standard practice by now, we have also given the following guidance for the period forward: 13. With headline inflation likely to have peaked and non-food manufactured products inflation declining steadily over the last few months, there is an increasing likelihood that going into 2013-14, inflation will remain range-bound around the current levels. This provides space, albeit limited, for monetary policy to give greater emphasis to growth risks. This policy guidance will, however, be conditioned by the evolving growth-inflation dynamic and the management of risks from the twin deficits. Expected Outcomes 14. We expect that today's policy actions, and the guidance that we have given, will result in the following three outcomes: first, investment will be encouraged, thereby supporting growth; second, medium-term inflation expectations will remain anchored on the basis of a credible commitment to low and stable inflation;3 and, finally, there will be an improvement in liquidity conditions to support credit flow. Global and Domestic Developments 15. Our policy decisions have been based on a detailed assessment of the global and domestic macroeconomic situation. Let me comment first on the global outlook. Global Economy 16. Since the Reserve Bank's last quarterly Policy Review in October 2012, headwinds holding back the global economy have begun to abate gradually, although sluggish conditions prevail. In the US, activity gathered momentum in the third quarter of 2012 but this is unlikely to have been sustained in the fourth quarter. While a political consensus to avert the ‘fiscal cliff' has calmed financial markets, how the debt ceiling is managed will be crucial in shaping the market sentiment on the way forward. The euro area economy is threatened by continuing contraction, notwithstanding the liquidity firewall of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the EU's commitment to act collectively to backstop the union. Overall, however, apprehensions that the sovereign debt crisis will disrupt the global financial system have ebbed. A pick-up in the pace of growth of China is likely. But growth in other emerging and developing economies has slowed owing to a combination of a slump in external demand and domestic structural bottlenecks. Furthermore, inflationary pressures persist in some of them. Overall, global economic prospects have improved modestly since the Reserve Bank's last review in October 2012 even as significant risks remain. Indian Economy 18. Moving on to the domestic economy. GDP growth slowed significantly this year, dropping to 5.5 per cent in the first quarter, and dropping even further to 5.3 per cent in the second quarter. The decline in the GDP growth rate became more broad based, with consumption demand also slowing alongside stalling investment and declining exports. In July 2012, the Reserve Bank projected GDP growth for the current year, 2012-13, of 6.5 per cent. In the October Review, we revised this downwards to 5.8 per cent, signalling increasing global risks as well as accentuated domestic risks. As part of this review, we revisited this growth projection taking into account developments over the last three months. During this period, industrial activity has remained subdued. Sluggish external demand continues to inhibit improvement in services. While the coverage of rabi sowing has picked up, severe winter in certain parts of the country could affect crop prospects. New investment demand, which should be the key driver of an upturn, continues to be weak. While the series of recent policy initiatives by the Government has boosted market sentiment, it will take some time to reverse the investment slowdown and reinvigorate growth. Accordingly, we have revised downwards our baseline projection of GDP growth for the current year from 5.8 per cent to 5.5 per cent.4 Inflation 21. Let me now turn to inflation. Headline WPI inflation eased significantly from 8.1 per cent in September 2012 to 7.2 per cent by December. Notably, inflation on account of non-food manufactured products, which have a weight of 55 per cent in the WPI, fell sharply in November-December as input price pressures eased. The momentum indicators too suggest a moderation in headline as well as non-food manufactured products inflation. The Reserve Bank's industrial outlook survey also points to a softening of the rate of increase of output prices, suggesting that the pricing power of corporates has weakened. Fuel group inflation moderated in December, mainly reflecting the tempering of inflation of non-administered petroleum products as well as the range-bound exchange rate of the rupee. Food inflation, on the other hand, showed a contrarian behaviour, moving into double digits in December, reflecting both cyclical and structural factors. In contrast to WPI inflation. CPI inflation as measured by the new consumer price index, rose to 10.6 per cent in December, largely reflecting the surge in food inflation. Excluding food and fuel groups. CPI inflation remained unchanged at 8.4 per cent during the third quarter. In the October Review, the Reserve Bank made a baseline projection of inflation for March 2013 of 7.5 per cent. An environment of slower growth and excess capacity in some sectors suggests that inflation has come off its peak. However, it is expected to be range-bound around the current levels due to persisting food inflation, the pass-through of diesel price adjustments over the next several months and the possibility of adjustment in other administered prices. If international commodity prices, including the price of crude, further decline, they should cushion the phased increase in diesel prices, to the extent they are not offset by exchange rate movements. A sustained reduction in inflation pressure is, however, contingent upon alleviation of supply constraints and progress on fiscal consolidation. This will also help mitigate the cost-push pressures stemming from the surge in wages. Keeping in view the expected moderation in non-food manufactured products inflation, domestic supply-demand balances and global trends in commodity prices, we revised downwards the baseline WPI inflation projection for March 2013 from 7.5 per cent to 6.8 per cent. Monetary and Liquidity Conditions 26. Let me now turn to monetary and liquidity conditions. Money supply remained below the indicative trajectory of the Reserve Bank. This essentially reflected the deceleration of growth in aggregate deposits and moderation in economic activity. On the other hand, the overall non-food credit growth was around the indicative trajectory. However, bank credit to industry showed a significant deceleration while credit to agriculture registered an increase. Keeping in view the seasonal pattern for the last quarter. M growth projection 3 for the current year has been scaled down to 13.0 per cent while non-food credit growth projection is retained at 16.0 per cent.5 28. Liquidity conditions tightened from the second week of November on account of a build-up in the Centre's cash balances, festival-related lumpy increase in currency demand, and structural pressures brought on by the widening wedge between deposit growth and credit growth. Anticipating liquidity pressures, the Reserve Bank lowered the CRR and conducted open market operations. Despite these measures, the liquidity deficit in the system remained above the Reserve Bank's comfort level. Risk Factors 29. Macroeconomic management going forward is subject to a number of risks. Let me briefly address them. First, the widening of the current account deficit (CAD) to historically high levels, especially in the context of a large fiscal deficit and slowing growth, exposes the economy to the twin deficit risk. Financing the CAD with increasingly risky and volatile flows increases the economy's vulnerability to sudden shifts in risk appetite and liquidity preference, potentially threatening macroeconomic and exchange rate stability. Large fiscal deficits will accentuate the CAD risk, further crowd out private investment and stunt growth impulses. Second, despite the recent calm, global risks remain elevated, with the potential for spillover into the Indian economy through trade, finance and confidence channels. In the US, the risk of political inaction to manage the debt ceiling or even a sudden onset of fiscal austerity can lead to a turmoil in financial markets, followed by a downturn in economic activity. Escalation of the euro area sovereign debt stress in view of the continuing absence of credible and comprehensive policy responses remains a contingent global risk. Risks also stem from geopolitical tensions that can adversely impact supplies and prices of key commodities, particularly of crude oil. Furthermore, these forces can potentially increase global risk aversion with implications for financing of our CAD. Third, inflation over the last three years has been a result of demand pressures as well as supply constraints. With demand pressures now on the ebb, the supply constraints need to be urgently addressed. In the absence of an effective supply response, inflationary pressures may return and persist with adverse implications for macroeconomic stability. Fourth, the key to stimulating growth is a vigorous and sustained revival in investment. Achieving this will, however, depend on a number of factors such as bridging the infrastructure gaps, and resolute pursuit of structural and governance reforms. Finally, risk aversion in the banking system stemming from concerns relating to growing non-performing assets (NPAs) is constraining credit flow. Notwithstanding the importance of repairing asset quality, banks should be discerning in their loan decisions and ensure adequate credit flow to productive sectors of the economy. Let me conclude by summarising our macroeconomic concerns. Inflation has come off from its peak, but its further downward movement is going to be slow and gradual. On the other hand, economic activity has slowed, trailing well below its potential and opening up a negative output gap. What the economy needs most of all and most urgently is new investment. This will step up currently flagging aggregate6 demand and also ease the supply constraints so that existing capacity is fully utilised and new capacity is built up. A strong and effective supply response is particularly important for bridging the infrastructure gaps and correcting structural imbalances in other segments of the economy, including key food articles. Critical to this effort are a credible and comprehensive fiscal adjustment by the Government, implementation of structural reforms, hastening the approval process, and improving governance to inspire the trust and confidence of potential investors. The Reserve Bank, on its part, will have to calibrate monetary policy to the evolving growth-inflation dynamic and the management of the twin deficits risks. Thank you for your attention"".

United States,2013-01-30,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December suggests that growth in economic activity paused in recent months, in large part because of weather-related disruptions and other transitory factors. Employment has continued to expand at a moderate pace but the unemployment rate remains elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector has shown further improvement. Inflation has been running somewhat below the Committee's longer-run objective, apart from temporary variations that largely reflect fluctuations in energy prices. Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will proceed at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. Although strains in global financial markets have eased somewhat, the Committee continues to see downside risks to the economic outlook. The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely will run at or below its 2 percent objective. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee will continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months. If the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially, the Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until such improvement is achieved in a context of price stability. In determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, the Committee will, as always, take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens. In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; James Bullard; Elizabeth A Duke; Charles L Evans; Jerome H Powell; Sarah Bloom Raskin; Eric S Rosengren; Jeremy C Stein; Daniel K Tarullo; and Janet L Yellen. Voting against the action was Esther L George, who was concerned that the continued high level of monetary accommodation increased the risks of future economic and financial imbalances and, over time, could cause an increase in long-term inflation expectations."
Egypt,2013-01-31,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release January 31, 2013 In its meeting held on January 31, 2013, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 925 percent and 1025 percent, respectively, and the 7‐day repo at 975 percen. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 95 percen. Headline CPI increased by 015 percent (m/m) in December following a decline of 131 percent (m/m) in November, bringing the annual rate to 466 percent from 425 percent in the previous mont. The latest monthly developments in headline inflation were largely driven by lower prices of vegetables which were partially offset by regulated price adjustments related to electricit. On the other hand, core CPI increased by 044 percent (m/m) in December following a decline of 025 percent (m/m) in November on the back of sporadic movements in food prices as well as moderate inch ups in some non‐food price. This led the annual rate to inch up to 444 percent in December from 420 percent recorded in Novembe. While the probability of a rebound in international food prices is less likely in light of recent global developments, the re‐emergence of local supply bottlenecks and distortions in the distribution channels, in addition to the recent exchange rate movements, pose upside risks to the inflation outloo. Meanwhile real GDP grew by 26 percent in 2012/2013 Q1, following a similarly feeble growth rate of 22 percent in 2011/201. This nascent recovery in economic activity came on the back of tentative signs of recovery in the construction secto. Nonetheless GDP growth remains to be partly suppressed by continuing weaknesses, albeit of lesser extent, in the manufacturing and tourism sector. In the meantime, given the heightened uncertainty that faced market participants since early 2011, investment levels remained lo. Looking ahead, the current political transformation may continue to have ramifications on both consumption as well as investment decisions, adversely weighing on key sectors within the econom. Moreover downside risks continue to surround the global recovery on the back of challenges facing the Euro Are. These factors, combined, pose downside risks to domestic GDP going forwar. While the slowdown in economic growth has been limiting upside risks to the inflation outlook, there are possible upward pressures on inflation going forwar. Given the mixed balance of risks surrounding the inflation and GDP outlooks and the uncertainty at this juncture, the MPC judges that the current key CBE rates are appropriat. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium‐ter. Dr Rania Al‐Mashat Sub Governor.

Malaysia,2013-01-31,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.00 percent. The global economic activity is showing signs of improvement, albeit at an uneven pace. Growth in the major advanced economies remains constrained by ongoing fiscal consolidation and weak labour market conditions. In Asia, growth is supported by sustained domestic demand and a gradual recovery in external demand. Stress in the international financial markets has also receded. Notwithstanding these improvements, downside risks to the prospects for global growth still remain. In the domestic economy, a broad set of indicators suggests robust expansion in the fourth quarter of 2012. Growth was driven by sustained domestic consumption and investment activity with some improvements in the external sector. Looking ahead, domestic demand is expected to continue to expand, underpinned by firm private sector activity. Private consumption will be supported by income growth and stable employment conditions while investment will be led by capital spending in the domestic-oriented sectors, the oil and gas industry and the on-going implementation of infrastructure projects. The external sector is also expected to gradually improve and provide additional support to the economy. Domestic headline inflation averaged 1.6% in 2012. In 2013, inflation is expected to be higher but to remain modest. Selected global food prices and domestic factors are expected to increase costs and contribute to higher prices. Nevertheless, given modest global growth prospects, pressures from global commodity prices is expected to be contained. The MPC considers the current stance of monetary policy to be supportive of the economy while inflation remains contained. In addition to domestic conditions, the MPC will continue to carefully assess the global economic and financial developments and their implications on the overall outlook for inflation and growth of the Malaysian economy.

Romania,2013-02-05,"The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which will be released to the public in a press conference on 7 February 2013. The annual inflation rate picked up to reach 4.95 percent in December 2012, remaining outside the variation band around the target and above the December 2011 reading of 3.14 percent. The annual inflation rate at end-2012 was marginally below the latest NBR projection of 5.1 percent. However, the average annual inflation rate kept falling to a 23-year low of 3.33 percent. The annual adjusted CORE21 inflation rate remained at 3.3 percent in December 2012 for the third consecutive month. The path of the annual inflation rate in 2012 H2 shows the adverse impact of supply-side factors  beyond the scope of monetary policy , largely the higher domestic and global food prices and administered price adjustments, against the background of sharper exchange rate volatility. The magnitude of the adverse impact on inflation coming from these factors was however partially moderated by the persistence of a significant negative output gap. The statistical data suggest a near stalemate in economic activity in 2012 from the previous year amid a drought-induced drop in agricultural production and protracted euro area recession, which hurt Romania's net exports and industrial output. Monetary developments also pinpoint the real annual dynamics of loans to the private sector remaining in negative territory, similarly to credit developments in the euro area and the other countries in the region. The prudent monetary policy stance throughout 2012 was aimed at anchoring inflation expectations via a steady dosage of the instruments available to the central bank and strengthening the prospects for the annual inflation rate to remain close to the medium-term target. This, along with an improved investor perception on emerging economies, including on the local economy and financial market, amid the ongoing fiscal consolidation and the fading tensions associated with the electoral context, had a favourable bearing on the recent exchange rate developments. The improved investor sentiment coupled with the shift to adequate liquidity management in the banking system caused money market rates and yields on government securities to decline and gradually near the monetary policy rate, thus strengthening the policy rate transmission. In today's meeting, the NBR Board examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, a document that assesses developments in the macroeconomic environment, sets forth the inflation outlook, and identifies the main challenges and risks to monetary policy in the period ahead. According to the updated forecast, the annual inflation rate will reach again the upper bound of the target band by the end of the year following a short-lived pick-up in consumer price growth in 2013 H1, mainly as a result of larger administered price adjustments. In line with the Report, risks and uncertainties surrounding the external developments, especially those associated with capital flow volatility, still remain, along with the domestic risks related to the persistence of some structural rigidities across the Romanian economy, to the wage-productivity relationship, as well as to the dynamics of volatile and administered prices. Against this background, with a view to effectively anchoring inflation expectations, the NBR Board decided to keep the monetary policy rate unchanged at 5.25 percent per annum, to ensure adequate liquidity management in the banking system and to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The decisions are aimed to ensure the resumption and the subsequent consolidation of disinflation, thus creating the necessary prerequisites for a gradual recovery of lending to the Romanian private sector and sustainable economic growth in the new European and global context. An optimal dosage of the instruments available to the central bank, along with the implementation of a consistent macroeconomic policy mix and structural reforms, pursuant to the commitments assumed under the arrangements with international institutions, is essential to achieve price and financial stability in the medium term and thus support the nominal and real convergence. The NBR Board reaffirms that it will closely monitor domestic and global economic developments so as, by adjusting its available instruments accordingly, to ensure price stability over the medium term, as well as financial stability. The quarterly Inflation Report will be released to the public in a press conference on 7 February 2013, along with a 12-month calendar of NBR Board meetings dedicated to monetary policy issues. 1 Calculated by excluding administered prices, volatile prices, and tobacco and alcohol prices from the consumer price index.

Czech Republic,2013-02-06,"Press conference of the CNB Bank Board 1st Situation Report on Economic and Monetary Developments 6 February 2013 The monetary policy decision taken and the ratio of the votes cast At the close of the meeting the Board decided unanimously to leave the two-week repo rate unchanged at 0.05%. Reasons for the decision Headline inflation will be close to the 2% target this year. In early 2014, after the effects of the increase in both VAT rates of 1 p.p. drop out, headline inflation will fall slightly below the target. Monetary-policy relevant inflation will be in the lower half of the tolerance band over the entire outlook. Consistent with the forecast is a slight decline in market interest rates, followed by a rise in rates as from mid-2014. The message of the forecast baseline scenario Tax changes, food price growth and gradually fading import price growth are the sources of currently observed inflation. Headline inflation will be close to the CNB's 2% target this year despite the increase in both VAT rates of 1 p.p. Monetary-policy relevant inflation will be in the lower half of the tolerance band around the target over the whole forecast horizon. This year. GDP will drop by 0.3% amid markedly restrictive domestic fiscal policy and only gradual recovery in external demand.

Poland,2013-02-06,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 6 February 2013 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 5-6 February 2013 The Council decided to decrease the NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage points:  reference rate to 3.75% on an annual basis;  lombard rate to 5.25% on an annual basis;  deposit rate to 2.25% on an annual basis;  rediscount rate to 4.00% on an annual basis. Incoming data show that global economic activity remains low. In 2012 Q4, economic growth in the United States declined, while the euro area most probably remained in recession. At the same time, recently some business indicators for developed countries have slightly improved. There are also signs that in some major emerging economies economic growth accelerated somewhat. Weak global economic activity is conducive to a decline in inflation in many countries. In Poland, incoming data, including GDP data for 2012, show that  as expected  2012 Q4 saw a further economic slowdown. The decrease in consumer demand was accompanied by a smaller decline in investment. Economic growth continued to be supported by a positive  albeit lower than in the previous quarter  contribution of net exports. The economic slowdown is also confirmed by data from the labour market. In December, employment in the corporate sector still decreased, and wage growth remained low. At the same time, the unemployment rate rose again. Over the last months, both household and corporate lending growth continued to weaken. In December. CPI inflation declined to 2.4% y/y, running at the level consistent with the NBP inflation target of 2.5%. At the same time, both core inflation measures and producer price growth continued to decrease, which confirms further weakening of demand and cost pressures in the economy. Declining inflation was accompanied by lower inflation expectations of households. In the opinion of the Council, the incoming data confirm a considerable economic slowdown in Poland, which results in limited wage and inflationary pressures. At the same time, the Council assesses that GDP growth will remain moderate in the coming quarters, and therefore, the risk of inflation running below the NBP inflation target in the medium term persists. Therefore, the Council decided to lower the NBP interest rates further. The decrease in interest rates should support economic activity and reduces the risk of inflation remaining below the target in the medium term. 00-919 Warszawa, ul.

Euroarea,2013-02-07,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. HICP inflation rates have declined further, as anticipated, and are expected to fall below 2% in the coming months. Over the policy-relevant horizon, inflationary pressures should remain contained. The underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be subdued. Medium to longer-term inflation expectations for the euro area remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. Overall, this allows our monetary policy stance to remain accommodative. The economic weakness in the euro area is expected to prevail in the early part of 2013. In particular, necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors will continue to weigh on economic activity. Later in 2013 economic activity should gradually recover, supported by our accommodative monetary policy stance, the improvement in financial market confidence and reduced fragmentation, as well as a strengthening of global demand. In order to sustain confidence, it is essential for governments to reduce further both fiscal and structural imbalances and to proceed with financial sector restructuring. With regard to the liquidity situation of banks, counterparties have so far repaid €140.6 billion of the €489.2 billion obtained in the first of the two three-year longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) settled in December 2011 and March 2012. Repayments are provided for in the modalities of the three-year LTROs and are at the discretion of the counterparties, who must appropriately assess their funding situation, their ability to provide new loans to the economy and their resilience to shocks. We will closely monitor conditions in the money market and their potential impact on the stance of monetary policy, which will remain accommodative with the full allotment mode of liquidity provision. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Euro area real GDP declined by 0.1%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2012, following a contraction of 0.2% in the second quarter. Available data continue to signal further weakness in activity in the fourth quarter and at the beginning of 2013. This weakness reflects the adverse impact of low consumer and investor sentiment on domestic expenditure, as well as subdued foreign demand. However, financial market sentiment has improved and the latest survey indicators confirm earlier evidence of a stabilisation in business and consumer confidence, albeit at low levels. Later in 2013 a gradual recovery should start, with domestic demand being supported by our accommodative monetary policy stance, the improvement in financial market confidence and reduced fragmentation, and export growth benefiting from a strengthening of global demand. The risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside. They relate to the possibility of weaker than expected domestic demand and exports, slow implementation of structural reforms in the euro area, as well as geopolitical issues and imbalances in major industrialised countries which could both have an impact on developments in global commodities and financial markets. These factors have the potential to dampen the ongoing improvement in confidence and thereby delay the recovery. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 2.0% in January 2013, down from 2.2% in November and December and from 2.5% in October. On the basis of current futures prices for oil, inflation rates are expected to decline further to below 2% in the coming months. Over the policy-relevant horizon, in an environment of weak economic activity in the euro area and well-anchored long-term inflation expectations, underlying price pressures should remain contained. Risks to the outlook for price developments continue to be seen as broadly balanced over the medium term, with upside risks relating to higher administered prices and indirect taxes, as well as higher oil prices, and downside risks stemming from weaker economic activity and, more recently, the appreciation of the euro exchange rate. Turning to the monetary analysis, the underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be subdued. The annual growth rate of M3 decreased to 3.3% in December 2012, from 3.8% in November. Shifts from overnight deposits to short-term time deposits led to a decrease in the annual rate of growth of M1, which declined to 6.2% in December, from 6.7% in November, and outflows from marketable instruments dampened overall M3 growth. A further strengthening in the deposit base of MFIs in a number of stressed countries took place in December, in combination with further capital inflows into the euro area, both of which continued to reduce fragmentation. The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) remained negative in December. This mainly reflected ongoing negative annual growth of loans to non-financial corporations, which was -1.3% in December after -1.5% in November. However, annual growth in MFI loans to households remained broadly unchanged at 0.7% in December. To a large extent, subdued loan dynamics reflect the current stage of the business cycle, heightened credit risk and the ongoing adjustment in the balance sheets of the financial and non-financial sectors. In line with these developments, the bank lending survey for the fourth quarter of 2012 confirms the weakness in credit demand and the continued effect of credit risk considerations on the tightening of credit standards. At the same time, the survey confirms the positive impact of Eurosystem measures on banks' overall funding and liquidity situation. In particular, banks reported improvements across all funding categories in the fourth quarter. In order to ensure adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions in euro area countries, it is essential to continue strengthening the resilience of banks where needed. Decisive steps for establishing an integrated financial framework will help to accomplish this objective. The future single supervisory mechanism (SSM) is one of the main building blocks. It is a crucial move towards re-integrating the banking system. To sum up, the economic analysis indicates that price developments should remain in line with price stability over the medium term. A cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. As regards other policy areas, structural reforms and fiscal adjustment can complement each other, thereby improving the outlook for job creation, economic growth and debt sustainability. Past policy action is bearing fruit, in terms of both the unwinding of existing fiscal imbalances and the reduction of current account deficits. In particular, in several countries with particular adjustment needs, contained growth in unit labour costs signals greater price competitiveness and exports are performing better. Governments should build on the progress achieved in fiscal consolidation, strengthen competition in product markets and continue with labour market reforms. This would boost the euro area's growth potential, reduce high structural unemployment and improve the adjustment capacities of the euro area countries."
Israel,2013-02-11,"Currency (Unit) Rate Daily Change. Nominal Effective Rate -0.124%. This press release as a Word file. The Bank of Israel's Monetary Committee resolved, under the authority itis granted by the Bank of Israel Law, 5770-2010, that it will not make decisions on the interest rate around the Passover and Tabernacles (Sukkot) holidays. This is because in the weeks prior to the scheduled dates of these decisions, data are received with a lag due to the Passover holiday (which generally falls out in March-April) and New Year holiday season (which falls out around September-October); data received thenare irregular and activity levels are low due to the holidays. ; In 2013, decisions on the interest rate will not be made at the end of April andat the end of September. Thus, the Bank of Israel interest rate set at theend of March 2013 will be in effect for April and May 2013, and the interest rate set at the end of August 2013 will be in effect for September and October 2013. ; The weekly meetings of the Monetary Committee will continue even during months in which interest rate decisions are not reached. Furthermore, the Monetary Committee maintains the authorization, set in law, to change the interest rate in the intermeeting periods, should it deem it necessary. ;Summary of the Monetary Commitee discussion and decisions on January 28,2013 regarding interest rate decisions. ;.

Georgia,2013-02-13,"13.02.13 NBG Reduces Its Policy Rate by 50 basis points to 4.75% The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on February 13, 2013 and decided to reduce the refinancing rate by 50 basis points to 4.75 percent. According to existing information the inflation forecasts for the coming 4-6 quarters have gone further down since the previous meeting of the MPC. According to the current forecasts it is expected that the headline CPI inflation will remain below its target value throughout this year and will approach it in the second half of 2014. Both core and headline inflation values in January were low, with the headline annual inflation reaching -1.6%. Negative values of inflation were mainly caused by the decrease in food prices. An important one-time factor was also the reduction in regulated prices (electric power and garbage collection services). The preliminary economic activity indicators in the fourth quarter point at the weakening in economic growth, pushing price level downwards. The NBG forecast of the economic growth rate in 2013 has not changed at the moment, and will be revised based on the data for the first quarter of 2013. In the past year the slowdown in the aggregate demand was caused both by external and domestic factors. Credit activity in the country still remains weak, due to low demand for loans. Drop in European growth rates has been reflected in the low growth of remittances during the past year. Another indication of weakening demand is the decrease in export and import growth rates in the fourth quarter of 2012. Given that the inflation is predicted to remain below the target in the medium term, the National Bank of Georgia decided to continue monetary easing and to reduce the Monetary Policy Rate. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on March 27, 2012."
Chile,2013-02-14,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 14 February 2013 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 5% (annual). Internationally, financial conditions are stable, after the improvement experienced in recent months. However, the fiscal and financial situation in the Eurozone is still fragile. Weak growth continues in developed economies, while more favorable signs are observed coming from China. World prices of fuels and metals—including copper—increased in the recent weeks. Domestically, recent output and demand indicators exceeded forecasts in the last Monetary Policy Report. The labor market is still tight. Headline and core inflation are below 2% y-o-y, while inflationary expectations in the policy horizon remain aligned with the target. The peso has appreciated. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. * The Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2013-02-14,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.75% for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.75% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information, the Committee considers the moderate economic recovery in the US to have continued but economic activities in the euro area to have been unable to shake off their sluggishness, while economic indicators in emerging market countries have displayed continued trends of improvement. The Committee expects the global economy to exhibit a modest recovery going forward, but judges that the uncertainties related for instance to the fiscal crisis in the euro area and to fiscal consolidation in the US have not lifted and remain as downside risks to growth. In Korea, although investment has increased amid generally favorable exports, the Committee appraises economic growth to have remained at a weak level as consumption has declined. On the employment front, amid its continued uptrend led by the higher age groups and the service industry, the number of persons employed has increased by a greater margin in the manufacturing sector as well. Going forward, the Committee anticipates that the negative output gap in the domestic economy will persist for a considerable time, due mostly to the slow recovery of the global economy in consequence chiefly of the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area. 1 Consumer price inflation and core inflation excluding the prices of agricultural and petroleum products continued to run at low levels similar to those in the previous month, at 1.5% and 1.2% respectively in January. The Committee forecasts that inflation will remain low for the time being, owing primarily to the weakening of demand-side pressures. As for housing prices, those in Seoul and its surrounding areas continued on their downtrend and those in the rest of the country on their uptrend. In the financial markets, stock prices have fallen and the Korean won has depreciated against the US dollar, due mostly to outflows of foreigners' securities investment funds. Long-term market interest rates have shown fluctuations at low levels within a relatively narrow range. Looking ahead, the Committee will closely monitor external risk factors and geopolitical risks in Korea and the consequent changes in financial and economic conditions, continue its efforts to lower inflation expectations, and conduct monetary policy so as to keep consumer price inflation within the inflation target range over a medium-term horizon while ensuring that the growth potential is not eroded due to the continuation of slow growth."
Peru,2013-02-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR FEBRUARY 2013 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 4.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference rate at 4.25 percent. This decision is based on the fact that inflation continues reflecting both the reversal of the shocks on the side of supply and a pace of economic growth close to the economy's potential level of growth. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants to consider future adjustments in monetary policy instruments. Inflation in January showed a rate of 0.12 percent, which reflected mainly the rise in the prices of meals outside the home. Inflation in the last 12 months increased from 2.65 percent in December to 2.87 percent in January. On the other hand, core inflation registered a rate of 0.29 percent (3.34 percent in the last 12 months) and inflation excluding food and energy showed a rate of 0.04 percent (2.09 percent in the last 12 months). Inflation is expected to converge to the 2 percent target in the next months due to the improvement of food supply conditions and due to a pace of growth of economic activity close to the economy's level of potential output, in a context in which global economic activity continues to show weak indicators. Current and advanced indicators of activity show that the growth of the Peruvian economy has stabilized around its long-term sustainable level of growth, even though the indicators associated with the external market still register a weak performance. The Board also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as described below: Overnight deposits: 3.45 percent. Direct repo and rediscount operations: 5.05 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.05 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for March on its session of March 7, 2013."
Turkiye,2013-02-19,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to adjust the short term interest rates as follows: a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) has been kept at 5.5 percent. b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate has been cut from 4.75 percent to 4.50 percent while lending rate has been cut from 8.75 percent to 8.50 percent. Interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions has been cut from 8.25 percent to 8 percent. c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent while lending rate has been cut from 11.75 percent to 11.50 percent. Recent data confirm that the rebalancing between the domestic and external demand continues as envisaged. Domestic demand follows a moderate pace while exports continue to increase despite weak global activity. Overall, current account deficit continues to decline gradually. The Committee has indicated that credit growth displays a significant acceleration amid strong capital inflows. In order to contain the risks on financial stability, the proper policy would be to keep interest rates at low levels while continuing with macroprudential measures. Accordingly, it was deemed appropriate to implement a measured tightening through reserve requirements, while delivering a limited downward shift in the interest rate corridor. Ongoing uncertainties regarding the global economy necessitate the monetary policy to remain flexible in both directions. Therefore, the impact of the measures undertaken on credit, domestic demand, and inflation expectations will be monitored closely and the funding amount will be adjusted in either direction, as needed. The Committee has indicated that inflation will continue to fall despite the recent increase in oil prices. Core inflation indicators are also expected to follow a mild course. In the meantime, the impact of increases in administered prices on the pricing behavior will be monitored closely. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Thailand,2013-02-20,"No 8/ 2013 Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 20 February 2013 Mr. Paiboon Kittisrikangwan. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting today as follows. The global economy has been more stable and exhibited signs of improvement since the last meeting. The Chinese and Asian economies have expanded well on the back of strong domestic demand and better prospects of exports. Domestic consumption and investment in the US continued to expand and, if sustained, should lend support to the economy going forward. The eurozone economy remained in recession and would take time to fully recover. Economic growth in Japan has yet to gain traction, but the planned fiscal and monetary stimulus should gradually help stabilise the economy. Despite improving overall outlook, the global economic recovery is still subject to downside risks, from the eurozone's sovereign debt problems and uncertainties regarding the US fiscal consolidation. The Thai economy expanded more than expected in the fourth quarter of 2012, spurred by domestic demand amid strong economic fundamentals as well as accommodative monetary and fiscal policies. The economy is expected to grow faster than previously projected in the periods ahead, with domestic demand being a key growth driver together with a gradual recovery of exports. Inflationary pressure has risen somewhat, as a result of an increase in oil prices. The MPC judged that the accommodative monetary policy stance contributed to sustained growth of the economy, while inflation has been kept within the target range. However given remaining uncertainties surrounding the global economic outlook and risks to domestic financial stability including from rising asset prices, the MPC voted 6 to 1 to maintain the policy interest rate at 275 percent per annum. One member viewed risks stemming from volatile capital flows and fragile economic momentum to warrant a 025 percent reduction. Going forward, the MPC will continue to closely monitor risks to financial stability as well as capital flow situation and stand ready to take actions as appropriate."
Israel,2013-02-25,"Various indicators of real economic activity are mixed. Surveys indicate an improvement in expectations of economic activity in the business sector, and the most recent monthly indicators show a possibility that there was some improvement in January in the rate of activity. In contrast. GDP grew by 2.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012, a lower rate than in previous quarters. This was apparently affected by, among other things. Operation Pillar of Defense. It is therefore early to assess whether thisrepresents a turnaround in economic activity. The development of actual prices and of inflation expectations for the year ahead continues to indicate an inflation environment below the midpointof the target range. Inflation over the previous 12 months was 1.5 percent, and inflation expectations for the year ahead, based on various sources, are slightly below the midpoint of the target range. The widespread assessment is that the risk of a deterioration in the global economic crisis has declined. At the same time, macro-economic data from leading economies are mixed. Therefore, at this stage,it is too early to determine whether this represents a positive turnaround. The nominal effective exchange rate of the shekel appreciated in recent months after a decline last summer. The rate of increase in home prices continues to rise, and in the 12 months ending in December, home prices increased by 6.7 percent, compared with 5.8 percent in the 12 months to November. The growth in the high volume ofnew mortgages taken also continued in recent months. Last week, the Supervisor of Banks published a Draft Directive requiring banks to increase theircapital buffers and allowances against the risks inherent in the housing loans portfolio. This is a prudential step, but one that may also moderate the pressure in the housing market to a certain extent. To view this press release as a Word file. Currency (Unit) Rate Daily Change. Nominal Effective Rate -0.124%. Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for January declined by 0.2 percent. This was below forecasts, which projected, on average, no change in the CPI. The rate of increase in the CPI over the past 12 months remains essentially unchanged compared to previous months, at 1.5 percent. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Forecasters' inflation projections for the next twelve months remained stable this month, at 1.9 percent, as didinflation expectations based on over-the-counter CPI futures contracts offered by banks, at 1.8 percent. Inflation expectations for the next twelve months calculated from the capital markets (break-even inflation) are 2.5 percent. (This figure is biased upward due to seasonality.) Inflation expectations for two to three years declined slightly from 2.5 percent to 2.4 percent, while expectations for the medium-term remained stable. Expectations for longer terms declined sharply from 2.8 percent to 2.4 percent. Expectations for the Bank of Israel interest rate one year from now derived from the Telbor (Tel Aviv Inter-Bank Offered Rate) market, and expectations based on the average projection of forecasters, are for an interest rate of 1.6 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively. Real economic activity: Various indicators point toward continued moderate growth of demand, with a continued slowdown in exports, and signal an improvement in expectations of business sector activity. The most recent monthly indicators show that economic activity continues to growmoderately, although it is likely that there was some improvement in the rate of this growth in January. The Composite State-of-the-Economy Index in its new format increased by 0.2 percent in January. Foreign trade data, the Business Tendency Survey, and consumer confidence indices in recent months have shown a decline in export sales in general, and in the high technology sector in particular. In contrast, sales in the domestic market have improved during the most recent period. Import data were mixed, with a continued decline in the import of investmentgoods contrasted by sharp growth in the import of raw materials and consumer goods (durables and non-durables). National Accounts data indicate that the growth rate in the fourth quarter of 2012 was 2.5 percent: lowerthan in previous quarters, apparently due to the effect of Operation Pillar of Defense. This decline reflects a decrease in goods exports and imports, as well as a slowdown in growth of the main uses: private consumption and investments (principal industries and housing): contrasted by an increase in public consumption. Until a new government is formed, and the budget is approved, there will be uncertainty regarding how the government will deal with the need to align the budget with the limitations of thedeficit target and expenditures. The labor market: Most of the recent labor market data indicate stability. Labor force survey data indicate a slight increase in unemployment during the fourth quarter of 2012, to 6.9 percent, accompanied by a decline in the participation rate of 0.4 percentage points. At the same time, the unemployment rate among the main employment ages of 25-64 declined slightly during the fourth quarter of 2012, accompanied by a decline in the participation rate and a more moderate decline in the employment rate. Examining the numberof employed persons by industry shows that, compared to the previous quarter, there was an increase in employment in the business sector, particularly in the trade and construction industries, and a decline in the number of employed persons in the public services as a whole (other than education).<span> An analysis of salaried positions in the government and private (financial and non-financial) sectors indicates that growth in the number of positions in October and November comprised not just the government sector (as in previous quarters), but also the private sector, followingdeclines in previous quarters. The balance of filled positions minus vacated positions, which appears in the survey of employers, also indicates stability in the labor market. Compared to the third quarter, nominal wages increased in October-November by 0.5 percent, while real wages increased by 0.2 percent, based on seasonally adjusted data. Health tax receipts, which provide an indication of nominal wage payments, were 4.7 percent higher in December-January than in the corresponding period of the previous year, compared with a year over year increase of 5.7 percent in October-November. The Bank of Israel Research Department staff forecast: In December, the Bank of Israel Research Department updated its macroeconomic forecast. According to that assessment, which was published December, the inflation rate is expected to be 1.8 percent in 2013. The growth rate for 2013 is projected to be 3.8 percent, assuming that production of natural gas from the Tamar field begins during the second quarter of 2013, as planned; the growth rate is estimated to be 2.8 percent excluding the production of natural gas. The forecast will next be updated at the end of March. Budget data: There was a budget surplus of NIS 2.4 billion in domestic government activity in January. This is characteristic of January, but is lower than in previous years and than the seasonal path consistent with attainingthe government's deficit target. Total domestic expenditure (excluding credit) in January was about NIS 19 billion: about NIS 2 billion above the level of expenditure that corresponds to the seasonal path for government expenditure in accordance with the expenditure ceiling. In January, the government operated without an approved budget framework and in accordance with the law allowing it to spend 1/12 of last year's overall budget each month (including debt repayments), adjusted for increases in the CPI. The foreign exchange market: From the previous monetary policy discussion held on January 27, 2013, through February 22, 2013, the shekel appreciated against the dollar by about 0.25 percent, while the dollar was mixed against most major currencies. Nonresidents' activity supported a stronger shekel, as they purchased more than $1 billion worth of shekels. The shekel appreciated by 2.2 percent against the euro, similar tomost major currencies. In terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, the shekel appreciated by about 1.2 percent during the period. The capital and money markets: From the previous monetary policy discussion held on January 27, 2013, through February 22, 2013, the Tel Aviv 25 Index appreciated by about 2.1 percent. Yields on government bonds decreased, in line with the trend in Germany, while there were only slight changes along the length of the curve in the United States. Yields on both the CPI-indexed bonds and unindexed bonds decreased sharply, with yields on short-term unindexed bonds declining by up to 15 basis points and yields on medium- and long-term bonds declining by up to 6 basis points. Yields on short- and medium-term CPI-indexed bonds declined by up to 10 basis points, and yields onlong-term CPI-indexed bonds declined by 9 basis points. The yield differential between 10-year Israeli government bonds and equivalent 10-year US Treasury securities was unchanged at around 200 basis points. Makam yields declined along most of the curve by up to 8 basis points, with one-yearyields declining to 1.62 percent during the period. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spread remained unchanged at 124 basis points. The Tel-Bond 60 Index increased by about 0.5 percent over the period. Spreads in the corporate bond market continued to contract for all ratings, though primarily for lower ones. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in January, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 10.4 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 6 percent. Developments in the credit markets: The outstanding debt of the business sector declined by 1.1 percent in December, from NIS 791 billion to NIS 782 billion, although more than half of the decrease apparently derived from the appreciation of the shekel. In the past 12 months the debt of the business sector remained unchanged. Total outstanding credit to households increasedin December by 0.3 percent, to NIS 384 billion, and increased by 5.5 percent during the past year. The total volume of new mortgages granted in January was NIS 4 billion, compared with NIS 4.7 billion in December. ; The past few months have seen a decrease in the average loan-to-value ratio (LTV). The balance of housing debt was NIS 269 billion at the endof December, an increase of 6.9 percent compared with December 2011. Against the background of continued growth in this balance and the absence of appropriate growth in allowances for doubtful debts in respect of housing credit, the Supervisor of Banks published a Draft Directive increasing the required risk weighting and provisioning on housing loans, and reducing the required capital allocation for guarantees in respect of homes already delivered to residents. Interest rates on new CPI-indexed mortgages granted in January declined across all linkage tracks, mainly in the unindexed, floating-rate track, against the background of the reduction in the Bank of Israel interest rate for January. In January, there was a continued increase in issuance volume by the non-financial business sector, froma monthly average of NIS 2.3 billion in 2012 to NIS 4.4 billion. An assessment of the mix of companies issuing debt last month shows that alongside high-rated real estate companies, companies from the trades and services sectors, mainly those in manufacturing, raised significant amounts. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (based on housing rents) declined by 0.1 percent in January. In the twelve months ending in January, it increased by 2.9 percent, compared with an increase of 3.3 percent in the twelve months to December. Home prices, which are measured by the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of home prices but are not included in the CPI, increased in November-December by 1 percent, after increasing by 1.1 percent in October-November. The rate of increase in home prices continued to rise. In the twelve months ending in December, home prices increased by 6.7 percent, compared with an increase of 5.8 percent in thetwelve months to November. The number of building starts in the 12 months ending in November was 40,406, and it is expected to continue to be reflected in an increased stock of homes. At the same time, the number of building starts in the January-November period was about 13 percent lower than in the corresponding period in 2011. In addition, the rate of properties marketed by the Israel Lands Administration has declined sharply. The global economy: The improving trend in the global economy continued, andthe widespread assessment is that there has been a decline in the probability of occurrence of the risks which generated a very high level of uncertainty last year: the fiscal cliff in the US, a deterioration in the debt crisis in Europe, and a moderation of growth in China. In the US, macrodata have been mixed, while there is concern that the US budget contraction expected in March is liable to impact growth negatively. The recession in the eurozone continues: in the final quarter of 2012, all 4 of the major economies in the eurozone, as well as the overall eurozone economy itself, contracted at a sharper than expected rate. Some indicators, primarily sentiment measures, point toward the possibility of an improvement in thetrend beginning in 2013. However, the recovery process in the European economy is expected to be very slow, as noted by the ECB in its most recent interest rate decision. Data in China continued to indicate continued recovery in activity. Stockmarkets worldwide traded mixed this month, with increases in US indices and declines in Europe, after sharp increases in markets in January. Energy and metals prices have recently increased, which is likely to have an effecton inflation. There has also been a sharp depreciation of the yen against the background of an increase in Japan's inflation target. The ECB president noted in his announcement that an interest rate reduction would be likelyif the euro's appreciation continues and negatively impacts the eurozone'seconomic recovery. This apparently halted the euro's strengthening of recent months. Monetary policy at most central banks did not change during the past month, and interest rates in major economies remained low. The quantitative easing policy in the US and UK continues, and additional easing was announced in Japan. Based on their announcements, the accommodative policiesof central banks in major advanced economies are expected to continue. The main considerations behind the decision. The decision to keep the interest rate for March 2013 unchanged at 1.75 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's interest rate policy, which is intended to entrench the inflation rate within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel and in the global economy, the monetary policies of major central banks, and developments in the exchange rate of the shekel. The following are the main considerations underlying the decision:. C 2B 7 Over the past month,most major central banks continued their quantitative easing policies, andinterest rates in major economies remained close to zero. Based on their announcements, the accommodative policies of central banks in major advanced economies are expected to continue. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets, particularly in light of the continuing high level of uncertainty in the global economy. The Bank will use the tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will keep a close watch on developmentsin the asset markets, including the housing market. The minutes of the discussions prior to the above interest rate decision will bepublished on March 11, 2013. The decision regarding the interest rate for April 2013 will be published at 17:30 on Sunday. March 24, 2013. Reminder: In accordance with the Monetary Committee's decision, the interest rate published at the end of March will be valid for the months of April and May."
Hungary,2013-02-26,"At its meeting on 26 February 2013, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by 25 basis points from 5.50% to 5.25%, with effect from 27 February 2013. In the Monetary Council's judgement. Hungarian economic growth is likely to resume this year following last year's recession. The level of output is below its potential and unemployment is above its long-term level determined by structural factors. The Monetary Council expects weak demand conditions to persist, which will ensure that inflationary pressures in the economy remain muted in the period ahead. Inflation in January slowed more than anticipated. The decline was related to a wide range of goods and services. This, coupled with the marked slowdown in underlying inflation, may reflect the stronger-than-expected disinflationary impact of weak domestic demand. The short-term outlook for inflation improved significantly as a result of the lower-than-projected price increases around the start of the year and the government measures affecting the prices of items excluded from the core measure. However, the extent to which companies will be able to pass on higher production costs into prices in response to the government measures may be a source of uncertainty for the medium-term inflation outlook. The Monetary Council will therefore continue to monitor closely developments in underlying inflation. According to preliminary data, in the final quarter of last year the performance of the Hungarian economy fell by more than expected. Growth is likely to resume this year following last year's recession as the country's export markets recover; however, external, and domestic demand factors in particular, point to only modest growth in the period ahead. In the Monetary Council's judgement, there remains a degree of spare capacity in the economy, output continues to be significantly below its potential level and the labour market remains loose. The weakness in investment and persistently high unemployment suggest that the potential growth rate of the economy is significantly below its pre-crisis level. Global risk appetite has remained strong over the past month, but the contrast between improved investor sentiment in international financial markets and the modest outlook for growth in the world economy continues to pose a risk. Meanwhile, domestic risk premia have remained broadly stable. The success of the foreign currency-denominated bond issue by the Government has reduced financing risks for the economy. Cooperation with the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund might contribute to a further reduction in financing costs and a sustained improvement in perceptions of the risks associated with the economy. In the Monetary Council's judgement, the economic data becoming available in the past month suggest that weak demand continues to exert a strong disinflationary impact on prices, and therefore companies will have limited ability to pass on higher production costs into prices. The favourable global financial market environment may lead to a sustained fall in domestic financial asset prices. In the light of these factors, the inflation target can be met even with looser monetary conditions. The Council will consider a further reduction in the policy rate if the medium-term outlook for inflation remains consistent with the Bank's 3% target and the improvement in financial market sentiment is sustained."
Mongolia,2013-02-27,"THE BANK OF MONGOLIA MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT Improving monetary policy instruments Number: 2013/02 Date: 27 February 2013 At its meeting on 27 February 2013, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of Mongolia decided to establish an interest rate corridor based on macroeconomic conditions, demand for money market development and international experiences on monetary policy implementation. Establishing the interest rate corridor and improving monetary policy instruments will play a significant role to reduce volatility in short-term interest rates, improve interest rate channel of monetary transmission mechanism and bring more transparency in the implementation of monetary policy. In conjunction with making the decision, interest rate structure of the monetary policy instruments is fully changed and new monetary policy instruments such as overnight repo and overnight deposit facilities are launched. The interest rate corridor around policy interest rate consists of two end-of-day standing facilities. The rate of overnight repo facility will become the ‘ceiling' (policy interest rate + 2 percentage points) and the rate of overnight deposit facility will serve as the ‘floor' of the corridor (policy interest rate - 2 percentage points). This policy measure shall provide a core condition for enhancing the efficiency of interbank market, decreasing the volume of outstanding central bank bills, reducing the interest rate of financing to banks as well as promoting economic activity. MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE."
Poland,2013-03-06,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 6 March 2013 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 5-6 March 2013 The Council decided to decrease the NBP interest rates by 0.50 percentage points:  reference rate to 3.25% on an annual basis;  lombard rate to 4.75% on an annual basis;  deposit rate to 1.75% on an annual basis;  rediscount rate to 3.50% on an annual basis. Incoming data show that the global economic activity remains low. In 2012 Q4, economic growth in the United States came to a halt, while the euro area remained in recession. GDP declined in all major euro area economies, including Germany. At the same time, economic growth in some major emerging economies probably accelerated. In recent months, economic activity in several developed economies showed some signs of improvement. In Poland, the GDP data confirmed that in 2012 Q4 there was a marked economic slowdown. Weakening consumer demand was accompanied by slower decline in investment. Economic growth continued to be supported by a positive, albeit somehow lower than in the previous quarter, contribution of net exports. Incoming data point to still low economic growth in early 2013. Weak economic activity growth is accompanied by falling employment in the corporate sector and rising unemployment, which holds back wage growth. At the same time, both household and corporate lending growth remains subdued. In January. CPI inflation declined more than expected. According to the preliminary data. CPI inflation was 1.7% y/y, running below the NBP inflation target of 2.5%. Also core inflation remained low, which confirms limited demand pressure in the economy. At the same time, household inflation expectations decreased further. The Council got acquainted with the inflation and GDP projection prepared by the Economic Institute, which is one of the inputs to the Council's decisions on the NBP interest rates. In line with the March projection based on the NECMOD model  assuming unchanged NBP interest rates  there is a 50-percent probability of inflation running in the range of 1.3-1.9% in 2013 (as compared to 1.8-3.1% in the November projection), within 0.8-2.4% in 2014 (as against 0.7-2.4%) and between 0.7-2.4% in 2015. In the opinion of the Council, incoming data confirm persistently low economic growth in Poland, no wage pressure and low inflationary pressure. Economic activity may gradually improve in the coming quarters. However. GDP growth will probably remain moderate, which will continue to contain inflationary pressure. Such an assessment is supported by the March projection of inflation and GDP. Considering the risk of inflation running below the NBP inflation target in the medium term, the Council decided to lower the NBP interest rates further. The March decision complements the monetary policy easing cycle commenced in November 2012. In the opinion of the Council, considerable monetary policy easing in recent months and at the March meeting will allow inflation to run close to target in the medium term and at the same time supports recovery of the Polish economy. The Council adopted the Inflation Report  March 2013."
Euroarea,2013-03-07,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. HICP inflation rates have declined further, as anticipated, and fell below 2% in February. Over the policy-relevant horizon, inflationary pressures should remain contained. The underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be subdued. Inflation expectations for the euro area remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Overall, this will allow our monetary policy stance to remain accommodative. Available data continue to signal that economic weakness in the euro area has extended into the beginning of the year, while broadly confirming signs of stabilisation in a number of indicators, albeit at low levels. At the same time, necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors will continue to weigh on economic activity. Later in 2013 economic activity should gradually recover, supported by a strengthening of global demand and our accommodative monetary policy stance. In order to support confidence, it is essential for governments to continue implementing structural reforms, to build further on the progress made in fiscal consolidation, and to proceed with financial sector restructuring. With regard to the liquidity situation of banks, counterparties have so far repaid €224.8 billion of the €1,018.7 billion obtained in the two three-year longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) settled in December 2011 and March 2012. In net terms, this implies that, of the increase in the outstanding volume of bank refinancing through the ECB's monetary policy operations of around €500 billion between mid-December 2011 and early March 2012, about €200 billion have now been repaid. These repayments reflect improvements in financial market confidence over the last few months and receding financial market fragmentation. We are closely monitoring conditions in the money market and their potential impact on the stance of monetary policy and the functioning of the transmission of our monetary policy to the economy. Our monetary policy stance will remain accommodative with the full allotment mode of liquidity provision. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. The GDP outcome for the fourth quarter of 2012 was weak, with Eurostat's second estimate indicating a contraction of 0.6% quarter on quarter. The decline was largely due to a fall in domestic demand but also reflected weak exports. As regards 2013, recent data and indicators suggest that economic activity should start stabilising in the first part of the year. A gradual recovery should commence in the second part, with export growth benefiting from a strengthening of global demand and domestic demand being supported by our accommodative monetary policy stance. Furthermore, the improvements in financial markets since July last year and the continued implementation of structural reforms should work their way through to the economy. At the same time, necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors, and the associated tight credit conditions, will continue to weigh on economic activity. This assessment is also reflected in the March 2013 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee average annual real GDP growth in a range between -0.9% and -0.1% in 2013 and between 0.0% and 2.0% in 2014. Compared with the December 2012 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the ranges have been revised slightly downwards. The revision for 2013 mainly reflects a more negative carry-over effect from the outcome for real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2012, while the projected path of the recovery has remained broadly unchanged. The Governing Council continues to see downside risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area. The risks relate to the possibility of weaker than expected domestic demand and exports and to slow or insufficient implementation of structural reforms in the euro area. These factors have the potential to dampen the improvement in confidence and thereby delay the recovery. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.8% in February 2013, down from 2.0% in January. The on-going decline in annual inflation rates mainly reflects the energy and food components of the price index. Looking ahead, while the monthly pattern of headline inflation rates may be somewhat volatile, underlying price pressures should remain contained given the environment of weak economic activity in the euro area. Inflation expectations are well-anchored and in line with price stability over the medium term. The March 2013 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area foresee annual HICP inflation in a range between 1.2% and 2.0% in 2013 and between 0.6% and 2.0% in 2014. In comparison with the December 2012 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the ranges are broadly unchanged. In the Governing Council‘s assessment, risks to the outlook for price developments continue to be seen as broadly balanced over the medium term, with upside risks relating to stronger than expected increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, as well as higher oil prices, and downside risks stemming from weaker economic activity. Turning to the monetary analysis, monetary figures for January 2013 support our assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be subdued. The annual growth rate of M3 remained broadly unchanged at 3.5% in January, after 3.4% in December 2012. The annual rate of growth of the narrow monetary aggregate. M1, increased to 6.7% from 6.3% in December 2012. The deposit base of MFIs in a number of stressed countries strengthened further in January. The annual growth rate of loans (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) to non-financial corporations stood at -1.5% in January, after -1.3% in December 2012. The annual growth in MFI loans to households moderated slightly to 0.5%, from 0.7% in December. To a large extent, subdued loan dynamics reflect the current stage of the business cycle, heightened credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. At the same time, available information on the access to financing of non-financial corporates indicates tight credit conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises. In order to ensure adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions in euro area countries, it is essential to continue reducing fragmentation of euro area credit markets and strengthening the resilience of banks where needed. Decisive steps for establishing an integrated financial framework will help to accomplish this objective. The future Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) is one of the main building blocks, together with a Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM). Both are crucial elements for moving towards re-integrating the banking system. To sum up, the economic analysis indicates that price developments should remain in line with price stability over the medium term. A cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. While the accommodative monetary policy stance will continue to support the recovery in the euro area, it is essential that fiscal and structural policies strengthen the prospects for economic growth over the medium term. As regards fiscal policies, the European Commission's 2013 winter forecast reflects progress in reducing fiscal imbalances in the euro area. The euro area-wide general government deficit is expected to have declined from 4.2% of GDP in 2011 to 3.5% of GDP in 2012 and is projected to be reduced further to 2.8% of GDP this year. Governments should build on this progress with a view to further restoring confidence in the sustainability of public finances. At the same time, fiscal consolidation must be part of a comprehensive structural reform agenda to improve the outlook for job creation, economic growth and debt sustainability. In the view of the Governing Council, it is of particular importance at this juncture to address the current high long-term and youth unemployment. To this end, further product and labour market reforms are needed to create new job opportunities by supporting a dynamic, flexible and competitive economic environment."
Malaysia,2013-03-07,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.00 percent. The global economy continues to be confronted with some uncertainties. While there have been improvements in the advanced economies, risks to sustained recovery remain. In Asia, growth continues to be supported by domestic demand and a gradual improvement in intra-regional trade. While global financial markets have broadly improved, markets remain vulnerable to setbacks and changes in sentiments. In the domestic economy, the latest indicators point to robust investment activity and continued expansion in private consumption. Going forward, this trend is expected to continue. Private consumption is supported by sustained income growth amid stable labour market conditions. Investment is being led by capital spending in the domestic-oriented sectors, the oil and gas industry and the ongoing implementation of infrastructure projects. The external sector is also expected to improve and provide additional support to the economy. Inflation remained low at 1.3% in January. While inflation is expected to rise during the year, the expectation is for it to remain modest. Higher global prices of selected food commodities and domestic factors are expected to increase costs and contribute to higher prices. Nevertheless, in line with modest global growth prospects, pressures from global commodity prices are expected to be contained. The MPC considers the current stance of monetary policy to be appropriate given the outlook for inflation and growth. In addition to domestic conditions, the MPC will continue to carefully assess the global economic and financial developments and their implications on the overall outlook for inflation and growth of the Malaysian economy. Bank Negara Malaysia 07 March 2013."
Philippines,2013-03-13,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the BSP's key policy interest rate at 3.50 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility. At the same time, it kept the rate for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility at 5.50 percent. It also decided to set the interest rate on RRPs at 3.50 percent for all tenors. Following its previous decision to rationalize the Special Deposit Account (SDA) facility in January, the Monetary Board further reduced the interest rates on the SDA facility by 50 basis points to 2.50 percent across all tenors effective immediately. Meanwhile, the reserve requirement ratios were kept steady. The Monetary Board's decision to maintain the policy interest rates at their current levels is based on its assessment that the inflation environment over the policy horizon is likely to remain manageable. Inflation expectations also continue to be firmly anchored. Furthermore, the risks to the inflation outlook are evenly balanced. Although global economic activity has gained traction, lingering fiscal and financial market stresses in the advanced economies continue to dampen the broad outlook, thereby mitigating upward pressures on commodity prices. Meanwhile, pending domestic power rate adjustments and potentially stronger domestic liquidity growth due to expectations of further capital inflows pose upside risks to the inflation outlook. Latest baseline forecasts have risen slightly due to the higher inflation outturns in recent months but continue to track the lower half of the 4 ± 1 percent target range for 2013 and 2014. The reduction in the SDA rate is consistent with the BSP's continuing efforts to fine-tune the operation of its monetary policy tools. The benign inflation outlook and improving growth prospects provide room for the reduction in the SDA rate. Going forward, the BSP will continue to monitor emerging price and output conditions to maintain the consistency of the monetary policy stance with the price stability objective while being supportive of economic growth. The BSP also stands ready to employ macroprudential measures as necessary to pre-emptively address any potential misalignments in asset prices."
Chile,2013-03-14,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 14 March 2013 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 5% (annual). International financial conditions are stable. The United States is posting more dynamic output indicators, as opposed to the Eurozone, which continues to endure recession and a fragile fiscal and financial situation. The Japanese authorities have signaled more expansionary macroeconomic policies, which has translated into a depreciation of the yen. The dollar has appreciated in world markets. The prices of commodities, including copper, receded in recent weeks. Domestically, output and demand indicators have exceeded forecasts in the latest Monetary Policy Report. Economic activity reflects improvements in mining, while demand growth, driven by investment, is outpacing GDP. The labor market is still tight. Headline and core inflation are around 1% y-o-y, while inflationary expectations in the policy horizon remain aligned with the target. The peso has appreciated in multilateral terms. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. * The Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2013-03-14,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.75% for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.75% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information, the Committee considers the moderate economic recovery in the US to have been sustained but economic activities in the euro area to have been unable to shake off their sluggishness, while emerging market countries have shown continuing economic growth. The Committee expects the global economy to sustain its modest recovery going forward, but judges that the uncertainties related for instance to the fiscal crisis in the euro area and to fiscal consolidation in the US have not lifted and remain as downside risks to growth. In Korea, although exports have maintained their trend of recovery and construction investment has increased slightly, the Committee appraises the economy to have sustained a weak level of growth as consumption and facilities investment have declined owing to temporary factors. On the employment front, the increase in the number of persons employed was smaller in February than in the month before, as a result of the accelerated decline in the number of temporary and daily workers due mainly to the Lunar New Year holiday. Going forward, there is no change to the Committee's forecast that the domestic economy will show a negative output gap for a considerable time, due mostly to the slow recovery of the global economy in consequence chiefly of the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area. 1 Consumer price inflation and core inflation excluding the prices of agricultural and petroleum products continued to run at low levels similar to those in the previous month, at 1.4% and 1.3% respectively in February. Inflation appears likely to remain relatively low, due to the weakening of demand-side pressures; the Committee forecasts, however, that it will rise above its current level as downward pressures from institutional factors partially disappear. As for housing prices, those in Seoul and its surrounding areas continued on their downtrend and those in the rest of the country on their moderate uptrend. In the financial markets, stock prices have shown slight fluctuations, as the influences of foreigners' stock investment fund inflows and of the increase in Korea's geopolitical risk have coincided, while long- term market interest rates have fallen due mainly to large inflows of foreigners' bond investment funds. The Korean won-US dollar exchange rate had fluctuated within a certain range, but has risen recently, owing largely to the emergence of geopolitical risk. Looking ahead, the Committee will closely monitor external risk factors and Korea's geopolitical risk and any consequent changes in financial and economic conditions, continue its efforts to lower inflation expectations, and conduct monetary policy so as to keep consumer price inflation within the inflation target range over a medium-term horizon while ensuring that the growth potential is not eroded due to the continuation of slow growth."
Peru,2013-03-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR MARCH 2013 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 4.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference rate at 4.25 percent. This decision is based on the fact that inflation continues evidencing both the reversal of the shocks on the side of supply and a pace of economic growth close to the economy's potential level of growth. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants to consider future adjustments in monetary policy instruments. Inflation in February showed a rate of -0.09 percent, which reflected mainly the drop in food prices. Inflation in the last 12 months declined from 2.87 percent in January to 2.45 percent in February. Moreover, core inflation showed a rate of 0.21 percent (3.22 percent in the last 12 months) and inflation excluding food and energy showed a rate of 0.18 percent (2.20 percent in the last 12 months). Inflation is expected to converge to the 2 percent target in the next months due to the improvement of food supply conditions and due to a pace of growth of economic activity close to the economy's level of potential output, in a context in which weak production indicators persist in the global economy. Current and advanced indicators of activity show that the growth of the Peruvian economy has stabilized around its long-term sustainable level of growth, even though the indicators associated with the external market still show a weak performance. The Board also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as described below: Overnight deposits: 3.45 percent. Direct repo and rediscount operations: 5.05 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.05 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for April on its session of April 11, 2013."
Russia,2013-03-15,"Information Notice. The Board of Directors' Decision on the Bank of Russia Interest Rates(Unofficial translation). The Bank of Russia External and Public Relations Department informs that on 15 March 2013 the Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia decided to maintain the refinancing rate and the interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations unchanged (table “Interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations”). The decision was supported by the assessment of inflation risks and economic growth prospects. In February and in the beginning of March 2013 the pace of inflation was estimated at 7.3% over a year ago, which was in line with the Bank of Russia forecast of inflation exceeding the target range in the first half of 2013. High pace of inflation is mainly explained by the food prices growth and the dynamics of certain regulated prices and tariffs. The inflation rate staying above the target range for a prolonged period of time may affect economic agents' expectations and thus poses inflation risks, in particular taking into account the planned increases in the natural monopolies' tariffs. The dynamics of the key macroeconomic indicators in January 2013 pointed to a continuing slowdown in economic growth. The growth rates of investment in production capacity remained subdued and the retail sales growth decelerated. The industrial output decreased. At the same time, economic confidence indicators remain overall positive and labour market conditions together with credit expansion provide support to the domestic demand. Considering recent domestic and external macroeconomic developments the Bank of Russia judges that the current level of money market interest rates is appropriate for achieving the balance of the main macroeconomic risks. The Bank of Russia will continue to monitor inflation risks and the risks of the economy cooling down. In making monetary policy decisions the Bank of Russia will be guided by the inflation goals and economic growth prospects. The next meeting of the Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia on monetary policy issues is planned to be held in the first half of April 2013.

Nigeria,2013-03-18,"Central Bank of Nigeria Communique No. 88 of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting of Monday and Tuesday. March 18 and 19, 2013 The Monetary Policy Committee met on March 18 and 19, 2013 with all the 12 members in attendance. The Committee reviewed the conditions and challenges that confronted the domestic economy in the first quarter of 2013 against the backdrop of current international economic and financial developments with a view to reassessing the monetary policy options in the short-to- medium term. The Committee reviewed the conditions and challenges that confronted the domestic economy in the first quarter of 2013 against the backdrop of current international economic and financial developments with a view to reassessing the monetary policy options in the short-to-medium term. International Economic Developments At the outset, the Committee observed that global growth remained subdued throughout 2012 due to the softer than expected level of activities in the euro area and the slipping of Japan into recession during the second half of the year. Weak and fragmented growth was also recorded across major economies and regions including the US. The emerging market economies, however, showed a fair degree of resilience. The growth outlook, however, appears promising. The IMF January 2013 WEO Update, projected a global output growth of 35 per cent in 2013 compared with the 32 per cent achieved in 2012. In the Advanced Economies, output was estimated at 14 per cent for 2013 compared with the 13 per cent achieved in 2012. Recession is expected to continue in the euro area although the magnitude of the contraction, estimated at 02 per cent in 2013, represents an improvement over the 04 per cent contraction in 2012. slowdown in growth is also expected in the US in 2013, as output is projected to decline by 20 per cent from 23 per cent in 2012, owing largely to the short term effects of its fiscal consolidation regime as well as the weaknesses in the labor and housing markets. The emerging Asian economies were projected to post a gradual recovery that would propel global output growth in 2013. China which previously recorded a slowdown over seven consecutive quarters to Q3 2012, witnessed improved activity in Q4 2012; confirming that an upswing in growth was underway. The recent fiscal and monetary easing operations of the Peoples Bank of 2 China led to increased tempo of investment in infrastructure with indications of further public spending in fiscal 2013. Thus the economy is expected to grow strongly in 2013 amid gradual improvements in the external environment. Japan returned to growth in the fourth quarter of 2012, raising hopes of an end to the 15-year deflation. The major setback in the region is expected from India, with real GDP growth of 54 per cent in 2012 on account of the poor performance of the manufacturing, agriculture and service sectors. The recent fiscal and monetary easing operations of the Peoples Bank of China led to increased tempo of investment in infrastructure with indications of further public spending in fiscal 2013. The Committee noted that growth in Sub-Saharan Africa was still robust, although real output growth dropped to 48 per cent in 2012 from 53 per cent in 2011. The performance of Sub-Saharan Africa during 2013 would partly depend on developments in the euro area as well as the extent of recovery in China. With policy buffers weaker than they were prior to the 2008 crisis, the ability of governments to implement countercyclical fiscal policy may be constrained. The Committee noted that growth in Sub-Saharan Africa was still robust, although real output growth dropped to 48 per cent in 2012 from 53 per 2 cent in 2011. Domestic Economic and Financial Developments Output 3 The Committee was satisfied with the relatively robust output growth projections for 2013 despite the slowing global economy, on the back of favorable conditions for increased agricultural production, the outcome of banking sector reforms, as well as other initiatives by government to stimulate the real economy. The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) reported that the real GDP growth rate declined from 743 per cent in 2011 to 658 per cent in 2012. The decline was partly driven by the oil sector which contracted by 091 per cent. The major driver of overall growth, therefore, remained the non-oil sector, with agriculture; wholesale and retail trade; and services contributing 137, 219 and 210 percentage points, respectively. Domestic Economic and Financial Developments Output The Committee was satisfied with the relatively robust output growth projections for 2013 despite the slowing global economy, on the back of favorable conditions for increased agricultural production, the outcome of banking sector reforms, as well as other initiatives by government to stimulate the real economy. The Committee was concerned that the declining contribution of the oil sector to growth, which became apparent in the second half of 2011, continued in Q4 2012. Crude oil production, including condensates and natural gas liquids, decreased by 37,,000 barrels per day (bpd) in February 2013 to 2054m bpd compared with the level of 2072m bpd attained in December 2012. Oil theft in the Niger-Delta remained a source of concern. The Committee was 4 also concerned that the decline in the growth rate of agricultural output which started in the 4th quarter of 2011 continued up to the end of 2012. Crude oil production, including condensates and natural gas liquids, decreased by 37,,000 barrels per day (bpd) in February 3 2013 to 2035m bpd compared with the level of 2072m bpd attained in December 2012. The Committee was of the view that although the GDP growth projection remained high, there were a number of risk factors that were likely to affect output performance. These include perception of increased levels of corruption and impunity in the country, insecurity particularly in the northern part of the country, as well as mixed signals from power and petroleum sector reforms. The Committee was also concerned that the decline in the growth rate of agricultural output which started in the 4th quarter of 2011 continued up to the end of 2012. Prices Headline inflation which had decreased to a four-year low of 90 per cent in January 2013 inched up to 95 per cent in February, driven largely by the food component. Food inflation, which was 101 per cent in January 2013, increased by 087 percentage point in February due mainly to increases in the prices of farm produce and imported food items. Core inflation, however, moderated slightly between January and February 2013. The Committee noted that the sharp drop in inflation in early 2013 compared with early 2012 is largely a result of the base effect of the partial 5 removal of fuel subsidy in January 2012. With the tapering off of the first and second round effects of the increase, the prudent monetary policy stance and stable exchange rates are yielding lower headline inflation figures. Monetary Credit and Financial Market Developments Broad money supply (M2) grew by 286 per cent in February 2013 over the level at end-December 2012, which annualizes to 1716 per cent. Aggregate domestic credit (net) grew by 1017 per cent over the same period (an annualized rate of 6102 per cent). The significant growth in net credit in the period was due to the huge increase in credit to government (net), which rose by 10818 per cent. The Committee noted that the sharp drop in inflation in early 2013 compared with early 2012 is largely a result of the base effect of the partial removal of fuel subsidy in January 2012. With the tapering off of the first and second round 4 effects of the increase, the prudent monetary policy stance and stable exchange rates are yielding lower headline inflation figures. Interest rates in the interbank money market declined between January 21 and March 14, 2013 owing to liquidity surfeit in the banking system. The interbank call and the OBB rates, which opened at 1035 and 1033 per cent on January 21, closed at 1029 and 1028 per cent, respectively, on March 15, 2013. The average interbank call and OBB rates for the period were 1138 and 1123 per cent, respectively. The average prime lending rate 6 inched up slightly from 1654 per cent in December 2012 to 1656 in February 2013, while the maximum lending rate more or less remained flat at 2460 per cent during the period. The weighted average deposit rate, however, increased from 377 to 537 per cent during the review period. The Committee noted the upswing in activities in the capital market, as equities market indicators all trended upwards in the review period. The All-Share Index (ASI) increased by 173 per cent from 28,,07881 on December 31, 2012 to 32, 95008 on March 15, 2013 while Market Capitalization (MC) rose by 175 per cent, from N897 trillion to N1054 trillion. The Committee, however, observed that the improved performance was largely induced by the substantial portfolio inflows, as foreign investors took advantage of the favourable domestic environment brought about by the high yield on government debt instruments, and stability in the naira exchange rate. The average prime lending rate inched up slightly from 1654 per cent in December 2012 to 1656 in February 2013, while the maximum lending rate more or less remained flat at 2460 per cent during the period. External Sector Developments 7 At the Wholesale Dutch Auction System (wDAS), interbank and the BDC segments of the foreign exchange market, the exchange rate opened at N15729/US$. N15710/US$, and N15900/US$ on 22nd January 2013 and closed at N15732/US$. N15865/US$, and N16000/US$, respectively, on March 15, 2013. The average wDAS, interbank and BDC exchange rate during the period was N15730/US$. N15765/US$, and N15894/US$, respectively. The Committee noted the slight depreciation in the exchange rate at the wDAS and interbank segments of the foreign exchange market. The BDC segment, however, appreciated during the period due to the low patronage by speculators on account of the improved supply of foreign exchange by oil companies, increased inflow from portfolio investors, and the effect of the prohibition of the simultaneous access to the CBN window (Repo and Standing Lending Facility) and wDAS transactions by DMBs. The All- Share Index (ASI) increased by 173 per cent from 28,,07881 on December 31, 5 2012 to 32, 95008 on March 15, 2013 while Market Capitalization (MC) rose by 175 per cent, from N897 trillion to N1054 trillion. The Committee expressed satisfaction with the significant accretion to external reserves which stood at US$4938 billion as at March 14, 2013, representing an increase of US$ 55 billion or 1268 per cent over the level of US$4383 billion at end-December 2012. External Sector Developments At the Wholesale Dutch Auction System (wDAS), interbank and the BDC segments of the foreign exchange market, the exchange rate opened at N15729/US$. N15710/US$, and N15900/US$ on 22nd January 2013 and closed at N15732/US$. N15865/US$, and N16000/US$, respectively, on March 15, 2013. The BDC segment, however, appreciated during the period due to the low patronage by speculators on account of the improved supply of foreign exchange by oil companies, increased inflow from portfolio investors, and the effect of the prohibition of the simultaneous access to the CBN window (Repo and Standing Lending Facility) and wDAS transactions by DMBs. The Committee expressed satisfaction with the significant accretion to external reserves which stood at US$4938 billion as at March 14, 2013, representing an increase 6 of US$ 55 billion or 1268 per cent over the level of US$4383 billion at end- December 2012. The increase in reserves was driven largely by the proceeds from crude oil and gas sales and crude oil-related taxes, as well as reduced funding of the wDAS. The reserves level could finance over 13 months of imports. The increase in reserves was driven largely by the proceeds from 8 crude oil and gas sales and crude oil-related taxes, as well as reduced funding of the wDAS. The reserves level could finance over 13 months of imports. The Committee urged the Bank to continue the monitoring of portfolio and foreign direct investment flows, while being conscious of the risks to financial stability of a rapid outflow of hot money. Given the slowdown in overall GDP and agricultural GDP growth, inability of the SMEs to borrow at the current lending rates, and crowding out effects that may require monetary easing. The Committee carefully weighed the option of relaxing monetary policy against the likely risks in the near-to-medium term, noting that reversing the current stance of monetary policy was not likely to produce a neutral outcome, as it may signal the preference for a higher inflation rate on the part of the CBN. The Committee’s Considerations The Committee was pleased with the prevailing macroeconomic stability despite shocks from both external and domestic environments; a development which informed the tightening stance of monetary policy since the third quarter of 2010. Having achieved a reasonable degree of moderation in the rate of inflation, there were compelling arguments to consider easing monetary policy, at least from the perspective of stimulating growth in the real sector. Given the slowdown in overall GDP and agricultural GDP growth, inability of the SMEs to borrow at the current lending rates, and crowding out effects may require monetary easing. The Committee carefully weighed the option of relaxing monetary policy against the likely risks in the near-to- 9 medium term, noting that reversing the current stance of monetary policy was not likely to produce a neutral outcome, as it may signal the preference for a higher inflation rate on the part of the CBN. At 90 and 95 per cent in January and February, respectively, the price data, which largely reflected the base effect of the first and second round impact of the fuel subsidy removal in January 2012, sends a clear signal that there was still an upside risk to inflation in the near-to-medium term. Furthermore yields on FGN bonds have been declining steadily, signalling the impact of increased inflows while equity prices have been trending upwards. Quantitative easing, especially in the US and the EU is already creating a potential new round of asset bubbles globally. The Committee was of the view that the growth in the domestic capital market was driven largely by the huge capital flows. The principal risk of stability in the medium-to-long-term can be addressed through diligent implementation of sound policies of fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. Without these, the economy will not be able to attract long term foreign capital inflow that makes the 10 gains of monetary policy sustainable and insulate the economy from the risks associated with external shocks and capital flow reversals. Monetary policy will, therefore, seek to preserve the current gains of macroeconomic stability.

The Committee also noted the wide spread between deposits and lending rates, which it attributed to the inefficiencies in the market requiring institutional and structural reforms that would enforce behavioural change on the market, consistent with the long term needs of the economy. The Committee was of the view that sustainable low lending rates, could be achieved if the necessary infrastructure such as stable power and good roads, amongst others, were put in place. The Committee noted that the present infrastructural condition has always provided an incentive for asymmetric response on the part of the banks to the policy rate in a manner that was not always beneficial to the small and medium scale customers. With respect to the price level, the Committee observed that the rising pressure in February after a significant moderation in January, was 11 indicative of the fact that there were some underlying factors that could constitute a threat to inflation in the medium term.

The Committee noted the 2013 Federal Government Budget of N49 trillion, passed by the National Assembly and signed into law by the President, which represents an increase of about 5 per cent. In addition, the Committee observed that the foreign exchange market has started experiencing pressure in March 2013, mainly reflecting compression of yields in the fixed income market as well as outflows to pay dividends by multinational corporations. However the Committee noted that the exchange rate has remained within the target range and also that the current monetary conditions are conducive to further 9 tightening using Open Market Operations without recourse to an increase in the MPR. Furthermore the budget, predicated on an oil benchmark price of US$79/barrel as against US$75/barrel, proposed by the Executive, potentially slows down the pace of fiscal consolidation with implications for accretion to the Excess Crude Account and gross external reserves.

In view of these developments, the Committee was faced with three options: An increase in rates in response to the uptick in headline and food inflation; and pressure on exchange rates; A reduction in rates in view of declining core inflation and GDP growth; Retaining current monetary policy stance to sustain the gains of monetary policy while utilizing the existing space in the corridor to influence yields and exchange rates in the short term. 12 In view of these developments, the Committee was faced with three choices: An increase in rates in response to the uptick in headline and food inflation; and pressure on exchange rates; A reduction in rates in view of declining core inflation and GDP growth; Retaining current monetary policy stance to sustain the gains of monetary policy while utilizing the existing space in the corridor to influence yields and exchange rates in the short term. The Committee’s Decisions The Committee considered and rejected option 1 as being unnecessary since there are no major inflationary concerns at this time. While acknowledging the merit of the arguments in favour of option 2, it was also rejected by the majority because it could send wrong signals of a premature termination of an appropriately tight monetary stance. The Committee, therefore, decided by a majority vote of 9::3 to accept option 3 and maintain the current policy stance ie. to retain the MPR at 12 per cent with a corridor of +/- 200 basis points around the midpoint; retain the Cash Reserve Requirement at 12 per cent and Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent with the Net Open Position at 1 per cent.

CON Governor Central Bank of Nigeria 19th March 2013 PERSONAL STATEMENTS BY MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE MEMBERS 10 ALADE. SARAH Headline inflation decreased to 90 percent in January and edged up to 95 percent in February, 2013. This increase was driven mainly by increases in domestic food prices. In the international scene, the fiscal problems and budget cuts in the United States have the potential of dampening the pace of the global recovery. On the domestic front, the increase in the 2013 Budget benchmark oil price and the Government policy stance on the fuel subsidy regime remained possible pressure points and pose upside risks to inflation. Based on these. I am inclined to support a hold in Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) and Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR). 14 Global economic growth is still showing some signs of weakness. Global growth is projected to increase gradually in 2013 as policy actions in the euro zone have lowered the risk of severe crisis. However the cut-back in spending in the United States and the slide into recession in Japan pose risk to global growth prospects. In the euro area, although there is a return to recovery after a protracted contraction, low domestic demand and fiscal contraction in some European countries could delay economic recovery. In the emerging markets, coordinated policies have resulted in a modest growth pickup especially in China and Brazil, while growth in India remained weak. These mixed developments call for a cautious approach to monetary policy at this time, until conditions stabilize. The single digit inflation should be viewed with cautious optimism. Even with the achievement of single digit inflation in January and February 2013, tight monetary policy is still necessary to safeguard the economy as staff estimates suggest an upward trend in the coming months. The achievement of single digit inflation is a welcome development, signifying the benefit of past monetary policy actions and overall policy coordination that have helped 15 to sustain the improvement recorded in macroeconomic indicators. While there are strong arguments for monetary easing at this point, to aid credit creation and flows to the real sector of the economy among others, inflation edged up to 95 percent in February. In addition, monetary policy cannot be the sole cause of the lack of credit flow to the real sector. With risks such as depressed global growth and uncertainties in the domestic economy, a hasty monetary easing may not be in the interest of economic stability. It is well known that structural imbalances in the economy play a major role in the determination of high borrowing cost and without tackling these problems, there is a limit to what monetary policy can do. In addition, with the start of the raining season and commencement of the planting season, further upward pressures would be put on domestic food prices and overall headline inflation in the coming months, as consumable supplies dwindle. Available data showed increasing liquidity in the banking system. Money market rates have remained lower than the monetary policy rate and banks deposit in the Standing Deposit Facility with the Central Bank has been very high. Similarly average open buy 16 back (OBB) and interbank call rates averaged 113 percent and 103 percent respectively since the last Monetary Policy Committee meeting in January, suggesting liquidity in the banking system. This development coupled with anticipated upward inflationary pressure would suggest that monetary easing at this time is premature. The uncertainty surrounding oil prices could pose serious risk to the Budget. The 2013 Budget signed into law by the President was based on the oil price benchmark of US$7900 per barrel as recommended by the National Assembly in contrast to the US$7500 per barrel recommended by the Executive Arm of Government. The continued slow-down in global growth and increased domestic oil production in the United States have the tendency of lowering oil prices in the global market. This could have far reaching implications for the Nigeria economy in terms of decreased oil revenue; increased debt; and adverse consequences for external reserve build-up and volatility in the exchange rate. This would have a destabilizing effect on the economy and could undermine the policy gains of the past couple of years. 17 Base on the above. I recommend a hold on Monetary Policy Rate and Cash Reserve Requirement. In a situation of renewed inflationary pressure and weak global growth, there is a need for cautious approach to monetary policy and monetary easing at this time could be counterproductive. .0 BARAU. SULEIMAN Background Having deeply observed developments in the domestic and global economy since the last Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting. I have come to the conclusion that no significant event has happened to make a change in the current stance of monetary policy. have therefore, today, voted to maintain the status quo. Developments/Discussion Inflation – It is true that Headline Inflation trended down to single digit at 90% in January 2013. However the fact that it went up to 954% in February does support my position that we need to observe consistent declining trend for all measures of inflation overtime for us to consider a change in our tightening stance. We 18 currently have mixed signals. While core Inflation trended down from 1130% in January to 1118% in February. Food Inflation increased from 1010% in January to 1097% in February. Imported Inflation also trended up to 1433% in February from 1410% in January. The direction is therefore not very clear. There is also the possibility of further inflationary pressure from liquidity injection due to the commencement of the implementation of the 2013 Budget. Upside risk to inflation may also come from higher electricity tariff, the effect of duty and higher tariff on rice import amongst others. Exchange Rate: Exchange rates have been stable but we have recorded recent build-up of demand pressures, which led to mild depreciation across all market segments. The Interbank and BDC segments of the market saw exchange rates also depreciating by 1% and 063% respectively as a result of demand and supply factors. GDP Growth: Nigeria‟s GDP growth of 658% in 2012, though slightly lower than the level in 2011 was remarkably higher than global 19 GDP growth rate of 3. 2% and Sub-Saharan African average of 48%. This strong growth level (though arguably below potential) was achieved inspite of the tight monetary policy regime in 2012. It is true that accommodative policy should generally help to elicit better growth performance, but what is required to unleash Nigeria‟s growth potential are the necessary real sector reforms and the removal of market distortions that should elicit better pricing of capital and other assets. In other words, access to cheap finance is necessary but not sufficient to elicit sustained growth. Structural reforms have to be implemented to gravitate towards growth enhancing sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing, among others. Interest Rates: Market rates have been largely stable albeit taking a recent declining trend. The decline in my view is due to a combination of factors: - Current liquidity in the system; - Expectations of liquidity injection; and - Expectation of reversal of tightening stance through the lowering of policy rates by MPC. 20 With inflation rate at 95% in February real interest rates have continued to be positive. But the decline in market rates has two significant implications for policy consideration: - Yields on Government Bonds have trended downward with significant possible impact on profits; - We are becoming less attractive to foreign investors seeking destinations that offer attractive return on investment. This has led to decline in foreign portfolio inflows and may impact negatively on further build-up of foreign reserves and the exchange rate stability. The MPC is aware of the very obvious risks associated with foreign portfolio inflows and many would argue that being a less attractive destination for such flows is a positive development. am happy to note, however, that while MPC does not target portfolio inflows, their positive impact on the build-up of foreign reserves, stability of the exchange rate and creation of liquidity in the capital market have been noted. The risks associated with such inflows in the management of foreign reserves and exchange rates are very well noted and appropriate measures would be taken in due course to mitigate them. What is also required is the complementary measures in the capital market to remove the possibility of asset price bubble as well as possibly ensuring that exits are well controlled and managed. Foreign Reserves: At US $493billion, the foreign reserves position is at a healthy level and is sufficient to accommodate 13 months of import. The healthy growth has been on the back of good oil prices and significant portfolio inflows. The healthy foreign reserves position has supported the stability of exchange rates. 21 Riding on the back of increased market liquidity and portfolio inflows, we have recently witnessed increased demand pressure at all foreign exchange market segments. The maintenance of the current tightening stance would help to ensure the continued stability of the exchange rate and sustained build-up of foreign reserves. Market Expectation/Sentiment: Recent commentaries in the media understandably favoured reduction in MPR and the possible adoption of accommodative (effectively a reversal of current tight stance) monetary policy stance. This view is perhaps predicated, as I understand it, on the following points; - MPC has maintained the existing stance of policy for over a year; - It is probably somehow boring; - The decline in inflation rate in January, buildup of foreign reserves and stability of exchange rates at this point in time; and - The high lending rates and their adverse impact on economic growth. have the following response to these issues, not in any particular order: 22 - MPC decisions are not based on emotions or sentiments. MPC members are presented with current numbers and facts on local and global developments. Members factor in pressure points and review outlook in order to take well guided decisions. After a careful review of where we are and the outlook, it is my judgment that we should maintain the status quo. MPC decision is about rational choice. It is about price and monetary stability. We had, in my judgment, focused on inflation and exchange rate with modestly profound outcomes. Lending rates are unacceptably high because of the unusually high cost of doing business in Nigeria which current efforts at structural reforms would help to reduce. Fixing the structural issues would have a salutary effect on our growth trajectory. It will also help to deliver more acceptable lending rates. The MPC and the Central Bank of Nigeria would continue to promote price and monetary stability conducive to growth. The limitation of monetary policy must, however, be recognized by the market. Conclusion It is in the light of the foregoing that I voted as follows: Maintain MPR at 12% with the corridor of +/- 200 basis points Maintain Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) at 12% Maintain Net Open Position (NOP) limit at 1%. .0 GARBA.

India,2013-03-19,"Mid-Quarter Monetary Policy Review: March 2013 Monetary and Liquidity Measures Based on an assessment of the current macroeconomic situation, it has been decided to: reduce the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 25 basis points from 7.75 per cent to 7.5 per cent with immediate effect; Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF stands adjusted to 6.5 per cent and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate to 8.5 per cent with immediate effect. Introduction 2. Since the Reserve Bank's Third Quarter Review (TQR) of January 2013, global financial market conditions have improved, but global economic activity has weakened. On the domestic front too, growth has decelerated significantly, even as inflation remains at a level which is not conducive for sustained economic growth. Although there has been notable softening of non-food manufactured products inflation, food inflation remains high, driving a wedge between wholesale price and consumer price inflation, and is exacerbating the challenge for monetary management in anchoring inflationary expectations. 12012 indicate a tentative upturn on the back of improvement in housing and payroll employment. However. US macroeconomic prospects are clouded by the uncertainty surrounding the temporary appropriations and the debt ceiling. In the euro area, plagued by contingent risks of political uncertainty and adjustment fatigue. GDP shrank for the third successive quarter in Q4. Output in Japan too contracted in Q4, and it is as yet unclear how effective the emerging package of stimulus measures will be and how quickly they will turn around the economy. While some emerging and developing economies (EDEs), including China, are gradually returning to faster growth, activity is slowing in others, hobbled by weak external demand and slack domestic investment. International non-fuel commodity prices have softened in Q4, but fuel prices have remained firm, despite the growth slowdown, portending persisting inflationary pressures, particularly for net energy importers. Domestic Economy Growth 4. India's GDP growth in Q3 of 2012-13, at 4.5 per cent, was the weakest in the last 15 quarters. What is worrisome is that the services sector growth, hitherto the mainstay of overall growth, has also decelerated to its slowest pace in a decade. While overall industrial production growth turned positive in January, capital goods production and mining activity continued to contract. The composite purchasing managers' index (PMI) declined in February, largely reflecting slower expansion in services. In the agriculture sector, the second advance estimates of kharif production indicate a decline in relation to the level last year. However, that may be offset, at least partly, by the rabi output for which sowing has been satisfactory. 23 from 6.6 per cent in January, essentially reflecting the upward revisions effected to administered prices of petroleum products. On the other hand, non-food manufactured products inflation, and its momentum, continued to ebb along the trajectory that began in September 2012, enabled by softening prices of metals, textiles and rubber products. Worryingly, retail inflation continued on the upward path that set in from October 2012, with the new combined (rural and urban) CPI (Base: 2010=100) inflation at a high of 10.9 per cent in February 2013 on sustained price pressures from food items, especially cereals and proteins. Consequently, the divergence between wholesale and consumer price inflation continued to widen during the year. Monetary and Liquidity Conditions 6. Money supply (M ) and bank credit growth have broadly moved in alignment 3 with their revised indicative trajectories. With government cash balances with the Reserve Bank persisting at a higher than normal level, the liquidity deficit, as reflected by the net drawals by banks under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF), has remained above the indicative comfort zone. The reduction in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of banks by 25 basis points, effective from February 9 and open market purchases of 200 billion since February have enabled money market rates to remain anchored to the policy repo rate. The Reserve Bank will continue to actively manage liquidity through various instruments, including open market operations (OMO), so as to ensure adequate flow of credit to productive sectors of the economy. 34 has made a firm commitment to fiscal consolidation. According to the revised budget estimates for 2012-13, the gross fiscal deficit (GFD)-GDP ratio, at 5.2 per cent, was contained around its budgeted level, mainly by scaling down plan and capital expenditures. The GFD-GDP ratio is programmed to decline to 4.8 per cent in 2013-14 and further down to 3.0 per cent by 2016-17, in line with the revised road map for fiscal consolidation. External Sector 8. With merchandise exports recording positive growth for the second successive month in February and non-oil imports contracting, the trade deficit narrowed significantly. For April-February 2012-13, however, the trade deficit was higher than its level a year ago with adverse implications for the current account deficit (CAD), already at a record high. Although capital inflows, mainly in the form of portfolio investment and debt flows, provided adequate financing, the growing vulnerability of the external sector to abrupt shifts in sentiment remains a key concern. Outlook 9. There are several risks to the global outlook. The impact of sequestration in the US on the global economy is likely to be muted in view of legislation initiated to avert the debt ceiling. Nevertheless, lead indicators point to sluggish global growth. Political economy risks that block or delay credible and determined policy actions in advanced economies (AEs) are inhibiting recovery. For EDEs, risks of spillovers from AEs remain significant. While global inflationary pressures are likely to be subdued, given still large output gaps, several EDEs could potentially face the threat of elevated energy prices. 45.0 per cent, lower than the Reserve Bank's baseline projection of 5.5 per cent set out in the TQR, reflecting slower than expected growth in both industry and services. Key to reinvigorating growth is accelerating investment. The government has a critical role to play in this regard by remaining committed to fiscal consolidation, easing the supply bottlenecks and improving governance surrounding project implementation. On the inflation front, some softening of global commodity prices and lower pricing power of corporates domestically is moderating non-food manufactured products inflation. However, the unrelenting rise in food inflation is keeping headline wholesale price inflation above the threshold level and consumer price inflation in double digits. Also, there is still some suppressed inflation related to administered prices which carries latent inflationary pressures. All this complicates the task of inflation management and underscores the imperative of addressing supply constraints. From an inflation perspective, upward revisions in the minimum support prices (MSP) should warrant caution in view of their implications for overall inflation. On the external sector front, the key challenge is to reduce the CAD, which is well above the sustainable threshold. This adjustment, requiring as it does, measures to improve the competitiveness of exports and wean away demand for unproductive imports, will inevitably take time. Meanwhile, financing of the CAD with stable flows remains a challenge. 565 Chief General Manager 6."
United States,2013-03-20,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January suggests a return to moderate economic growth following a pause late last year. Labor market conditions have shown signs of improvement in recent months but the unemployment rate remains elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector has strengthened further, but fiscal policy has become somewhat more restrictive. Inflation has been running somewhat below the Committee's longer-run objective, apart from temporary variations that largely reflect fluctuations in energy prices. Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will proceed at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee continues to see downside risks to the economic outlook. The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely will run at or below its 2 percent objective. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months. The Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability. In determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, the Committee will continue to take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases as well as the extent of progress toward its economic objectives. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens. In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; James Bullard; Elizabeth A Duke; Charles L Evans; Jerome H Powell; Sarah Bloom Raskin; Eric S Rosengren; Jeremy C Stein; Daniel K Tarullo; and Janet L Yellen. Voting against the action was Esther L George, who was concerned that the continued high level of monetary accommodation increased the risks of future economic and financial imbalances and, over time, could cause an increase in long-term inflation expectations."
South Africa,2013-03-20,"South African Reserve Bank PRESS STATEMENT EMBARGO DELIVERY 20 March 2013 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Gill Marcus. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank There are a number of key developments that this meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) had to consider, not least among them on the domestic front the challenge of moderate growth, rising inflation, a depreciated currency, a wider current account deficit as well as difficult labour relations and unemployment that remains stubbornly high. Since the previous meeting of the MPC the domestic inflation outlook has deteriorated slightly. Risks posed by the depreciation of the rand exchange rate have overshadowed the more favourable developments, including lower electricity price increases and some moderation in food price inflation. Nevertheless inflation is expected to remain contained within the target range apart from a temporary breach in the third quarter of 2013. The domestic 2 economic growth prospects remain fragile amid continued tensions in the labour market, particularly in the mining sector. The global economy is still characterised by a multispeed recovery. However, recent events in Europe, particularly as they affect Cyprus, have increased risk and uncertainty in the region, and have the potential to reignite the banking and sovereign debt crisis and undermine growth prospects further. The global outlook is also clouded by the fiscal gridlock in the United States that remains unresolved. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas was 5,9 per cent in February 2013, up from 5,4 per cent in January. The upside surprise in the February was mainly due to the increase in medical insurance costs, which resulted in the contribution to CPI from miscellaneous goods and services increasing from 0,7 percentage points to 1,1 percentage points. This category also impacted on core inflation, which increased markedly from 4,7 per cent in January to 5,3 per cent in February. Petrol prices also contributed to the upward trend having increased by 11,9 per cent. Food price inflation measured 6,3 per cent, down from a recent high of 7,5 per cent in November 2012, and its contribution to overall inflation declined from 1,0 percentage points to 0,9 percentage points. Administered prices increased by 8,9 3 per cent, and by 7,5 per cent excluding petrol, year-on-year. The producer price inflation for final manufactured goods measured 5,8 per cent in January1. The inflation forecast of the Bank reflects a slight deterioration in the inflation outlook for 2013 compared with the previous forecast. The forecasts incorporate the new CPI weights and rebasing announced by Statistics South Africa, as well as the lower electricity price increase of 8 per cent granted to Eskom by Nersa. Inflation is now expected to average 5,9 per cent in 2013 and 5,3 per cent in 2014, compared with the previous forecasts of 5,8 per cent and 5,2 per cent for these respective years. Inflation is expected to breach temporarily the upper end of the target range in the third quarter of 2013, when it is expected to average 6,3 per cent, and then to moderate gradually to 5,2 per cent in the final quarter of 2014. This deterioration is largely due to the depreciation of the rand and higher petrol prices, which more than offset the impact of the lower electricity price increases and a lower starting point. The forecast of core inflation is more or less unchanged for 2013 but higher for 2014, yet still indicates the continued absence of significant demand pressures. This measure is expected to peak at 5,1 per cent in the second quarter of 2014, and to average 4,8 per cent and 4,9 per cent in 2013 and 2014, respectively. This 1 Statistics South Africa has adopted a “stages-of-production” concept for the PPI and no longer produces one aggregated series. The five producer price series are PPI for final manufactured goods; intermediate manufactured goods; electricity and water; mining; and agriculture, forestry and fishing. The PPI for final manufactured goods is regarded as best representing the effects of price changes through the five stages of production. 4 forecast is likely to be adjusted upwards in the light of the increase in medical insurance costs announced earlier today. Inflation expectations as reflected in the Reuters survey of analysts conducted in February 2013 have remained more or less unchanged since December. Expectations remained anchored within the target range but close to the upper end, and, as with the Bank's forecast, the peak is expected in the third quarter of 2013. The global economic outlook presents a mixed picture following a disappointing fourth quarter in most of the advanced economies. Recent data from the United States indicate positive trends in the labour market and household consumption expenditure due in part to positive wealth effects from the housing and equity markets. However, uncertainty about the possible negative impulse from fiscal tightening continues amid political differences over fiscal policy. Economic growth is still expected to remain below trend in 2013. The outlook for some of South Africa's other main advanced-economy trading partners is less positive. The Eurozone remains in recession, and is not expected to recover before mid-2013 at the earliest. The tail risks from a sovereign debt crisis appeared to have subsided, but the uncertainty created by the inconclusive Italian general election, and the crisis in Cyprus, have renewed concerns about. The tail risks from a sovereign debt crisis appeared to have subsided, but the uncertainty created by the inconclusive Italian general election, and the crisis in Cyprus, have renewed concerns about 5 the stability of the region. The outlook for the UK economy remains subdued against the backdrop of continued fiscal austerity. Growth prospects in the Asian economies are more positive. The Japanese economy is expected to be bolstered by positive consumer sentiment in response to fiscal and monetary stimuli, but the response on the capital expenditure side is still cautious. Nevertheless an improved growth performance is expected, particularly given the 18 per cent depreciation of the yen against the US dollar since October 2012. Growth in China is expected to be sustained at relatively robust levels as fixed investment expenditure remains strong despite a moderation in consumption expenditure growth. Growth in other emerging markets remains positive. These trends suggest that monetary policy in the advanced economies will remain accommodative for some time despite recent fears in the financial markets of an early reversal of quantitative easing in the US. The relatively weak growth outlook in the advanced economies has contributed to the subdued global inflation environment. The exchange rate of the rand continues to pose the main upside risk to the inflation outlook. Since the beginning of the year, the rand has depreciated by 8,4 per cent against the US dollar and fluctuated within a range of R8,45 and R9,26. However, given the significant realignment of global currencies, and particularly. However, given the significant realignment of global currencies, and particularly 6 the depreciation of the Japanese yen and the pound sterling against the US dollar, the trade weighted depreciation since the beginning of the year was more moderate at 5,6 per cent. Domestic factors contributing to the recent rand depreciation include continued work stoppages in parts of the mining sector, which also have the potential to disrupt electricity supplies, and the further widening of the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments, which measured 6,3 per cent in 2012. Some narrowing of the deficit is expected during the course of the year in response to the depreciation, although the degree of response will be constrained by weak demand from advanced economies as well as strong infrastructure-related import demands. Mining export growth will also be dependent on the resolution of labour market issues with a resumption of full production, and on the extent of possible shaft closures. Equity and bond flows to emerging economies have generally moderated in the past few months, making for a more challenging global environment for financing the deficit. Inflows into South African bond and equity markets have, however, been sustained, and year-to-date non-resident net purchases of equities and government bonds have totaled R6,1 bn and R11,3 bn respectively. These flows have, however, been volatile, and the growing proportion of bonds owned by non-residents, currently around 37 per cent of the total outstanding stock of debt could constrain the pace of inflows. 7 The rand is likely to remain sensitive to both domestic and global developments. The exchange rate is expected to remain volatile and subject to overshooting, and further sustained depreciation would increase the upside risk to the inflation outlook. The Reuters Econometer survey conducted in February shows that most analysts still expect the rand to appreciate from current levels during the year, although the degree of dispersion is indicative of the uncertainty around these forecasts. According to this survey, the consensus forecast for the rand/US$ exchange rate at the end of 2013 is R8,61, with a range of forecasts between R9,19 and R7,80. Domestic growth prospects remain relatively subdued notwithstanding a better- than-expected fourth quarter GDP growth outcome and positive developments in the mining and manufacturing sectors in January. The economy grew by 2,5 per cent in 2012, having recorded annualised growth of 2,1 per cent in the fourth quarter, despite a 9,3 per cent contraction in the mining sector. The moderate pace of recovery is expected to continue in 2013. The Bank's forecast is for growth of 2,7 per cent this year, marginally up from the previous forecast of 2,6 per cent, and 3,7 per cent in 2014, compared with a previous forecast of 3,8 per cent. The risks to these forecasts are assessed to be on the downside. The flat trajectory of the Bank's leading indicator of economic activity is consistent with this forecast. Growth this year is therefore expected to remain. Growth this year is therefore expected to remain 8 below potential output growth of 3,5 per cent, and this is expected to result in a slight widening of the Bank's revised estimate of the output gap which, at 2,0 per cent, reflects the continued subdued state of the economy. The mining sector recorded year-on-year growth of 7,3 per cent in January, with 3-month-on-3-month growth of 5,4 per cent following four consecutive months of contraction. Neverthless the sector is expected to remain under pressure given the unsettled labour relations environment. The outlook for manufacturing appears to have improved, but this recovery is still very tentative. The sector grew at a year-on-year rate of 3,9 per cent in January, and by 1,8 per cent on a 3-month-on-3-month basis. This was consistent with improvements in the Kagiso Purchasing Managers Index, which increased from 49,1 in January to 53,6 in February. Growth in gross fixed capital formation, which measured 5,7 per cent in 2012, has been on a moderate upward trend since 2009, driven mainly by investment growth of around 9 per cent by public corporations and general government. Private sector investment growth moderated from 4,6 per cent in 2011 to 3,9 per cent in 2012 due in part to excess capacity in manufacturing and electricity supply constraints. While household consumption expenditure has been the main driver of growth since 2010, its contribution to growth has been diminishing. The general absence 9 of demand pressures in the economy is reflected in the continued moderation in the growth in real consumption expenditure by households, which grew by 3,5 per cent in 2012 compared with 4,8 per cent in 2011. Nevertheless, growth in consumption of durable goods remained robust at 11 per cent, compared with demand for services which grew at only 1,8 per cent in 2012. Sales of new motor vehicles declined on both a month-on-month and on a three-month-on-three- month basis in February. Retail trade sales in January appear to reflect this weakening trend, with a 3- month-on-3-month decline of 0,7 per cent, and a lower than expected year-on- year increase of 1,9 per cent. There are indications that consumption growth may moderate further in 2013 amid slower real income growth, higher inflation, elevated household debt levels, and a possible slow-down in credit extension to consumers. Twelve-month growth in banks' total loans and advances to the private sector measured 8,9 per cent in January, following growth of 10,0 per cent in December. Loans and advances to the corporate sector grew by 7,5 per cent in January, and to the household sector by 9,9 per cent. Growth in general loans to households - mainly unsecured lending - moderated to 30,1 per cent following a recent peak growth of 39,3 per cent in June. General loans to households amounted to 8,3 per cent of total loans and advances, and 14,6 per cent of loans and advances to household. Growth in this category of lending is likely to be. Growth in this category of lending is likely to be 10 constrained by lower income growth and high household debt levels. Household debt to disposable income measured 75,8 per cent in the final quarter of 2012. Non-mortgage debt as a percentage of total household debt increased from 37 per cent in the third quarter of 2009 to 46 per cent in the final quarter of 2012. The trend in wage settlements remains an upside risk to the inflation outlook, although recent data is somewhat contradictory. The minimum wage in the agricultural sector has been increased by 52,2 per cent, and indications from the Andrew Levy Employment Publications are that wage settlements in collective bargaining agreements picked up significantly from 6,8 per cent in the third quarter of 2012 to 8,2 per cent in the fourth quarter. According to Statistics South Africa, average salaries and wages per worker in the non-agricultural sector increased over four quarters by 7,0 per cent in the final quarter of 2012, down from 8,9 per cent in the previous quarter, while unit labour cost increases declined from 7,4 per cent to 5,7 per cent in the same period. The MPC remains concerned about the possible impact of excessively high wage increases on employment growth. Employment in the formal non-agricultural sector increased by 1,0 per cent during 2012, compared with annual employment growth of 1,6 per cent in 2011. This included employment growth of 0,2 per cent in the mining and quarrying industry and a 0,3 per cent contraction in the manufacturing sector. In the fourth quarter of 2012 mining sector employment increased by 1,000 employees, following a decline of 16,000 in the third quarter. 11 Of concern is the seasonally adjusted annualised decline of 0,7 per cent in total non-agricultural employment during the fourth quarter of 2012. The recent national government budget tabled before parliament reflects a difficult balance between a commitment to medium-term fiscal consolidation and the need for counter-cyclical policy. The projected deficit of 5,7 per cent for the past fiscal year was wider than initially budgeted for, a result of lower revenue due to weaker economic growth. The fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP is budgeted to be 5,1 per cent in the 2013/14 fiscal year, and to decline to 3,6 per cent by 2015/16. The government net debt/GDP ratio is expected to stabilise at around 40 per cent in 2015/16, well below the international benchmark for debt sustainability of around 60 per cent. There are indications that the pressures on inflation emanating from food prices may be moderating. Food price inflation at the consumer price level declined from a recent high of 7,5 per cent in November 2012 to 6,4 per cent in January and 6,3 per cent in February. A similar trend is evident at the producer price level where manufactured food inflation declined to 5,9 per cent in January, compared with a recent peak of 11,1 per cent in November 2012. Similarly, producer price inflation in agricultural products moderated from a recent high of 6,3 per cent in October 2012 to 3,5 per cent in January. Global agricultural commodity prices have declined on average by almost 20 per cent since their recent peak in. Global agricultural commodity prices have declined on average by almost 20 per cent since their recent peak in 12 August 2012, and expectations are for further moderation in the absence of adverse weather shocks. Administered prices continue to put upside pressure on inflation, although lower electricity price increases from the third quarter will dampen some of these pressures. The petrol price, which has increased by a cumulative R1,24 per litre since January 2013, remains an upside risk. Although global oil prices have declined over the past few weeks, resulting in an over-recovery of the petrol price so far this month, it is unlikely to be sufficient to offset the adverse exchange rate impacts and the fuel levy increases, and a further increase in the petrol price is likely in April. The MPC continues to assess the balance of risks to the inflation outlook to be on the upside, mainly due to the exchange rate and wage pressures. These upside risks are mitigated in part by lower risk from food price inflation. Underlying inflation appears to be relatively contained, consistent with the moderating trend in consumption expenditure by households. The economic growth outlook is more or less unchanged from the previous meeting of the MPC, and risks to the outlook remain on the downside. The unresolved labour disputes in the mining sector pose a significant risk to the exchange rate and to economic growth through their negative impact on export revenues, employment growth and investor perceptions of South Africa. 13 However, the depreciated exchange rate provides an opportunity for the manufacturing sector in particular to become more competitive despite the challenging export environment. Ensuring that this increase in competitiveness is sustained will require improved productivity and the containment of wage and other cost pressures, which underlines the need to keep inflation under control. The MPC continues to assess the monetary policy stance to be appropriately accommodative given the persistence of the negative output gap. At the same time, further accommodation remains constrained by the upside risks to the inflation outlook. The MPC has therefore decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 5,0 per cent per annum. The Committee will continue to apply monetary policy consistent with its mandate of price stability within a flexible inflation targeting framework.

Egypt,2013-03-21,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release March 21, 2013 In its meeting held on March 21, 2013, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate by 50 basis points to 975 percent and 1075 percent, respectively, and raise the rate of the CBE's main operation* by 50 basis points to 1025 percen. The discount rate was raised by 75 basis points to 1025 percen. Headline CPI increased by 250 percent (m/m) in February following an increase of 169 percent (m/m) in Januar. This comes as the highest monthly increase since August 2010, pushing the annual rate to 821 percent from 466 percent recorded in December 201. On the other hand, core CPI increased by 286 percent (m/m) in February following an increase of 131 percent (m/m) in Januar. This also comes as the highest monthly increase since August 2010, pushing the annual rate to jump to 768 percent in February up from 444 percent in December 201. The latest monthly developments in both headline and core inflation were largely driven by broad based increases in food and non‐food prices on the back of the recent movements in the exchange rate and diesel distribution bottlenecks across the countr. While the probability of a rebound in international food prices is less likely in light of recent global developments, the re‐emergence of local supply bottlenecks and distortions in the distribution channels pose upside risks to the inflation outloo. Meanwhile real GDP grew by 24 percent in 2012/2013 H1, following a similarly feeble growth rate of 22 percent in 2011/201. This nascent recovery in economic activity came on the back of tentative signs of recovery in the construction and tourism sector. Nonetheless GDP growth remains to be partly suppressed by continuing weaknesses, albeit of lesser extent, in the manufacturing secto. In the meantime, given the heightened uncertainty that faced market participants since early 2011, investment levels remained lo. Looking ahead, the current political transformation may continue to have ramifications on both consumption as well as investment decisions, adversely weighing on key sectors within the econom. Moreover downside risks continue to surround the global recovery on the back of challenges facing the Euro Are. These factors, combined, pose downside risks to domestic GDP going forwar. The CBEs main operations would be Repos or Deposit Auctions depending on the prevailing market liquidity condition. While the slowdown in economic growth has been limiting upside risks to the inflation outlook, there is a possible build‐up of upward pressures on inflation going forward for the previously mentioned reason. Despite the downside risks to the GDP outlook, the MPC judges that disanchored inflation expectations are more detrimental to the economy over the medium ter. Hence a rate hike is warrante. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium‐ter. Dr Rania Al‐Mashat Sub Governor.

Israel,2013-03-24,"To view as Word doc. Currency (Unit) Rate Daily Change. Nominal Effective Rate -0.085%. In accordance with the Monetary Committee's decision of January 28, 2013, this interest rate will be in effect for April and May, 2013. Background conditions Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for February remained unchanged, in line with forecasts. The rate of increase in the CPI over the past 12 months remained essentially unchanged compared to recent months, at 1.5 percent. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Forecasters' inflation projections for the next twelve months, as well as inflation expectations based on over-the-counter CPI futures contractsoffered by banks, were 1.8 percent on average, similar to their level lastmonth. Inflation expectations for the next twelve months calculated from the capital markets (breakeven inflation), seasonally adjusted, remained stable at 2 percent. Inflation expectations for short terms (2-3 years) were unchanged at 2.4 percent, while expectations for the medium term declined slightly from previous months. Expectations for longer terms declinedfrom 2.4 percent to 2.3 percent, continuing the marked decline of last month (from 2.8 percent to 2.4 percent). Expectations for the Bank of Israel interest rate one year from now derived from the Telbor (Tel Aviv Inter-BankOffered Rate) market, and expectations based on the average projection of forecasters, are for an interest rate of 1.6 percent and 1.75 percent, respectively. Real economic activity: Updated indicators of economic activity in February point toward continuation of theimprovement which began to be seen in January. Most indicators which became available this month are positive: the Business Tendency Survey indicates that there was improvement in activity in February, continuing thatof the previous month. Similarly, the Climate Index indicates a continuation of the positive trend in the business sector, and the Composite State ofthe Economy Index increased in February at a rate similar to that of the previous month, and the growth rate is relatively high compared with the final quarter of 2012. The industrial production index increased by 5.7 percent in January, and the Purchasing Managers Index increased and reached the level indicating expansion in manufacturing industry. Most consumer confidence indices increased. Tax revenues in January-February were in linewith the seasonal path consistent with the growth estimate of 3.8 percent.With that, it is likely that the positive picture derives from a correction from the weakness in the final quarter of 2012, which stemmed from, amongother things, security issues, and it is too early to tell if this is a change in trend. The labor market: Labor market data which became available this month indicate stability in employment for January. Labor force survey data for January indicate a decline of 0.3 percentage points in the unemployment rate, to 6.5 percent, with a decline of 0.2 percentage points in the participation rate. There was a slight decline as well in the unemployment rate among the main employment ages of 25-64, to 5.5 percent. Unemployment data are consistent with figures of theIsraeli Employment Service, which reported a decline in the number of unemployed and laid off workers in January. Employers' expectations in various industries reported in the Business Tendency Survey for February present a mixed picture for the changes in the number of employed people in the coming 3 months. This was in line with the decline of 7 percent in February in the number of available posts. Nominal wages increased by 1.3 percent and real wages increased by 0.9 percent in the fourth quarter, based on seasonally adjusted data. Health tax receipts by the National Insurance Institute, which provide an indication of nominal wage payments, were 5.4 percent higher in December-February than in the corresponding period of the previous year, reflecting a slowdown compared with an average year over year increase of 6.4 percent in the preceding 3 month period. The Bank of IsraelResearch Department staff forecast: This month, the Bank of Israel Research Department updated its macroeconomic forecast. (A separate <a href a.aspx>press release presenting the forecast is issued together with this notice.) According to itsprojection, the inflation rate over the 4 quarters ending in the first quarter of 2014 will be 1.7 percent, the Bank of Israel interest rate, which was 1.75 percent when the forecast was formulated, is expected to remain at that level in the coming year, and GDP is expected to grow by 3.8 percent in 2013, assuming that production of natural gas from the Tamar field beginsas expected during the second quarter of 2013 (similar to the previous forecast). Excluding the effect of natural gas production from Tamar, growth is projected to be 2.8 percent. Growth in 2014 is forecast to be 4.0 percent (3.3 percent excluding the effect of natural gas production from Tamar), aprojection which reflects an acceleration in activity, influenced by the expected recovery worldwide. Gas production requires a small number of workers, so that the developments expected in employment and unemployment will primarily be impacted by growth of GDP excluding gas production. Budget data: In February, the government operated without an approved budget framework and in accordance with the law allowing it to spend 1/12 of the overall 2012 budget each month in 2013 (including debt repayments), until a budget framework is approved. The cumulative deficit from the beginning of the year is about NIS 1.3 billion, about NIS 4.1 billion greater than the seasonal path consistent with the deficit of 3.6 percent of GDP derived from the fiscal rule and tax rates set in law. An examination of the spending commitments for 2013 made in past years indicates that in order to abide by the expenditure rule, the government must reduce the commitments by about NIS 13 billion (about 1.3 percent of GDP). Even after such cuts, this is still a real expansion of about 4.5 percent compared with the 2012 budget. Deviation in the government deficit is liable to lead to increased interest rates in the economy. The foreign exchange market: FromFebruary 24, 2013, through March 20, 2013, the shekel appreciated by about 0.84 percent against the dollar, and by 2.9 percent against the euro. In terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, the shekel appreciated by about 1.95 percent during the period. The shekel's strength against the dollar during the month was in contrast to the dollar's trend worldwide. The capital and money markets: From February 24, 2013, through March 20, 2013, the Tel Aviv 25 Index increased by about 2.3 percent. Yields on government bonds increased moderately, and the yield differential between 10-year Israeli government bonds and equivalent 10-year US Treasury securities widened by about 5 basis points, to 209 basis points. Makam yields increased slightly along most of the curve by up to 6 basis points, with one-year yields increasing to 1.66 percent during the period. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spread was unchanged at 122 basis points. The Tel-Bond 60 Indexincreased moderately by about 0.1 percent over the period. Spreads in the corporate bond market widened for companies with lower ratings. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in February, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 12.9 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 6.9 percent. Developments in the credit markets: The outstanding debt of the business sector declined by 0.3 percent in January, from NIS 779 billion to NIS 776 billion. Total outstanding credit to households increased in January by 0.3 percent, to NIS 386 billion. The total volume of new mortgages granted in February was NIS 3.9 billion, similar to January. The balance of housing debt was NIS 271 billion in January, an increase of 7.1 percent compared with January 2012. Interest rates on new mortgages taken out in January remained unchanged. The decline in the LTVratio for housing loans continued in February, against the background of directives issued by the Supervisor of Banks. There was also a decline in the proportion of mortgages granted to finance homes purchased for investmentpurposes. The decline in the average LTV ratio and in the proportion of mortgages for investment purposes apparently indicate the increasing influence of constraints imposed by the Banking Supervision Department. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (based on housing rents) declined by 0.4 percent in February. In the twelve months ending in February, it increased by 2.5 percent, compared with an increase of 2.9 percent in the twelve months to January.Home prices, which are published in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of home prices but are not included in the CPI, increased in December-January by 1.7 percent, after increasing by 1.1 percent in November-December. The rate of increase in home prices continues to rise. In the twelve months ending in January, home prices increased by 8.6 percent, compared with an increase of 6.7 percent in the twelve months to December. There were 39,794 building starts in the 12 months ending in December, and this is expected to continue to support a high level of stock of homes. At the same time, the number of building starts in 2012 was about 13 percent lower than in 2011. Inaddition, the rate of properties marketed by the Israel Lands Administration has declined sharply. The global economy: The global macroeconomic picture was mixed in the past month. In the US, macro data continued to be mostly positive, and indicated continued recovery in the economy, despite the fiscal tightening measures which went into effect in the beginning of the year and in March. With that, the consequences of those measures, together with the debt ceiling issue, present a risk to the continued process of improvement, as already expressed in the decline in the consumerconfidence index there. In the eurozone, macro data continued to be weak and indicated continued recession. Against this background, the European Commission and the ECB recently revised their eurozone growth forecasts for 2013 downward, with neither entity forecasting positive growth until 2014. InChina, recent macro data indicated some loss of momentum in the growth rate. In the eurozone, there were two factors in the recent month which increased concern of a return of the debt crisis in Europe: election results in Italy which raised doubts about continued implementation of reforms in the country, and developments in Cyprus. Over the period, stock market indices of advanced economies increased. Oil and metals prices declined during the period, and agricultural commodity prices were stable. Monetary policy at most central banks did not change during the past month, and interest rates in major economies remained low, with expectations for accommodative monetary policy to continue. </div> The main considerations behind the decision The decision to keep the interest rate for April-May 2013 unchanged at 1.75 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's interest rate policy, which is intendedto entrench the inflation rate within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel and in the global economy, the monetary policies of major central banks,and developments in the exchange rate of the shekel. ; The following are themain considerations underlying the decision: ; C 2B 7 The inflation environment reflected in increased actual prices and expectations for one year ahead remains stable. Inflationover the previous 12 months was 1.5 percent, and forecasters' inflation projections for the next year are 1.8 percent, on average. C 2B 7 Updated indicators of economic activity in February point toward continuation of the signs of improvement which began to be seen in January, but it is still too early to determine if this is a positive turning point. According to the Research Department's staff forecast. GDP growth is expected to be 3.8 percent in 2013, and 4 percent in 2014. Excluding the effects of natural gas production from Tamar drilling. GDP growth is expected to be 2.8 percent in 2013 and 3.3 percent in 2014. C 2B 7 One of the sources of uncertainty regarding developments in the economy is the government's fiscal policy. An examination ofthe budget commitments which are already in place indicates that in order to abide by the expenditure rule, the government must reduce commitments this year by about NIS 13 billion (about 1.3 percent of GDP). Even after sucha reduction, the budget would reflect a real expansion of 4.5 percent compared with the 2012 budget. Deviation in the government deficit is liable tolead to increased interest rates in the economy. C 2B 7 The global macroeconomic picture is mixed. There are signs of recovery in the US economy, while in Europe, the slowdown continues. With that, it appears that the there has been a decline in the probability of a crisis occurring, a development which has reduced the high level of uncertainty that prevailed in the past year. C 2B 7 In terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, the shekel continued its appreciation this month, following its strengthening in recent months. C 2B 7 The rate of increase in home prices continues to rise, and in the 12 months which ended in January, home prices increased by 8.6 percent, compared with an increase of 6.7 percent in the 12 months which ended in December. C 2B 7 During the past month, the expansionary policies of major central banks continued, and interest rates in those economies remained near zero. The accommodative policies of central banks in major advanced economies, based on their announcements, are expected to continue during the rest of the year. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies andin financial markets, particularly in light of the continuing high level of uncertainty in the global economy. The Bank will use the tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system,and in this regard will keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. The minutes of the discussions prior to the interest rate decision for April-May 2013 will be published on April 7, 2013 (Sunday).

There was 0.4 percent deflation recorded in February of 2013, with the 12-month inflation of 3.1 percent. The Board acknowledged continued uncertainties over political solutions to debt problems in developed economies and slower world economic growth rates. In the meanwhile, the global market of basic raw materials posted a moderate growth trend but somewhat deflationary trends were observable in food product markets. In the light of such developments, the external sector will be marked with slow recovery rates in forecast horizon with no inflationary pressures expected from the external sector, though. Real economic growth, as the Board estimates, exceeded the expectations, mostly owing to higher-than-anticipated growth in industry and services, coupled with reportedly more private spending growth. In the meantime, the Government's fiscal policy was more contractionary in relation to the baseline scenario outlined in line the first quarter of 2013 monetary policy, and it mostly offsets the private demand's inflationary effect on domestic prices. Under such conditions, the domestic economy's impact on prices in the forecast horizon remains minor inflationary, as was anticipated. In view of the aforementioned developments as well as expected impact of minor inflationary environment from the domestic economy on the forthcoming 12-month inflation path, the CBA Board finds it reasonable to continue carrying out a neutral monetary policy by leaving the refinancing rate unchanged. It is therefore estimated that the 12-month inflation would, by the second quarter, reach the 4 percent target and would remain around in the forecast horizon. More information on the setting of interest rate will be available in Press Release due on the 5th of April, 2013. The Central Bank Public Relations."
Turkiye,2013-03-26,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to adjust the short term interest rates as follows: a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) has been kept at 5.5 percent. b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate has been kept constant at 4.50 percent while lending rate has been cut from 8.50 percent to 7.50 percent. Interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions has been cut from 8 percent to 7 percent. c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent while lending rate has been cut from 11.50 percent to 10.50 percent. Recent data suggest that domestic and external demand are evolving in line with expectations. Domestic demand follows a healthy recovery while exports remain relatively strong despite weak global economic activity. The current account deficit is expected to increase somewhat in the forthcoming period following the revival in domestic demand. However, the current policy framework is expected contain the widening in the current account deficit. Credit growth has been hovering above the reference rates during the early months of the year amid strong capital inflows. However, there is a deceleration in capital inflows in the recent period. The Committee has decided to increase the effectiveness of the Reserve Options Mechanism gradually in response to the heightened volatility in capital inflows. The automatic stabilizer effect of this mechanism reduces the need for a wider interest rate corridor. In this respect, the interest rate corridor was made more symmetric by cutting the overnight lending rates by 100 basis points. Ongoing uncertainties regarding the global economy necessitate the monetary policy to remain flexible in both directions. Therefore, the impact of the measures undertaken on credit, domestic demand, and inflation expectations will be monitored closely and the funding amount will be adjusted in either direction, as needed. The Committee has indicated that weak global demand and the commodity price outlook contains the upward pressures on inflation. In the meantime, the impact of increases in credit and domestic demand on the pricing behavior will be monitored closely. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Georgia,2013-03-27,"27.03.13 NBG Reduces Its Policy Rate by 25 basis points to 4.5% The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on March 27, 2013 and decided to reduce the refinancing rate by 25 basis points to 4.5 percent. According to existing information, the inflation forecasts for the coming 4-6 quarters have gone further down since the previous meeting of the MPC. According to the current forecasts, it is expected that the headline CPI inflation will remain below its target level throughout this year and will approach it in the second half of 2014. Both headline and core inflation were low in February, with the headline annual inflation reaching -2.1%. Negative values of inflation were mainly caused by the decrease in food prices. The base effect and the reduction in regulated prices (electric power and garbage collection services) were important as well. The economy grew by 2.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012 indicating the weakening in the economic activity at the end of the year. Decline in aggregate demand pushes the price level downwards. Decrease in import growth rates in January and February is another indication of slowdown in domestic demand. In February and March the credit activity still remains weak in the country due to the low demand for loans, leading to the slowdown in aggregate demand. Low credit activity also weakens the interest rate channel of the monetary transmission. Given that the inflation is predicted to remain below the target in the medium term, the National Bank of Georgia decided to continue monetary easing and to reduce the Monetary Policy Rate. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on May 8, 2013."
Czech Republic,2013-03-28,"Press conference of the CNB Bank Board 2nd Situation Report on Economic and Monetary Developments 28 March 2013 The monetary policy decision and the stance of the CNB At the close of the meeting the Board decided unanimously to leave the two-week repo rate unchanged at 0.05%. Interest rates will remain at current levels (i.e. at technical zero) over a longer horizon until inflation pressures increase significantly. In line with previous communication, the CNB is ready to use foreign exchange interventions if further monetary policy easing becomes necessary. Reasons for the decision within the context of the forecast Consistent with the forecast is a slight decline in market interest rates, followed by a rise in rates as from mid-2014. The current Inflation Report I/2013 forecast does not predict an increase in inflation pressures and no tangible risks of such an increase in inflation pressures can be identified at present. Developments in industrial production, construction output and retail sales in January continue to indicate subdued economic activity. The labour market exhibits signs of weakness: Total employment saw y-o-y growth in 2012 Q4 but continued to decline when converted into full-time equivalents. Unemployment (s.a.) rose in terms of both the general unemployment rate in 2012 Q4 and the share of unemployed persons in January and February 2013. Y-o-y growth in the average nominal wage markedly accelerated in 2012 Q4, which was, however, affected by tax optimisation. Cost-push pressures are apparent from agricultural producer prices only."
Romania,2013-03-28,"The NBR will closely monitor domestic and global economic developments so as, via an adequate use of its instruments, to ensure the fulfilment of its objectives to achieve price stability over the medium term and to maintain financial stability. The analysis of the latest developments in macroeconomic indicators points to the resumption of disinflation, after the temporary pick-up in consumer price growth in January 2013, and to a relative improvement in economic activity, underpinned by favourable net export performance. The annual inflation rate fell to 5.65 percent in February 2013 from the previous month's reading of 5.97 percent, although remaining outside the variation band around the target and above the 4.95 percent level seen in December 2012. The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate 1 stood at 3.1 percent in February, marginally below the 3.2 percent figure in January 2013. Real GDP recorded positive growth in 2012 Q4, while the widening of the negative output gap slowed. Monetary indicators point to the real annual dynamics of lending to the private sector remaining in negative territory, similarly to credit developments in the euro area and in most countries in the region. The monetary policy remained prudent, seeking to firmly anchor inflation expectations amid the transitory inflation bout and the heightened capital flow volatility, triggered by resurgent eurozone tensions stymieing investors' risk appetite. As domestic political and financial tensions eased, the NBR carefully calibrated the monetary policy instruments, also by shifting from firm to adequate liquidity management, which led to an improvement of liquidity conditions on the money market and hence drove interbank rates considerably lower. With interbank rates nearing the policy rate, the transmission of the latter's signal is strengthened, which reflects positively upon the leu-denominated credit market, via a gradual cut in funding costs for both the real economy and the government sector. The NBR's current assessments reconfirm the prospects for the annual inflation rate to follow a downward trend, albeit remaining outside the variation band in the forthcoming months, with the persistence of the negative output gap being the main disinflation driver. Subsequently, the annual inflation rate is projected to reach the upward bound of the target band at end-2013. In this context and with a view to effectively anchoring inflation expectations, the NBR Board has decided to keep the monetary policy rate unchanged at 5.25 percent per annum, to further ensure adequate liquidity management in the banking system and to maintain the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The monetary policy stance aims to fulfil the objectives of price stability over the medium term and financial stability, while also mitigating the adverse impact of external and domestic factors on the economic rebound. The NBR Board reiterates that the central bank closely monitors domestic and global economic developments so as, by gradually adjusting the monetary policy and adequately using its instruments, to ensure price stability over the medium term and financial stability, thus paving the way for lasting and sustainable growth. In line with the announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for 2 May 2013, when the new quarterly Inflation Report is to be examined. 1Calculated by excluding administered prices, volatile prices, as well as tobacco and alcohol prices from the consumer price index.

Russia,2013-04-02,"The Bank of Russia External and Public Relations Department informs that on 2 April 2013 the Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia decided to maintain unchanged the refinancing rate and the interest rates on the Bank of Russia main liquidity provision and absorption operations and to reduce effective from 3 April 2013 the interest rates on certain longer-term refinancing operations by 0.25 percentage points (table “Interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations”). The decision was supported by the assessment of inflation risks and economic growth prospects. This cut in the interest rates on liquidity provision operations will not have any significant impact on the level of money market interest rates. However, it will bring the cost of obtaining liquidity from the Bank of Russia by credit institutions closer to the interest rates on the Bank of Russia main liquidity provision operations, which will contribute to strengthening the interest rate channel of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. In March the rate of inflation remained above the target range and as of 25 March 2013 was estimated at 7.2% over a year ago. Current pace of inflation is mainly explained by the food prices growth and the dynamics of certain regulated prices and tariffs. The inflation rate staying above the target range for a prolonged period of time may affect economic agents' expectations and thus poses inflation risks, in particular taking into account the planned increases in the natural monopolies' tariffs. However, according to the Bank of Russia projections based on the assumptions of maintaining the current monetary policy stance, stable inflation expectations and absent adverse food prices shocks, the rate of inflation will return to the target range in the second half of 2013. The dynamics of the key macroeconomic indicators in February 2013 pointed to a continuing deceleration of economic growth and increased risks of economy slowing down. The growth rates of investment in production capacity remained subdued. The decrease in retail sales growth and industrial production continued. Against this background economic confidence indicators are gradually deteriorating. At the same time, labour market conditions and credit dynamic still provide support to the domestic demand. The Bank of Russia will continue to monitor inflation risks and the risks of the economy slowing down. In making monetary policy decisions the Bank of Russia will be guided by the inflation goals and economic growth prospects. The next meeting of the Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia on monetary policy issues is planned to be held in the first half of May 2013.

Thailand,2013-04-03,"No 15/ 2013 Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 3 April 2013 Mr. Paiboon Kittisrikangwan. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting today as follows. The global economy has continued to recover gradually. However tail risks have edged up somewhat since the last meeting, as financial crisis in the eurozone could exacerbate the economic contraction. The US economy has improved on the back of private consumption and investment, with fiscal sequestration weighing on growth. The Japanese economy has benefited from planned monetary and fiscal policy stimulus. The Chinese and Asian economies have continued to expand as expected on the back of domestic demand, while the outlook for exports improved slightly. The Thai economy is projected to moderate toward a normal trend in the first quarter of 2013, after accelerating in the previous quarter. In the periods ahead, domestic demand should continue to be a key engine for growth, supported by favourable household income, high employment, as well as accommodative monetary and credit conditions. Fiscal stimulus should also gradually pick up pace in the second half of this year, in line with the start of public investment in flood management and large‐scale infrastructure projects, lending further impetus to private investment. Exports should expand slowly, in line with global economic conditions. Inflation remains within the target, but potential upward pressure from supply constraints and higher labour costs warrants monitoring. The MPC judges that, given the fragile state of the global economy, a continuation of accommodative monetary policy stance remains appropriate. However risks to financial stability, including volatile exchange rate and capital flows, are a concern. The MPC therefore voted 5 to 1 to maintain the policy interest rate at 275 percent per annum, with one member voting for a cut in the policy rate by 025 percent per annum. The MPC will continue to closely monitor domestic economic developments as well as risks to financial stability, and stand ready to take appropriate policy action. One MPC member was unable to attend this meeting due to obligations abroad."
Euroarea,2013-04-04,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. HICP inflation rates have declined further, as anticipated, and price developments over the medium term should remain contained. Inflation expectations for the euro area continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. At the same time, weak economic activity has extended into the early part of the year and a gradual recovery is projected for the second half of this year, subject to downside risks. Against this overall background our monetary policy stance will remain accommodative for as long as needed. In the coming weeks, we will monitor very closely all incoming information on economic and monetary developments and assess any impact on the outlook for price stability. It is essential for governments to intensify the implementation of structural reforms at national level and to strengthen euro area governance, including the implementation of the banking union. They should also build on progress made in fiscal consolidation and proceed with financial sector restructuring. We are also closely monitoring money market conditions and their potential impact on our monetary policy stance and its transmission to the economy. As said on previous occasions, we will continue with fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. The outcome for real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2012 was weak, with Eurostat's second estimate indicating a contraction of 0.6% quarter on quarter. The decline was largely due to a fall in domestic demand but also reflected a drop in exports. Recent data and indicators confirm that the economic weakness extended into the early part of the year. Looking forward, euro area export growth should benefit from a recovery in global demand and our monetary policy stance should contribute to support domestic demand. Furthermore, the improvements in financial markets seen since last summer should work their way through to the real economy, notwithstanding recent uncertainties. Together, this should help stabilise euro area economic activity and lead to a gradual recovery in the second part of the year. At the same time, necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors, and the associated tight credit conditions, will continue to weigh on economic activity. This economic outlook for the euro area remains subject to downside risks. The risks include the possibility of even weaker than expected domestic demand and slow or insufficient implementation of structural reforms in the euro area. These factors have the potential to dampen the improvement in confidence and thereby delay the recovery. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.7% in March 2013, down from 1.8% in February. The ongoing decline in annual inflation rates mainly reflects the energy component of the price index. Looking ahead, price developments over the medium term should remain contained in an environment of weak economic activity in the euro area. Inflation expectations are firmly anchored and in line with price stability over the medium to long term. Risks to the outlook for price developments continue to be broadly balanced over the medium term, with upside risks relating to stronger than expected increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, as well as higher oil prices, and downside risks stemming from weaker economic activity. Turning to the monetary analysis, the underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be subdued. The annual growth rate of M3 moderated to 3.1% in February, down from 3.5% in January. The annual growth rate of the narrow monetary aggregate. M1, increased to 7.0% in February, from 6.6% in January. At the same time. MFI deposits in a number of stressed countries strengthened further in February. The annual growth rate of loans (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) to non-financial corporations and households remained broadly unchanged in February, at -1.4% and 0.4% respectively. To a large extent, subdued loan dynamics reflect the current stage of the business cycle, heightened credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. At the same time, available information on non-financial corporates' access to financing indicates tight credit conditions, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises in several euro area countries. In order to ensure adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions in euro area countries, it is essential that the fragmentation of euro area credit markets is reduced further and the resilience of banks strengthened where needed. However, considerable progress has been made since last summer in improving the funding situation of banks, in strengthening the domestic deposit base in stressed countries and in reducing reliance on the Eurosystem as reflected in repayments of the three-year LTROs. Further decisive steps for establishing a banking union will help to accomplish this objective. In particular, in the light of recent experience, we must emphasise that the future Single Supervisory Mechanism and a Single Resolution Mechanism are crucial elements for moving towards re-integrating the banking system and therefore require swift implementation. To sum up, taking into account today's decision, the economic analysis indicates that price developments should remain in line with price stability over the medium term. A cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. As regards fiscal policies, euro area countries should build on their efforts to reduce government budget deficits and continue to implement structural reforms, thereby mutually reinforcing fiscal sustainability and economic growth. Fiscal policy strategies need to be complemented by growth-enhancing structural reforms. Such reforms should be ambitious and broad-ranging, encompassing product markets, including network industries, labour markets and the modernisation of public administration. To support employment, wage-setting should become more flexible and better aligned with productivity. These reforms will help countries in their efforts to regain competitiveness, set the foundations for sustainable growth and support the return of macroeconomic confidence."
Poland,2013-04-10,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 10 April 2013 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 9-10 April 2013 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged:  reference rate at 3.25% on an annual basis;  lombard rate at 4.75% on an annual basis;  deposit rate at 1.75% on an annual basis;  bill rediscount rate at 3.50% on an annual basis; Despite a gradual improvement, global economic activity remains low. In the euro area, recession probably continued into 2013 Q1, although the situation varied across countries. In Germany, following a decline in GDP in 2012 Q4, economic activity rebounded at the beginning of the year; nevertheless, corporate sentiment has deteriorated most recently. In other major economies of the euro area, recessionary trends persisted. In contrast to that, incoming data point to acceleration in economic growth in the United States, supported by improving labour and real estate markets. At the same time, economic activity growth in some of the major emerging economies has probably increased slightly. In Poland. GDP growth in 2013 Q1 probably remained low. This is indicated by a decline in industrial and construction output observed in the first months of 2013, amidst a merely marginal increase in retail sales. Low economic activity in 2013 Q1 is also reflected in low levels of business climate indicators. Weak economic activity in the first months of 2013 was accompanied by falling employment in the corporate sector and rising unemployment, which continued to constrain wage growth. While a certain increase in annual wage growth in February was registered in the corporate sector, this may have largely resulted from statistical base effects. At the same time, lending  both to the corporate and household sector  remained low. In February. CPI inflation decreased again, reaching 1.3% y/y, i.e. a level markedly below the NBP inflation target of 2.5%. There was also a decline in core inflation measures, which confirms a weak demand pressure prevailing in the economy. This was accompanied by a further decline in inflation expectations of households and enterprises. In the opinion of the Council, incoming data confirm low economic growth in Poland as well as no wage and inflationary pressures. Economic activity may gradually improve in the coming quarters. However. GDP growth will probably remain moderate, which will continue to contain inflationary pressure. The Council's decisions in the following months will depend on the assessment of the incoming data with regard to the probability of inflation remaining markedly below the NBP inflation target in the medium term and regarding economic activity."
Chile,2013-04-11,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 11 April 2013 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 5% (annual). International financial conditions are stable. Incoming economic indicators for the United States are mixed, while the Eurozone remains in recession and in a fragile fiscal and financial situation. The Bank of Japan recently announced a substantial quantitative easing program, which has translated into a depreciation of the yen. The prices of commodities receded in recent weeks, especially for copper. Domestically. February's activity indicator was below market expectations. The labor market is still tight and domestic demand remains dynamic. Credit conditions are somewhat more restrictive. Headline and core inflation measures are around 1% and 2% y-o-y, while inflationary expectations in the policy horizon remain around the target. The peso has appreciated further in multilateral terms. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. * The Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2013-04-11,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.75% for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.75% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information, the Committee considers the moderate economic recovery in the US to have continued but economic activities in the euro area to have remained sluggish, while economic indicators in emerging market countries, led by China, have continued their trends of improvement. The Committee expects the global economy to sustain its modest recovery going forward, but judges that the uncertainties related for instance to the delay in economic recovery in the euro area and to fiscal consolidation in the US remain as downside risks to growth. In Korea, although exports have maintained their trend of recovery and investment-related indicators have rebounded, the Committee appraises economic growth to have sustained its weak level, as consumption has continued its decline of the previous month. On the employment front, the increase in the number of persons employed has accelerated, centering around the 50-and-above age group. Going forward, there is no change to the Committee's forecast that the domestic economy will show a negative output gap for a considerable time, due mostly to the slow recovery of the global economy and to the influence of Japanese yen weakening. Consumer price inflation declined slightly to 1.3% in March, from 1.4% the previous month, due mainly to decreases in the prices of 1 agricultural, livestock and fisheries products, while core inflation excluding the prices of agricultural and petroleum products rose slightly to 1.5%, from 1.3% in February. Inflation appears likely to remain relatively low, due to the weakening of demand-side pressures. However, the Committee forecasts that it will rise above its current level in line with the partial disappearance of downward pressures from institutional factors. As for housing prices, those in Seoul and its surrounding areas continued on their downtrend and those in the rest of the country on their moderate uptrend. In the financial markets, stock prices have fallen substantially and the Korean won has depreciated significantly against the US dollar, as foreigners' securities investment funds have flowed out in line with the reemergence of euro area risk and with the increase in geopolitical risk in Korea. Long-term market interest rates have continued their downtrend, primarily on concerns about the slowdown in economic recovery. Looking ahead, the Committee will closely monitor external risk factors and Korea's geopolitical risk and any consequent changes in financial and economic conditions, continue its efforts to lower inflation expectations, and conduct monetary policy so as to keep consumer price inflation within the inflation target range over a medium-term horizon while ensuring that the growth potential is not eroded due to the continuation of slow growth."
Pakistan,2013-04-12,"STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN MONETARY POLICY DECISION 12th April 2013 In the monetary policy statement of February 2013, the SBP highlighted two main challenges for monetary policy: to manage the balance of payment position and to contain the possible increase in inflation. Since then. SBP's foreign exchange reserves have declined by another $2 billion; from. billion at end-January 2013 to $6. billion as of 5th April 2013, mainly due to debt payments. Contrary to expectations, however, year-on-year inflation has come down by. percentage points; from. percent in January 2013 to. percent in March 2013. These developments pose divergent policy choices for the SBP. While the former calls for caution, the latter indicates possible resumption of ease in the policy rate. The balance of payments position continues to be driven by low financial inflows and high debt payments. cumulative net capital and financial inflow of $34 million during July February. FY13 is insufficient to finance the external current account deficit of $700 million for the same period. While the external current account deficit is expected to widen further in the remaining months of FY13, the net capital and financial inflows are not likely to increase considerably. It is important to emphasize that it is not the size of the external current account deficit, which is projected to be small and manageable, but the lack of adequate financial inflows that is exerting pressure on the balance of payments. In addition, the SBP has to retire another $838 million of IMF loans during the remaining period of FY13 after making payments of $2. billion during the first three quarters of the current fiscal year. Thus the pressure on foreign exchange reserves is likely to remain in the coming months. So far the SBP has played an active role in managing the conditions, but only consistent increase in foreign exchange can ensure sustainable stability in the market. The role of interest rate is also important in this context as it determines the return on rupee denominated assets relative to foreign currency assets. The idea is to discourage speculative demand for dollars by keeping rupee denominated assets sufficiently lucrative. Real returns on rupee denominated assets have marginally increased due to substantial decline in inflation. Moreover led by depreciation of. percent in the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER), the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) has also depreciated by. percent during July February. FY13. This bodes well for the competitiveness of the external trade sector. However real cost of borrowing has increased, which may be undesirable in the wake of declining private investment and low growth in the economy. Despite continued energy shortages and substantial fiscal borrowings from the banking system, credit extended to private businesses has shown some nascent recovery. During July February. FY13, loans to private businesses have increased by Rs173. billion as opposed to Rs56. billion during the same period of last year. This has helped in modest growth of. percent in the Large Scale Manufacturing (LSM) sector during July February. FY13 compared to. percent in the corresponding period of last year. cumulative decline of 450 basis points in the policy rate of SBP since the beginning of FY12 has played role in this uptick. Moreover an analysis of the balance sheets of the main sectors supports this Page of STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN assessment. Thus both the decline in inflation and the need to encourage further borrowings by the private sector point towards continuation of current monetary policy stance and possible reduction in the policy rate. However the current balance of payments position and structural imbalance in fiscal accounts suggest vigilance. The main implication of fiscal imbalance for monetary policy is excessive borrowings from the banking system, including the SBP. During 1st July 29th March. FY13, the fiscal authority has borrowed Rs853 billion (on cash basis) from the banking system for budgetary support compared with Rs925 billion in the corresponding period of last year and against full-year estimate of Rs484 billion for FY13. The high level of these borrowings has kept an upward pressure on the system's liquidity and thus market interest rates and is restraining growth in the private sector credit. The SBP can provide liquidity through short term Open Market Operations (OMOs), which has been the case during most of FY13, as long as inflation expectations remain manageable. However even if inflation continues to remain within the announced target, this approach cannot be sustained for longer periods since it does not address the source of the problem. The source of the problem is untargeted subsidies and the absence of meaningful tax reforms to increase the tax base. The implications are high borrowings and rising debt level, which have considerably increased debt servicing expenditures. One consequence of high level of subsidies is that the government has managed to keep check on administered prices such as electricity and gas prices and some transportation fares. Apart from financing subsidies, high rate of fiscal borrowing is being used to pay for the already accumulated debt, which does not represent current government demand. Taken together, these two observations largely explain why despite substantial fiscal borrowings and high growth in M2 inflation has come down. In addition, muted private sector investment expenditures are also having dampening effect on aggregate demand and thus inflation. Even inflation expectations seem to have moderated, having broad-based effect on both food and non-food inflation. This is because major factor in expectation formation is the recent experience of inflation. Thus not only has year-on-year CPI inflation dropped to. percent but the 20-percent trimmed measure of core inflation has also declined to. percent in March 2013; the lowest level since October 2009. The pertinent question, from the point of view of monetary policy, is the sustainability of these subsidies and the overall fiscal position. Any fiscal consolidation effort, which is overdue, can potentially affect the level of subsidies at the expense of partially unhinging expectations of inflation remaining low. prudent approach would be to gradually reduce the subsidy burden together with credible and reform oriented medium term fiscal program. In conclusion, given the risks to the balance of payments position, the Central Board of Directors of SBP has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at. percent. Page of."
Peru,2013-04-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR APRIL 2013 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 4.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference rate at 4.25 percent. This decision is based on the fact that the rate of inflation is within the target range in a context of economic growth close to the economy's potential level of growth. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants to consider future adjustments in monetary policy instruments. Inflation in March showed a rate of 0.91 percent, of which 0.38 percentage points are due to the rise in education costs (tuition and fees). Inflation in the last 12 months rose from 2.45 percent in February to 2.59 percent in March. Core inflation showed a rate of 0.87 percent (3.48 percent in the last 12 months) and inflation without food and energy showed a rate of 0.95 percent (2.59 percent in the last 12 months). Inflation is expected to converge to the 2 percent target in the next months due to the improvement observed in the food supply conditions, due to a pace of growth of economic activity close to the economy's level of potential output, and due to inflation expectations anchored to the target range in a context in which weak production indicators persist in the global economy. Current and advanced indicators of activity show that the growth of the Peruvian economy has stabilized around its long-term sustainable level of growth, even though the indicators associated with the external market still show a weak performance. The Board also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as described below: Overnight deposits: 3.45 percent. Direct repo and rediscount operations: 5.05 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.05 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for May on its session of May 9, 2013."
Turkiye,2013-04-16,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to cut the short term interest rates as follows: a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) has been cut from 5.5 percent to 5 percent. b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate has been cut from 4.50 percent to 4 percent while lending rate has been cut from 7.50 percent to 7 percent. Interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions has been cut from 7 percent to 6.5 percent. c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent while lending rate has been cut from 10.50 percent to 10 percent. Recent data suggest that domestic and external demand are evolving in line with expectations. Domestic demand follows a healthy recovery while exports slow down due to weak global economic activity. The current account deficit has increased somewhat following the revival in domestic demand. However, the current policy framework and the decline in commodity prices are expected contain the widening in the current account deficit. Recently, there is a re-acceleration in capital inflows and credit growth hovers above the reference rate. The Committee indicated that, in order to balance the risks on financial stability, the proper policy would be to keep interest rates low while increasing foreign currency reserves via macroprudential measures. Accordingly, it was deemed appropriate to further increase the reserve options coefficients, while delivering a cut in the short term interest rates. Ongoing uncertainties regarding the global economy and the volatility in capital flows necessitate the monetary policy to remain flexible in both directions. Therefore, the impact of the measures undertaken on credit, domestic demand, and inflation expectations will be monitored closely and the funding amount will be adjusted in either direction, as needed. The Committee has indicated that the weak global demand and the commodity price outlook contain the upward pressures on inflation. In the meantime, the impact of increases in credit and domestic demand on the pricing behavior will be monitored closely. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Hungary,2013-04-23,"At its meeting on 23 April 2013, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by 25 basis points from 5.00% to 4.75%, with effect from 24 April 2013. In the Council's judgement. Hungarian economic growth is likely to resume this year following last year's recession. The level of output remains below its potential and unemployment above its long-term level determined by structural factors. The Council expects weak demand conditions to persist, which will ensure that inflationary pressures in the economy remain muted in the period ahead. Recent inflation data have confirmed that weak domestic demand exerts strong downward pressure on prices. Inflation fell back to below the Bank's target, reflecting the effects of the reduction in administered prices at the beginning of the year and subdued demand. The upward impact on costs of fiscal measures, leading to a higher tax burden on certain sectors of the economy, may feed through gradually to the entire corporate sector along the production chain, which in turn may lead to higher core inflation adjusted for indirect taxes. However, the Council judges that, with the output gap remaining negative, the passing on of increased costs into consumer prices may be slow and partial. Inflation is likely to remain below the 3 per cent target throughout this year and settle close to the target value in 2014. External and domestic factors both contributed to weak activity data towards the end of last year, while temporary cuts in production in some sectors of the economy for idiosyncratic reasons exacerbated the downturn. Growth is expected to resume this year as the country's export markets improve, but external and, to a greater extent, domestic demand factors point to only modest growth in the period ahead. In the low inflation environment, household real income growth is expected to recover. However, due to the protracted deleveraging process and increased uncertainty about the economic environment, household consumption behaviour is likely to be cautious and the saving rate to be high, and therefore consumer demand is likely to strengthen only from 2014. Global risk appetite has remained high over the past month. Risk premia on Hungarian financial assets fell significantly, reflecting an improvement in the international environment. In the Council's judgement, however, the contrast between the benign financial market environment and weak real economic activity still remains despite intensified efforts by the international community, which warrants a cautious approach to policy. In the Council's judgement, the economic data becoming available in the past month suggest that weak demand continues to exert a strong disinflationary impact on prices, and therefore companies have limited ability to pass on higher production costs into prices. Based on this assessment, the outlook for inflation and the real economy is consistent with a lower central bank base rate. The Council will consider a further reduction in the policy rate if the medium-term outlook for inflation remains in line with the Bank's 3 per cent target and the improvement in financial market sentiment is sustained."
Philippines,2013-04-24,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the BSP's key policy interest rates at 3.50 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 5.50 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The reserve requirement ratios were kept steady as well. Meanwhile, the Monetary Board further reduced the interest rates on the Special Deposit Account (SDA) facility by 50 basis points to 2.0 percent across all tenors, effective immediately. The Monetary Board's decision to maintain the policy interest rates at their current levels is based on its assessment that the inflation environment is likely to remain manageable over the policy horizon, with expectations firmly anchored within the inflation target band. The projected inflation path continues to track the lower half of the 4 ± 1 percent target range for 2013 and 2014. Moreover, the risks to the inflation outlook remain evenly balanced. Uncertainty over the strength of the global economy and the relative firmness of the peso are the key downside risks to the broad outlook for prices. However, power rate adjustments and the possibility of a sustained surge in liquidity owing to strong capital inflows could push inflation higher as well. At the same time, the Monetary Board noted that the benign inflation environment and robust domestic growth prospects provided scope for further enhancing the efficiency of the operations for absorbing liquidity through the SDA facility. The adjustment is in line with the BSP's continuing efforts to fine-tune its monetary policy instruments and thereby gain greater flexibility in conducting monetary operations, and also to ensure adequate liquidity for economic activity. Going forward, the BSP will continue to monitor emerging price and output conditions to ensure that the monetary policy stance remains consistent with maintaining stable prices while supporting economic growth. The BSP also aims to deploy macroprudential measures as needed to pre-emptively address any potential misalignment in asset prices."
Thailand,2013-04-30,"No 19/ 2013 The Monetary Policy Committee approved a framework for exchange rate management The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) today attended a regular monthly macroeconomic briefing organized by the Bank of Thailand and discussed recent exchange rate developments. The MPC has been closely monitoring recent baht appreciation and assessing its implications for the Thai economy. The committee judges that recent gain in baht is largely attributable to foreign investors' confidence in the strength of the Thai economy. On the positive side, the baht appreciation has been conducive to business investment to enhance their productivity. However the stronger baht also has negative impact on exporters, particularly small and medium sized firms as well as those that rely heavily on domestic raw materials, agricultural products, and labour. Nonetheless the export sector's continued structural and productivity improvements have helped alleviate the adverse impact to some extent. Overall despite exchange rate appreciation, the committee expects the Thai economy to remain resilient, which is in line with other agencies' assessments. The MPC expressed concern over recent volatility and rapid appreciation of the baht, which, at times, have not been justified by economic fundamentals. The committee therefore agreed on the need for a timely implementation of appropriate policy mix as warranted by circumstances, in close coordination with the Ministry of Finance and other agencies."
United States,2013-05-01,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace. Labor market conditions have shown some improvement in recent months, on balance, but the unemployment rate remains elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector has strengthened further, but fiscal policy is restraining economic growth. Inflation has been running somewhat below the Committee's longer-run objective, apart from temporary variations that largely reflect fluctuations in energy prices. Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will proceed at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee continues to see downside risks to the economic outlook. The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely will run at or below its 2 percent objective. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months. The Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability. The Committee is prepared to increase or reduce the pace of its purchases to maintain appropriate policy accommodation as the outlook for the labor market or inflation changes. In determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, the Committee will continue to take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases as well as the extent of progress toward its economic objectives. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens. In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; James Bullard; Elizabeth A Duke; Charles L Evans; Jerome H Powell; Sarah Bloom Raskin; Eric S Rosengren; Jeremy C Stein; Daniel K Tarullo; and Janet L Yellen. Voting against the action was Esther L George, who was concerned that the continued high level of monetary accommodation increased the risks of future economic and financial imbalances and, over time, could cause an increase in long-term inflation expectations."
Czech Republic,2013-05-02,"Press conference of the CNB Bank Board 3rd Situation Report on Economic and Monetary Developments 2 May 2013 The monetary policy decision and the stance of the CNB At the close of the meeting the Board decided unanimously to leave the two-week repo rate unchanged at 0.05%. Interest rates will remain at current levels (i.e. at technical zero) over a longer horizon until inflation pressures increase significantly. The CNB is ready to use foreign exchange interventions if further monetary policy easing becomes necessary. 2 Reasons for the decision within the context of the forecast Consistent with the forecast is a slight decline in market interest rates, followed by a rise in rates in 2014. The new forecast does not predict an increase in inflation pressures and no tangible risks of such an increase in inflation pressures can be identified either. 3 The message of the forecast Tax changes and growth in administered prices are again the sources of current inflation. Headline inflation will be slightly below the CNB's 2% target this year and next year. Monetary-policy relevant inflation will be close to the lower boundary of the tolerance band this year and then return slowly to the target. This year. GDP will drop by 0.5% amid ongoing fiscal consolidation and an only gradual recovery in external demand. The exchange rate of the koruna against the euro will appreciate very slowly from a weak initial level. Consistent with the forecast is a slight decline in market interest rates, followed by a rise in rates in 2014.

Euroarea,2013-05-02,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. I would like to thank Governor Makúch for his kind hospitality and express our special gratitude to his staff for the excellent organisation of today's meeting of the Governing Council. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting, during which we took a number of decisions on key ECB interest rates, liquidity provision and possible ways forward to enhance the provision of credit. The meeting was also attended by the Commission Vice-President. Mr Rehn. First, based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to lower the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem by 25 basis points to 0.50% and the rate on the marginal lending facility by 50 basis points to 1.00%. The rate on the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%. These decisions are consistent with low underlying price pressure over the medium term. Inflation expectations for the euro area continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. In keeping with this picture, monetary and loan dynamics remain subdued. At the same time, weak economic sentiment has extended into spring of this year. The cut in interest rates should contribute to support prospects for a recovery later in the year. Against this overall background, our monetary policy stance will remain accommodative for as long as needed. In the period ahead, we will monitor very closely all incoming information on economic and monetary developments and assess any impact on the outlook for price stability. Second, we are closely monitoring money market conditions and their potential impact on our monetary policy stance and its transmission to the economy. In this context, we decided today to continue conducting the main refinancing operations (MROs) as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of the 6th maintenance period of 2014 on 8 July 2014. This procedure will also remain in use for the Eurosystem's special-term refinancing operations with a maturity of one maintenance period, which will continue to be conducted for as long as needed, and at least until the end of the second quarter of 2014. The fixed rate in these special-term refinancing operations will be the same as the MRO rate prevailing at the time. Furthermore, we decided to conduct the three-month longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) to be allotted until the end of the second quarter of 2014 as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment. The rates in these three-month operations will be fixed at the average rate of the MROs over the life of the respective LTRO. Third, the Governing Council decided to start consultations with other European institutions on initiatives to promote a functioning market for asset-backed securities collateralised by loans to non-financial corporations. In the meantime, it is essential for governments to intensify the implementation of structural reforms at national level, building on progress made in fiscal consolidation and proceeding with bank recapitalisation where needed. Furthermore, they should maintain the momentum towards a genuine Economic and Monetary Union, including the swift implementation of the banking union. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Real GDP contracted by 0.6% in the fourth quarter of 2012, following a decline of 0.1% in the third quarter. Recent developments in short-term indicators, notably survey data, indicate that weak economic sentiment has extended into spring of this year. Looking ahead, euro area export growth should benefit from a recovery in global demand and our monetary policy stance should contribute to support domestic demand. Furthermore, the improvements in financial markets seen since last summer should work their way through to the real economy. At the same time, necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors will continue to weigh on economic activity. Overall, euro area economic activity should stabilise and recover gradually in the second half of the year. The risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside. They include the possibility of even weaker than expected domestic and global demand and slow or insufficient implementation of structural reforms in the euro area. These factors have the potential to dampen confidence and thereby delay the recovery. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.2% in April 2013, down from 1.7% in March. This decline in the annual inflation rate reflects a significant fall in energy prices, but is also due to a sizeable transitory effect coming from the annual rate of change in services prices on account of the timing of Easter. Inflation rates could remain subject to some volatility throughout the year. Looking further ahead, underlying price trends should persist and, over the medium term, inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability. Taking into account today's decisions, risks to the outlook for price developments are broadly balanced over the medium term, with upside risks relating to stronger than expected increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, as well as higher commodity prices, and downside risks stemming from weaker economic activity. Turning to the monetary analysis, recent data confirm that the underlying pace of monetary expansion continues to be subdued. Annual growth in broad money moderated in March, standing at 2.6%, after 3.1% in February. The annual growth rate of the narrow monetary aggregate. M1, increased slightly further to 7.1% in March, reflecting the continued preference for the most liquid instruments in M3. Deposits with the domestic money-holding sector continued to grow further in most stressed countries in March. The annual growth rates of loans (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) to non-financial corporations and households have now remained broadly unchanged since the turn of the year, standing in March at -1.3% and 0.4% respectively. To a large extent, weak loan dynamics reflect the current stage of the business cycle, heightened credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. The recent Bank Lending Survey (BLS) confirmed weak demand for loans in the euro area. While some signs of stabilisation are emerging, the Survey on the access to finance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the euro area indicates continued tight credit conditions, particularly for SMEs in several euro area countries. Moreover, the available information indicates high risk perception on the part of banks. In order to ensure adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions in euro area countries, it is essential that the fragmentation of euro area credit markets continues to decline further and that the resilience of banks is strengthened where needed. Progress has been made since last summer in improving the funding situation of banks, in strengthening the domestic deposit base in stressed countries and in reducing reliance on the Eurosystem as reflected in repayments of the three-year LTROs. Further decisive steps for establishing a banking union will help to accomplish this objective. In particular, the Governing Council emphasises that the future Single Supervisory Mechanism and a Single Resolution Mechanism are crucial elements for moving towards re-integrating the banking system and therefore require swift implementation. To sum up, taking into account today's decisions, the economic analysis indicates that price developments should remain in line with price stability over the medium term. A cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. With regard to fiscal policies, the spring 2013 deficit and debt data notifications by euro area countries indicate that the average government deficit declined from 4.2% of GDP in 2011 to 3.7% in 2012. Over the same period, the average government debt rose from 87.3% to 90.6% of GDP. In order to bring debt ratios back on a downward path, euro area countries should not unravel their efforts to reduce government budget deficits and continue, where needed, to take legislative action or otherwise promptly implement structural reforms, in such a way as to mutually reinforce fiscal sustainability and economic growth potential. Such structural reforms should target improvements in competitiveness and adjustment capacities, as well as aim to increase sustainable growth and employment."
Romania,2013-05-02,"In order to temper interest rates volatility on the money and banking markets the NBR Board has decided to narrow the symmetrical corridor around the monetary policy rate for the interest rates on the NBR standing facilities to +/- 3 percentage points from +/- 4 percentage points. Therefore, starting with May 3, 2013 the interest rate on the NBR's lending facility (Lombard) will be lowered to an annual 8.25 percent from 9.25 percent, while its deposit facility rate will stand at 2.25 percent per annum versus 1.25 percent previously. The NBR Board has also examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled for May 8, 2013. The analysis of the latest developments in macro-economic indicators reveals ongoing disinflation, in line with the previous projections, on the back of the fading out of the transitory impact of supply-side factors, the improvement of inflation expectations, and of the persistence of the negative output gap. The annual inflation rate fell to 5.25 percent in March 2013 from the previous month's reading of 5.65 percent, remaining however above the upper bound of the variation band around the target and the 4.95 percent level seen in December 2012. The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate 1 further stayed on a downward trend, falling to 3.0 percent in March from 3.25 percent in December 2012. Monthly increases in consumer prices in February and March 2013 stood at historically low levels, reflecting the reduction in inflation expectations. The GDP remains below potential owing to the evolution of its quarterly growth rate, the recent return to positive territory notwithstanding, including in the context of signals pinpointing the improved economic activity due mainly to the favourable evolution of exports and manufacturing. The real annual dynamics of lending to the private sector stayed in negative territory, similarly to credit developments in the euro area and in most countries in the region. The resurgent tensions on the international financial markets amid the recent deepening of the eurozone crisis had limited spillover effects on the domestic economy, with Romania's better performance boosting the resumption of capital inflows, as mirrored by the appreciation of the leu. The monetary policy stance has remained prudent, seeking to firmly anchor inflation expectations. The NBR's adequate calibration of the monetary policy instruments, including by shifting from firm to adequate liquidity management, led to an improvement of liquidity conditions on the money market and to a stronger transmission of the monetary policy impulse by bringing the interbank rates closer to the policy rate. In the context of interbank rates and yields on government securities remaining on a downward trend, lending and deposit rates on new business resumed their decline. In this respect, the developments in 3M ROBOR  a benchmark for private sector financing  whose average level fell to 4.57 percent in April 2013 from 6.04 percent in December 2012 are highly relevant. In today's meeting, the NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, a document that assesses developments in the macroeconomic environment, looks at the inflation outlook, and identifies the main challenges and risks to monetary policy in the period ahead. Compared to the previous projection, the updated forecast indicates an improved short-term disinflation outlook, anticipating the return of the inflation rate inside the target band in the second half of 2013, against the background of the persistence of the negative output gap. The main risks and uncertainties surrounding the updated projection refer to the volatility of capital flows targeting the Romanian economy amid an external environment featuring fluctuations, as well as to the persistent structural rigidities across the Romanian economy, especially those highlighted by the precautionary financing agreements concluded with the international institutions. In order to further accommodate the monetary policy with a view to effectively anchoring inflation expectations, the NBR Board has decided to keep unchanged the monetary policy rate at 5.25 percent per annum, to continue to pursue an adequate liquidity management and to leave unchanged the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. In order to moderate interest rate volatility on the money and banking markets, the NBR Board has decided to narrow the symmetrical corridor defined by interest rates on the NBR's standing facilities to +/-3 percentage points from +/-4 percentage points. These decisions are aimed at further strengthening the transmission of the policy rate signal, which will have a favourable impact on the credit market in domestic currency, by gradually cutting the costs related to new loans. The monetary policy stance further pursues the objective of price stability over the medium term under financial stability conditions and amid a lower adverse impact of external and domestic factors on the rebound of the domestic economy. The NBR Board reiterates that the central bank closely monitors domestic and global economic developments so as, by gradually adjusting the monetary policy stance and adequately using its instruments, to ensure price stability over the medium term and financial stability, thus paving the way for sustainable growth. The quarterly Inflation Report will be released to the public in a press conference on 8 May 2013. In line with the announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for 1 July 2013. 1Calculated by excluding administered prices, volatile prices, as well as tobacco and alcohol prices from the consumer price index.

Georgia,2013-05-08,"08.05.13 NBG Reduces Its Policy Rate by 25 basis points to 4.25% The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on May 8, 2013 and decided to reduce the refinancing rate by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent. According to existing information, the inflation forecasts for the coming 4-6 quarters have gone further down since the previous meeting of the MPC. According to the current forecasts, it is expected that the headline CPI inflation will remain below its target level throughout this year and will approach it by the end of 2014. Both headline and core inflation were low in April, with the headline annual inflation reaching -1.7%. Decrease in inflation was mainly caused by the decline in food prices. The base effect and the reduction in regulated prices were important as well. The leading indicators of economic activity indicate it being weaker than expected in the first quarter of 2013, resulting in inflation falling below the expected level as well. Decline in aggregate demand pushes the price level downwards. Decrease of imports in the first quarter is another indication of slowdown in domestic demand. The credit activity of commercial banks still remains weak due to the decrease in loan demand. Low credit activity also weakens the interest rate channel of the monetary transmission. Given that the inflation is predicted to remain below the target in the medium term, the National Bank of Georgia decided to continue monetary easing and to reduce the Monetary Policy Rate. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on June 19, 2013."
Poland,2013-05-08,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 8 May 2013 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 7-8 May 2013 The Council decided to decrease the NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage points:  reference rate to 3.00% on an annual basis;  lombard rate to 4.50% on an annual basis;  deposit rate to 1.50% on an annual basis;  bill rediscount rate to 3.25% on an annual basis; Global economic activity remains weak. Despite an acceleration in economic growth in the United States in 2013 Q1, consumer and corporate confidence weakened somewhat in March 2013. Recession probably continued in the euro area, and in Germany  despite expected positive growth rate  the sentiment of economic agents weakened. A weakening of economic growth was also observed in China. Weak global economic activity has contributed to a decline in inflation in many countries. The recent decrease in commodity prices in the global markets is also conducive to lower inflation. In Poland, the incoming data confirm that economic growth is low. In 2012 Q4. GDP growth was weaker than previously estimated. Data on industrial and construction output as well as retail sales in the first months of 2013 show that economic activity growth remained weak also in 2013 Q1. Subdued economic activity is also confirmed by weak business climate indicators. In 2013 Q1 employment in the enterprise sector declined, while the seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate rose. Wage growth continued to decrease. At the same time, lending growth, both to corporates and households, slowed down. In March. CPI inflation declined again, reaching 1.0% y/y, i.e. a level markedly below the NBP inflation target of 2.5%. The decline in inflation was mainly driven by a decrease in food price growth. Core inflation measures and producer price inflation also declined, which confirms weak demand and cost pressures in the economy. This was accompanied by a decline in inflation expectations of households. In the opinion of the Council, the incoming data indicate that economic growth in Poland remains weak, while inflation decline is stronger than forecasted in the March projection. At the same time, uncertainty about the pace and timing of the expected recovery in the euro area has increased, which can adversely affect economic activity in Poland. Hence, the risk of inflation staying markedly below the target in the medium term has risen. The Council's decisions in the coming months will depend on the assessment of the incoming data with regard to probability of inflation remaining markedly below the NBP target in the medium term."
Egypt,2013-05-09,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release May 9, 2013 In its meeting held on May 9, 2013, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 975 percent and 1075 percent, respectively, and the rate of the CBE's main operation at 1025 percen. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 1025 percen. Headline CPI increased by 147 percent (m/m) in April and 064 percent (m/m) in March, pushing the annual rate to 811 percent in April from 759 percent in Marc. On the other hand, core CPI increased by 097 percent (m/m) in April compared to 051 percent (m/m) in March, bringing the annual rate to 747 percent in April from 703 percent in Marc. The monthly developments in both headline and core inflation since the beginning of the year were largely driven by broad based increases in food and non‐food prices on the back of the recent movements in the exchange rate and diesel distribution bottlenecks across the countr. While the probability of a rebound in international food prices is less likely in light of recent global developments, the re‐emergence of local supply bottlenecks and distortions in the distribution channels pose upside risks to the inflation outloo. Meanwhile real GDP grew by 24 percent in 2012/2013 H1, following a similarly feeble growth rate of 22 percent in 2011/201. This nascent recovery in economic activity came on the back of tentative signs of recovery in the construction and tourism sector. Nonetheless GDP growth remains to be partly suppressed by continuing weaknesses, albeit of lesser extent, in the manufacturing secto. In the meantime, given the heightened uncertainty that faced market participants since early 2011, investment levels remained lo. Looking ahead, the current political transformation may continue to have ramifications on both consumption as well as investment decisions, adversely weighing on key sectors within the econom. Moreover downside risks continue to surround the global recovery on the back of challenges facing the Euro Are. These factors, combined, pose downside risks to domestic GDP going forwar. While the slowdown in economic growth has been limiting upside risks to the inflation outlook, there is a possible build‐up of upward pressures on inflation going forward for the previously mentioned reason. Nonetheless the MPC judges that the current key CBE rates are appropriate given the lagged transmission of the previous rate hike across the economy combined with the mixed balance of risks surrounding the inflation and GDP outlooks at this junctur. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium‐ter. Dr Rania Al‐Mashat Sub Governor.

South Korea,2013-05-09,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points from 2.75% to 2.50%. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to lower the Base Rate by 25 basis points from 2.75% to 2.50%. Based on currently available information, the Committee considers the moderate economic recovery in the US to have continued but the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area to have deepened, while the trends of improvement in economic indicators in emerging market countries such as China have been weaker than initially anticipated, with the result that some central banks, including the ECB, have cut their policy rates. The Committee expects the global economy to continue its modest recovery going forward, but judges that the downside risks to growth remain considerable due chiefly to uncertainties related for instance to the sluggishness of economic activity in the euro area and to the implementations of fiscal consolidation in major countries. In Korea, exports have maintained their trend of recovery, albeit at a modest pace, but the Committee appraises economic growth to have remained weak, with indicators related to domestic demand alternating between improvement and worsening. On the employment front, the increase in the number of persons employed has accelerated, centering around the 50-and-above age group. Going forward there is no change to the Committee's forecast that the domestic economy will show a negative output gap for a considerable time, due mostly to the slow recovery of the global economy, to the influence of Japanese yen weakening, and to the geopolitical risk in Korea. 1 Consumer price inflation recorded 1.2% in April, a level similar to that in the previous month (of 1.3%). Core inflation excluding the prices of agricultural and petroleum products was 1.4%, also similar to its March level of 1.5%. The Committee forecasts that inflation will remain low for the time being, provided there are no occurrences of exceptional factors on the supply side. As for housing prices, the downtrend of those in Seoul and its surrounding areas slowed as transactions increased, and those in the rest of the country continued on their moderate uptrend. In the financial markets, stock prices and the exchange rate have fluctuated substantially under the influence chiefly of concerns about geopolitical risk in Korea and about worsening corporate performances, and the consequent outflows of foreigner stock investment funds. Long-term market interest rates, while greatly influenced by foreigners' investment in bond futures, have fluctuated in response to changes in expectations related to monetary policy and the economy. Looking ahead, the Committee will closely monitor the effects of the Base Rate cut and the economic policies of the government including the supplementary budget, strive to improve the sentiments of economic agents and lower inflation expectations, and conduct monetary policy so as to keep consumer price inflation within the inflation target range over a medium-term horizon while ensuring that the growth potential is not eroded due to the continuation of slow growth."
Malaysia,2013-05-09,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.00 percent. The global growth momentum has continued to be modest. Latest economic data suggests that the recovery is uneven while downside risks to global growth prospects remain. Growth in the major advanced economies continues to be constrained by ongoing fiscal consolidation, slow recovery in financial intermediation and weak labour market conditions. In Asia, while growth has been affected by the weak external environment, domestic demand continues to support growth. Despite the improvements in international financial market conditions, markets remain vulnerable to setbacks and changes in sentiments. In the Malaysian economy, while the external sector is affected by global developments, domestic demand has continued to provide support to growth. Investment activity and private consumption have remained firm. Going forward, the domestic economy is expected to sustain a steady growth. Private consumption is supported by sustained income growth amid stable labour market conditions, while investment activity is being led by capital spending in the domestic-oriented sectors, and progress in the implementation of infrastructure projects. Inflation remained low at 1.5% in the first quarter. While inflation is expected to continue to rise during the year, it is projected to remain modest. Domestic supply and cost factors are expected to contribute to higher prices. Externally, the risk of weather-related supply disruptions remains and could raise global food prices. Nevertheless, given the modest global growth prospects, pressures from global commodity prices are likely to be contained. The MPC considers the current stance of monetary policy to be appropriate given the outlook for inflation and growth. In addition to domestic conditions, the MPC will continue to carefully assess the global economic and financial developments and their implications on the overall outlook for inflation and growth of the Malaysian economy.

Israel,2013-05-13,"The appreciation trend of the shekel continues. In terms of the effective exchange rate, the shekel has appreciated by 2.4 percent in the past month, and by 5.4 percent in the past 3 months. The shekel's strength against the dollar and the euro during these periods stood out markedly in comparison with other currencies' movements vis-C 3A 0-vis the dollar and euro. The appreciation trend was affected by, among other things, the beginning of natural gas production from the Tamar gas field, the interest rate reductions by central banks worldwide, notably the ECB, and the continued quantitative easing programs in several major economies around the world.

Armenia,2013-05-14,"Press Release 14.05.2013 Interest rate unchanged, 8 percent In the May 14th of 2013 Meeting the Board of CBA decided to leave the Refinancing Rate of CBA unchanged, at 8 percent. There was 0.1 percent deflation recorded in April of 2013, with the 12-month inflation of 3.9 percent, almost in concurrence with the target inflation. According to the CBA estimations, the 12-month inflation will go up by the end of the second quarter, staying at the upper bound, but it will however stabilize around the target in the forecast horizon. The Board acknowledged that the global demand remains weak, and in the beginning of the second quarter some deflationary trends were observable in raw materials and food product markets in the world. The Board reckons that some rise in prices of agricultural products in the short run is possible. This is attributable to the agricultural supply shock having receded during the previous year, which will offset a deflationary impact on inflation expected from the external sector. Meanwhile, economic activity in Armenia in the first quarter of 2013 was strong enough due to high growths reported in industry and services (trade volumes, in particular), coupled with increased private consumption this quarter, as well. Note that the impact of private consumption on domestic prices came in mostly moderate as the Government's fiscal policy in the first quarter was more contractionary in relation to the 1st quarter baseline scenario outlined in MP program. In view of the aforementioned developments, the CBA Board finds it reasonable to continue carrying out a neutral monetary policy. In this case the 12-month inflation is estimated to remain around the 4.0% target in the forecast horizon. The Board also admits that inflationary risks may emerge in the short-run perspective as bad weather conditions lately could leave an influence on agriculture and a possible revision of energy tariffs is ahead. The adjustment of the policy rate by the CBA is therefore possible. More information on setting of the interest rate will be available in Inflation Report (Q2, 2013 Monetary Policy Program) due on May 24, 2013. Press Service of the Central Bank."
Peru,2013-05-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR MAY 2013 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 4.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference rate at 4.25 percent. This decision is based on the fact that the rate of inflation is within the target range in a context of economic growth close to the economy's potential level of growth. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants to consider future adjustments in monetary policy instruments. Inflation in April registered a rate of 0.25 percent due mainly to the rise in the price of some food products. Inflation in the last 12 months continued declining and fell from 2.59 percent in March to 2.31 percent in April. Core inflation showed a rate of 0.29 percent (3.40 percent in the last 12 months) and inflation excluding food and energy showed a rate of 0.15 percent (2.41 percent in the last 12 months). Inflation is expected to converge to the middle of the target range in the next months due to the improvement observed in the conditions of food supply, to a pace of growth of economic activity close to the economy's level of potential output, and to inflation expectations anchored to the target range. Current and advanced indicators of activity show that the growth of the Peruvian economy has stabilized around its long-term sustainable level of growth, even though the indicators associated with the external market still show a weak performance that affects the prices and volumes of export products. The Board also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as described below: Overnight deposits: 3.45 percent. Direct repo and rediscount operations: 5.05 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.05 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for June on its session of June 13, 2013."
Russia,2013-05-15,"The Bank of Russia External and Public Relations Department informs that on 15 May 2013 the Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia decided to maintain unchanged the refinancing rate and the interest rates on the Bank of Russia main liquidity provision and absorption operations and to reduce effective from 16 May 2013 the interest rates on certain longer-term operations by 0.25 percentage points (table “Interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations”). The decision was supported by the assessment of inflation risks and economic growth prospects. The cut in the interest rates on longer-term liquidity provision operations brings the cost of obtaining liquidity from the Bank of Russia by credit institutions closer to the interest rates on the Bank of Russia main liquidity provision operations, which will contribute to strengthening the interest rate channel of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. In April and at the beginning of May the rate of inflation remained above the target range and as of 13 May 2013 was estimated at 7.2% over a year ago. Core inflation in April amounted to 5.7%. Observed pace of inflation is mainly explained by the food prices growth and the dynamics of certain regulated prices and tariffs. The inflation rate staying above the target range for a prolonged period of time may affect economic agents' expectations and thus poses inflation risks, in particular taking into account the planned increases in the natural monopolies' tariffs. However, according to the Bank of Russia projections based on the assumptions of maintaining the current monetary policy stance and absence of adverse food prices shocks, the rate of inflation will return to the target range in the second half of 2013. The dynamics of the key macroeconomic indicators pointed to a continuing deceleration of economic growth in the first quarter of 2013. The industrial output did not increase as compared to the first quarter of 2012, investment activity stayed weak. Against this background economic confidence indicators are gradually deteriorating. There remain risks of further economic slowdown, stemming among other factors from the sluggish global recovery. At the same time, labour market conditions and credit dynamics still provide support to the domestic demand. The Bank of Russia will continue to monitor inflation risks and the risks of the economy slowing down. In making monetary policy decisions the Bank of Russia will be guided by the inflation goals and economic growth prospects. The next meeting of the Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia on monetary policy issues is planned to be held in the first half of June 2013.

Chile,2013-05-16,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 16 May 2013 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 5% (annual). International financial conditions show some improvement. The Eurozone remains in recession and in a fragile fiscal and financial situation, while there is increased optimism in the United States and Japan. Incoming indicators for China and other emerging economies point at marginally weaker growth, while several central banks have lowered their policy rates. The dollar has appreciated in international markets. Metal prices receded in recent weeks, especially for copper. Domestically, first-quarter indicators show decelerating output and demand. The labor market is still tight. Headline and core inflation measures remain close to 1% y-o-y, while surveys suggest that inflationary expectations over the policy horizon remain around the target. The exchange rate has depreciated; however, in real terms it is still in the lower part of the range that is compatible with its long- term fundamentals. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. * The Spanish original prevails."
Turkiye,2013-05-16,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to cut the short term interest rates as follows: a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) has been cut from 5 percent to 4.5 percent. b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate has been cut from 4 percent to 3.5 percent while lending rate has been cut from 7 percent to 6.5 percent. Interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions has been cut from 6.5 percent to 6 percent. c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent while lending rate has been cut from 10 percent to 9.5 percent. Recent data suggest that domestic and external demand are evolving in line with expectations. Domestic demand follows a healthy recovery while exports slow down due to weak global economic activity. The current policy framework and the decline in commodity prices limit the impact of the increasing economic activity on the current account deficit. Capital inflows remain strong and credit growth hovers above the reference rate. The Committee indicated that, in order to balance the risks on financial stability, the proper policy would be to keep interest rates low while increasing foreign currency reserves via macroprudential measures. Accordingly, it was deemed appropriate to implement a measured tightening via reserve requirements and reserve options coefficients, while delivering a cut in the short term interest rates. Ongoing uncertainties regarding the global economy and the volatility in capital flows necessitate the monetary policy to remain flexible in both directions. Therefore, the impact of the measures undertaken on credit, domestic demand, and inflation expectations will be monitored closely and the funding amount will be adjusted in either direction, as needed. The Committee has indicated that the weak global demand and the commodity price outlook contain the upward pressures on inflation. In the meantime, the impact of increases in credit and domestic demand on the pricing behavior will be monitored closely. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Nigeria,2013-05-20,"Central Bank of Nigeria Communique No. 89 of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting of Monday and Tuesday. May 20 and 21, 2013 The Monetary Policy Committee met on May 20 and 21, 2013 with 10 out of the 11 members in attendance. The Committee reviewed the conditions and challenges that confronted the domestic economy in the first five months of 2013, and reassessed the short-to-medium term monetary policy options in the light of the fragile global economic and financial environment. The Committee noted that one of the members. Professor Sam Olofin has left the Board of the Central Bank and, therefore, ceases to be a member of the MPC. The Committee recognized his tremendous contributions to its deliberations over the years and thanked him for his services. International Economic Developments Global economic recovery continues to be fragile due to suppressed growth and weakness in key financial markets, including the euro area and Japan. However the emerging market economies and Sub-Sahara African (SSA) countries continued to show resilience. Global growth outlook remains subdued but promising. It is forecast to average 32 per cent in 2013. In the advanced economies, output is estimated to grow by 12 per cent in 2013 compared with 13 per cent in 2012. In the US, budget deficit figures are better than projections due to automatic spending cuts and improved revenues boosted by dividend payments to the Treasury from mortgage banks bailed out during the crisis. Unemployment figures are also improving. Although the European Central Bank has commenced a wave of monetary easing, the euro area is expected to remain in recession with output contracting by 03 per cent compared with a contraction of 06 per cent in 1 2012. The EU made steady progress in establishing a Banking Union, pursuing a three-pronged initiative of the Single Supervisory Mechanism; Deposit Guarantee System; and a Recovery and Resolution Scheme. The development has been adjudged as an important step towards recovery. The regime of quantitative easing commenced by the Bank of Japan holds prospects for Japanese recovery arising from a weaker Yen and improved competitiveness of Japanese exports. However the downside risk lies in Japan's demographics whose key feature is a low propensity to consume, given its large population of pensioners-about 30 per cent. With slowing growth momentum in the emerging markets, global output is forecast to remain around the 2012 level. The emerging and developing economies as a group are forecast to grow by 53 per cent in 2013, with SSA growing at 56 per cent. These economies have continued to face the challenge of adjusting macroeconomic policy to compensate for the weak external environment, particularly shocks induced by developments in the advanced economies. The IMF suggests that with the prospects of improvements in the global economy, policy recalibration in a number of emerging market economies should address risks from sustained rapid credit expansion and high asset prices. Growth in these economies has somewhat moderated compared with last year. The strong GDP growth rate of 77 per cent recorded in the first quarter of 2013 for China was countered by weaker rates in the other economies. Domestic Economic and Financial Developments Output The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) forecasts real GDP growth rate of 672 per cent for Q2, 2013, an improvement over the Q1 estimate of 658 per cent. The major driver of overall growth remains the non-oil sector led by services; agriculture; and wholesale and retail trade. The Committee noted that the 2 relatively robust output growth projection for 2013 was hinged on expected favourable conditions for increased agricultural production and other policy initiatives aimed at stimulating the economy. However the Committee noted with caution, the high GDP growth projection in view of the extant risk factors such as widespread insecurity, weak infrastructure and probable flooding from the projected heavy rains in some parts of the country. In addition, the state of emergency in the North East and the accompanying military operations in that axis have the potential to adversely affect economic activities generally, including agricultural production and food prices, as well as consumer demand. The Committee also noted that although most sectors of the economy showed improved growth performance in Q1 of 2013 when compared with Q1 2012, this was not the case with respect to the key sectors like agriculture, telecommunications and distributive trade. Concern was also expressed over short-term prospects in the oil sector, mainly around possible reduction in oil prices and continuing leakages in oil production due to bunkering and other illegal activities. Prices Headline inflation increased from 86 per cent in March to 91 per cent in April, remaining within the target range for the fourth consecutive month. Food inflation was 100 per cent year-on-year in April compared with 95 per cent in March, while core inflation declined further to 69 per cent from 72 per cent in March. On a month-on-month basis, inflation showed broad-based moderation across almost all components with the exception of imported food which may be largely a reflection of the new tariff regime. The inflation outlook remains relatively benign with projections of headline inflation remaining in the single digit range for the next six months. This result reflects a combination of base effect and the success of tight monetary policy 3 leading to muted growth in the monetary aggregates and exchange rate stability. The principal risks to the outlook remain fiscal spending and possible pressures on the exchange rate from any attrition to reserves caused by declining revenues as a result of output leakages. Monetary Credit and Financial Market Developments Broad money supply (M2) grew by 444 per cent in April 2013 over the level at end-December 2012. When annualised. M2 grew by 133 per cent, compared with the contraction of 003 per cent in the corresponding period of 2012. The growth in M2 was slightly below the growth benchmark of 152 per cent for 2013. Aggregate domestic credit (net) grew by 1746 per cent in April 2013 which annualized to a growth rate of 5238 per cent over the end-December 2012 level, compared with the contraction of 612 per cent recorded in the corresponding period of 2012. Interest rates in the interbank money market moved in tandem with the level of liquidity in the banking system. The average inter-bank call and OBB rates which opened at 1021 and 1023 per cent on March 19 closed at 1086 and 1091 per cent, respectively, on May 16, 2013. The average maximum lending rate rose marginally to 2453 per cent in April, 2013 from 2449 per cent in March, 2013. Similarly the average prime lending rate, rose to 1665 per cent in April 2013, from 1661 per cent in March. The Committee noted the continued recovery in the Nigerian capital market as equities market indicators were positive in the review period. Market Capitalization (MC) also increased by 315 per cent from N897 trillion to N1180 trillion during the same period. Improved earnings, increased capital inflow and portfolio investments as well as investor confidence in the economy contributed to the up-swing in stock prices. The 4 Committee also noted the reported increase in the share of domestic players in the capital market, thus reducing the risk of major shocks due to slowdown in foreign participation. External Sector Developments At the Wholesale Dutch Auction System (wDAS), interbank and the BDC segments of the foreign exchange market, the exchange rate opened at N15732/US$. N15870/US$, and N16000/US$ on 20th March 2013 and closed at N15730/US$. N15833/US$, and N15950/US$, respectively, on May 18, 2013. In all three segments, the naira exchange rate appreciated in the review period. This development reflected the effects of improved supply of foreign exchange to the market. Both the average and monthly premia for the review period remained insignificant, indicating the effectiveness of current policy measures. The Committee also expressed satisfaction with the significant accretion to external reserves which stood at US$4913 billion as at May 16, 2013. This represents an increase of US$53 billion or 121 per cent above the level of US$4383 billion at end-December 2012. This level of reserves could finance approximately 13 months of import. The Committee's Considerations The Committee was pleased with the prevailing macroeconomic stability- moderation in all measures of inflation on month-on-month basis; stable banking system and exchange rate and robust external reserves. It commended the agreement reached between the CBN and AMCON on the settlement of outstanding AMCON obligations to all private sector investors by December 2014 and to repay the N36 trillion debts held by the CBN under a new refinancing and restructuring arrangement within a period not exceeding ten years at single-digit interest rate. The Committee noted that the repayments and 5 refinancing arrangements would have no adverse monetary policy implications; but rather increase confidence in the financial system. Also under this arrangement, it is unlikely that banks will be required to contribute more than 05 per cent of their Balance Sheets annually to the sinking fund. By October 2014, the CBN will be the sole creditor to AMCON, holding bonds guaranteed by the Federal Government of Nigeria. The Federal Government will therefore have no contingent liability to any party other than the CBN, and the Bank will recover its debt from AMCON recoveries and contributions to the Sinking Fund by the banks. Since the CBN supervises and regulates the banks and AMCON, this exposure is considered a fair risk. The Committee was concerned about the threat posed by developments in the oil sector arising from uncertain oil market environment, high output leakages arising from oil theft which has negatively affected the oil sector's contribution to GDP and the prospects for declining output if the state of affairs continues. The Committee observed that the accretion to reserves resulted principally from increased portfolio capital inflows. The Committee noted the potential effect of this development on exchange rates, reserves and the capital account in the event of capital flow reversal, and thus stressed the need to maintain stability and retain confidence of investors in the consistency of monetary policy. The Committee also expressed concern over the low level of credit growth to the private sector and traced this to the crowding out effect of high growth in credit to the public sector. The Committee noted the N102 trillion increase in claims on government and the N111 trillion drawdown on savings between January and April 2013 and particularly the monetization of US$1 billion in April 2013, being proceeds of the Excess Crude Account. The combined effect of new borrowings and reduced savings was an increase in net credit to the central government of over N2 trillion in the first four months of 2013. The 6 evidence points to an increase in the rate of government expenditure in 2013 when compared with 2012. In addition, the recent military action in the North- East will result in additional spending. Although the Government has announced that there will be no supplementary budget, the Coordinating Minister for the Economy and Honorable Minister of Finance has already announced that there will be a drawdown on a Contingency Vote embedded in the 2013 Budget to cover emergencies. Overall the Committee is of the view that government spending will constitute a major risk to the inflation and exchange rate outlook, thus advising prudence in monetary policy action at this time. The Committee further noted that in spite of increased borrowings, yields on FGN bonds have been declining steadily, signaling the impact of increased inflows while equity prices have been trending upwards. The evidence does not, therefore, support claims of monetary policy being too tight. The Committee was of the view that the principal risks to long-term stability can be addressed through diligent implementation of sound policies of fiscal consolidation and efficient sectoral policies underpinned by structural reforms. These are required to attract long term foreign capital inflow that would make the gains of monetary policy sustainable, and also support credit extension to the private sector players. Consequently the Committee weighed the following options: A reduction in rates in view of declining core inflation, stable exchange rates and relative reserve accretion. Against the backdrop of sustained pressure to ease the stance of monetary policy, the Committee considered the imperative of signaling its sensitivity to the concerns expressed about high lending rates in the economy; 7 Retaining current monetary policy stance to sustain the macroeconomic gains of tight monetary policy and to continue to rein-in inflationary expectations. The Committee's Decisions The Committee considered and acknowledged the merits of option 1 but rejected it as being premature in view of the potential risk factors in the horizon posed by recent developments which would necessitate increased fiscal expenditure in the short-to-medium term, resulting in a resurgence of inflationary pressures. The Committee considered and decided by a majority of 7 votes to hold and 3 votes to reduce the MPR by 50 basis points. Thus by a majority vote of 7 members to 3, the MPC voted to maintain the current policy stance ie. retain the MPR at 12 per cent with a corridor of +/-200 basis points around the MPR; retain the Cash Reserve Requirement at 12 per cent and Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent; with the Net Open Position at 10 per cent. In the final analysis, the Committee was convinced that in view of the successes achieved in all fronts -banking stability, low inflation, exchange rate stability, strong reserve buffers and recovery in the equities market, there is no reason at this point to change a policy that has worked so well.

Nigeria,2013-05-22,"CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA PRESS RELEASE Misrepresentation of MPC Communique The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has noted with concern the lead story in an Abuja-based newspaper today. Wednesday. May 22, 2013, with the headline “Sanusi Condemns Emergency Rule”. We hereby state as follows: 1. That the said report is a complete misrepresentation of the content of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) Communique No. 89, issued on May 21, 2013. That the said MPC communique never, in any form, condemned the state of emergency in the affected states. For the avoidance of doubt, and in reviewing the likely factors that could influence economic dynamics in the coming months, the MPC communique, cited the fiscal implication of the state of emergency, which is a likely increase in government spending, thus making it imprudent to embark on monetary easing at this time. That the said newspaper was not represented at the post-MPC media briefing despite being invited to attend same. That this report is in the pattern of similar concerted attempts to fabricate false stories in the past by some sections of the media against the Bank and its principal officers. That the Central Bank of Nigeria joins other well-meaning Nigerians in urging our journalists and editors to reflect on the poor professional conduct and practice of some members of the mass media and the implications of false, sensational stories on institutions, public officers and the nation. For the umpteenth time, we appeal to media practitioners to always endeavor to verify their facts, put national interest first and to display utmost patriotism in their reporting.

South Africa,2013-05-23,"The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas was 5,9 per cent in April 2013, unchanged from the previous two months. However, the drivers of the overall rate changed somewhat. Food price inflation measured 6,3 per cent in April, reversing the downward trend that had prevailed since November 2012. The contribution of food to overall inflation remained unchanged at 0,9 percentage points while housing and utilities, contributed 1,4 percentage points. Administered prices increased by 8,9 per cent, and by 7,8 per cent excluding petrol. Core inflation, which excludes food, petrol and electricity, measured 5,2 per cent, marginally up from 5,1 per cent in March. The headline producer price inflation for final manufactured goods measured 5,7 per cent in March, up from 5,4 per cent in February. The inflation forecast of the Bank was relatively unchanged since the previous meeting of the MPC. Inflation is now expected to average 0,1 percentage points lower in 2013 and 2014 at 5,8 per cent and 5,2 per cent respectively, and to average 5,0 per cent in 2015. A temporary breach of the upper end of the target range is still expected in the third quarter of 2013, but at a lower average level of 6,1 per cent (6,3 per cent previously), followed by a gradual moderation of inflation to 4,9 per cent in the final quarter of 2015. The slight improvement is due to changed assumptions about international commodity prices, including oil, and lower global inflation. The forecast for core inflation for 2013, at an average of 5,3 per cent, is significantly higher than the forecast of 4,8 per cent previously. This follows the sharp increase in medical insurance costs in the February CPI. Core inflation is also expected to be adversely affected over the coming months by increases in a number of other administered prices, particularly water and municipal rates and taxes. This measure is expected to peak at 5,4 per cent in both the third and fourth quarter of 2013, and to average 5,0 per cent and 4,6 per cent in the coming two years. Despite the higher near-term trend, this indicator is still assessed to reflect an absence of significant demand pressures. Inflation expectations, as reflected in the Reuters survey of analysts conducted in April, has remained relatively stable for some months. The forecast is the same as the Bank's for 2013, although higher for the next two years but still within the target range. The relatively anchored inflation expectations at the upper end of the target range are also evident in the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research (BER) in the first quarter of 2013. Overall, respondents expect inflation to average 6,0 per cent in both 2013 and 2014, and 6,1 per cent in 2015. The global economic environment remains challenging, with different regions growing at varying rates. Within the advanced economies, the United States appears to be showing a number of positive signs of recovery: the University of Michigan's consumer confidence index is at its highest in almost six years; labour market developments have been more favourable; and there are strong wealth effects from the booming equity market as well as from the recovering housing market. However, headwinds can be expected from the fiscal contraction resulting from the fiscal cliff compromise and the spending cuts that were part of the recent sequester. The impact of this contraction is expected to be as high as two percentage points of GDP. The Eurozone remains in recession, having contracted at an annualised rate of 0,9 per cent in the first quarter of 2013, compared with a contraction of 2,7 per cent in the previous quarter. The French economy has recorded two consecutive quarters of negative growth, while Germany managed to avoid recession by recording annualised growth of 0,3 per cent in the first quarter of this year. The Eurozone is constrained by continued deleveraging by households, banks and governments and the region is also characterised by increasing financial fragmentation. Although a slower pace of fiscal consolidation in the periphery has been agreed to in terms of the bail-out agreements, negative or at best very low growth is expected to persist in the region for some time. The Japanese economy rebounded from its 2012 recession in the first quarter of 2013, but it is still too soon to assess the impact of the fiscal, monetary and structural policy stimulus packages that were announced recently. The yen exchange rate, which has depreciated by around 30 per cent against the US dollar since October 2012, is likely to contribute positively to growth. Emerging markets remain the main global source of growth, but there are signs of moderation in some of the systemically important countries, particularly China. India and Brazil. The rebalancing of the Chinese economy away from fixed capital formation and production toward internal consumption has resulted in some slowdown, which has contributed to the declining trend of global commodity prices. The persistence of slow global growth and weaker commodity prices have resulted in a moderation in global inflation. This is particularly the case with respect to energy prices in the advanced economies. This combination of lower inflation and slow growth prompted further monetary easing by the ECB, and with Japan yet to begin with its quantitative monetary easing, these accommodative policy stances are likely to persist for some time. While there are concerns about the possible risks posed to financial markets and global capital flows by an early reversal of the US monetary policy stance, any such action is likely to be extremely cautious, and is only expected to begin once a sustained recovery is well-entrenched. There are, however, growing concerns that the buoyant conditions in the financial markets in many countries are indicative of bubbles caused by excessive global liquidity, rather than reflecting underlying positive growth prospects. Movements in the exchange rate of the rand continue to be impacted by external developments, but since mid-2012 these have been compounded by domestic factors which have undermined investor sentiment. The increasingly fraught labour relations environment, and high wage demands in the mining sector in particular, are likely to continue to impact adversely on the volume of mining exports against a backdrop of falling international commodity prices and concerns about the widening of the current account deficit of the balance of payments. These developments also have the potential to affect, directly and indirectly. South Africa's credit ratings, and increase the cost of much-needed finance. The rand has also been influenced in recent weeks by the hedging related to renewable energy projects, as well as a strengthening dollar. Since the previous meeting of the MPC, the rand has depreciated by around 4,6 per cent against the US dollar, and by 3,7 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. Despite the current negative sentiment towards the rand, non-residents have remained net buyers of bonds and equities this year. Since January, non-residents have been net buyers of equities to the value of R12,7 billion, and bonds to the value of R22,5 billion. However, these positive inflows can reverse very quickly in response to changing risk perceptions. Furthermore, any hedging of these exposures, as is sometimes the case during periods of rand weakness, puts pressure on the rand even though the underlying assets are still held by non-residents. As we have noted previously, the impact of the weaker rand on inflation is dependent on the extent, speed and duration of the depreciation, as well as the phase of the business cycle. While some of the recent decline reflects changes in the underlying fundamentals, the rand remains highly vulnerable to changes in sentiment. The rand has a tendency to overshoot in either direction, and at times for extended, but uncertain, periods making the impact on inflation difficult to forecast. The current level of the exchange rate, if sustained, poses a significant upside risk to the inflation outlook. Domestic growth prospects remain fragile amid low consumer confidence, continued output disruptions in the mining sector, electricity supply constraints and a weak global environment. The growth forecast of the Bank has been revised down from 2,7 per cent to 2,4 per cent for 2013 and from 3,7 per cent to 3,5 per cent in 2014. Growth is expected to accelerate to 3,8 per cent in 2015. At these growth rates, the negative output gap will widen further before stabilising next year, and begin to close during 2015. This outlook is consistent with the flat trajectory of the Bank's leading indicator of economic activity. Notwithstanding the increase in the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index in the first quarter of 2013, given the difficult labour relations environment in the country and the risks to global growth, the downside risk to growth remains, as does the possibility of increased job losses. Although the physical volume of mining production recorded a quarter-to-quarter increase of 6,1 per cent in the first quarter of 2013 following the disruptions in the previous quarter, output contracted on a month-to-month basis in both February and March. The outlook for the sector remains bleak with threats of shaft closures and retrenchments, falling commodity prices, high wage demands and a risk of protracted periods of industrial action and further supply disruptions. Manufacturing production declined in the first quarter of 2013 compared with the previous quarter, although the extent of the decline is complicated by the seasonal adjustment for the Easter weekend which fell over March and April. The Kagiso PMI, which increased marginally above the neutral 50 level in April, reflects the uncertain outlook for the sector. The depreciated value of the rand should improve the competitiveness of the sector, provided that gains are not eroded by rising wages and prices. The weaker rand is expected to result in some narrowing of the trade deficit. However, the subdued global demand, together with robust import volume growth driven to a large extent by infrastructure projects, suggests that the net export position will remain negative over the forecast period, and continue to be a constraint on growth. Nevertheless, the BER manufacturing confidence index, while still low, improved somewhat in the first quarter. The outlook for household consumption expenditure, in recent years the main driver of growth, appears to have weakened with the FNB/BER Consumer Confidence Index declining to a nine-year low in the first quarter of 2013. Retail sales grew at a modest quarter-to-quarter rate of 0,6 per cent in the first quarter of this year, while sales contracted on a month-to-month basis in March. This was consistent with the decline in the BER retail confidence index in the first quarter. New vehicle sales growth, while increasing significantly on a year-on-year basis, moderated to 0,1 per cent on a 3-month-to-3 month basis in April. Consumption expenditure by households is expected to be constrained in part by lower real income growth, significant increases in the price of electricity and petrol, and high debt levels. The slowdown in expenditure growth has also been related to the moderation in some categories of credit extension by banks. Year-on-year growth in total loans and advances to the private sector moderated steadily from a recent peak of 10 per cent in December, to 8,1 percent in March 2013. Excluding the weak growth in mortgage advances, year-on-year growth in loans and advances declined from 18,5 per cent in December 2012 to 14,5 per cent in March. Although growth in unsecured lending to households remains at high levels, it has declined continuously since September 2012, to measure 27,9 per cent in March. This moderating trend is expected to continue, due in part to the increasing number of impaired advances in this category of lending at some of the banks. However the ratio of total impaired advances to total loans and advances in the banking sector continues to decline and stands at just below 4 per cent. A number of sectors in the economy are entering into wage-bargaining rounds. The MPC is increasingly concerned about the prospect of settlements well above inflation and productivity growth and the risk of protracted and disruptive strike action, with negative implications for growth and exports. Furthermore, excessively high settlements will come at the expense of retention of employees, employment creation and could result in higher inflation. The risk of a wage-price spiral remains high. This would negate the benefits of wage increases to workers, and undermine the competitive gains of the currency depreciation. According to Andrew Levy Employment Publications, the overall wage settlement rate in collective bargaining agreements increased from 7,6 per cent in 2012 to 7,9 per cent in the first quarter of 2013. Should this upward momentum continue, it is likely to impart an upside risk to inflation. At a time of high and rising unemployment and slowing growth, the imperative of an economy-wide commitment to wage and salary restraint at all levels, including executive pay, cannot be over-emphasised. International oil prices are expected to remain constrained by the subdued global growth environment, but vulnerable to political developments in the Middle East in particular. Having reached a recent high of around US$118 per barrel in mid-February of this year. Brent crude oil prices have remained in a range of between US$97 and US$105 per barrel since April. The domestic price of petrol increased by 12 cents in April, but declined by 73 cents in May, mainly as a result of lower international oil prices. Although there is currently a small average over-recovery on the petrol price, recent exchange rate movements have raised the probability of further petrol price increases in the near term. The higher CPI food price increases in April may have reversed the favourable food price developments observed in recent months. Since the end of November 2012 to date, domestic maize prices have declined by about 17 per cent, and wheat prices by around 9 per cent. This is reflected in the producer price index for agriculture which increased at a year-on-year rate of 1,4 per cent in February and declined by 0,2 per cent in March. Manufactured food prices, by contrast, increased by 6,1 per cent and 6,3 per cent in the same months respectively, in line with CPI food price increases. The exchange rate poses an upside risk to food inflation as prices of agricultural commodities such as wheat and maize are based on international prices. The MPC is increasingly concerned about the deteriorating outlook for the South African economy. There are a number of critical domestic issues that are contributing to the vulnerability of the economy that need to be urgently addressed. These include the financing of the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments; the fractious labour relations environment and the associated risks of protracted work stoppages and excessive wage increases; electricity supply constraints; upside risks to inflation; downside risks to growth and employment creation in a context of high unemployment; and declining domestic and foreign investor confidence which could impact directly on capital flows. These interrelated developments are reflected in the volatility and weakness in the exchange rate. There is an urgent imperative for all parties – government, business, labour and civil society – to interact and address these issues and vulnerabilities at a national level. While the Bank is prepared to play its part, many of these challenges are beyond the role, scope and effectiveness of monetary policy. While a depreciated exchange rate is part of the balance of payments adjustment mechanism, the competitive advantages thereof need to be realised through price and wage restraint. In the absence of such restraint, the outcome is simply higher inflation with the risk of an exchange rate-inflation spiral. Given the current unsettled environment in the economy, the MPC assesses the risks to inflation to be on the upside, while many of the above factors contribute to a downside risk to growth. The MPC assesses the current stance of monetary policy to be accommodative. Given the risks outlined above, the scope for further monetary easing is limited at this stage. The MPC has therefore decided to leave the repurchase rate unchanged at 5 per cent per annum. The MPC is ready to act appropriately in either direction in the event of material changes in the outlook."
Israel,2013-05-27,"Following on the measures announced by theMonetary Committee two weeks ago, the Committee decided to reduce the interest rate and thus narrow the gaps between the Bank of Israel's interest rate and the rates in major economies worldwide, in order to weaken the forces for appreciation of the shekel. During the past two months, the accommodative monetary policy of major central bankshas continued, and has even accelerated in the past month. The ECB reducedits interest rate to a record low of 0.5 percent and its president stated that he does not rule out further interest rate reductions. Quantitative easing plans continue in the US, and the Bank of Japan announced at the beginning of April that it would double the rate of its bond purchase plan. The expansionary policy of central banks in major advanced economies is expected to continue, according to their announcements, in the coming year as well. To viewthis message as Word doc. Background conditions. Thedecision to reduce the interest rate for June 2013 by 0.25 percentage points, to 1.25 percent, is consistent with the Bank of Israel's interest rate policy, which is intended to entrench the inflation rate within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel and in the global economy, the monetary policies of major central banks, and developments in the exchange rate of the shekel. Inflation data:Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Inflation expectations from various sources were around 1.7 percent at the time (two weeks ago) of the unscheduled Monetary Committee decision to reduce the interest rate and implement a plan to purchase foreign exchange in order offset the effect of gas production. After the Committee's decision and the April CPI were published, inflation expectations from the various sources increased slightly, and are now slightly below the midpoint of the target range. Inflation expectations for terms of 2 years and longer (monthly averages) range from 2.3 percent to 2.5 percent. The expected increases in VAT and in electricity prices are expected to lead to higher prices in coming months, though the recent declines in prices of commodities and energy are expected to act to lower prices. Expectations for the Bank of Israel interest rate one year from now derived from various sources range between 1.3 percent and 1.45 percent. Real economic activity: Updated indicators of economic activity which have become available so far indicate continued moderate growth in the first quarter, and a mixed trend in April. Based on National Accounts data, the GDP growth rate in the first quarter of 2013 was similar to the average growth rate over the previous 4 quarters, about 2.8 percent in annual terms. Growth in goods and services exports and in private consumption expenditure contributed to GDP growth. Investment in the principal industries declined by 19.3 percent, continuing declines of 11.6 percent and 6.9 percent, respectively, in the previous two quarters. Exports of goods and services increased by 5.6 percent: after declines of 10 percent and 5 percent, respectively, in the previous two quarters: bringing the figure back to the level it was at in the first quarter of 2011. In contrast to National Accounts data, the Climate Indices which are derived from the Business Tendency Survey of the Central Bureau of Statistics, and the Composite State of the Economy Index of the Bank of Israel indicate an increased rate of growthcompared with the previous quarter. The government's budget plan, should it be approved by the Knesset, is expected to reduce the deficit target from 4.65 percent of GDP in 2013 to 3 percent of GDP in 2014. This decline, while regaining budgetary control, is expected to moderate the growth rate of demand. The labor market: Labor force survey data for the first quarter indicatea continued decline in the unemployment rate with a slight increase in theemployment rate. In the first quarter, the unemployment rate declined to 6.5 percent (a decline of 0.3 percentage points) and the employment rate increased to 59.5 percent (an increase of 0.1 percentage points). The number of employed persons increased in the first quarter by 0.7 percent compared with the final quarter of 2012. It appears that in the past year the employment rate has stabilized at a high level, after increasing rapidly in the previous two years. The stability in employment in the past two months is reflected as well in the number of employee posts, which remained unchanged in the private sector in February, while the number of posts in the government sector increased by 0.3 percent. Nominal wages declined by 0.1 percent, and real wages declined by 0.4 percent, in January-February comparedwith the fourth quarter of 2012, based on seasonally adjusted data. Healthtax receipts by the National Insurance Institute, which provide an indication of nominal wage payments, were 4.4 percent higher in March-April than in the corresponding period of the previous year, reflecting a slowdown in the growth of wages compared with the preceding 2 month period, whenthere was an average year over year increase of 5.7 percent. Budget data: In April, the government continued to operate without an approved budget framework and in accordance with the law allowing it to spend 1/12 of the overall 2012 budget each month in 2013 (including debt repayments), until a budget framework is approved. On May 5, 2013, the government approved increased expenditure in 2013 of about NIS 6.5 billion more than that derived from the fiscal rule, as well as an increased deficit ceiling, to 4.65 percent of GDP. Cumulative tax receipts for the year to date are about NIS 2.5 billion below the seasonal path consistent with revenue projections. In April, the domestic deficit was about NIS 2.5 billion, about NIS 0.7 billion lower than the seasonal path consistent with achieving the new deficit target. The cumulative deficit from the beginning of the year is about NIS 5.7 billion, about NIS 0.4 billion lower than the seasonal path consistent with the deficit ceiling of 4.65 percent of GDP. The foreign exchange market: From the monetary policy discussion on March 24, 2013, through the unscheduled discussion on May 12, 2013, the shekel appreciated by about 2.9 percent against the dollar and by 2.2 percent against the euro. In terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, the shekel appreciated by about 2.8 percent during the period. Since that date, the shekel has weakened by about 3.9 percent against the dollar, by 3.5 percent against the euro, and by 3.2 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. Since May 12, most currencies weakened against the dollar, though most of them by less than the shekel. The capital and money markets: From March 24, 2013, through May 24, 2013, the Tel Aviv 25 Index declined by 2 percent. Yields on government bonds declined sharply, and the yield differential between 10-year Israeli government bonds and equivalent 10-year US Treasury securities contracted by about 60 basis points, to 150 basis points. Makam yields declined along the entire curve, with declines of up to 20 basis points since the announcement of the interest rate reduction. One-year yields declined to 1.32 percentduring the period. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spread declined during the period from 121 basis points to 100 basis points, but increased again this month to 116 basis points. The Tel-Bond 60 Index increased markedly by about 3.2 percent over the period. Spreadsin the corporate bond market narrowed, primarily for debt issued by companies with lower ratings. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in April, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 8.9 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexeddeposits of up to one year) increased by 6.7 percent. Developments in the credit markets: The shekel's appreciation was the main factor in the 0.9 percent decline of business sector debt in March, to NIS 778 billion. Bond issuance by the nonfinancial private sector inMarch-April averaged NIS 1.7 billion per month, compared with NIS 3.3 billion, on average, in the first two months of the year. Total outstanding credit to households increased in March by 1 percent compared with February, to NIS 389 billion. The balance of credit for housing continued to increase, to NIS 274 billion in March, an increase of 0.8 percent compared with February. The total volume of new mortgages granted was NIS 3.8 billion in March and NIS 4.1 billion in April, similar to levels in recent months of about NIS 4 billion per month. Interest rates on new fixed rate. CPI-indexed mortgages declined in April, while the interest rate on variable rate mortgages remained stable. It appears that the Banking Supervision Department's directives had an effect on purchasers of homes for investment. The rate of mortgages granted to investment home purchasers with high LTV ratios (60-90 percent) declined from about 37 percent in November 2012 to around 9.5 percent in March 2013. Likewise, the size of the average mortgage taken out for purchasing an investment home declined during the same period by 20 percent, compared with stability in the average size of mortgages overall. ;The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (based on housing rents) increased by 0.9 percent in April, continuing an increase of 0.8 percent in March. In the twelve months ending in April, this component increased by 3 percent, compared with an increase of 2.9 percent in the twelve months ending in March. Home prices, which are published in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of home prices but are not included in the CPI, increased in February-March by 0.5 percent, continuing an increase of 1.4 percent in January-February. The rate of increase in home prices continues to rise. In the twelve months ending in March, home prices increased by 10.5 percent, compared with an increase of 10.1 percent in the twelve months to February. ; Therewere 39,330 building starts in the 12 months ending in February, and this is expected to continue to support a high level of stock of homes. At the same time, this is still lower than the rate in 2011. ;The global economy: The global economy continued to present a mixed macroeconomic picture in the past two months. Macro data published recently in the US were mostly positive and indicated a moderate improvement. In theeurozone, data indicated deepening recession, while in China, the data pointed toward a more significant than expected slowdown. In April, the IMF revised its 2013 growth forecast downward for most major economies. Projections were lowered by 0.2 percentage points for the global economy, to 3.3 percent, for the US economy, to 1.9 percent, and for the eurozone, to -0.3 percent. The growth forecast for China was reduced by 0.1 percentage points, to 8 percent. According to the IMF, the main risk remains the situation in Europe, with improvement there expected to be slow, as it continues to suffer from restraining budgetary policy and from a low supply of bank credit. The medium term risks include recession in Europe, fiscal crisis in Japan, and slower than expected growth in developing economies. Against the background of the economic picture, many central banks continued accommodative monetary policy: quantitative easing plans continue in the US, the ECB reduced its interest rate to a record low of 0.5 percent as the bank's president noted that he does not rule out a further interest rate reduction, and the Bank of Japan announced at the beginning of April that it would double the rate of its planned bond purchases (a step which reinforced the weakness of the yen and apparently led other central banks to reduce the interest rate and intervene in foreign exchange markets). Inflation in major economies declined. The main considerations behind the decision Thedecision to reduce the interest rate for June 2013 by 0.25 percentage points, to 1.25 percent, is consistent with the Bank of Israel's interest rate policy, which is intended to entrench the inflation rate within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The following are the main considerations underlying the decision: Following on the measures announced by theMonetary Committee two weeks ago, the Committee decided to reduce the interest rate and thus narrow the gaps between the Bank of Israel's interest rate and the rates in major economies worldwide, in order to weaken the forces for appreciation of the shekel. In April, the IMF revised downward its 2013 growth forecast for most major economies. ;. The cumulative deficit from the beginning of the year is about NIS 5.7 billion, about NIS 0.4 billion lower than the seasonal path consistent with the deficit ceiling of 4.65 percent of GDP. The foreign exchange market: From the monetary policy discussion on March 24, 2013, through the unscheduled discussion on May 12, 2013, the shekel appreciated by about 2.9 percent against the dollar and by 2.2 percent against the euro.

At the same time, this is still lower than the rate in 2011. ;The global economy: The global economy continued to present a mixed macroeconomic picture in the past two months. The main considerations behind the decision. The following are the main considerations underlying the decision:. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets, particularly in light of the continuing uncertainty in the global economy. The Bank will use the tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. The minutes of the discussions prior to the interest rate decision for June 2013 will be published on June 10, 2013. The decision regarding the interest rate for July 2013 will be published at 17:30 on Monday. June 24, 2013."
Hungary,2013-05-28,"At its meeting on 28 May 2013, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by 25 basis points from 4.75% to 4.50%, with effect from 29 May 2013. In the Council's judgement. Hungarian economic growth is likely to resume this year following last year's recession. The level of output remains below its potential and unemployment exceeds its long-term level determined by structural factors. The Council expects weak demand conditions to persist, which will ensure that inflationary pressures in the economy remain muted in the period ahead. Inflation slowed sharply in April, partly related to developments in the prices of non-core items. Recent trends in underlying inflation continue to reflect the strong downward pressure of weak domestic demand on prices. The subdued rate of earnings growth suggests that companies are adjusting through the labour market more strongly in response to the increase in production costs, and therefore the pass-through into consumer prices is likely to be moderate. Recent developments in energy and commodity prices as well as the forint exchange rate have also contributed to the disinflation process. In the Council's judgement, these factors indicate that inflation risks will remain moderate in the medium term. Preliminary data suggest that the Hungarian economy may recover from recession in the first half of 2013. The correction of adverse one-off shocks at the end of last year may also have contributed significantly to the strong quarter-on-quarter growth. The main underlying factors driving growth have not changed significantly: the outlook for global growth remains weak, while precautionary motives continue to be a drag on the recovery in domestic demand. A sustained pick-up in growth is likely to occur from the end of the year as demand in Hungary's export markets improves. Risk appetite in global financial markets has remained strong in the past month. In the supportive environment, domestic indicators of risk continued to fall. The Council judges, however, that the contrast between the benign financial market environment and the weak outlook for global growth continues to pose a risk, which calls for maintaining a cautious approach to policy. In the Council's judgement, the incoming economic data suggest that weak demand continues to exert a strong disinflationary impact on prices, and therefore companies have limited ability to pass on higher production costs into prices, while they are making stronger adjustment through the labour market. Perceptions of the risks associated with the economy have improved. The outlook for inflation and the real economy point to a reduction in interest rates. The Council will consider a further reduction in the policy rate if the medium-term outlook for inflation remains in line with the Bank's 3 per cent target and the improvement in financial market sentiment is sustained."
Thailand,2013-05-29,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 28‐29 May 2013 Mr. Paiboon Kittisrikangwan. Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meetings on 28 and 29 May 2013 as follows. The global economic recovery was slower than expected. The US economy continued to recover gradually. The eurozone economy remained weak, but tail risks have declined. The Chinese and Asian economies expanded less than expected, which may cause a delay in Thai exports' recovery. Meanwhile the Japanese economy began to benefit from economic stimulus policies, as reflected by improvement in exports and private consumption. Global financial market remained volatile, leading to persistent capital flows into the region and exchange rate volatility. The Thai economy in the first quarter of this year grew less than expected from tepid domestic demand, which could weigh on overall economic momentum particularly if there was delay in government's infrastructure investment expected to start later this year. Exports are subject to downside risks from growth moderation in regional economies, especially China. Inflationary pressure eased further owing to lower production costs, while growth of private credit and household debts remained elevated. The committee judges that the Thai economy should continue to expand on the back of sound economic fundamentals, although downside risks have increased from lower‐than‐ expected growth in the first quarter of this year. As inflation remains well within the target, monetary policy has room to further cushion against downside risks to domestic demand. Against the backdrop of continued financial stability concerns, the MPC thus voted unanimously to reduce the policy rate by 025 percent from 275 to 250 percent per annum, with immediate effect. The MPC will closely monitor developments of the Thai economy, financial stability risks as well as capital flow situation, and stand ready to take appropriate action as warranted."
Poland,2013-06-05,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 5 June 2013 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 4-5 June 2013 The Council decided to decrease the NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage points:  reference rate to 2.75% on an annual basis;  lombard rate to 4.25% on an annual basis;  deposit rate to 1.25% on an annual basis;  bill rediscount rate to 3.00% on an annual basis. Global economic activity remained weak in 2013 Q1. However, economic growth differed significantly across economies. GDP growth acceleration in the United States was accompanied by persisting recession in the euro area and some decline in GDP growth in some major developing countries, including China. In Germany. GDP growth was positive, whereas in other large euro area economies GDP continued to decline. Despite signs of some improvement, recent data on business conditions in the euro area point to persistently negative trends in that economy at the beginning of Q2. Weak global activity growth, and the previous fall in commodity prices, has supported further decline in inflation in many countries. In Poland, preliminary data on GDP in 2013 Q1 point to a slightly stronger than expected weakening in economic growth. Decline in GDP growth in Q1 resulted from lower positive contribution of net exports to GDP growth amidst persistently declining domestic demand. The decline in domestic demand  amidst persistent stagnation in consumption  continued to be driven by falling investment, yet, the fall was lower than in the previous quarter. The April data on industrial and construction output and retail sales, as well as the majority of business climate indicators show that weak economic growth continued at the beginning of Q2. The continuing slowdown in demand in 2013 Q1 contributed to further deterioration in the labour market; in particular the number of employed decreased and unemployment rose. Also the April data on the corporate sector point to a continued decline in employment, accompanied by rising registered unemployment rate (in seasonally adjusted terms). The situation in the labour market supports low wage growth. In April 2013, growth in lending to the private sector remained limited. Both growth in loans to households and enterprises continued to be low. CPI inflation in April 2013 declined again, reaching 0.8% y/y, i.e. a level markedly below the NBP inflation target of 2.5%. The decline in inflation was mainly driven by a lower growth in energy prices, including prices of fuels. At the same time, low level of core inflation, as well as 00-919 Warszawa, ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, phone (+48 22) 653 28 88, fax (+48 22) 653 13 28 a stronger decline in producer prices, confirm persistently low demand and cost pressure in the economy. This is accompanied by a further decline in inflation expectations of households. In the opinion of the Council, incoming data point to weaker than expected economic growth in Poland and a stronger  than forecasted in the March projection  decline in inflation. At the same time, uncertainty about the scale and timing of the expected economic recovery in the euro area persists, which can adversely affect economic activity in Poland. Therefore, the Council decided to lower the NBP interest rates again. The Council assesses that monetary policy easing conducted since November 2012 supports economic recovery and limits the risk of inflation running below the NBP target in the medium term."
Euroarea,2013-06-06,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup. Finance Minister Dijsselbloem. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Incoming information has confirmed our assessment which led to the cut in interest rates in early May. The underlying price pressure in the euro area is expected to remain subdued over the medium term. In keeping with this picture, monetary and, in particular, credit dynamics remain subdued. Medium-term inflation expectations for the euro area continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. At the same time, recent economic sentiment survey data have shown some improvement from low levels. The accommodative stance of our monetary policy, together with the significant improvements in financial markets since mid-2012, should contribute to support prospects for an economic recovery later in the year. Against this overall background, our monetary policy stance will remain accommodative for as long as necessary. In the period ahead, we will monitor very closely all incoming information on economic and monetary developments and assess any impact on the outlook for price stability. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Real GDP contracted by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2013, following a decline of 0.6% in the fourth quarter of 2012. Output has thus declined for six consecutive quarters, with labour market conditions remaining weak. Recent developments in economic sentiment survey data have shown some improvement from low levels. Looking ahead to later in the year and to 2014, euro area export growth should benefit from a recovery in global demand, while domestic demand should be supported by the accommodative stance of our monetary policy and by the recent real income gains due to lower oil prices and generally lower inflation. Furthermore, the significant improvements in financial markets seen since last summer should work their way through to the real economy, as should the progress made in fiscal consolidation. At the same time, the remaining necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors will continue to weigh on economic activity. Overall, euro area economic activity should stabilise and recover in the course of the year, albeit at a subdued pace. This assessment is also reflected in the June 2013 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real GDP declining by 0.6% in 2013 and increasing by 1.1% in 2014. Compared with the March 2013 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the projection for 2013 has been revised marginally downwards, largely reflecting the incorporation of the latest GDP data releases. The Governing Council continues to see downside risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area. They include the possibility of weaker than expected domestic and global demand and slow or insufficient implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.4% in May 2013, up from 1.2% in April. This increase was, in particular, accounted for by a rebound in services prices related to the unwinding of the Easter effect and an increase in food prices. More generally, as stated last month, annual inflation rates are expected to be subject to some volatility throughout the year due particularly to base effects relating to energy and food price developments twelve months earlier. Looking through this volatility, the underlying price pressure over the medium term is expected to remain subdued, reflecting low capacity utilisation and a modest pace of economic recovery. Over the medium term, inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability. This assessment is also reflected in the June 2013 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation at 1.4 % and 1.3 % in 2013 and 2014, respectively. In comparison with the March 2013 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the projection for inflation for 2013 has been revised downwards, mainly reflecting the fall in oil prices, while the projection for 2014 remains unchanged. In the Governing Council's assessment, risks to the outlook for price developments are broadly balanced over the medium term, with upside risks relating to stronger than expected increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, as well as higher commodity prices, and downside risks stemming from weaker economic activity. Turning to the monetary analysis, recent data confirm that the underlying pace of monetary and, in particular, credit expansion continues to be subdued. Annual growth in broad money. M3, increased in April to 3.2%, from 2.6% in March, mainly due to a base effect and special factors. The same factors have impacted on the annual growth rate of the narrow monetary aggregate. M1, which increased from 7.1% in March to 8.7% in April. The growth of loans to the private sector continued to be weak. The annual growth rates of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) remained at 0.3% in April, broadly unchanged since the turn of the year. The annual negative growth of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) increased from -1.3% in March to -1.9% in April. This development stemmed, in particular, from net redemptions in short-term loans, which could reflect reduced demand for working capital against the background of weak order books in early spring. More generally, weak loan dynamics continue to reflect primarily the current stage of the business cycle, heightened credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. In order to ensure adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions in euro area countries, it is essential that the fragmentation of euro area credit markets continues to decline further and that the resilience of banks is strengthened where needed. Progress has been made since last summer in improving the funding situation of banks, in strengthening the domestic deposit base in stressed countries and in reducing reliance on the Eurosystem as reflected in repayments of the three-year LTROs. Further decisive steps for establishing a banking union will help to accomplish this objective. In particular, the Governing Council emphasises that the future Single Supervisory Mechanism and a Single Resolution Mechanism are crucial elements for moving towards re-integrating the banking system and therefore require swift implementation. To sum up, the economic analysis indicates that price developments should remain in line with price stability over the medium term. A cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. With regard to fiscal consolidation and structural reforms, the Governing Council welcomes the progress made and encourages governments to continue with determined efforts. It is essential that euro area countries do not unravel their efforts to reduce government budget deficits. The new European governance framework for fiscal and economic policies should be applied in a steadfast manner. In this respect, the Governing Council considers it very important that decisions by the EU Council to extend the time frame for the correction of excessive fiscal deficits should remain reserved for exceptional circumstances. At the same time, it is necessary to continue, where needed, to take legislative action or otherwise promptly implement structural reforms. Structural reforms should, in particular, target competitiveness and adjustment capacities in labour and product markets, thereby helping to generate employment opportunities in an environment of unacceptably high unemployment levels, especially among young workers, prevailing in several countries. Combined action on the fiscal and structural front should mutually reinforce fiscal sustainability and economic growth potential and thereby foster sustainable job creation."
Philippines,2013-06-12,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to keep the BSP's key policy rates at3.50 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 5.50 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs and special deposit accounts (SDAs) were also maintained. The reserve requirement ratios were held steady as well. The Monetary Board's decision is based on its assessment that the inflation environment remains benign. Latest baseline forecasts indicate that inflation will remain within target for 2013 until 2015. Inflation expectations also remain well supported. At the same time, domestic economic growth remains firm, driven by strong internal demand. Ample liquidity and strong bank lending should also continue to support economic activity in the months ahead. The Monetary Board noted that the risks to the inflation outlook appear evenly balanced. The modest pace of global economic activity could continue to temper the broad outlook for inflation. Meanwhile, potential upside pressures on inflation could arise from power rate adjustments and the upward impact of sustained capital inflows on domestic liquidity. Keeping policy settings steady also allows time to assess the impact of recent fine-tuning in monetary operations. Recent global financial market developments also support an unchanged policy stance. On balance therefore the Monetary Board is of the view that the manageable inflation outlook and robust domestic growth provide scope to keep policy settings steady for the time being. Going forward, the BSP will continue to pay close attention to evolving price and output conditions as well as asset market developments to ensure that policy settings remain consistent with safeguarding price and financial stability while being supportive of sustained and balanced economic growth."
Chile,2013-06-13,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 13 June 2013 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 5% (annual). International financial conditions have tightened somewhat, especially those facing emerging economies, partly because the markets expect an earlier withdrawal of the US monetary stimulus. This combines with lower growth prospects for China. The Eurozone is still in recession, while projections anticipate the recovery of the US economy. Commodity prices receded slightly in recent weeks. The dollar appreciated in global markets, particularly with respect to emerging economies' currencies. Domestically, incoming information reveals an ongoing slowdown of output and demand. Investment has posted the sharpest adjustment, while private consumption has remained strong. The labor market is still tight. Headline and core inflation measures remain close to 1% y-o-y, while inflationary expectations over the policy horizon remain around the target. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. * The Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2013-06-13,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information, the Committee considers the moderate economic recovery in the US to have continued but economic activities in the euro area to have remained sluggish, while emerging market countries such as China have shown slightly lower economic growth than initially anticipated. The Committee expects the global economy to sustain its modest recovery going forward, but judges that the uncertainties related for instance to the possibility of an earlier-than-expected tapering off of US quantitative easing policy and to the implementations of fiscal consolidation in major countries remain as downside risks to growth. In Korea, consumption and facilities investment have declined but the Committee appraises economic growth to be continuing, albeit weakly, as exports have improved and construction investment has increased to a great extent. On the employment front, the number of persons employed has increased, centering around the 50-and-above age group and the service sector. Due to a slowdown in the uptrend in employment in the manufacturing sector, however, the increase was smaller in May than in the previous month. Going forward there is no change to the Committee's forecast that the domestic economy will show a negative output gap for a considerable time, due mostly to the slow recovery of the global economy. 1 Consumer price inflation declined to 1.0% in May, from 1.2% the previous month, owing mainly to decreases in the prices of agricultural and petroleum products, while core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices rose to 1.6%, from 1.4% in April. The Committee forecasts that inflation will remain low for the time being, provided there are no occurrences of exceptional factors on the supply side such as fluctuations in the prices of international oil and agricultural products. As for housing prices, those in Seoul and its surrounding areas remained generally steady, and those in the rest of the country continued their slight uptrend. In the domestic financial markets, just as in the international financial markets, stock prices have reversed to sharp declines, affected mainly by the possibility of an earlier-than-expected tapering off of US quantitative easing. Long-term market interest rates have risen significantly and the Korean won has also depreciated to a considerable extent. Looking ahead, the Committee, while closely monitoring the trends of changes in external risk factors and the effects of the previous month's Base Rate cut and the economic policies of the government, including the supplementary budget, will conduct monetary policy so as to keep consumer price inflation within the inflation target range over a medium-term horizon while ensuring that the growth potential is not eroded due to the continuation of slow growth."
Thailand,2013-06-14,"No 25 /2013 Outcome of the Joint Meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) and Financial Institutions Policy Committee (FIPC) on 14 June 2013 The Bank of Thailand announced the outcome of the first joint meeting of MPC and FIPC for 2013 as follows. The Committees viewed that Thailand's overall economy and financial system is sound and stable. On economic conditions, the Thai economy expanded at a slower pace in the first quarter owing to domestic demand after having accelerated in the previous period on the back of sound economic fundamentals. The export sector expanded gradually in tandem with global economic recovery. The Thai exports figure in the first four months of 2013 outperformed that of the regional countries; however, some SMEs were affected especially those in labor-intensive industries with low profit margin and previously impacted by the minimum-wage hike. As for the money market, appreciation of Thai Baht at the beginning of this year reflected the catching up with other regional currencies that had appreciated since last year, as well as the result of capital inflows into the bond market, mostly into long-term bonds, corresponding to some extent with real investment demand. Going forward, the capital flow, however, would remain volatile and could impact the money market. Accommodative monetary policies by major advanced countries coupled with the different speed of economic growth across countries could be the supporting factors of capital inflows. Meanwhile investors are much sensitive to financial market information such as improved economic indicators of the US, which led to the expectation of earlier tapering in quantitative easing and hence, possible capital outflows. The Thai banking system is robust. Credit continued to expand, particularly in consumer and SME sectors, although its growth has been decelerated in line with the economic slow-down. The loan quality remained sound. Capital ratio and loan loss provision were high, which could be used as a buffer against risk and volatilities in the economic and financial system. Nevertheless high competition and expansion of credit in the consumer and SME sectors warrant continuous monitoring. The Committees viewed that high level of household debt that accelerated sharply in the past few years was a risk factor to the financial stability and should be monitored closely. Although a portion of household debts was attributed to the purchase of houses and other fixed assets, the high level of household debt could decrease household's liquidity, making their debt serviceability more vulnerable to uncertainties, especially for those in the low-income group."
Peru,2013-06-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JUNE 2013 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 4.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference rate at 4.25 percent. This decision is based on the fact that the rate of inflation is within the target range in a context of economic growth close to the economy's potential level of growth. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants to consider future adjustments in monetary policy instruments. In May, inflation registered a rate of 0.19 percent mainly as a result of the rise observed in the price of some food products. Inflation in the last 12 months rose from 2.31 percent in April to 2.46 percent in May. Core inflation in May showed a rate of 0.25 percent (3.32 percent in the last 12 months) while inflation excluding food and energy showed a rate of 0.15 percent (2.33 percent in the last 12 months). Inflation is expected to converge to the middle of the target range in the next months due to the improvement observed in the conditions of food supply, to a pace of growth of economic activity close to the economy's level of potential output, and to inflation expectations anchored to the target range. Current and advanced indicators of activity show that the growth of the Peruvian economy is around its long-term sustainable level of growth, even though the indicators associated with the external market still show a weak performance that affects the prices and volumes of export products. The Board also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as described below: Overnight deposits: 3.45 percent. Direct repo and rediscount operations: 5.05 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.05 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for July on its session of July 11, 2013."
Russia,2013-06-15,"The Bank of Russia External and Public Relations Department informs that on 10 June 2013 the Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia decided to maintain unchanged the refinancing rate and the interest rates on the Bank of Russia main liquidity provision and absorption operations and to reduce effective from 11 June 2013 the interest rates on certain longer-term operations by 0.25 percentage points (table “Interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations”). The decision was supported by the assessment of inflation risks and economic growth prospects. The cut in the interest rates on longer-term liquidity provision operations brings the cost of obtaining liquidity from the Bank of Russia by credit institutions closer to the interest rates on the Bank of Russia main liquidity provision operations, which will contribute to strengthening the interest rate channel of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. In May and at the beginning of June the rate of inflation remained above the target range and as of 3 June 2013 was estimated at 7.4% over a year ago. Core inflation in May amounted to 5.9%. Observed pace of inflation is mainly explained by the food prices growth and the dynamics of certain regulated prices and tariffs. The inflation rate staying above the target range for a prolonged period of time may affect economic agents' expectations and thus poses inflation risks, in particular taking into account the planned increases in the natural monopolies' tariffs. However, according to the Bank of Russia projections based on the assumptions of maintaining the current monetary policy stance and absence of adverse food prices shocks, the rate of inflation will return to the target range in the second half of 2013. The dynamics of the key macroeconomic indicators points that the pace of economic growth remains low. The growth rates of industrial production remain subdued, investment in production capacity continues to decrease. At the same time the consumer activity indicators have been resilient in the recent months. Labour market conditions and credit dynamics are still providing support to the domestic demand. According to the Bank of Russia estimates, there remain risks of further economic slowdown given the weak investment activity and the sluggish recovery in external demand. The Bank of Russia will continue to monitor inflation risks and the risks of the economy slowing down. In making monetary policy decisions the Bank of Russia will be guided by the inflation goals and economic growth prospects. The next meeting of the Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia on monetary policy issues is planned to be held in the first half of July 2013.

Turkiye,2013-06-18,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels: a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) at 4.5 percent, b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing at 3.5 percent, lending rate at 6.5 percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 6 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, lending rate at 9.5 percent. Recent data suggest that domestic and external demand are evolving in line with expectations. Domestic demand follows a healthy recovery while exports slow down due to weak global economic activity. The current policy framework and the decline in commodity prices limit the impact of the increasing economic activity on the current account deficit. Recently, capital flows have weakened due to increasing uncertainty regarding the global monetary policies. Yet, loan growth continues to hover above the reference rate. In this regard, the impact of exchange rate movements as well as growth in loans and domestic demand on the pricing behavior will be closely monitored. Ongoing uncertainties regarding the global economy and the volatility in capital flows necessitate the monetary policy to remain flexible in both directions. To this end, necessary adjustments will be made in the composition of Turkish lira liquidity provided by the Central Bank. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Georgia,2013-06-19,"19.06.13 NBG Reduces Its Policy Rate by 25 basis points to 4.0% The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on June 19, 2013 and decided to reduce the refinancing rate by 25 basis points to 4.0 percent. Since the previous meeting of the Committee the inflation forecasts have not changed; inflation will remain low throughout this year and will approach its target value by the end of next year. In May the headline annual inflation reached -0.1%, whereas the monthly inflation was 0.7%. The price dynamics was affected mostly by the decrease in energy prices and seasonal increase in fruit and vegetable prices. The base effect and the one- time reduction in regulated prices were important as well. The recent monetary easing by the National Bank, which was reflected both in the decrease of policy rate and widening the collateral base for the National Bank operations, has already somewhat affected long-term interest rates, which in turn promotes the increase in aggregate demand. At present the banking system has large amounts of liquid resources and capital, which will allow rapid increase in credit activity in case the loan demand goes up. Given that according to the existing forecasts the inflation is predicted to remain below the target in the medium term, the National Bank of Georgia decided to continue monetary easing and to reduce the Monetary Policy Rate. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on August 14, 2013."
United States,2013-06-19,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in May suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace. Labor market conditions have shown further improvement in recent months, on balance, but the unemployment rate remains elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector has strengthened further, but fiscal policy is restraining economic growth. Partly reflecting transitory influences, inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will proceed at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee sees the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished since the fall. The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely will run at or below its 2 percent objective. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months. The Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability. The Committee is prepared to increase or reduce the pace of its purchases to maintain appropriate policy accommodation as the outlook for the labor market or inflation changes. In determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, the Committee will continue to take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases as well as the extent of progress toward its economic objectives. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens. In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; Elizabeth A Duke; Charles L Evans; Jerome H Powell; Sarah Bloom Raskin; Eric S Rosengren; Jeremy C Stein; Daniel K Tarullo; and Janet L Yellen. Voting against the action was James Bullard, who believed that the Committee should signal more strongly its willingness to defend its inflation goal in light of recent low inflation readings, and Esther L George, who was concerned that the continued high level of monetary accommodation increased the risks of future economic and financial imbalances and, over time, could cause an increase in long-term inflation expectations."
Egypt,2013-06-20,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release June 20, 2013 In its meeting held on June 20, 2013, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate and overnight lending rate unchanged at 975 percent and 1075 percent, respectively, and the rate of the CBE's main operation at 1025 percen. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 1025 percen. Headline CPI declined by 016 percent (m/m) in May compared to an increase of 147 percent in April which lies below the average monthly pace of 157 percent recorded in the first four months of 201. In spite of the monthly decline, the annual rate increased to 820 percent from 811 percent recorded in April, given the unfavorable base effec. On the other hand, core CPI remained unchanged in May compared to 097 percent increase in Apri. Given the unfavorable base effect from last year, the annual rate increased to 804 percent from 747 percent recorded in April 201. The favorable monthly developments in both headline and core inflation came on the back of declines in several food prices, despite sporadic increases in non‐food price. While the probability of a rebound in international food prices is less likely in light of recent global developments, the re‐emergence of local supply bottlenecks and distortions in the distribution channels pose upside risks to the inflation outloo. Meanwhile real GDP grew by 24 percent in 2012/2013 H1, following a similarly feeble growth rate of 22 percent in 2011/201. This nascent recovery in economic activity came on the back of tentative signs of recovery in the construction and tourism sector. Nonetheless GDP growth remains to be partly suppressed by continuing weaknesses, albeit of lesser extent, in the manufacturing secto. In the meantime, given the heightened uncertainty that faced market participants since early 2011, investment levels remained lo. Looking ahead, the current political transformation may continue to have ramifications on both consumption as well as investment decisions, adversely weighing on key sectors within the econom. Moreover downside risks continue to surround the global recovery on the back of challenges facing the Euro Area and the softening growth in emerging market. These factors, combined, pose downside risks to domestic GDP going forwar.

Pakistan,2013-06-21,"STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN MONETARY POLICY DECISION 21st June 2013 There has been discernible positive change in sentiments post May 2013 elections because of clarity on the political front. The change in the behavior of banks in auctions of government securities and reaction of stock market are two examples. Importantly there has been considerable improvement in SBP conducted surveys of consumer confidence, expected economic conditions, and inflation expectations. The absence of foreign financial inflows and high fiscal borrowings from the banking system, however, remain formidable economic challenges, especially for monetary policy. Similarly power shortages and security conditions continue to be strong impediments to growth. An almost continuous and broad based deceleration in inflation over the last year has had favorable impact on inflation outlook key variable in monetary policy decisions. In May 2013, the year-on-year CPI inflation was. percent while trimmed measure of core inflation was. percent; the lowest levels since October 2009. The average CPI inflation for FY13 is expected to be at least two percentage points below the target of. percent. However in the latest budget the government has announced an increase of percentage point in the General Sales Tax (GST), from 16 percent to 17 percent, and changes in the tax structure for some goods and services. In addition, the government is considering phase-wise upward adjustment in electricity tariff. The exact magnitude and timing of this adjustment is yet to be decided. Therefore there is risk that average inflation for FY14 could exceed the announced target of percent for the year. However aggregate demand in the economy is expected to remain moderate, which could have dampening effect on inflation. reflection of the current declining trend in inflation can be seen in the muted real economic activity, especially private investment expenditures. Beset by energy shortages and law and order conditions, the GDP growth has struggled to ameliorate in the last few years and this year was no exception. The provisional estimate of GDP growth for FY13 is. percent, which is lower than the. percent target for the year. Similarly private fixed capital formation has decreased by. percent the fifth consecutive year of declining trend. Although there has been an encouraging uptick in the growth of Large Scale Manufacturing (LSM) sector,. percent in April 2013, it is too early to term it as an emerging trend. declining inflation trend and below potential GDP growth make case for further reduction in the policy rate. The argument is twofold. First the SBP has been giving relatively high priority to inflation in its monetary policy decisions over the last few years. Thus continuing to do so would indicate consistency in the monetary policy stance. Second without further reduction in the policy rate, the real interest rate policy rate minus expected inflation would increase due to declining inflation. High real interest rates are not helpful for supporting private investment in the economy. However as indicated in the last monetary policy decision, the current balance of payments position and structural imbalance in fiscal accounts suggest vigilance. The stress in the balance of payments Page of STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN position was prime consideration in maintaining the policy rate at. percent in the last two monetary policy decisions. The basic argument has been that the return on rupee denominated assets needs to be sufficiently attractive to discourage speculative demand for dollars. There is no significant revision in the assessment of the balance of payments position since the last monetary policy decision. The external current account deficit is expected to remain manageable, around percent of GDP for FY13, signifying very low risk from this source for the external accounts. The real challenge continues to emanate from the lack of financial inflows. Let alone finance the small current account deficit, there has been cumulative net capital and financial outflow of $143 million during the first eleven months of the current fiscal year. Add to this the on-going payments of IMF loans and it becomes clear that the pressure on foreign exchange reserves has not abated. As of 14th June 2013. SBP's foreign exchange reserves stand at $6. billion. There are two developments, however, that are worth highlighting. First there has been noticeable change in sentiments, as highlighted above, that can potentially have favorable influence on private financial inflows. Other than the overall economic outlook, investment decisions do take into account the relative political certainty that determines the continuation of economic policies for some time in the future. Second declining inflation has increased the relative real return on rupee denominated assets. This could provide some room for downward adjustment in nominal returns to cater to broad macroeconomic considerations despite external account concerns. In this context, lot depends on the fiscal outlook. The fiscal deficit for FY13 has been estimated to reach. percent of GDP, which is considerably higher than earlier projections. The source of deviation is structural and well known low tax revenues due to absence of meaningful tax reforms and continuation of untargeted subsidies without comprehensively addressing the energy sector problems. For FY14, the federal government has announced provisional estimate of. percent of GDP. From the monetary policy perspective, it is the financing pressure of the fiscal position that is the source of stress. Due to almost zero net external financing in FY13, the burden of financing the sizeable deficit of. percent has fallen disproportionately on domestic sources, in particular the banking system. During 1st July 7th June. FY13, fiscal borrowings from the banking system for budgetary support were Rs1230 billion, including Rs413 billion from the SBP. The high level of these borrowings has kept an upward pressure on the system's liquidity and thus short term market interest rates and is restraining growth in the private sector credit. If the economy is to reap the benefits of evolving positive sentiments and lure the domestic as well as foreign investors then implementation of reform oriented and credible medium term fiscal outlook is essential. On its part, the Central Board of Directors of SBP has decided to place higher weight to declining inflation and low private sector credit relative to risks to the balance of payments position.

Israel,2013-06-24,"Inflation expectations for the coming year, based on various sources, are near the midpoint of the inflation target, ranging from 1.7 percentto 2 percent. The actual increase in prices over the past 12 months is near the lower bound of the target range, but is expected to rise to the center of the target by July, primarily due to the VAT rate increase. To view this Press Release as a Word document. Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for May increased by 0.1 percent, below the average projection of 0.3 percent by private forecasters, and within the forecasts' overall range of 0-0.4 percent. TheCPI measured over the past 12 months was below the lower bound of the inflation target range for the second consecutive month in May, at 0.9 percent. The main factors contributing to the CPI increase in May were higher electricity prices and increased taxes on cigarettes. The increase was offset bya decline in fuel prices. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Private forecasters' inflation expectations for the next 12 CPI readings increased slightly during the month to 2 percent, on average. Inflation expectations for the coming 12 months derived from banks' internal interest rates were stable at 1.7 percent, and expectations derived from the capital market declined to 1.5 percent. Expectations for terms of 2 years and longer (monthly averages) remained stable, and range from 2.3-2.5 percent. Private forecasters' average projections are for the CPI to increase by 0.7 percent inJune, and to increase by 0.3 percent in July. Expectations for the Bank ofIsrael interest rate 1 year from now, based on various sources, are 1.2 percent on average, with one interest rate reduction in the next 3 months reflected in forecasters' projections. Real economic activity: Indicators of economic activity which became available in the past month point to the possibility that in recent months there has been a slowdown in the growth rate of economic activity. The second estimate of National Accounts data for the first quarter indicates stability in the GDP growth rate, but with a slowdown in the growth rate of business sector product, a worsening contraction of investment and imports, and a virtual standstill in exports excluding diamonds and start-ups. The Climate Index: which is based on the Business Tendency Survey by the Central Bureau of Statistics, and which indicated an increase in the growth rate in the previous month: declined in May to a level lower than that of theprevious 4 months. The Composite State of the Economy Index, which increased by 0.1 percent in May, was revised downward for previous months. The Purchasing Managers Index declined to 47.1 points in May: continuing its decline in April: after 3 months in which it was above 50 points, considered the boundary between economic expansion and contraction. Consumer confidence indices declined sharply in May. Foreign trade data indicate an increase in the average level of exports (excluding aircraft, ships and diamonds, seasonally adjusted), although the increase is accompanied by marked volatility and likely derives from transitory factors. The labor market: Monthly labor force survey data indicate that the unemployment rate increased to 6.9 percent in April, compared with an average level of 6.6 percent in the preceding 3 months. Among 25-64 year olds, the rate increased to 6 percent, from 5.7 percent over the preceding 3 months. The employment rate is at a high level, although it appears that in recent quarters its trend of increase has halted. This month, there was an increase in new claims for unemployment benefits and a moderation in the growthof the number of job vacancies in the private sector. Since the beginning of the year there has been a decline of 0.8 percent in the number of employee posts in the private sector, after a virtual standstill in 2012. Nominalwages declined by 1.6 percent and real wages declined by 2 percent in the first quarter, compared with the fourth quarter of 2012, based on seasonally adjusted data. The growth rate of health tax receipts by the National Insurance Institute, which provide an indication of nominal wage payments, remained at the low level which has characterized it since the beginning of the year: receipts were 5.1 percent higher in April-May than in the corresponding period of the previous year. Budget data: The proposed 2013-14 budget which was approved by the government reflects a marked increase of 7 percent in domestic public expenditure in 2013, and a moderate increase of 1.1 percent in 2014. In January-May, the government's cumulative domestic deficit was NIS 4.3 billion, about NIS 2 billion below the path consistent with the deficitceiling for 2013 of 4.65 percent of GDP. Trend data of tax receipts since the beginning of the year indicate stability in direct and indirect tax collection, and total receipts below projections consistent with the seasonal path. With that. VAT collection on domestic manufacturing increased relative to the level in the second half of 2012. The Research Department staff forecast: This month, the Research Department updated its macroeconomic forecast. The notice of the forecast is published concurrently with this release. According to the forecast, the inflation rate willbe 2.1 percent during the 4 quarters ending in the second quarter of 2014;the Bank of Israel interest rate, which was 1.25 percent when the forecastwas compiled, is expected to be at that same level 1 year from now. The GDP is expected to grow by 3.8 percent in 2013, and by 2.8 percent excluding the effect of natural gas production from Tamar. In 2014, 3.2 percent growth is expected (2.5 percent excluding the effect of natural gas production): compared with 4 percent growth (3.3 percent excluding the effect of natural gas production) in the previous forecast. The Research Department's updated growth forecast for 2013 remained unchanged while the 2014 forecast was revised downward primarily due to the fiscal program which was approved to deal with the budget deficit. The foreign exchange market: From the monetary policy discussion on May 26, 2013, through June 21, 2013, the shekel appreciated by about 1.8 percent against the dollar and depreciated slightly, by 0.1 percent, against the euro. In terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, the shekel appreciated by about 1.7 percent during the period. The shekel's appreciation against the dollar stood out against the global trend, and primarily relativeto developing economies, and occurred against the background of sales of domestic companies to foreign investors, a current account surplus in the first quarter, and extensive foreign exchange sales by nonresidents in the past month. The capital and money markets: From the monetary policy discussion on May 26, 2013, through June 21, 2013, the Tel Aviv 25 Index declined by 1.3 percent. Yields on government bonds increased sharply, by about 40 basis points for most maturities: except for short-term unindexed securities whichposted a decline in yields. The yield differential between 10-year Israeligovernment bonds and equivalent 10-year US Treasury securities contracted by about 20 basis points, to 133 basis points, primarily due to a sharper increase in yields in the US. Makam yields declined along the entire curve by 5-10 basis points, against the background of the interest rate reduction in the previous month. One-year yields declined to 1.22 percent during the period. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spread remained stable with an increase of about 9 basis points to 131 basis points, in contrast to the trend in global emerging markets which increased sharply. The Tel-Bond 60 Index declined by about 1.4 percent. Spreads in the corporate bond market narrowed, primarily for debt issuedby companies with lower ratings. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in May, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 10.8 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 8.3 percent. Developments in the credit markets: The total outstanding debt of the business sector declined by 0.5 percent in April, to NIS 785 billion, as a resultof net bank loan repayments and the appreciation of the shekel, effects which were offset by debt raised abroad. Likewise, in May, there was a recovery in the volume of bond issuances by the private nonfinancial sector, reaching NIS 3.7 billion compared with an average of NIS 1.7 billion in the previous two months. Household debt increased by 0.2 percent in April, to NIS 390 billion, with an increase of 0.6 percent in households' housingdebt, to NIS 276 billion. In May, there was a marked increase in new mortgages taken, to NIS 5.6 billion, compared with the monthly average of around NIS 4 billion in the first fourmonths of the year. It is assessed that the increase derives primarily from new mortgages being brought forward ahead of the VAT increase at the beginning of June. Interest rates on mortgages declined in May on all indexation tracks, and are at low points. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (based on housing rents) increased by 0.3 percent in May, following an increase of 0.9 percent in April. In the twelve months ending in May, this component increased by 3 percent, similar to the increase over the twelve months ending in April. Homeprices, which are published in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of home prices but are not included in the CPI, declined by 0.1 percent in March-April, after 9 consecutive months of increases, and the increasein February-March was revised downward, from 0.5 percent to 0.2 percent. As a result, the rate of home price appreciation in the twelve months ending in April declined to 8.9 percent, compared with an increase of 10 percent in the twelve months to March. It is likely that the moderation in home prices derived from sellers wanting to complete transactions before the beginning of May, with the expiration of a temporary order allowing 2 apartments to be sold and be exempt from land betterment tax. Therewere 39,873 building starts in the 12 months ending in March, and this is expected to continue to support a high level of stock of homes. At the sametime, this is still a lower rate than that in 2011. The main considerations behind the decision. The decision to keep the interest rate for July 2013 unchanged at 1.25 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's interest rate policy, which is intended to entrench the inflation rate within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel and in the global economy, the monetary policies of major central banks, and developments in the exchange rate of the shekel. The following are the main considerations underlying the decision:."
Armenia,2013-06-25,"Press Release 25.06.2013 Interest rate unchanged, 8 percent In the June 25th of 2013 Meeting the Board of CBA decided to leave the Refinancing Rate of CBA unchanged, at 8 percent. There was 0.02 percent deflation recorded in May of 2013. With the 1.3 percent deflation reported for the same period of the previous year, this led to the increase of the 12- month inflation up to 5.2 percent at the end of May. The Board acknowledged that there was further slowing of the economic growth rates in the external environment. Therefore, some deflationary trends were observable in raw materials and food product markets in the world. In the light of such developments, in the forecast horizon the external sector will be marked with the slow pace of global economic growth and non-inflationary effects. The CBA Board reckons that, in line with recent developments, the previous year's excess growth of real consumption kept on reducing in the Armenian economy, as was expected, attributable to the agriculture supply shock having gradually faded down. This has been concurrent with more-than-expected contractionary fiscal policy carried out by the Government. As a result, in the forecast horizon, the impact of domestic demand on inflation will remain non-inflationary. With such deflationary factors, the expansion of the inflationary environment in the second quarter was due mainly to negative developments in the agricultural sector, particularly the delayed vegetation season because of bad weather conditions as well as existing inflationary expectations. The was reflected in the smaller-than-expected decline in food prices, therefore, at the end of the first half of the year the 12-month inflation rate will be higher than predicted, according to the Central Bank estimates. In view of the aforementioned developments, and considering that the current high inflationary environment is due to the temporary supply shock, the CBA Board finds it reasonable to leave the policy rate unchanged. Maintaining a positive real interest rate will enable the CBA to anchor the inflation expectations and foster economic activity. Another CBA action of lowering the ratio of reserve requirement on funds attracted in drams, which helped pump enough liquidity in the market, further contributed to the economic activity. In the meantime, the CBA is prepared to react to the demonstration of inflation expectations and its second-round effects driven by the rise in prices of energy resources effective from July. Under this circumstance, the CBA estimates the 12-month inflation will near the 4.0% target by the second half of the next year and will be within that range in the forecast horizon, while the economic growth will stay in equilibrium. More information on setting of the interest rate will be available in Press Release due on July 4th, 2013. Press Service of the Central Bank."
Czech Republic,2013-06-27,"Press conference of the CNB Bank Board 4th Situation Report on Economic and Monetary Developments 27 June 2013 The monetary policy decision and the stance of the CNB At the close of the meeting the Board decided unanimously to leave the two-week repo rate unchanged at 0.05%. Interest rates will remain at current levels (i.e. at technical zero) over a longer horizon until inflation pressures increase significantly. The CNB is ready to use foreign exchange interventions if further monetary policy easing becomes necessary. Reasons for the decision within the context of the forecast Consistent with the forecast is a slight decline in market interest rates, followed by a rise in rates in 2014. The current Inflation Report II/2013 forecast does not predict an increase in inflation pressures and no tangible risks of such an increase in inflation pressures can be identified either. The overall risks to the inflation forecast are on the downside, respectively tilted towards the need for easier monetary conditions in comparison with the forecast. Developments in industrial production, construction output and retail sales excluding the automotive segment in April continue to indicate subdued economic activity. On the contrary, there are some signs of economic recovery (growth in exports and export orders, developments of some GDP components, and a further increase in consumer confidence). Labour market broadly stagnated in 2013 Q1: Total employment saw a surprising y-o-y growth. The latter two indicators have exhibited only marginal changes so far during Q2. Y-o-y growth in the average nominal wage in the business sector was negative in 2013 Q1, which was influenced by tax optimization.

Romania,2013-07-01,"The NBR closely monitors domestic and global economic developments so as, via the gradual adjustment of the monetary policy conduct and the adequate use of its instruments, to achieve price stability over the medium term and financial stability. The analysis of the latest macroeconomic data reveals that inflation posted developments in line with the central bank's previous projections and that the negative output gap has persisted, the faster economic growth notwithstanding. In May 2013, the annual inflation rate measured by the consumer price index calculated by the National Institute of Statistics based on the domestic methodology stood at 5.32 percent, rising marginally against March 2013 (5.25 percent), amid the increase in volatile food prices and excise duties. At the same time, the annual inflation rate measured by the Harmonised Index for Consumer Prices, which the National Institute of Statistics determines based on the Eurostat methodology in order to ensure EU-wide comparability, came in at 4.38 percent, down from 4.56 percent in December 2012 and 4.45 percent in March 2013. The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate 1 stayed on a downward path, falling to 2.66 percent in May 2013 versus 3.25 percent in December 2012. Turning to economic growth, the annual GDP dynamics picked up in 2013 Q1 (to 2.2 percent against 1.1 percent in 2012 Q4) on the back of net exports, whose upturn entailed a marked advance in manufacturing output. The improvement in the trade balance had a bearing on the current account, the balance of which remained in positive territory January through April 2013. The annual dynamics of foreign currency lending to the private sector dropped by 4.1 percent, while local currency lending saw a stalemate. The exchange rate of the leu posted wider swings, owing to heightened volatility of investors' risk appetite, as well as to the persistence of uncertainty surrounding economic activity in Europe and elsewhere. In this context, the monetary policy conduct was aimed at firmly anchoring inflation expectations, consolidating the monetary policy impulse transmission and increasing confidence in the positive performance of the economy, amid the implementation of the arrangements signed with the international financial institutions. The NBR's adequate calibration of the management of banking system liquidity and the narrowing of the symmetrical corridor defined by the interest rates on the standing facilities around the policy rate were reflected favourably by the downtrend in interbank rates and yields on government securities, which are now close to or below the policy rate. The current short-term projection reconfirms the resumption of disinflation as of July 2013. The annual inflation rate is expected to decelerate at a faster pace and re-enter in September/October 2013 the ±1 percentage point variation band around the 2.5 percent target. In addition, the adjusted CORE2 inflation rate is anticipated to stay on a downward trend, amid the persistence of the negative output gap. This outlook enables the gradual easing of the monetary policy stance, while effectively anchoring inflation expectations and duly monitoring domestic and global developments. Against this backdrop, the Board of the National Bank of Romania decided to lower the monetary policy rate to 5.0 percent per annum from 5.25 percent starting 2 July 2013. Also starting with 2 July 2013, the interest rate on the NBR's lending facility (Lombard) will be lowered to an annual 8.0 percent from 8.25 percent, while its deposit facility rate will stand at 2.0 percent per annum versus 2.25 percent previously. The NBR Board also decided to continue to pursue an adequate liquidity management in the banking system and to leave unchanged the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The decisions convey a positive signal to the banking system, the business community and households, by prompting a gradually downward trend in domestic currency lending costs and fostering economic activity. Such a monetary policy configuration is further aimed at achieving the objective of ensuring medium-term price stability while preserving financial stability and cushioning the adverse impact of domestic and external factors on the recovery of the Romanian economy. The major risks to the short-term inflation outlook refer to capital flow volatility, given the current global picture, and to the persistence of structural rigidities across the Romanian economy. The NBR will closely monitor domestic and global economic developments so as, via the gradual adjustment of the monetary policy conduct and the adequate use of its instruments, to achieve price stability over the medium term and financial stability. In line with the announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for 5 August 2013, when the new quarterly Inflation Report is to be examined. 1Calculated by excluding administered prices, volatile prices, as well as tobacco and alcohol prices from the consumer price index.

Poland,2013-07-03,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 3 July 2013 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 2-3 July 2013 The Council has decided to decrease the NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage points:  reference rate to 2.50% on an annual basis;  lombard rate to 4.00% on an annual basis;  deposit rate to 1.00% on an annual basis;  rediscount rate to 2.75% on an annual basis. Available data indicate that global economic activity in the first half of 2013 remained low. However, economic growth continued to differ significantly across economies. A markedly better situation in the United States is accompanied by probably on-going recession in the euro area and the lack of visible rebound in some major developing countries, including China. Low global economic activity as well as the previously observed fall in commodity prices are conducive to low inflation in many countries. Signals of a possible tapering of monetary expansion by the Federal Reserve have recently led to a deterioration of sentiment in financial markets. This, in turn, resulted in some outflow of capital from emerging markets and depreciation of their currencies, including the zloty. In Poland, data on industrial output, construction and assembly output as well as retail sales in April and May indicate that growth in economic activity in Q2 remained weak. This development is also suggested by a number of economic climate indicators, though some of them have improved lately. The continuing low economic activity supports weak wage growth. At the same time. May 2013 saw a halt in the decline of employment in the corporate sector and a slight decrease in the registered unemployment rate (in seasonally adjusted terms). Growth in lending to the private sector remained limited. Growth in loans to both households and enterprises continued to be low. CPI inflation declined again in May 2013, reaching 0.5% y/y, i.e. a level markedly below the NBP inflation target of 2.5%. The decline in inflation was mainly driven by further deceleration in the growth of energy prices, including fuel prices. Low level of core inflation as well as a stronger decline in producer prices, confirm persistently low demand and cost pressures in the economy. This is accompanied by a further decline in inflation expectations of households and enterprises. 00-919 Warszawa, ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, phone (+4822) 653 28 88, fax (+4822) 653 13 28 The Council got acquainted with the inflation and GDP projection prepared by the Economic Institute, being one of the inputs to the Council's decisions on the NBP interest rates. In line with the July projection based on the NECMOD model  prepared under the assumption of unchanged NBP interest rates and taking into account data available until 13 June 2013 (i.e. not encompassing the July decision of the Council)  there is a 50-per cent probability of inflation running in the range of 0.6-1.1% in 2013 (as compared to 1.3-1.9% in the March projection), within 0.4-2.0% in 2014 (as against 0.8-2.4%) and within 0.7-2.4% in 2015 (as against 0.7-2.4%). At the same time, the annual GDP growth  in line with the July projection  will be, with a 50-per cent probability, contained within 0.5-1.7% in 2013 (as compared to 0.6-2.0% in the March projection), within 1.2-3.5% in 2014 (as against 1.4- 3.7%) and within 1.6-4.2% in 2015 (as against 1.9-4.4%). In the opinion of the Council, the incoming data confirm continued low economic growth in Poland accompanied by lack of wage and inflation pressures. The July projection, however, indicates that from the second half of 2013  together with the expected improvement of global economic activity  a gradual acceleration of GDP growth can be expected, which will be conducive to rising inflation in the coming years. However, despite this, a risk of inflation running below the target in the medium term persists. Taking this into consideration, the Council decided to lower the NBP interest rates again. The Council assesses that the significant reduction of NBP interest rates implemented since November 2012 supports economic recovery and limits the risk of inflation running below the NBP target in the medium term. The decision to lower NBP interest rates made at the current meeting ends the loosening cycle of monetary policy. The Council adopted the Inflation Report  July 2013."
Euroarea,2013-07-04,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Vice-President. Mr. Rehn. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Underlying price pressures in the euro area are expected to remain subdued over the medium term. In keeping with this picture, monetary and, in particular, credit dynamics remain subdued. Inflation expectations for the euro area continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. At the same time, recent confidence indicators based on survey data have shown some further improvement from low levels. Our monetary policy stance is geared towards maintaining the degree of monetary accommodation warranted by the outlook for price stability and promoting stable money market conditions. It thereby provides support to a recovery in economic activity later in the year and in 2014. Looking ahead, our monetary policy stance will remain accommodative for as long as necessary. The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. This expectation is based on the overall subdued outlook for inflation extending into the medium term, given the broad-based weakness in the real economy and subdued monetary dynamics. In the period ahead, we will monitor all incoming information on economic and monetary developments and assess any impact on the outlook for price stability. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Real GDP declined by 0.3% in the first quarter of 2013, following a contraction of 0.6% in the last quarter of 2012. Recent developments in cyclical indicators, particularly those based on survey data, indicate some further improvement from low levels. Looking ahead to later in the year and to 2014, euro area export growth should benefit from a gradual recovery in global demand, while domestic demand should be supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance as well as the recent gains in real income owing to generally lower inflation. Furthermore, notwithstanding recent developments, the overall improvements in financial markets seen since last summer should work their way through to the real economy, as should the progress made in fiscal consolidation. This being said, the remaining necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors will continue to weigh on economic activity. Overall, euro area economic activity should stabilise and recover in the course of the year, albeit at a subdued pace. The risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside. The recent tightening of global money and financial market conditions and related uncertainties may have the potential to negatively affect economic conditions. Other downside risks include the possibility of weaker than expected domestic and global demand and slow or insufficient implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries. As stated in previous months, annual inflation rates are expected to be subject to some volatility throughout the year owing particularly to base effects. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.6% in June 2013, up from 1.4% in May. This increase reflected an upward base effect relating to energy price developments twelve months earlier. However, underlying price pressures are expected to remain subdued over the medium term, reflecting the broad-based weakness in aggregate demand and the modest pace of the recovery. Medium-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability. The risks to the outlook for price developments are expected to be still broadly balanced over the medium term, with upside risks relating to stronger than expected increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, as well as higher commodity prices, and downside risks stemming from weaker than expected economic activity. Turning to the monetary analysis, recent data confirm the subdued monetary and, in particular, credit dynamics. Annual growth in broad money (M3) decreased in May to 2.9%, from 3.2% in April. Moreover, annual growth in M1 decreased to 8.4% in May, from 8.7% in April. The annual rate of change of loans to the private sector remained negative. While the annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) remained at 0.3% in May, broadly unchanged since the turn of the year, the annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) weakened further to -2.1% in May, from -1.9% in April. As in April, strong monthly net redemptions in May were concentrated in short-term loans, possibly reflecting reduced demand for working capital against the background of weak order books in early spring. More generally, weak loan dynamics continue to reflect primarily the current stage of the business cycle, heightened credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. Since the summer of 2012 substantial progress has been made in improving the funding situation of banks and, in particular, in strengthening the domestic deposit base in a number of stressed countries. This has contributed to reducing reliance on Eurosystem funding, as reflected in the ongoing repayments of the three-year longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs). In order to ensure an adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions in euro area countries, it is essential that the fragmentation of euro area credit markets continues to decline further and that the resilience of banks is strengthened where needed. Further decisive steps for establishing a Banking Union will help to accomplish this objective. In particular, the future Single Supervisory Mechanism and a Single Resolution Mechanism are crucial elements for moving towards re-integrating the banking system and therefore require swift implementation. To sum up, the economic analysis indicates that price developments should remain in line with price stability over the medium term. A cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. With regard to other economic policies, the Governing Council notes the initiatives taken by the European Council of 27-28 June 2013 in the areas of youth unemployment, investment and financing of small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as the European Council's endorsement of the country-specific recommendations of the 2013 European semester. The Governing Council stresses that implementation of these recommendations is essential to contribute to a sustainable recovery in the euro area. Moreover, the new European governance framework for fiscal and economic policies should be applied in a steadfast manner and much more determined efforts should be pursued to carry forward structural reforms to foster growth and employment. In this respect, the Governing Council deems it particularly important to target competitiveness and adjustment capacities in labour and product markets. Finally, the Governing Council welcomes the setting-out of a number of steps towards the completion of the Banking Union as moves in the right direction, but also urges that they be implemented swiftly."
Chile,2013-07-11,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 11 July 2013 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 5% (annual). International financial conditions tightened, especially those facing emerging economies, mainly responding to signs of an earlier withdrawal of the monetary stimulus in the United States. Recent indicators for the U.S. economy are positive and point to a gradual recovery. The Eurozone continues in recession while growth forecasts for China have been revised downward, as have those for other emerging economies. The prices of foodstuffs and metals, including copper, receded in recent weeks, while fuel prices rose. The dollar showed a widespread appreciation in international markets. Domestically, incoming information reveals an ongoing slowdown of output and demand, especially in investment. The labor market is still tight. Consumption has remained strong, but the evolution of credit conditions and confidence surveys suggest this variable will lose momentum. Headline inflation approached the tolerance range, as expected, while core measures remain close to 1% y-o-y. Inflation expectations over the policy horizon remain around the target. The consolidation of the trends outlined in the last Monetary Policy Report could call for adjustments to the monetary policy interest rate in the coming months. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. * The Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2013-07-11,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information, the Committee considers the moderate economic recovery in the US to have been sustained but the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area to have continued, while economic growth in emerging market countries such as China has slowed somewhat. The Committee expects the global economy to sustain its modest recovery going forward, but judges that the uncertainties related for instance to the possibility of an earlier-than-expected tapering off of US quantitative easing and of a slowdown in Chinese economic growth, and to the implementations of fiscal consolidation in major countries, remain as downside risks to growth. In Korea, the Committee appraises economic growth to be continuing, albeit weakly, as exports have been generally favorable while indicators of domestic demand have alternated between improvement and worsening. On the employment front, the increase in the number of persons employed has accelerated, centering around the 50-and-above age group and the service sector. The domestic economy is expected to maintain a negative output gap for a considerable time going forward, due mostly to the slow recovery of the global economy, although the Committee forecasts that the gap will gradually narrow. Consumer price inflation was 1.0% in June, the same as in May, as the prices of agricultural, livestock, fisheries and petroleum 1 products continued their declines of the previous month and as service prices maintained their low rate of increase. Core inflation excluding the prices of agricultural and petroleum products declined slightly to 1.4%, from 1.6% in May, owing primarily to an increase in the extent of decline in the prices of livestock products. The Committee forecasts that inflation will show a stable trend for the time being as the output gap remains negative, although it will rise above its present level due mainly to a base effect from its low rate of increase in the second half of last year. As for housing prices, those in Seoul and its surrounding areas declined, while those in the rest of the country continued their slight uptrend. In the domestic financial markets, as in the international financial markets, the volatility of price variables has increased with the possibility of an earlier-than-expected tapering off of US quantitative easing. Stock prices have fallen substantially due to outflows of foreigners' stock investment funds, while long-term market interest rates have risen in concert with those of major economies. After having depreciated greatly, the Korean won has appreciated to a considerable extent. Looking ahead, while closely monitoring the trends and the influences of changes in external risk factors, and the effects of May's Base Rate cut and of the government's economic policies including the supplementary budget, the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as to keep consumer price inflation within the inflation target range over a medium-term horizon while ensuring that the growth potential is not eroded due to the continuation of slow growth."
Malaysia,2013-07-11,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.00 percent. The global economy continues to experience slow growth. In the advanced economies, growth has remained weak. While domestic demand in the emerging economies remains an important source of growth, the prolonged weakness in the external environment has begun to affect domestic economic activity in these economies. Although global monetary conditions remain highly accommodative, financial market volatility has increased substantially in the recent period as markets reassessed the direction of policy. For the Malaysian economy, domestic demand has continued to support growth amid the continued moderation in external demand. The sustained weakness in the external sector may, however, affect the overall growth momentum. Going forward, private consumption is expected to remain steady underpinned by income growth and stable labour market conditions. Capital spending in the domestic-oriented industries and the ongoing implementation of infrastructure projects will also support investment activity. Inflation remained low at 1.6% in the first five months of the year. While inflation is expected to rise in the second half of the year due to domestic supply and cost factors, it is projected to remain modest. Pressures from global commodity prices are also likely to be contained given the moderate global growth prospects. The MPC considers the current stance of monetary policy to be appropriate given the outlook for inflation and growth. In addition to domestic conditions, the MPC will continue to carefully assess the global economic and financial developments and their implications on the overall outlook for inflation and growth of the Malaysian economy.

Russia,2013-07-12,"The Bank of Russia External and Public Relations Department informs that on 12 July 2013 the Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia decided to maintain unchanged the interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations and the refinancing rate (table “Interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations”). The decision was supported by the assessment of inflation risks and economic growth prospects. In June and at the beginning of July the rate of inflation declined, but remained above the target range and as of 8 July 2013 was estimated at 6.6% over a year ago. Core inflation in June amounted to 5.8%. Observed pace of inflation is mainly explained by the dynamics of food prices and regulated prices and tariffs. According to the Bank of Russia projections based on the assumptions of maintaining the current monetary policy stance and absence of adverse food prices shocks, the rate of inflation will return to the target range during the second half of 2013. The dynamics of the key macroeconomic indicators points out that the pace of economic growth remains low. At the same time the decrease in the growth rates of certain indicators recorded in May 2013 was partly attributed to the calendar effect. Labour market conditions and credit dynamics are still providing support to the domestic demand. According to the Bank of Russia estimates, the risks of further economic slowdown remain given the weak investment activity and the sluggish recovery in external demand. The Bank of Russia will continue to monitor inflation risks and the downside risks to economic growth. In making monetary policy decisions the Bank of Russia will be guided by the inflation goals and economic growth prospects. The Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia also decided to set effective from 15 July 2013 the minimum interest rate on the auctions for provision of loans, secured by non-marketable assets and guarantees, for 12 months term with floating interest rate at the level of 5.75%. The development of the system of the Bank of Russia monetary policy instruments, implemented by this decision, will contribute to strengthening the interest rate channel of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. The next meeting of the Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia on monetary policy issues is planned to be held on 9 August 2013.

Peru,2013-07-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JULY 2013 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 4.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference rate at 4.25 percent. This decision is based on the fact that the rate of inflation is within the target range in a context of economic growth in the country close to the economy's potential level of growth amid international financial uncertainty. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants to consider future adjustments in monetary policy instruments. Inflation in June recorded a rate of 0.26 percent due mainly to the rise in the prices of some food products and fuels. Inflation in the last 12 months rose from 2.46 percent in May to 2.77 percent in June. Core inflation showed a rate of 0.26 percent (3.38 percent in the last 12 months), and inflation excluding food and energy showed a rate of 0.16 percent (2.35 percent in the last 12 months). Inflation is expected to converge to the center of the target range in the next months due to the improvement observed in the conditions of food supply, to a pace of growth of economic activity close to the economy's level of potential output, and to inflation expectations anchored to the target range. Current and advanced indicators of activity show that the growth of the Peruvian economy is close to its long-term sustainable level of growth, even though the indicators associated with the external market still show a weak performance that affects the prices and volumes of export products. The Board has been adopting measures to make the reserve requirements regime more flexible. Thus, the amount of long-term liabilities not subject to reserve requirements was raised in May to 2.3 times the effective equity of a financial institution with the aim of promoting increased long-term financing in soles, and a maximum limit of 20 percent was established in June for the mean rate of reserve requirements in soles in order to reduce the dispersion of required reserves in the different financial entities and promote intermediation in soles, releasing in this way 500 million. If necessary, the Board will adopt additional measures to make the regime of required reserves more flexible in order to promote a more orderly evolution of credit. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as described below: Overnight deposits: 3.45 percent. Direct repo and rediscount operations: 5.05 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.05 percent. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for August on its session of August 8, 2013."
South Africa,2013-07-18,"South African Reserve Bank PRESS STATEMENT EMBARGO DELIVERY 18 July 2013 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Gill Marcus. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank The period since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has been dominated by the reaction of the global financial markets to statements by the US Federal Reserve that a slowdown in quantitative easing may begin sooner than previously anticipated. The news impacted on capital flows to emerging markets, with outflows from bond markets in particular, but yields on long term bonds of advanced economies were also affected. While some of the initial fears have been addressed by further guidance from the Fed, this episode gives some insight into the difficulties that could be faced in fine-tuning exit strategies from highly accommodative monetary policies, particularly at a time when global growth remains weak. 2 These events had a significant impact on the exchange rate of the rand, creating further upside risks to the inflation outlook at a time when the domestic economy has shown increased signs of vulnerability. There has consequently been no let- up in the policy dilemma faced by monetary policy: that of a widening output gap in a worsening inflation environment. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas surprised on the downside at 5,6 per cent in May 2013, having measured 5,9 per cent for the previous three consecutive months. However, this decline is likely to have been temporary as it was due in part to a 73 cent per litre decrease in the petrol price in May, which has since been reversed by an 84 cent per litre increase in July. Food price inflation increased further from 6,3 per cent in April to 6,7 per cent, and accounted for 1,0 percentage point of CPI inflation. The other main contributors to the inflation outcome were housing and utilities and miscellaneous goods and services which contributed 1,4 and 1,1 percentage points respectively. Administered price inflation declined to 6,3 percent from 8,9 per cent in April due to the petrol price decline. Excluding petrol, administered price inflation was unchanged at 7,8 per cent. Core inflation, which excludes food, petrol and electricity, measured 5,3 per cent, marginally up from 5,2 per cent in April. The headline producer price inflation for final manufactured goods measured 4,9 per cent in May, compared with 5,4 per cent in April. 3 Despite the lower starting point, the inflation forecast of the Bank has deteriorated since the previous meeting of the MPC. Inflation is now expected to average 0,1 and 0,3 percentage points higher in 2013 and 2014 at 5,9 per cent and 5,5 per cent respectively, while the forecast for 2015 has been raised from 5,0 per cent to 5,2 per cent. A temporary breach of the upper end of the target range is still expected in the third quarter of 2013, but at a higher average level of 6,3 per cent (6,1 per cent previously), followed by a return to within the target range by the final quarter of the year. The deterioration is mainly due to continued currency weakness and higher-than-expected petrol price increases. The forecast for core inflation for 2013 is unchanged at an average of 5,3 per cent in 2013 and is now expected to peak at 5,5 per cent in the fourth quarter. This measure is then expected to moderate and to average 5,2 per cent and 5,0 per cent in the coming two years, compared with the previous forecasts of 5,0 per cent and 4,6 per cent respectively. This upward drift in the forecast in the absence of obvious excess demand pressures suggests that there may be emerging underlying pressures, possibly due to the lagged effects of the depreciation of the rand exchange rate. Inflation expectations appear to have remained anchored around the upper end of the inflation target range. According to the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research at Stellenbosch University during the second quarter of 2013, inflation expectations of all the categories of respondents remained almost. According to the survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research at Stellenbosch University during the second quarter of 2013, inflation expectations of all the categories of respondents remained almost 4 unchanged compared with those of the previous quarter. Overall, the survey found that inflation is expected to average 6,0 per cent in 2013 and 6,1 per cent in the next two years, with financial analysts' expectations below those of the business executives and trade union officials over the whole forecast period and within the target range. The former category is consistent with the Reuters survey which reflects expectations of an average of 5,9 per cent in 2013, and moderating to 5,6 per cent and 5,4 per cent in the following two years, respectively. The global economic growth outlook has remained fragile due to the continuing deeper recession in the Eurozone and a slowdown in a number of systemically important emerging market economies. Several forecasters, including the IMF, have downgraded Eurozone growth forecasts against the backdrop of a slowdown in Germany, and continued risks emanating from Portugal. Italy and Spain. In its recent World Economic Outlook update, the IMF reduced its 2013 forecast for Eurozone growth by 0,2 percentage points to -0,6 per cent, with a weaker recovery than previously forecast in 2014. Although the US economic recovery appears to be gaining some traction, headwinds from the fiscal contraction remain, and first quarter economic growth, at an annualised 1,8 per cent, was weaker than the initial estimate of 2,5 per cent. The sustainability of the recovery is also at risk from rising long-term bond and mortgage interest rates in response to expectations of a tapering off of asset purchases by the Fed. There 5 are tentative signs of stronger growth in Japan, but the sustainability of the recovery remains uncertain. The slowing growth in various emerging market economies including China. Brazil and Russia illustrate the difficulties of decoupling from the advanced economies, with the IMF revising its forecasts for 2013 for China from 7,8 per cent to 7,5 per cent; Russia from 3,4 per cent to 2,5 per cent; and Brazil from 3,0 per cent to 2,5 per cent. The deteriorating outlook for emerging markets has been compounded by the recent capital flow reversals that impacted adversely on domestic bond and currency markets in particular. While financial markets have stabilised somewhat, the risks posed to emerging economies in general, including South Africa, by normalisation of monetary policy in the US in the future, are evident. The combination of slower growth in China and the stronger US dollar has also impacted negatively on commodity prices, although oil prices have been underpinned by risks related to recent events in Egypt. Global inflation remains benign and monetary policy is expected to remain accommodative in the advanced economies for some time, as indicated in the forward guidance provided by the ECB, the Bank of England and the Fed, notwithstanding a possible slower pace of quantitative easing in the US. By contrast, a general tightening bias is evident in a number of emerging markets in response to recent capital flow and exchange rate developments. 6 Movements in the exchange rate of the rand continue to pose the main upside risk to the inflation outlook. Since the previous meeting of the MPC exchange rate volatility has increased and the rand generally traded in a range between R9,60 and R10,36 against the US dollar. Since the beginning of the year the rand has depreciated by 14,2 per cent against the US dollar and by 11,1 per cent on a trade weighted basis. Much of the recent volatility and weakness has been in line with the reaction of a number of other emerging market currencies to fears of US monetary policy tightening. The rand has also been negatively impacted by lower commodity prices. Domestic bond yields increased significantly in response to capital outflows and higher bond yields in the advanced economies. The yield on the 10-year government bond, for example, increased by more than 100 basis points since the financial market turbulence in late May. Net sales of domestic government bonds by non-residents amounted to R17,4 bn in May and June. In July non- residents became net buyers again with net purchases of R3,0 bn, bringing the year-to-date net total to R5,2 bn. Having been net sellers of South African equities in both 2011 and 2012, non-residents have returned to the market, with year-to-date net purchases of R23,3 bn. Despite a 15,5 per cent nominal effective depreciation of the rand exchange rate since January 2012, the pass-through to inflation has been relatively muted,. Despite a 15,5 per cent nominal effective depreciation of the rand exchange rate since January 2012, the pass-through to inflation has been relatively muted, 7 particularly when compared with previous episodes of currency weakness. This is probably a reflection of the weak pricing power in some sectors of the economy in a low growth environment. Nevertheless the risk remains that these pricing pressures may intensify at some stage, particularly if the exchange rate depreciates further from current levels. Market expectations are for a moderate appreciation of the rand in the coming months, although these expectations have been tempered in recent surveys. According to the Reuters Econometer survey conducted in June, analysts on average expect a rand/dollar exchange rate of R9,70 at the end of 2013, and R9,40 at the end of 2014. There is, however, a wide dispersion between the forecasters, reflecting a high degree of uncertainty. Despite a slight narrowing of the current account deficit in the first quarter of 2013 to 5,8 per cent of GDP, the depreciated currency reflects this deficit against a backdrop of declining terms of trade and more uncertain global capital flows. The outlook for domestic economic growth has weakened further, following the first quarter annualised growth rate of 0,9 per cent. While more favourable outcomes can be expected in the subsequent quarters of this year, overall annual growth is likely to be lower than the 2,5 per cent growth rate recorded in 2012. The Bank's growth forecast for 2013 has again been revised down from 2,4 per cent to 2,0 per cent, and from 3,5 per cent to 3,3 per cent for 2014. Growth is expected to accelerate to 3,6 per cent in 2015, compared with 3,8 per cent. Growth is expected to accelerate to 3,6 per cent in 2015, compared with 3,8 per cent 8 previously. The risks to the outlook are still assessed to be on the downside, particularly in the face of further delays in overcoming electricity supply constraints. In line with these subdued growth prospects, the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index declined from 52 in the first quarter of 2013 to 48 in the second quarter, consistent with the continued sideways movement of the Bank's leading indicator of economic activity. The outlook for the mining sector remains bleak following a 0,7 per cent year-on- year contraction in May. Although production showed positive month-to-month growth for the first time in four months, on a three-month-to-three-month basis the sector contracted by 1,4 per cent. There are indications that the manufacturing sector will make a positive contribution to growth in the second quarter following the annualised 7,9 per cent contraction in the first quarter. In May the sector expanded by 2,2 per cent on a year-on-year basis, and by 0,9 per cent on a three-month-to-three-month basis. This more positive trend is also indicated in the Kagiso PMI which increased by 1,2 index points to 52,6 in July. The real value of building plans passed remains on a moderately upward trend despite a decline in May. The FNB construction confidence index reflects some improvement, having increased by 4 points to 41 in the second quarter of 2013, although the civil construction index declined somewhat over the same period. 9 Underlying the sluggish economic growth outlook is the low growth in real gross fixed capital formation, which moderated from an annualised 4,3 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2012 to 2,5 per cent in the first quarter of 2013. Private sector fixed investment growth slowed from 3,8 per cent to 2,8 per cent over this period, and reflected lower outlays in all sectors apart from agriculture, construction and finance. Work stoppages at Eskom's Medupi plant also impacted negatively on investment by state-owned enterprises in the quarter. Fixed investment expenditure is likely to remain affected by low business confidence and prolonged electricity supply constraints. Employment growth remains subdued, particularly in the private sector. In the year from March 2012 to March 2013, employment grew by 1,0 per cent, or 80,000 workers, of which 65,000 were in the public sector, although this number was inflated by temporary appointments relating to municipal by-elections in the first quarter of the year. Employment contracted in the mining and manufacturing sectors during this period. The official unemployment rate increased from 24,9 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2012 to 25,2 per cent in the first quarter of 2013. Of particular concern is the increase in the youth unemployment rate to 52,9 per cent in the first quarter. Slower growth in real consumption expenditure by households is indicative of declining consumer confidence and the relative lack of excessive demand pressures in the economy. Household Consumption expenditure growth 10 moderated to 2,3 per cent in the first quarter of 2013, driven mainly by more subdued demand for durable goods, particularly motor vehicles. Real retail trade sales surprised on the upside in May with year-on-year growth of 6,2 per cent. Nevertheless, retail trade sales increased by 0,5 per cent in the three months ending May compared with the previous three months, suggesting a continuation of the moderate growth in sales. Consumption expenditure is expected to be constrained by high petrol and electricity costs, high consumer debt levels and declining growth in credit extension to households. Despite a moderation in the growth of household debt in the first quarter of 2013, the ratio of household debt to disposable income was unchanged at 75,4 per cent, as growth in real disposable income also slowed. Twelve-month growth in total loans and advances extended to the private sector increased by 9,3 per cent in May, but excluding mortgage advances the increase was 16,8 per cent. In the first five months of 2013, general loans (mainly unsecured lending) continued to account for the bulk of the increase in credit extension, but at a slower pace, particularly to households. Twelve-month growth in general loans to households declined from a recent peak of 35,4 per cent in September 2012 to 24,4 per cent in May 2013. The slowdown is more pronounced when measured over three months. In the three months to the end of May 2013, annualised growth was 11,3 per cent, compared with rates of increase in excess of 30 per cent during 2012. 11 One of the upside risks to inflation remains wage and salary increases. In the first quarter of 2013, a stronger upward trend was observed with growth in nominal remuneration per worker increasing from 6,6 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2012 to 7,5 per cent. With slower productivity growth, this implied an increase in unit labour cost growth from 5,2 per cent to 6,7 per cent. These increases are consistent with the overall average wage settlement rate in collective bargaining agreements published by Andrew Levy Employment Publications, which increased from 7,6 per cent in 2012 to 7,9 per cent in the first quarter of 2013. Other upside risks to the inflation outlook emanate from food prices, which have been accelerating over the past few months following a low of 4,6 per cent in September 2012. Food price pressures are intensifying at the producer price level, with manufactured food product prices increasing by 6,9 per cent in May. Although agricultural product inflation remained subdued at 2,6 per cent, this was mainly due to the 13,0 per cent decline in live animal prices which offset the 10,4 per cent increase in cereal and other crop prices. More favourably, global food prices have declined as a result of expectations of bumper crops in some of the main grain producing countries. The FAO international cereals price index decreased by 10,1 per cent since September 2012. Global oil prices have broken out of their recent trading range of between US$100 and US$105, mainly due to political developments in the Middle East. 12 However, the relatively subdued global growth outlook, particularly in China, is likely to restrain these price increases. The current under-recovery of around 36 cents per litre on the domestic petrol price is mainly due to international price developments, and indicates that a further petrol price increase can be expected in August. The MPC continues to face conflicting policy choices relating to rising inflation and slowing growth. Inflation is expected to resume its upward trajectory following the brief respite in May. However, despite the upward trend in core inflation, there are no strong signs of excess demand pressures and the forecast for headline inflation suggests that the breach of the target may be short-lived. The main upside risk to the inflation outlook is the exchange rate and much will depend on the strength of the pass-through to inflation, which to date has been relatively muted. However, the risk remains that these pressures could be mounting, particularly if further currency weakness occurs and affects inflation expectations, which are currently anchored at the upper end of the target range. In addition, the outcome of the present round of wage bargaining will be critical in determining the extent of wage pressure on the inflation outlook. The output gap has widened, and is only anticipated to begin to narrow during 2015, when growth is expected to be more or less in line with potential. The downside risk to growth has already resulted in the Bank being more tolerant of. The downside risk to growth has already resulted in the Bank being more tolerant of 13 inflation at the upper end of the target range than would normally have been the case, an approach that is consistent with a flexible inflation targeting framework. While the upside risks to the inflation outlook reduce the scope for further accommodation, a tightening of the monetary policy stance does not automatically follow. This will be highly dependent on how we see the inflation trajectory unfolding in this very uncertain environment. In other words, it has become even more data dependent. At this stage a sustained breach of the inflation target is not our central forecast. However, we are concerned about the revised higher trajectory of core inflation and macroeconomic vulnerabilities that are increasingly evident. The MPC is mindful of these conflicting pressures and the challenging domestic and global environment, and will continue to monitor developments closely and act appropriately to achieve its mandate. The MPC has decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 5,0 per cent per annum. Gill Marcus GOVERNOR Contact person: Candice Jeffreys +27 12 313 4209 Candice."
Nigeria,2013-07-22,"Central Bank of Nigeria Communique No. 90 of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting of Monday and Tuesday. July 22 and 23, 2013 The Monetary Policy Committee met on July 22 and 23, 2013 with 10 out of the 12 members in attendance. new member. Mr. Stephen O Oronsaye who is a Board member, replaced Professor Sam Olofin whose tenure as a Board member had expired. The Committee reviewed the economic conditions and challenges that confronted the domestic economy in the first half of the year, particularly since the last MPC meeting in May 2013. It also re-evaluated the short-to-medium term risks to inflation, domestic output, external balance and financial stability. International Economic Developments Global economic recovery remained weak, as new risks have emerged including the possibility of a further slowdown in growth in the emerging market economies. The old risks of a recession in the Eurozone have persisted alongside slowing growth in China and the possibility of tighter financial conditions when central banks gradually exit from their current monetary accommodation stance. Consequently global growth prospects have not improved. Blaming weaker domestic demand and slower growth in several key emerging market economies, as well as a more protracted recession in the euro area, the IMF in 1 July 2013 reviewed downward its global growth forecast. It also reviewed downward its growth forecast for the US and China to 17 and 78 per cent, from 19 and 80 per cent in April 2013, respectively, but raised the forecast for the UK from 07 per cent to 09 per cent in the same period. For the Eurozone which has seen its longest recession since monetary union, the IMF projects a further contraction of 06 per cent in 2013, which more or less doubled the earlier forecast in April. The IMF has also cut the growth forecast for Brazil. South Africa. India and Russia to 25, 20, 56 and 25 per cent from 30, 28, 58 and 34 per cent, respectively. Japan's growth rate forecast is projected at 20 per cent, up from a forecast of 15 per cent. The slowdown in global growth is likely to impact on commodity prices and thus, adversely impact oil exporting countries like Nigeria. In addition, continued fragility in financial markets continues to generate bouts of capital flow reversals and inflows that are potentially disruptive to emerging and transition markets. Domestic Economic and Financial Developments Output The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) estimated the real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth at 672 per cent for Q2 2013, slightly higher than the 656 per cent recorded in Q1, and 639 per cent in Q1 of 2012. Overall GDP growth for fiscal 2013 was projected at 691 per cent up from 658 per cent in 2012. The 2 non-oil sector remained the major driver of growth recording 791 per cent in contrast to the growth rate of -068 per cent for the oil sector during the second quarter of 2013. The drivers of the non-oil sector growth remained agriculture; wholesale and retail trade; and services which contributed 172, 147, and 290 per cent, respectively. The Committee noted the continued decline in the contribution of the oil sector to overall GDP and the underlying factors responsible for this state of affairs. These factors include; sustained oil theft which has led to a decline in output volumes in the face of an uncertain international oil market and price signals, weak infrastructure, and downside risks due to discovery of shale oil and the emergence of other African oil exporters competing for Nigeria's traditional oil market. Prices Inflationary pressures continued to moderate partly in response to the tight monetary policy and base effect. The year-on-year headline inflation decelerated to 84 per cent in June from 90 per cent in May. Also core inflation declined significantly to 55 per cent in June from 62 per cent in May and 69 per cent in April. Food inflation, however, rose to 96 per cent in June from 93 per cent in May 2013. Notwithstanding the moderation in headline inflation, there are benign risks on the horizon, including the possibility of accelerated fiscal releases in the later part of the year and the effects of the upward review in electricity tariffs in line with the MYTO following the implementation of the full deregulation of the energy sector. The six-month inflation outlook indicates that inflation would remain within single digit territory due to base effect and tight monetary policy. However the current state of government finances is likely to generate increased borrowing. The key risks to the outlook, therefore, remain fiscal operations, increased pressure on the exchange rate due to excess structural liquidity in the banking system and the possibility of a capital flow reversal in the medium term. Monetary Credit and Financial Market Developments Broad money supply (M2) grew by 071 per cent as at end-June 2013 over the level at end-December 2012. When annualized. M2 grew by 142 per cent, compared with the growth of 270 per cent in the corresponding period of 2012. Thus M2 growth was also significantly below the growth benchmark of 1520 per cent for 2013 and 760 per cent for Q2 of 2013. Interest rates in the interbank money market moved in tandem with the level of liquidity conditions in the banking system. The average liquidity ratio was 6779 per cent compared with the prudential requirement of 300 per cent. Thus the average inter-bank call and open-buy-back (OBB) rates, which opened at 1207 and 1191 per cent on May 20, 2013, closed lower at 1042 and 1029 per cent, respectively, on June 28, 2013. However the average inter-bank call and OBB rates for the period were 1180 and 1146 per cent, respectively. The recovery in the Nigerian capital market continued, as equities market indicators were upbeat in the review period. The All-Share Index (ASI) increased 4 by 288 per cent from December 2012 to June 2013, while the equities Market Capitalization (MC) increased by 273 per cent from N897 trillion on December 31, 2012 to N1143 trillion on June 28, 2013. Improved earnings and investor confidence in the economy contributed to the up-swing in stock prices. The equities market median price-earnings ratio rose above the long-run median by 90 per cent in June 2013 indicating that share prices were recovering faster than earnings and investor assessment of future returns was good. External Sector Developments At the Wholesale Dutch Auction System (wDAS), interbank and the BDC segments of the foreign exchange market, the exchange rate depreciated to N15732/US$. N16125/US$, and N16300/US$ on July 19, 2013 from N15730/US$. N15830/US$, and N15950/US$ on 21st May, 2013. The Committee noted the depreciation recorded in all segments of the foreign exchange market in the review period on the back of a general sell-off by portfolio investors in emerging and frontier markets following guidance by the US Federal Reserve Bank (FED) with respect to its quantitative easing programs. It also observed that the experience in Nigeria was not unique, as the spike in the US yields negatively impacted financial markets globally. However calm has since returned to the financial markets following further clarifications by the FED that exit from quantitative easing is not imminent and does not necessarily mean monetary tightening. Thus the Nigerian capital market has seen a rally, while the demand pressure in the foreign exchange market has somewhat moderated. The 5 Committee, however, noted the build-up of structural excess liquidity in banks balance sheets, which poses risks to the inflation and exchange rate outlook. The Committee noted the increase in external reserves to US$4799 billion as at July 18, 2013 from US$4383 billion at end-December, 2012, representing a rise of US$416 billion or 949% year-to-date. This level of reserves provides cover for approximately 11 months of import. The Committee's Considerations The Committee was satisfied with the prevailing macroeconomic stability achieved during the period, including the single digit inflation, stable banking system, exchange rate stability, favourable output growth, capital market recovery and growth in external reserves, thus sustaining internal balance and external viability. The Committee also noted the recent volatility in the foreign exchange market and also recognized that the commitment of the Bank to defend the currency in the face of capital flow reversal and significant revenue attrition has stemmed the depreciation of the naira. Consequently the Bank has been able to sustain the objectives of financial and price stability. The Committee observed the build-up in excess liquidity in the banking system, and expressed concern over the rising cost of liquidity management as well as the sluggish growth in private sector credit, which was traced to DMB's appetite for government securities. This situation is made more serious by the perverse 6 incentive structure under which banks source huge amounts of public sector deposits and lend same to the Government (through securities) and the CBN (via OMO bills) at high rates of interest. The Committee expressed strong concerns about the risks posed to government revenues from oil theft, less than expected production, new discoveries of shale oil, the fast increasing number of African oil exporters, the dwindling market for Nigerian crude as well as the inevitability of a fall in global oil prices as well as capital flow reversal, which may impact the current global (dollar) carry trade, for which Nigeria has been a major beneficiary. The Committee commended the Federal Government on its sustained efforts towards fiscal consolidation in 2012 and stressed the need to reverse the loose fiscal stance of 2013. The Committee articulated the monetary policy risks of dwindling fiscal revenues to include: the crowding out effect of government borrowing, depletion of excess crude savings and pressure on the exchange rate. Available data indicates that capital expenditure is the first casualty of dwindling government revenues as available resources are channeled into funding non-discretionary recurrent expenditure. The Committee considered the inflationary outlook for the rest of the year as benign. However principal risks remain largely due to the loose fiscal stance and rising deficit, excess liquidity in the banking system and risks to the 7 exchange rate due to a combination of revenue shocks and external developments. Decisions Having considered all the above factors, the Committee decided: 1. By a vote of 9 to 1 to hold the MPR at 12 per cent. One member voted for a 50 basis points reduction; 2. By a vote of 9 to 1 to maintain the symmetric corridor around the MPR at +/-2 per cent. One member voted for an asymmetric corridor; 3. Unanimity to retain the CRR at 12 per cent; and 4. 9 to 1 to introduce a 50 per cent CRR on public sector deposits. This will be applied on Federal. State and Local Government deposits and all MDAs. For other deposits CRR will remain at 12 per cent Thank you. Sanusi Lamido Sanusi. CON Governor Central Bank of Nigeria 23rd July, 2013 8."
Hungary,2013-07-23,"At its meeting on 23 July 2013, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by 25 basis points from 4.25% to 4.00%, with effect from 24 July 2013. In the Council's judgement. Hungarian economic growth is likely to resume this year following last year's recession. The level of output remains below its potential and unemployment exceeds its long-term level determined by structural factors. The Council expects weak demand conditions to persist, which will ensure that inflationary pressures in the economy remain muted in the period ahead. In the Council's judgement, the rate of price increases affecting the general consumer price level, caused by the regulatory price measures taken to ensure the co-movement of producer and consumer prices between 2002 and 2009, fell to around half after 2010. This indicates a change in the approach of economic policy to inflation. Consequently, inflation in 2013 is expected to fall back to around 3 per cent even excluding the effect of the reduction in utilities prices. Historically low inflation is partly related to developments in the prices of non-core items. In addition, measures of underlying inflation have fallen further and have been at low levels since the beginning of the year, reflecting the strong downward pressure of weak domestic demand on prices. The low rate of earnings growth suggests that companies are adjusting to higher production costs mainly through labour costs, and therefore the pass-through into consumer prices is likely to be moderate. In the Council's judgement, these factors indicate that underlying inflation remains subdued and risks to inflation will be moderate over the medium term. The Hungarian economy is likely to recover from recession in 2013. The main underlying factors driving growth have not changed significantly: the outlook for global growth remains weak, while precautionary motives continue to be a drag on the recovery in domestic demand. A sustained pick-up in growth is likely to occur from the end of the year as demand in Hungary's export markets improves. The external balance of the economy remains favourable. In the Council's view, risk appetite in global financial markets has been highly volatile over the past month. Domestic indicators of risk declined despite increased uncertainty in the global financial environment, and no significant sell-off of domestic assets occurred. In the Monetary Council's assessment, increased volatility in sentiment in global financial markets and the uncertain outlook for global economic growth continue to pose a risk, which in turn calls for maintaining a cautious approach to policy. In the Council's judgement, there is a significant degree of spare capacity in the Hungarian economy and inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate even over the medium term. Data becoming available over the past month confirm that weak demand has exerted a strong disinflationary impact, and therefore companies have limited ability to pass on higher production costs into prices. Consequently, easier monetary policy will ensure that the 3 per cent inflation target is achieved. However, global financial markets have been volatile recently. A sustained and marked shift in perceptions of the risks associated with the economy may influence the room for manoeuvre in monetary policy. The significant reductions in interest rates so far and the volatile conditions in financial markets may justify changing the pace or extent of policy easing over the coming months."
Turkiye,2013-07-23,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to adjust the short term interest rates as follows: a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) has been kept constant at 4.5 percent, b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing has been kept at 3.5 percent, lending rate has been increased from 6.5 percent to 7.25 percent, and the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions has been increased from 6 percent to 6.75 percent. c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent while lending rate has been increased from 9.5 to 10.25 percent. Recent data suggest that domestic and external demand developments in the second quarter are in line with expectations. Domestic demand follows a healthy recovery while exports grow at a moderate pace. The current policy framework limits the deterioration in current account balance. Accordingly, current account deficit, excluding gold trade, has been on a stable course. Capital flows have weakened since May due to increasing uncertainty regarding the global monetary policies. Yet, loan growth continues to hover above the reference rate. The Committee has indicated that tightening the monetary policy stance under these circumstances will support financial stability. Recently, several developments have affected inflation adversely. Surging unprocessed food prices, rising oil prices, and the increased exchange rate volatility may continue to have adverse impact on inflation in the short term. Although the Committee sees these developments as temporary to a large extent, a measured monetary tightening is deemed necessary in order to contain a deterioration in the pricing behavior. In order to support the price and financial stability, the Committee has decided to raise the upper bound of the interest rate corridor. Cautious stance will be maintained until the inflation outlook is in line with the medium term targets. In this respect, additional monetary tightening will be implemented when necessary. Due to ongoing uncertainties regarding the global economy and the volatility in capital flows, the Committee has decided to increase the flexibility of the liquidity management. To this end, developments regarding price stability and financial stability will be closely monitored and necessary adjustments will be made in the composition of Turkish lira liquidity provided by the Central Bank. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Philippines,2013-07-24,"Statement by BSP Governor Amando M Tetangco. Jr. At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to keep the BSP's key policy rates at3.50 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 5.50 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs, and special deposit accounts (SDAs) were also left unchanged accordingly. The reserve requirement ratios were maintained as well. The Monetary Board's decision is based on its assessment that the inflation environment continues to be benign. Latest baseline forecasts indicate that the future inflation path remains within the target range of 4.0±1.0 percent in 2013-2014 and 3.0±1.0 percent for 2015. The forecasts are supported by well-contained inflation expectations, which remain within target over the policy horizon. The risks to the inflation outlook also remain broadly balanced. Global economic prospects are likely to stay subdued going forward, thus tempering upward pressures on commodity prices. Nonetheless, upside risks to the inflation outlook remain, including pending utility rate adjustments as well as the recent depreciation of the peso. At the same time, the Philippine economy continues to be robust, supported by favorable domestic demand and buoyant market confidence. Growth in domestic liquidity and bank lending also remains strong, providing solid support to domestic economic activity. The Monetary Board also considered that financial market volatility persists owing to concerns over the timing of the tapering of monetary stimulus in advanced economies, and this suggests caution in assessing the policy stance. On balance, the Monetary Board is of the view that prevailing monetary policy settings remain appropriate. The manageable inflation outlook and strong domestic growth support keeping policy settings steady given renewed market volatility. Going forward, the BSP will continue to monitor evolving price and output developments to ensure that the monetary policy stance remains consistent with ensuring price and financial stability while supporting sustainable economic growth."
Israel,2013-07-29,"Inflation expectations for the coming year, based on various sources, are below the midpoint of the inflation target range. Actual inflation over the past 12 months rose to the midpoint of the target. Indicators which became available in the past month point to continued growth of economic activity at the relatively moderate pace of the past two years, whicheased concerns of an additional slowdown in growth. The IMF revised its global growth forecast downward. The global economy continues topresent a mixed picture, with apparent recovery in Japan and the UK, mixedmacroeconomic data in the US, a recessionary environment continuing in Europe, and weakness persisting in emerging markets. Federal Reserve officialsclarified during the month that the tapering of its quantitative easing program will depend on economic conditions. The Bank of Japan continued quantitative easing, and the ECB and the Bank of England provided forward guidance for their monetary policy, which is expected to remain accommodative foran extended period. Against the background of continued expansionary monetary policies in major economies, the shekel continued to appreciate in terms of the effective exchange rate, strengthening by 0.9 percent this month. In recentmonths, new mortgages continued to be taken out at large volumes. Home prices, which are published in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of homeprices but are not included in the CPI, declined by 0.1 percent in April-May, and previous months' data were revised downward. Withthat, it is too early to determine if this represents a change in trend. To view this press release as a Word document. Thefollowing are the main considerations underlying the decision:. Against the background of these considerations and the interest rate reductions in recent months, the Monetary Committee decided tokeep the interest rate unchanged this month. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets, particularly in light of the continuing uncertainty in the global economy. The Bank will use the tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ The minutes of the discussions prior to the interest rate decision for August 2013 will be published on August 12, 2013. The decision regarding the interest rate for September-October 2013 will be published at 17:30 on Monday. August 26, 2013. Inflation data:Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Private forecasters' inflation expectations for the next 12 CPI readings declined, to 1.7 percent onaverage, after the June CPI figure was published and removed from the forecast calculation. Inflation expectations for the coming 12 months derived from banks' internal interest rates were stable this month at 1.6 percent, and expectations derived from the capital market were 1.5 percent. Forward expectations for terms of 2 years and longer (monthly averages) remained stable, and range from 2.2-2.5 percent. Private forecasters' average projections are for the July CPI to increase by 0.2 percent. Expectations for the Bank of Israel interest rate 1 year from now, based on various sources, remained stable and range from 1.1-1.2 percent on average, with most forecasters projecting that the Bank of Israel will leave the interest rate unchanged for August. Real economic activity: Indicators of economic activity which became available in the past month point to continued growth of economic activity at a rate similar to that of the past two years: against the backgroundof a virtual standstill in demand from abroad, which was somewhat offset by growth in domestic demand. In the third estimate of first quarter National Accounts data, the growth rate was revised upward to 2.9 percent, which moderated the previous month's concerns of an additional slowdown. Indicators of second quarter activity point to continued growth at a rate similar to that of the first quarter: consumer goods imports increasedin May by 4.1 percent, the industrial production index increased by 0.3 percent in May, the Trade Revenue Index increased by 2.7 percent in April-May compared with the first quarter, and tourist entries increased by 16 percent in the second quarter compared with the first quarter. The Composite State of the Economy Index increased by 0.1 percent in June: alow rate, but higher than that recorded in the beginning of the year. The standstill continued in manufacturing exports, which are given to volatility due to the effect of several large companies on the aggregate figure. TheClimate Index based on the Business Tendency Survey of the Central Bureau of Statistics indicates stability in the rate of growth. The Consumer Confidence Indices published by Globes and by Bank Hapoalim indicate a partial correction to their sharp declines in May, while the index published by the Central Bureau of Statistics continued to decline, as did the Purchasing Managers Index, which reached 46 points. The labor market: The number of employee posts in the business sector increased in April by 0.26 percent, and offset an appreciable share of its decline of recent months. Growth in employee posts in public services continued to increase. Based on seasonally adjusted data, nominal wages increased by 0.5 percent and real wages increased by 0.2 percent in February-April, compared with November-January, continuing the trend of several months. Health tax receipts by the National Insurance Institute, which provide an indication of total wage payments in the economy, were 5.1 percent higher in May-June than in the corresponding two months of the previous year, a year over year growth rate which is similar to the previoustwo months. Budget data: In January-June, the government's cumulative deficit in domestic activity was about NIS 7.7 billion, about NIS 5.5 billion below the path consistent with the deficit ceiling for 2013 of 4.65 percent of GDP. The lower than expected deficit is primarily an expression ofan expenditure level below the path. Tax receipts recovered in recent months, and were markedly higher than the seasonal path, although part of the growth represented one-time revenue and purchases brought forward ahead of the increase VAT rate in June. The changes made in the budget by the KnessetFinance Committee are not expected to impact on the deficit in 2014. However, due to the timing of some of them, a larger adjustment will be necessary in 2015. The foreign exchange market: From the monetary policy discussion on June 23, 2013, through July 26, 2013, the shekel appreciated by about 1.4 percent against the dollar and by 0.8 percent against the euro. In terms of the nominal effective exchange rate, the shekel appreciated by about 0.9 percent during the period. The shekel's appreciation against the dollar was in line with the global trend. The capital and money markets: From the monetary policy discussion on June 23, 2013, through July 26, 2013, the Tel Aviv 25 Index increased by 1.4 percent. Government bond yields declined along the unindexed curve by about 15 basis points for most maturities. Along the CPI-indexed yield curve, yields declined more moderately, except for the short term, where yields increased. The yield differential between 10-year Israeli government bonds and equivalent 10-year US Treasury securities continued to contract by about 20 basis points, to 108 basis points. Makam yields declined along the entire curve by 5-10 basis points, as the one-year yield declined to 1.16 percent during the period. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spread declined by about 19 basis points, to 108 basis points. The Tel-Bond 60 Index increased by about 1.6 percent. At the same time, spreads in the corporate bond market continued to narrow, primarily for debt issued by companies with lower ratings. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in June, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 11.7 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 5.8 percent. Developments in the credit markets: The total outstanding debt of the business sector increased by 1.2 percent in May, to NIS 794 billion, as a result of the effects of the depreciation of the shekel in May and net funds raised. The private nonfinancial sector issued about NIS 2.3 billion in bonds, compared with an average of NIS 2.6 billion since the beginning of the year. Household debt increased by 0.9 percent in May, to NIS 394 billion, primarily as a result of an increase of 1.1 percent in households' housing debt, to NIS 278.5 billion. In June, there was about NIS 4.2 billion in new mortgages granted, similar to the average since the beginning of the year, and despite the high level in May which was attributed to new mortgages being brought forward ahead of the VAT increase. Average interest rates on new variable-rate unindexed mortgages declined in June by about 0.15 percentage points, following the decline in the Bank of Israel interest rate. The interest rate on new fixed rate CPI-indexed mortgages increased by about 0.16 percentage points. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (based on housing rents) increased by 0.3 percent in June, following an increase of 0.3 percent in May. In the twelve months ending in June, this component increased by 3.2 percent, compared with a 3.0 percent increase over the twelve months ending in May. Home prices, which are published in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of home prices but are not included in the CPI, declined by 0.1 percent in April-May, and the data for previous months were revised downward. As a result, the rate of home price appreciation continued todecline, to 8.4 percent in the twelve months ending in May, compared with an increase of 8.9 percent in the twelve months to April. Following the continued decline in the share of homes purchased by investors out of total home transactions, the share increased sharply in May, from 20 percent to 24 percent. Therewere 39,327 building starts in the 12 months ending in April, a slight decline compared to the pace in recent months. The global economy: The International Monetary Fund reduced its global growth forecast at the beginning of the month from 3.3 percent to 3.1 percent for 2013, and from 4.0 percent to 3.8 percent for 2014. Projected growth of world trade was reduced by 0.5 percentage points for 2013, but was increased by 0.1 percentage points for 2014. The US economy seems to be continuing its recovery, but macroeconomic data in the US were mixed this month: nonfarm payroll employment growth continued, while the unemployment rate remained steady due to an increase in the participation rate. The housing and construction sectors continued to recover, and manufacturing activity strengthened. In contrast, there was a slowdown in activity in the services sector, and slower than expected growth in retail sales. The slowdown in Europe continues, and the unemployment rate increased slightly in May, although byless than expected. The IMF's growth forecast for Japan for 2013 was increased by 0.5 percentage points, and investment houses assess that this reflects investors' trust in the accommodative measures adopted there. The slowdown in the growth rates in emerging markets is becoming more severe. In China, there are increasing signs of a slowdown in growth. Growth in the second quarter was 7.5 percent in annualized terms, but viewed by composition of GDP, there was growth in the share of investments and a decline in the share of private consumption. Federal Reserve officials clarified during the month that the reduction in quantitative easing would dependon economic conditions, and the quantitative easing programs may continue or even increase if growth disappoints. This message reduced the volatilityof the financial markets that had been recorded since the Fed Chairman's speech last month. The Bank of Japan continued quantitative easing,and the ECB and the Bank of England provided forward guidance for monetarypolicy, which is expected to remain accommodative for a prolonged period. Monetary policy in emerging markets is not uniform, with some continuing toadopt accommodative policies, while India and Brazil adopted restrictive policies despite the slowdown, due to concerns of depreciation and inflation. The credit ratings of Italy and France were lowered this month, and political uncertainty in Portugal and Spain is making recovery in the eurozone more difficult. Energy prices increased this month, and contributed to some acceleration in inflation in emerging markets. Nonetheless, estimations regarding global inflation were lowered this month. The main considerations behind the decision. The decision to keep the interest rate for August 2013 unchanged at 1.25 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's interest rate policy, which isintended to entrench the inflation rate within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel and in the global economy, the monetary policies of major centralbanks, and developments in the exchange rate of the shekel."
India,2013-07-30,"First Quarter Review of Monetary Policy 2013-14 Statement by Dr.D. Subbarao. Governor. Reserve Bank of India ""First of all, on behalf of the Reserve Bank, a warm welcome to you all. This morning, we put out the First Quarter Review of Monetary Policy for 2013-14.Based on an assessment of the present and prospective macroeconomic situation, we have decided to keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) as also the cash reserve ratio (CRR) unchanged. Accordingly, the repo rate stays at 7.25 per cent, the reverse repo rate at 6.25 per cent, and the CRR at 4.0 per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) of scheduled banks. The marginal standing facility (MSF) rate used to have a mark up of a 100 basis points above the repo rate. You will recall that earlier this month we raised that mark up to 300 basis points, raising the MSF rate to 10.25 per cent. As there is no change in the repo rate, the MSF rate stays at 10.25 per cent. Considerations Behind the Policy Move The policy stance in this review was informed by two considerations. First, the need for continuous vigil and preparedness to pro-actively respond to risks to the economy from external developments, especially those stemming from global financial markets. Second, managing the trade-off posed by increased downside risks to growth and continuing risks to inflation and inflation expectations. Monetary Policy Stance Accordingly, the four broad contours of our monetary policy stance are the following: first, to address the risks to macroeconomic stability from external shocks; second, to continue to address the heightened risks to growth; third, to guard against re-emergence of inflation pressures; and fourth, to manage liquidity conditions to ensure adequate credit flow to the productive sectors of the economy.2 Guidance Let me now indicate the forward guidance that we have given. The monetary policy stance over the last two years has predominantly been shaped by the growth-inflation dynamic, even as external sector concerns have had a growing influence on policy calibration over the last one year. The current situation  moderating wholesale price inflation, prospects of softening of food inflation consequent on a robust monsoon, and decelerating growth  would have provided a reasonable case for continuing on the easing stance. However. India is currently caught in a classic ‘impossible trinity' trilemma whereby we are having to forfeit some monetary policy discretion to address external sector concerns. The liquidity tightening measures instituted by the Reserve Bank over the last two weeks are aimed at checking undue volatility in the foreign exchange market. They will be rolled back in a calibrated manner as stability is restored to the foreign exchange market, enabling monetary policy to revert to supporting growth with continuing vigil on inflation. We have emphasised that the time available now should be used with alacrity to institute structural measures to bring the current account deficit down to sustainable levels. The Reserve Bank stands ready to use all available instruments and measures at its command to respond proactively and swiftly to any adverse development. Global and Domestic Developments As always, our policy decision has been based on a detailed and careful assessment of the global and domestic macroeconomic situation. Let me begin with our assessment of the global outlook. Global Economy Global growth has been uneven and slower than initially expected. The tail risks to global recovery had eased in the early part of the year, but that improvement was overtaken by the flash turmoil in the financial markets because of the ‘announcement effect' of the tapering of quantitative easing (QE) by the US Fed. In advanced economies (AEs), activity has weakened. Emerging and developing economies (EDEs) are slowing, and are also experiencing sell-offs in their financial markets, largely due to the safe haven flight of capital. Market expectations of QE taper and the consequent increase in real interest rates in the US have translated into a rapid appreciation of the US dollar and consequent depreciation of EDE currencies. Commodity prices have generally softened, but the price of crude remains elevated.3 Indian Economy Here at home, economic activity weakened in the first quarter of this year. Lead indicators point to continuing headwinds facing manufacturing and services sector activity. Industrial production remained muted at 0.1 per cent during April-May; in May, there was an absolute decline of 1.6 per cent spread across all constituent sub- sectors, barring electricity generation. Capital goods production continues to contract, reflecting deteriorating investment conditions. Fortunately, the monsoon arrived on time and rainfall to date has been above the long period average. Consequently, kharif sowing has been significantly higher than a year ago. In the May Policy, the Reserve Bank projected GDP growth for 2013-14 of 5.7 per cent, conditional upon a normal monsoon returning agricultural growth to its trend level. The outlook for industrial activity, however, was expected to remain subdued. Growth in services and exports was expected to stay sluggish owing to global growth not improving significantly. While the onset of the monsoon and its spread have been robust, the persisting weakness in industrial activity has heightened the risks to growth. Moreover, global growth has been tepid, with consequent adverse spillovers on India's exports, manufacturing and services. On the basis of the above considerations, the growth projection for the current year is revised downwards, from 5.7 per cent to 5.5 per cent. Inflation Let me now turn to inflation. Headline inflation, as measured by the wholesale price index (WPI), edged up slightly to 4.9 per cent in June after declining for five months on a clip. The pickup was mainly driven by a spurt in food inflation, especially in respect of vegetables and cereals. Fuel inflation declined due to the reduction in coal prices in March and easing of inflation in electricity prices because of base effects. Non-food manufactured products inflation fell to 2.0 per cent in June, the lowest since December 2009. Retail inflation, as measured by the new series of Consumer Price Index (CPI), had moderated somewhat during April-May, but it surged close to double digits in June, driven primarily by a sharp increase in food prices. In the May Policy, the Reserve Bank indicated that during the current year. WPI inflation will be range-bound around 5.5 per cent, with some edging down in the first half and some edging up in the second half, mainly on base effects. The inflation trajectory in the first quarter of this year has moved largely in line with these expectations. Keeping in view the domestic demand-supply balance, the outlook for global commodity prices and on the expectation that the spatial and temporal distribution of the monsoon during the rest of the season will be normal, the Reserve Bank will endeavour to condition the evolution of inflation to a level of 5.0 per cent by March 2014, using all instruments at its command.4 Monetary and Liquidity Conditions Let me now turn to monetary and liquidity conditions. Money supply (M ), at 12.8 per cent y-o-y on July 12, was close to the 3 indicative trajectory of 13.0 per cent. On the other hand, non-food credit growth at 14.3 per cent was lower than the indicative projection of 15.0 per cent, with the slowdown spread across all major sectors. With nominal growth remaining broadly at the same level as envisaged in the May Policy, monetary aggregates are expected to move along the projected trajectories. Accordingly. M growth projection for the current year has been retained 3 at 13.0 per cent and aggregate deposit growth at 14.0 per cent. Non-food credit of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) is projected to grow at 15.0 per cent. As always, these numbers are indicative projections and not targets. Liquidity conditions have eased considerably since the May Policy. The average daily net liquidity injection under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) declined to 828 billion in the first quarter of this year from 1,078 billion during the last quarter of 2012-13. Government balances have been in deficit since June 28 and have bolstered liquidity, thereby significantly reducing the demand for funds under the LAF. The net drawal from the LAF declined significantly during the first week of July. On July 26, the net drawal was 558 billion, including a drawal of 229 billion from the marginal standing facility (MSF). Risk Factors I have so far given you the Reserve Bank's assessment of the global and domestic macroeconomic situation and our projections for the current year. Let me briefly indicate the risks to that macroeconomic outlook. First, the biggest risk to the macroeconomic outlook stems from the external sector. Financial markets around the world went into a flash turmoil beginning late May, on the perception of an earlier than expected tapering of its quantitative easing (QE) by the US Fed. The rupee depreciated in nominal terms by as much as 5.8 per cent between May 22 (the day of the first ‘announcement effect') and July 26, consequent on sudden stop and reversal of capital flows in reaction to the prospective change in the US monetary policy stance. It is not clear if financial markets have factored in the full impact of the prospective tapering of QE or whether they will react to every future announcement of tapering. We are dependent on external flows for financing our current account deficit. India will, therefore, remain vulnerable to confidence and sentiment in the global financial markets. Second, we have been running a large current account deficit. The CAD has been well above the sustainable level of 2.5 per cent of GDP for three years in a row. This is a daunting structural risk factor. It has brought the external payments situation under increased stress, reflecting rising external indebtedness and the attendant burden of servicing external liabilities. Most external vulnerability indicators have deteriorated ,thereby eroding the economy's resilience to shocks. The recent measures by the Reserve Bank to restore stability to the foreign exchange market should be used as a window of opportunity to put in place policies to bring CAD down to sustainable levels. Furthermore, the growing vulnerability in the external sector reinforces the importance of credible fiscal consolidation with accent on both the quantum and quality of adjustment.5 Third, the investment climate remains weak and risk aversion continues to stall investment plans. The outlook for investment is inhibited by cost and time overruns, high leverage, deteriorating cash flows, erosion of asset quality and muted credit confidence. Fourth, an environment of low and stable inflation and well-anchored inflation expectations is necessary to sustain growth in the medium-term. To engender this benign growth-inflation environment, it is critical to ease the supply constraints in the economy, particularly in the food and infrastructure sectors. Without policy efforts to address the deterioration in productivity and competitiveness, the pressures from wage increases and upward revisions in administered prices could weaken growth even further and exacerbate inflation pressures. Let me conclude by summarising our macroeconomic concerns. Risks to growth have increased notwithstanding the robust onset and spread of the monsoon. Industrial production has slumped, with lead indications of declining order books and input price pressures building on rupee depreciation. Meanwhile, depressed global conditions are undermining export performance, even as heightened volatility in capital flows has raised external funding risks. Wholesale price inflation pressures are on the ebb, but retail inflation remains high. Monetary policy going forward will be shaped by considerations of supporting growth, anchoring inflation expectations and maintaining external sector stability. The foreign exchange market came under severe stress starting May, prompting the Reserve Bank to institute liquidity tightening measures to contain the volatility. The recent measures by the Reserve Bank to restore stability to the foreign exchange market should be used as a window of opportunity to put in place policies to bring the CAD down to sustainable levels. Over the last one year, the Government has taken several policy initiatives to improve the investment environment. As these initiatives work through the system and are further built upon, the current slowdown can be reversed, returning the economy to a higher growth trajectory. The Reserve Bank will have to ensure that the economy traverses that high growth trajectory in an environment of price stability and financial stability. Thank you for your attention.""

United States,2013-07-31,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June suggests that economic activity expanded at a modest pace during the first half of the year. Labor market conditions have shown further improvement in recent months, on balance, but the unemployment rate remains elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector has been strengthening, but mortgage rates have risen somewhat and fiscal policy is restraining economic growth. Partly reflecting transitory influences, inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will pick up from its recent pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee sees the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished since the fall. The Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, but it anticipates that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months. The Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability. The Committee is prepared to increase or reduce the pace of its purchases to maintain appropriate policy accommodation as the outlook for the labor market or inflation changes. In determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, the Committee will continue to take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases as well as the extent of progress toward its economic objectives. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens. In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; James Bullard; Elizabeth A Duke; Charles L Evans; Jerome H Powell; Sarah Bloom Raskin; Eric S Rosengren; Jeremy C Stein; Daniel K Tarullo; and Janet L Yellen. Voting against the action was Esther L George, who was concerned that the continued high level of monetary accommodation increased the risks of future economic and financial imbalances and, over time, could cause an increase in long-term inflation expectations."
Czech Republic,2013-08-01,"Press conference of the CNB Bank Board 5th Situation Report on Economic and Monetary Developments 1 August 2013 The monetary policy decision and the stance of the CNB At the close of the meeting the Board decided unanimously to leave the two-week repo rate unchanged at 0.05%. Interest rates will remain at current levels (i.e. at technical zero) over a longer horizon until inflation pressures increase significantly. The likelihood of launching foreign exchange interventions to ease monetary policy has increased further. 2 Reasons for the decision within the context of the forecast Consistent with the forecast is a decline in market interest rates to zero, followed by a noticeable rise in rates only in 2015. Given the zero lower bound on monetary policy rates, this points to a need for easing monetary policy using other instruments. The new forecast does not predict an increase in inflation pressures and no tangible risks of such an increase in inflation pressures can be identified either. The risks to the new forecast are skewed towards a need for easier monetary conditions. 3 The message of the forecast Food prices continue to be the source of current inflation. The contribution of tax changes and administered prices has decreased. The domestic economy continues to dampen inflation significantly. Headline inflation will be below the CNB's 2% target this year, monetary-policy relevant inflation will be below the lower boundary of the tolerance band. At the monetary policy horizon, headline and monetary-policy will gradually approach the target again. This year. GDP will drop by 1.5% overall and a gradual recovery will be seen from 2013 Q2. Next year. GDP will grow by approximately 2% due to accelerating external demand amid an unwinding dampening effect of domestic fiscal consolidation. The exchange rate of the koruna against the euro has weakened and will appreciate only very slowly over the forecast horizon. Consistent with the forecast is a decline in market interest rates to zero, followed by a noticeable rise in rates only in 2015. Risks in this direction: − energy prices − a risk of unfulfilled expectations of an economic recovery in the euro area 1133 Thank you for your attention More information about the forecast can be found at and in Inflation Report III/2013, to be published 9 August 2013."
Euroarea,2013-08-01,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Underlying price pressures in the euro area are expected to remain subdued over the medium term. In keeping with this picture, monetary and, in particular, credit dynamics remain subdued. Inflation expectations for the euro area continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. At the same time, recent confidence indicators based on survey data have shown some further improvement from low levels and tentatively confirm the expectation of a stabilisation in economic activity. Our monetary policy stance continues to be geared towards maintaining the degree of monetary accommodation warranted by the outlook for price stability and promoting stable money market conditions. It thereby provides support to a gradual recovery in economic activity in the remaining part of the year and in 2014. Looking ahead, our monetary policy stance will remain accommodative for as long as necessary. The Governing Council confirms that it expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. This expectation continues to be based on an unchanged overall subdued outlook for inflation extending into the medium term, given the broad-based weakness in the economy and subdued monetary dynamics. In the period ahead, we will monitor all incoming information on economic and monetary developments and assess any impact on the outlook for price stability. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Following a six-quarter economic contraction in the euro area, recent confidence indicators based on survey data have shown some further improvement from low levels and tentatively confirm the expectation of a stabilisation in economic activity at low levels. Looking ahead to the remainder of the year and to 2014, euro area export growth should benefit from a gradual recovery in global demand, while domestic demand should be supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance as well as the recent gains in real income owing to generally lower inflation. Furthermore, the overall improvements in financial markets seen since last summer appear to be gradually working their way through to the real economy, as should the progress made in fiscal consolidation. This being said, the remaining necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors will continue to weigh on economic activity. Overall, euro area economic activity should stabilise and recover at a slow pace. The risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside. Recent developments in global money and financial market conditions and related uncertainties may have the potential to negatively affect economic conditions. Other downside risks include the possibility of weaker than expected domestic and global demand and slow or insufficient implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.6% in July 2013, unchanged from June. Annual inflation rates are currently expected to temporarily fall over the coming months, owing particularly to base effects relating to energy price developments twelve months earlier. Taking the appropriate medium-term perspective, underlying price pressures are expected to remain subdued, reflecting the broad-based weakness in aggregate demand and the modest pace of the recovery. Medium to long-term inflation expectations continue to be firmly anchored in line with price stability. The risks to the outlook for price developments are expected to be still broadly balanced over the medium term, with upside risks relating to stronger than expected increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, as well as higher commodity prices, and downside risks stemming from weaker than expected economic activity. Turning to the monetary analysis, underlying money and, in particular, credit growth remained subdued in June. Annual growth in broad money (M3) decreased in June to 2.3%, from 2.9% in May. Moreover, annual growth in M1 decreased to 7.5% in June, from 8.4% in May. The annual rate of change of loans to the private sector weakened further. While the annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) remained at 0.3% in June, broadly unchanged since the turn of the year, the annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was -2.3% in June, after -2.1% in May. Weak loan dynamics continue to reflect primarily the current stage of the business cycle, heightened credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. The bank lending survey for the second quarter of 2013 confirms that borrowers' risk and macroeconomic uncertainty remained the main factors restraining banks' lending policies. At the same time, the degree of net tightening of credit standards for loans to non-financial corporations remained unchanged in the second quarter of 2013, compared with the first quarter, and declined for loans to households. Since the summer of 2012 substantial progress has been made in improving the funding situation of banks and, in particular, in strengthening the domestic deposit base in a number of stressed countries. In order to ensure an adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions in euro area countries, it is essential that the fragmentation of euro area credit markets declines further and that the resilience of banks is strengthened where needed. Further decisive steps for establishing a Banking Union will help to accomplish this objective. To sum up, the economic analysis indicates that price developments should remain in line with price stability over the medium term. A cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. As regards fiscal policies, in order to bring debt ratios back on a downward path, euro area countries should not unravel their efforts to reduce government budget deficits. The emphasis should be on growth-friendly fiscal strategies which have a medium-term perspective and combine improving the quality and efficiency of public services with minimising distortionary effects of taxation. To reinforce the overall impact of such a strategy. Member States must step up the implementation of the necessary structural reforms so as to foster competitiveness, growth and job creation. Removing rigidities in the labour market, lowering the administrative burden and strengthening competition in product markets will particularly support small and medium-sized enterprises. These structural reform measures are essential to bring down the currently high level of unemployment, in particular among the younger citizens of the euro area."
Egypt,2013-08-01,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release August 1, 2013 In its mee(cid::415)ng held on August 1, 2013, the Monetary Policy Commi(cid::425)ee (MPC) decided to cut the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation by 50 basis points to 925 percent, 1025 percent, and 975 percent respectivel. The discount rate was also cut by 50 basis points to 975 percen. Headline CPI increased by 088 percent (m/m) in June compared to a decline of 016 percent in May, pushing the annual rate to 975 percent from 820 percent in Ma. On the other hand, core CPI increased by 077 percent (m/m) in June a(cid::332)er remaining unchanged in May, bringing the annual rate to 856 percent from 804 percent in Ma. It is worth mentioning that the cumulative monthly increase in headline CPI inched up by only 22 percent in 2013Q2, a(cid::332)er increasing by around 5 percent in 2013Q1. Similarly, the cumula(cid::415)ve monthly increase in core CPI registered 17 percent in 2013Q2 compared to 47 percent in the previous quarte. The latest monthly developments in both headline and core inflation were largely driven by increases in several food price. Upside risks to the inflation outlook have moderated as the possibility of a rebound in international food prices is unlikely in light of recent global development. Meanwhile real GDP grew by 23 percent in the first nine months of 2012/2013, following a similarly feeble growth rate of 22 percent in 2011/201. This nascent recovery in economic activity came on the back of tentative signs of recovery in the construction and tourism sector. Nonetheless GDP growth remains to be partly suppressed by continuing weaknesses, albeit of lesser extent, in the manufacturing secto. In the meantime, investment levels remained low given the heightened uncertainty that faced market par(cid::415)cipants since early 2011 and the weak credit growth to the private secto. Looking ahead, the current political transformation may continue to have ramifications on both consumption as well as investment decisions, adversely weighing on key sectors within the econom. Moreover downside risks continue to surround the global recovery on the back of challenges facing the Euro Area and the softening growth emerging market. These factors, combined, pose downside risks to domestic GDP going forwar. The pronounced downside risks to domestic GDP combined with the persistently negative output gap since 2011 will limit upside risks to the inflation outlook going forwar. Given that the downside risks to the GDP outlook outweigh the upside risks to the inflation outlook, the MPC decided to cut the key CBE rate. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium‐ter. Dr Rania Al‐Mashat Sub Governor.

Romania,2013-08-05,"The NBR Board has examined and approved the new quarterly Inflation Report, which will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled for 7 August 2013. The latest macroeconomic data show the inflation rate moving in line with the central bank's previous forecasts and the prospects of its falling within the target band once the statistical effects of the summer 2012 supply-side shocks fade away. The adjusted CORE2 inflation rate 1 saw a consolidation of its downward path, its annual rate coming in at 2.85 percent in June 2013 versus 3.03 percent in March and 3.25 percent in December 2012. The annual inflation rate measured by the Harmonised Index for Consumer Prices, a relevant indicator to ensure EU-wide comparability and to assess the degree of convergence with the European Union, ran at 4.5 percent in June 2013, similarly to the preceding months. The pick-up in economic growth in 2013 Q1 was driven by net exports, which had a bearing on the good performance of both manufacturing and current account. Nevertheless, final consumption nearly stalled, while the real annual dynamics of loans to the private sector have stayed in negative territory. Stronger volatility in investors' risk appetite and the persistence of uncertainties surrounding economic activity in Europe and elsewhere temporarily entailed wider fluctuations in the leu exchange rate. Moreover, the fact that interbank money market rates and yields on government bonds have recently been close to or even below the policy rate points to the consolidation of the monetary policy impulse transmission. However, the pass-through of the policy rate cut to interest rates on new corporate and household loans in domestic currency remains relatively slow. In today's meeting, the NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which foresees faster disinflation in the period ahead, along with a pick-up in economic growth. Against this backdrop, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided to lower the monetary policy rate to 4.5 percent per annum from 5.0 percent previously. Hence, starting with 6 August 2013, the interest rate on the NBR's lending facility (Lombard) will be lowered to an annual 7.5 percent from 8.0 percent, while its deposit facility rate will stand at 1.5 percent per annum. The NBR Board has also decided to continue to pursue an adequate liquidity management in the banking system and to leave unchanged the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The NBR Board considers that the necessary conditions are in place for a cautious adjustment of monetary conditions by adequately calibrating its policy tools in order to ensure the consolidation of disinflation, and the necessary prerequisites exist for a recovery of lending to the private sector, restoring confidence and achieving balanced and lasting economic growth. Furthermore, the prospects for concluding a new precautionary arrangement with international financial institutions are seen consolidating the stability of the macroeconomic framework and boosting structural reforms, thereby strengthening the resilience of the domestic economy to external shocks. The NBR reiterates that it will closely monitor domestic and global economic developments so as, via the proper calibration of the monetary policy conduct and the adequate use of its available tools, to ensure price stability over the medium term and financial stability. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be released to the public in a press conference on 7 August 2013. In line with the announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for 30 September 2013. 1Calculated by excluding administered prices, volatile prices, as well as tobacco and alcohol prices from the consumer price index.

South Korea,2013-08-08,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information, the Committee considers the moderate economic recovery in the US to have been sustained but the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area to have continued, while economic growth in emerging market countries such as China has slowed somewhat. The Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward, helped primarily by improvements in the US economy, but judges that the possibilities of changes in global financial market conditions related to the exit strategy of the US Federal Reserve, and of a slowdown in Chinese economic growth, and the uncertainties surrounding the implementations of fiscal consolidation in major countries, remain as downside risks to growth. In Korea, the Committee appraises economic growth to be continuing, albeit moderately, mainly led by exports. On the employment front, the increase in the number of persons employed has accelerated, centering around the 50-and-above age group and the service sector. The Committee expects that the domestic economy will maintain a negative output gap for a considerable time going forward, although it forecasts that the gap will gradually narrow. Consumer price inflation rose to 1.4% in July, from 1.0% the previous month, as the prices of agricultural and livestock products as well as petroleum products turned upward, and core inflation 1 excluding the prices of agricultural and petroleum products increased slightly to 1.5%, from 1.4% in June. The Committee forecasts that inflation will show a stable trend for the time being as the output gap remains negative, although it will rise above its present level due mainly to imbalances in agricultural product supply and demand caused by bad weather and to a base effect from its low rate of increase in the second half of last year. As for housing prices, those in Seoul and its surrounding areas sustained their downtrend, while those in the rest of the country continued their uptrend. The domestic financial markets have generally stabilized with the easing of concerns about an earlier-than-expected tapering off of US quantitative easing. Long-term market interest rates have risen modestly, primarily on improved global economic indicators, after having declined in concert with those of major economies. Stock prices, after having risen due to a shift to net inflows of foreigners' stock investment funds, have fallen back somewhat recently and the Korean won has appreciated. Looking ahead, while closely monitoring the trends and the influences of changes in external risk factors, and the effects of the Base Rate cut and of the government's economic policies including the supplementary budget, the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as to keep consumer price inflation within the inflation target range over a medium-term horizon while ensuring that the growth potential is not eroded due to the continuation of slow growth."
Russia,2013-08-09,"The Bank of Russia External and Public Relations Department informs that on 9 August 2013 the Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia decided to maintain unchanged the interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations and the refinancing rate (table “Interest rates on the Bank of Russia operations”). The decision was based on the assessment of inflation risks and economic growth prospects. In July and at the beginning of August the rate of inflation declined, but remained above the target range and as of 5 August 2013 was estimated at 6.5% over a year ago. The inflation deceleration was mainly attributed to food prices dynamics. Meanwhile, the growth rate of prices for nonfood products and services with the exception of regulated prices and tariffs also declined. Core inflation slid to 5.6% in July. According to the Bank of Russia estimates, there is no significant demand side inflationary pressure, as gross output stands slightly below its potential level. Assuming unchanged monetary policy stance and absence of adverse food prices shocks, the Bank of Russia expects that the rate of inflation will get back to the target range during the second half of 2013 and will continue declining in 2014. However, in order to achieve inflation target in the medium term favorable trends in the dynamics of inflation expectations should be sustainable. The dynamics of the key macroeconomic indicators points out that the pace of economic growth remains low. The growth rates of industrial production remain subdued, investment in production capacity continues to decrease. In this environment some increase in the unemployment rate was recorded in recent months. Consumer demand supported by the real wage and retail lending growth remains the major driver for the economic growth. Weak investment activity combined with the sluggish recovery in external demand points out to persisting risks of further economic slowdown, also in the medium term perspective. The Bank of Russia will continue to monitor inflation risks and the downside risks to economic growth. In making monetary policy decisions the Bank of Russia will be guided by the inflation goals and economic growth prospects. The next meeting of the Board of Directors of the Bank of Russia on monetary policy issues is planned to be held on 13 September 2013.

Armenia,2013-08-13,"Press-release 13.08.2013 In the August 13th of 2013 Meeting the Board of CBA decided to raise the Refinancing Rate of CBA by 0.5pp, setting it at 8.5 percent. There was 0.4 percent inflation recorded in July of 2013 mainly due to the rise of energy tariffs. With the 1.5 percent deflation reported for same period of the previous year this led to the increase of the 12-month inflation up to 8.5 percent at the end of July. The CBA decision is aimed to anchor the inflation expectations formed under the developments of the domestic economy, and to tame the second-round effects of energy tariffs rise. It is also important for the Board to keep the positive real interest rates. Owing to the CBA policy it is expected that within the coming months inflation will gradually reduce. Under the gradually reduce of inflation and possible economic growth slowdown the Board will react correspondingly by easing the monetary conditions. The Board acknowledged that the external environment remained in the frames of the forecast. The trends of the global economic growth slowdown continued and the deflationary trends were observable in raw materials and food product world markets. In the light of such developments, the external sector is expected to have no additional inflationary effects in the forecast horizon. The Board estimates that in line with the developments of the domestic economy in the first half- year the level of inflation has exceeded expectations and that was mainly due to developments in the agricultural sector (heavy hails and partial delay of growing season) and some services price rise. The Board reckons that inflation will gradually reduce and reach its target and will be a confidence band in the forecast horizon. Public Relations Service of the Central Bank of Armenia."
Chile,2013-08-13,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 13 August 2013 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 5% (annual). International financial conditions improved somewhat during the last month, including lower credit risk premiums, both sovereign and corporate. Global second-quarter activity figures were generally lower than expected, although consensus forecasts continue to anticipate a recovery in the United States. Growth expectations for emerging economies have declined further, although some recent indicators for China point to a stabilization of its the rate of expansion. The prices of metals, including copper, picked up in recent weeks, while food prices dropped. The dollar depreciated in international markets. Domestically, incoming information shows a sharper slowdown for output than for demand. Consumption remains dynamic, although confidence surveys foresee a reduced impulse from this variable going forward, while investment moderates. Headline inflation fell within the tolerance range, as forecast, while core inflation measures are still hovering around 1% annually. Inflation expectations remain near the target in the policy horizon. The consolidation of the trends outlined in the last Monetary Policy Report could call for adjustments to the monetary policy interest rate in the coming months. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. * The Spanish original prevails."
Peru,2013-08-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR AUGUST 2013 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 4.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference rate at 4.25 percent. This decision is based on that economic growth in the country is close to the economy's potential level of growth, inflation expectations remain anchored within the target range, uncertainty about international financial conditions persists, and the rate of inflation was affected by temporary factors on the side of supply. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants to consider future adjustments in monetary policy instruments. Inflation in July registered a rate of 0.55 percent due mainly to the rise in the prices of some perishable food products and transportation. Inflation in the last 12 months rose from 2.77 percent in June to 3.24 percent in July. Core inflation showed a rate of 0.33 percent (3.52 percent in the last 12 months), and inflation without food and energy showed a rate of 0.28 percent (2.48 percent in the last 12 months). Inflation is expected to return to the target range in the third quarter as a result of an improvement in food supply conditions and of inflation expectations anchored to the target range. Current and advanced indicators of activity show that the growth of the Peruvian economy is close to its long-term sustainable level of growth, even though the indicators associated with the external market still show a weak performance that affects the prices and volumes of export products. The Board has been adopting measures since April with the aim of making the reserve requirements regime more flexible in order to foster a more orderly evolution of credit and promote increased financing sources in soles. These measures have allowed to immediately release funds in domestic currency for a total of 1 billion and funds in foreign currency for a total of US$ 150 million, and it is estimated that a total of US$ 200 million will be released in the rest of the year. If necessary, the Board will adopt additional measures to make the regime of required reserves more flexible. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as described below: Overnight deposits: 3.45 percent. Direct repo and rediscount operations: 5.05 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.05 percent. The Monetary Program for September will be approved on the Board's meeting of September 12, 2013."
Turkiye,2013-08-20,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to adjust the short term interest rates as follows: a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) has been kept constant at 4.5 percent, b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing has been kept at 3.5 percent, lending rate has been increased from 7.25 percent to 7.75 percent, and the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions has been kept at 6.75 percent. c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate has been kept at 0 percent while lending rate has been kept at 10.25 percent. Recent data suggest that domestic and external demand developments are in line with expectations. Domestic demand and exports grow at a moderate pace. Gradual improvement in the current account deficit, excluding gold trade, continues. The current policy framework, with the additional support from recent macroprudential policies, will continue to improve the current account balance. The weakness in capital flows that started in May due to heightened uncertainty regarding the global monetary policies continues. The Committee has indicated that these developments along with a more cautious monetary policy stance will bring the credit growth rates gradually to more reasonable levels. Inflation is expected to start falling from August onwards as envisaged. Yet, in order to contain the adverse impact of the above-target inflation indicators on the pricing behavior, the Committee has decided to strengthen the cautious stance of the monetary policy. The cautious stance will be maintained until the inflation outlook is in line with the medium term targets. In this respect, additional monetary tightening will be implemented whenever needed. In order to increase the effectiveness of the additional monetary tightening, the Committee has decided to raise the overnight lending rate from 7.25 percent to 7.75 percent. Due to ongoing uncertainties regarding the global economy and the volatility in capital flows, it is important to maintain the flexibility of the liquidity management. To this end, developments regarding price stability and financial stability will be closely monitored and necessary adjustments will be made in the composition of Turkish lira liquidity provided by the Central Bank. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."

Real economic activity: Assessments of economic activity are that activity net of the effect of natural gas production continues to expand at a rate similar to that of the previous 2 years, as the increase in domestic demand, particularly in private consumption, offsets the decline in exports. The first estimate of the second quarter National Accounts data (annualized data, seasonally adjusted) was impacted by the start of natural gas production: GDP grew by 5.1 percent and business sector product increased by 5.9 percent. Private consumption increased by 6.7 percent, higher than would have been forecast based on purchases brought forward ahead of the VAT increase, and there was a marked increase as well in public expenditure (8.8 percent, excluding defense imports). This was in contrast to declines in exports (a decline of 8.2 percent, excluding diamonds and start-up companies) and in investments (a decline of 2.6 percent). The Composite State of theEconomy Index increased by 0.2 percent in July, and previous data were revised upward. Goods exports excluding diamonds declined by 7.6 percent in July, though manufacturing exports are subject to volatility due to the effect of several large companies on the aggregate figure. Over time, the picture presented by manufacturing exports, similar to developments in global trade, indicates a standstill at the 2011 level. Consumer goods imports increased in recent months and there was a partial correction of the decline in investment goods and raw materials imports. Expectations of future economic activity are consistent with continued moderate growth at a rate similar tothat of the recent period. The Climate Index based on the Business Tendency Survey of the Central Bureau of Statistics moderated in August, with moderation as well in expectations for the coming 3 months. Various Consumer Confidence Indices increased this month, but they continue to indicate relatively low levels of consumer confidence. The labor market: The unemployment rate increased in the second quarter from 6.6 percent to 6.9 percent. Monthly data indicate stability in the unemployment rate from April to June, and the unemployment rate in primary working ages declined during the second quarter from 6.1 percent to 5.9 percent. Labor force survey and employee posts data indicate a standstill in the number of employed persons, but this is with an increase in the number of work hours per employed person. Nominal wages increased by 0.3 percent and real wages increased by 0.15 percent in March-May, based on seasonally adjusted data, compared with December-February. Health tax receipts by the National Insurance Institute, which provide an indication of total wage payments in the economy, were 4.2 percent higher in June-July, on a nominal basis, than in the corresponding two months of the previous year, compared with a 5.7 year over year growth rate measured in the previous two months. Budget data: In January-July, the government's cumulative deficit in domestic activity was about NIS 7 billion (about 0.7 percent of GDP) below the path consistent with the deficit ceiling for 2013. This was the result of a relatively low expenditure level compared with the path in the budget approved by the Knesset on July 30. Tax receipts in recent months were higher than the seasonal path, even net of the impact of purchasesbrought forward ahead of the VAT rate increase and one-time government revenue, which likely indicates improved economic activity. Total revenue for January-July is similar to the seasonal path. The foreign exchange market: From the monetary policy discussion on July 28, 2013, through August 23, 2013, the shekel remained essentially unchanged against the dollar and in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. The shekel weakened by 0.8 percent against the euro. Since the beginning ofthe year, the shekel has appreciated by 5.7 percent in terms of the effective exchange rate. The capital and money markets: From the monetary policy discussion on July 28, 2013, through August 23, 2013, the Tel Aviv 25 Index declined by 2.5 percent. Government bond yields increased along the unindexed curve by up to 50 basis points. Along the CPI-indexed yield curve, yields increased more moderately, by up to 30 basis points. The yield differential between 10-year Israeli government bonds and equivalent 10-year US Treasury securities increased slightly, but remained low at 118 basis points. Makam yields increased along the entire curve by up to 8 basis points, and the one-year yield increased to 1.3 percent during the period. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spread increased by 19 basis points, to 130 basis points. The Tel-Bond 60 Index declined slightly by about 0.3 percent. At the same time, spreads in the corporate bond market remained low. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in July, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 14.6 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 5.2 percent. Developments in the credit markets: The total outstanding debt of the business sector declined by 1.6 percent in June, to NIS 776 billion, primarily as a result of net repayment of bank debt, and the appreciation of the shekel in June. The private nonfinancial sector issued about NIS 1.8 billion in bonds, compared with an average of NIS 2.5 billion since the beginning of the year. A quantitative estimate of business credit, net of exchange rate and linkage effects, indicates that there was no change in the balance ofcredit since the beginning of the year. Household debt increased by 0.8 percent in June, to NIS 397 billion, with an increase of 0.3 percent in households' housing debt, to NIS 279.4 billion. In June, there was about NIS 5 billion in new mortgages granted, compared with a monthly average of 4.4 billion since the beginning of the year. Interest rates on new mortgages increased slightly in July, primarily in the variable-rate CPI-indexed track, while it remained unchanged on other tracks. Against the background of the growth in housing credit volume, and its characteristics, and in order to reduce the risk to mortgage borrowers and to the banking system, the Supervisor of Banks published draft guidelines which limit the share of repayment out of income, the share of the loan which maybe granted at variable rate interest, and the term until final loan repayment. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (based on housing rents) increased by 1 percent in July, following an increase of 0.3 percent in June. In the twelve months ending in July, this component increased by 3.1 percent, similar to the increase over the twelve months ending in June. Home prices, which are published in the Central Bureau of Statistics surveyof home prices but are not included in the CPI, increased by 0.5 percent in May-July, and data for previous months were revised upward. Basedon the updated data, the decline in the annual rate of home price appreciation has halted, and they increased by a rate of 9.3 percent in the twelve months ending in June, compared with an increase of 8.7 percent in the twelve months to May. The number of transactions in the housing market continues to increase. The global economy: The global picture indicates slow improvement in advanced economies, compared with moderation, and in some cases deterioration,in emerging economies. Several indicators published in the US this month point to improvement in the US economy, including a shrinking trade deficit and improved purchasing managers indices. Most housing market indicators continue to show strength. In the eurozone, after six consecutive quarters ofnegative growth, positive growth was recorded, and expectations are for continued improvement in the future. Yet at the same time, the unemployment rate in the eurozone is at record levels, and with regard to financial situation it has been assessed that Greece will need an additional bailout. Someemerging economies suffered capital outflows as a result of assessments that the rate of quantitative easing the US will soon slow. The Reserve Bank of India was forced to increase some interest rates and impose limitations on capital flows, and it announced the beginning of a bond purchase plan. In Brazil, the lack of trust in the government's budget management increased and the projected growth rate was reduced again. In China, despitepublished data which was stronger than expected, there was increased concern about developments in the credit market and the composition of economic growth, which is not based on domestic consumption. Global capital markets operated under the shadow of concerns over the tapering process and there is still uncertainty about when the process will begin, and its strength. Bond yields increased in most economies, even against the background of the improvement in Europe. Oil prices increased by 3 percent this month against the background of the situation in Egypt, and there was a sharp increase aswell in industrial metals prices. With that, inflation threats are not seen in advanced economies. Central banks in all advanced economies did not change their interest rates this month, except for an interest rate reductionin Australia. The President of the ECB reiterated that the eurozone interest rate will remain low for a very long time. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to keep the interest rate for September 2013 unchanged at 1.25 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's interest rate policy, whichis intended to entrench the inflation rate within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel and in the global economy, the monetary policies of major central banks, and developments in the exchange rate of the shekel. The following are the main considerations underlying the decision: Inflation expectations for the coming year,based on various sources, are below the midpoint of the inflation target range. Uncertainty regarding the exact timing of the start of the process, its strength, and its consequences is expected to increase financial market volatility.Home prices, which are published in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of home prices but are not included in the CPI, began to increase again, and previous data were revised upward. Against the background of these considerations, the Monetary Committee was of the opinion that the current interest rate level is in line with economic conditions, and decided to keep the interest rate unchanged this month. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets, particularly in light of the continuing uncertainty in the global economy. The Bank will use the tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragementof employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decision for September 2013 will be published on September 9, 2013. The decision regarding the interest rate for October 2013 will be published at 15:00 on Monday. September 23, 2013. To view this press release as a Worddocument. Monetary Committee decides to return to monthly interest rate discussions. This past February, the Bank of Israel's Monetary Committee announced that it had resolved not to make decisions on the interest rate around the Passover and Tabernacles (Sukkot) holidays. This is because due to the Passover holiday and the New Year holiday season data are received with a lag, are irregular and activity levels are low due to the holidays. In accordance with the Committee's announcement in February, the interest rate set today was to be in effect for the months of September and October. Against the background of the experience accumulated since then, and of the uncertainty in global markets, the Committee found it prudent to re-examine monetary policy at the end of September on a scheduled basis.Likewise, the Committee was of the opinion that under current circumstances, it is optimal to maintain the flexibility that comes with monthly monetary discussions on interest rate decisions, and resolved to return to a format of reaching interest rate decisions 12 times per year. Background conditions. Inflation data:Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Private forecasters' inflation expectations for the next 12 CPI readings increased slightly, on average, to 1.9 percent. The main considerations behind the decision. The decision to keep the interest rate for September 2013 unchanged at 1.25 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's interest rate policy, whichis intended to entrench the inflation rate within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The following are the main considerations underlying the decision:. The Bank will use the tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragementof employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decision for September 2013 will be published on September 9, 2013."
Hungary,2013-08-27,"At its meeting on 27 August 2013, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by 20 basis points from 4.00% to 3.80%, with effect from 28 August 2013. In the Council's judgement. Hungarian economic growth is likely to recover gradually this year; however, the level of output remains below its potential and unemployment exceeds its long-term level determined by structural factors. The Council expects weak demand conditions to persist, which ensures that inflationary pressures in the economy remain muted in the medium term. Data for July indicate that inflation remained at historically low levels. Although temporary factors have also contributed to the decline in inflation, the persistently low rate of underlying inflation measures reflects the strong downward pressure of weak domestic demand on prices. Low wage dynamics suggest that companies are adjusting to higher production costs mainly through labour costs, rather than through consumer prices, and therefore, the pass-through into consumer prices is likely to be moderate. In the Council's judgement, these factors indicate that there is no significant inflationary pressure in the Hungarian economy and that risks to inflation could remain moderate over the medium term, which in turn will help anchor inflation expectations. In the current environment, monetary policy can contribute to meeting the inflation target over the medium term by maintaining accommodative monetary conditions. The Hungarian economy has recovered from recession this year. The improvement in domestic demand is likely to be slow and gradual, due to ongoing deleveraging and cautious behaviour by households, while activity in external markets, mainly in developed economies, is showing signs of a revival. However, there is uncertainty about future developments in external demand, caused by the slowdown in growth in emerging regions of the world. A sustained pick-up in growth is likely to occur from the end of the year as demand in Hungary's export markets improves. Perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy have increased slightly in the uncertain global financial environment. In the Monetary Council's assessment, higher volatility in sentiment in global financial markets continues to pose a risk, which in turn calls for maintaining a cautious approach to policy. In the Council's judgement, the Hungarian economy is characterised by significant unused capacity, and inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate over the medium term. Incoming data continue to suggest that weak demand has exerted a strong disinflationary impact, and, as a result, companies have limited ability to pass on higher production costs into prices. Consequently, a more accommodative monetary policy stance would ensure that the 3% inflation target is achieved over the medium term. After some temporary stabilisation, global financial markets have become more volatile again. A sustained and marked shift in perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy may influence the room for manoeuvre in monetary policy. In the Council's judgement, incoming data on inflation and the real economy give scope to ease monetary conditions further. However, in light of the significant reduction in interest rates so far and taking into account developments in perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy, a slower pace of policy easing is warranted."
Poland,2013-09-04,"Warsaw, 4 September 2013 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 3-4 September 2013 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged:  reference rate 2.50% on an annual basis;  lombard rate 4.00% on an annual basis;  deposit rate 1.00% on an annual basis;  rediscount rate 2.75% on an annual basis. In 2013 Q2 global economic activity growth was somewhat higher than in Q1, yet, persisted at a moderate level. GDP growth in the United States accelerated and  after a few quarters of decline  GDP in the euro area increased. The incoming data on the economic situation at the beginning of Q3 point to continued gradual recovery in the major developed economies. Major emerging economies in turn saw persistently low  as for those countries  economic activity growth. Moderate global economic activity growth is conducive to low inflation in many countries. Signals of a probable reduction in the scale of monetary expansion by the Federal Reserve, observed in the financial markets, contributed to heightened volatility and the outflow of capital from many emerging economies as well as depreciation of their currencies. Yet, zloty exchange rate remained relatively stable. In Poland, in 2013 Q2 economic growth, after a period of strong slowdown, slightly accelerated. Yet. GDP growth remained considerably below its potential. GDP growth was supported by substantial contribution of net exports, which was accompanied by further decline in domestic demand. In 2013 Q2 private consumption increased slightly, while decrease in investment was larger than in the previous quarter. Data on industrial production, construction output and retail sales in July point to the possibility of gradual improvement in business conditions at the beginning of 2013 Q3. In 2013 Q2 the number of working persons in the economy was lower than in the corresponding period of last year. Still, month-on-month data from the corporate sector point to a possible halt of job losses in the recent months. The seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate stabilized at a heightened level, which supported low wage growth. Growth in lending to the private sector remained limited in the recent period. Annual growth in corporate loans declined further. At the same time, growth in household loans continued at a low level, however, growth in consumer loans increased slightly. CPI inflation in July increased and reached 1.1% y/y, yet remaining markedly below the NBP inflation target (2.5%). The increase in inflation was driven by regulatory factors (i.e. higher waste disposal fees), which also pushed up core inflation, as well as higher 1/2 growth in the prices of vegetables and fuels. Demand and cost pressures in the economy remained low and inflation expectations of households continued to decline. In the opinion of the Council, gradual economic recovery is likely to continue in the coming quarters, however, inflationary pressure will remain subdued. The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged. Given low inflation pressure and a moderate scale of the expected recovery, in the Council's assessment interest rates should be kept unchanged at least until the end of 2013, which will support return of inflation to the target in the medium term. The Council adopted Monetary Policy Guidelines for 2014."
Euroarea,2013-09-05,"Ladies and gentlemen. I am very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. I will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Incoming information and analysis have further underpinned our previous assessment. Underlying price pressures in the euro area are expected to remain subdued over the medium term. In keeping with this picture, monetary and, in particular, credit dynamics remain subdued. Inflation expectations for the euro area continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. At the same time, real GDP growth in the second quarter was positive, after six quarters of negative output growth, and confidence indicators up to August confirm the expected gradual improvement in economic activity from low levels. Our monetary policy stance continues to be geared towards maintaining the degree of monetary accommodation warranted by the outlook for price stability and promoting stable money market conditions. It thereby provides support to a gradual recovery in economic activity. Looking ahead, our monetary policy stance will remain accommodative for as long as necessary, in line with the forward guidance provided in July. The Governing Council confirms that it expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. This expectation continues to be based on an unchanged overall subdued outlook for inflation extending into the medium term, given the broad-based weakness in the economy and subdued monetary dynamics. In the period ahead, we will monitor all incoming information on economic and monetary developments and assess any impact on the medium-term outlook for price stability. With regard to money market conditions, these have also been influenced by a gradual reduction in excess liquidity. Repayments of funds taken up in the context of the three-year longer-term refinancing operations reflect improvements in financial market confidence, some reduction in financial market fragmentation and the ongoing deleveraging by euro area banks. We will remain particularly attentive to the implications that these developments may have for the stance of monetary policy. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Following six quarters of negative output growth, euro area real GDP rose, quarter on quarter, by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2013. This increase is partly explained by transitory effects related to weather conditions in the first half of this year. Since then, survey-based confidence indicators up to August have improved further from low levels, overall confirming our previous expectations of a gradual recovery in economic activity. Looking ahead to the remainder of the year and to 2014, in line with our baseline scenario, output is expected to recover at a slow pace, in particular owing to a gradual improvement in domestic demand supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance. Euro area economic activity should, in addition, benefit from a gradual strengthening of external demand for exports. Furthermore, the overall improvements in financial markets seen since last summer appear to be gradually working their way through to the real economy, as should the progress made in fiscal consolidation. In addition, real incomes have benefited recently from generally lower inflation. This being said, unemployment in the euro area remains high, and the necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors will continue to weigh on economic activity. This assessment is also reflected in the September 2013 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real GDP declining by 0.4% in 2013 and increasing by 1.0% in 2014. Compared with the June 2013 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the projection for 2013 has been revised upwards by 0.2 percentage point, largely reflecting incoming data. For 2014 there has been a downward revision of 0.1 percentage point. The risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside. Recent developments in global money and financial market conditions and related uncertainties may have the potential to negatively affect economic conditions. Other downside risks include higher commodity prices in the context of renewed geopolitical tensions, weaker than expected global demand and slow or insufficient implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, as expected, euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.3% in August 2013, down from 1.6% in June and July. On the basis of current assumptions for energy and exchange rate developments, annual inflation rates are expected to remain low in the coming months, owing in particular to energy price developments. Taking the appropriate medium-term perspective, underlying price pressures are expected to remain subdued, reflecting the broad-based weakness in aggregate demand and the modest pace of the recovery. Medium to long-term inflation expectations continue to be firmly anchored in line with price stability. This assessment is also reflected in the September 2013 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual HICP inflation at 1.5% in 2013 and 1.3% in 2014. In comparison with the June 2013 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, the projection for inflation for 2013 has been revised upwards by 0.1 percentage point, while the projection for 2014 remains unchanged. The risks to the outlook for price developments are expected to be still broadly balanced over the medium term, with upside risks relating in particular to higher commodity prices as well as stronger than expected increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, and downside risks stemming from weaker than expected economic activity. Turning to the monetary analysis, data for July confirm that underlying broad money (M3) and, in particular, credit growth remained subdued. Annual growth in M3 decreased further in July to 2.2%, from 2.4% in June. Annual growth in M1 remained strong but decreased to 7.1% in July, from 7.5% in June. M3 growth continued to be mainly supported by net capital inflows into the euro area, while the annual rate of change of loans to the private sector weakened further. The annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) remained at 0.3% in July, broadly unchanged since the turn of the year. The annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was -2.8% in July, compared with -2.3% in June. Weak loan dynamics continue to reflect primarily the current stage of the business cycle, heightened credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. Since the summer of 2012 substantial progress has been made in improving the funding situation of banks and, in particular, in strengthening the domestic deposit base in a number of stressed countries. In order to ensure an adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions in euro area countries, it is essential that the fragmentation of euro area credit markets declines further and that the resilience of banks is strengthened where needed. Further decisive steps to establish a banking union will help to accomplish this objective. To sum up, the economic analysis indicates that price developments should remain in line with price stability over the medium term. A cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. In order to further reduce imbalances and to foster competitiveness, growth and job creation, euro area countries need to continue with their reform agenda. As regards fiscal policies, governments should not unravel their efforts to reduce deficits and put debt ratios on a downward path. The composition of fiscal consolidation should be geared towards growth-friendly measures which have a medium-term perspective and combine improving the quality and efficiency of public services with minimising distortionary effects of taxation. In terms of economic policies, product market reforms to increase competitiveness will facilitate the creation of new businesses, support the tradable goods sector and foster job creation, while high unemployment rates require decisive structural reforms to reduce rigidities in labour markets and to increase labour demand."
Malaysia,2013-09-05,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.00 percent. The global economy continues to experience modest growth. The strength of the recovery in the major advanced economies has yet to gain momentum. While domestic demand continues to support growth in emerging market economies, the growth momentum has moderated. Although global monetary conditions remain highly accommodative, market uncertainties on the direction of policy have resulted in substantial volatility in global financial markets. The reversal of capital flows from the emerging economies following a prolonged period of strong inflows has resulted in the depreciation of emerging market currencies. In the Malaysian economy, domestic demand has continued to support growth amid the weaknesses in external demand. Going forward, economic growth is expected to be underpinned by the continued expansion in domestic activity. Sustained income growth and stable labour market conditions will support private consumption. The impact of subsidy adjustments on consumption spending is expected to be contained by targeted financial assistance. Domestic investment activity which has been robust will continue to be led by capital spending in the domestic-oriented industries and the ongoing implementation of infrastructure projects. Overall growth prospects, however, could be affected by risks in the global economy and international financial markets. Inflation remained low at 1.7% in the first seven months of the year. Going forward, inflation is expected to increase in the remainder of the year and into 2014 resulting from domestic cost factors, including subsidy adjustments. The increase in inflation, however, is from a low level and will be mitigated by a stable external price environment, expansion in domestic capacity and moderate domestic demand pressures. In the MPC's assessment, there are increased uncertainties to the balance of risks surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation. The MPC will continue to carefully assess the global and domestic economic and financial developments and their implications on the overall outlook for inflation and growth of the Malaysian economy. Bank Negara Malaysia 05 September 2013."
Philippines,2013-09-11,"Statement by BSP Governor Amando M Tetangco. Jr. At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to keep the BSP's key policy rates at3.50 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 5.50 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs, and special deposit accounts (SDAs) were also left unchanged. The reserve requirement ratios were kept steady as well. The Monetary Board's decision is based on its assessment of a benign inflation environment. Latest baseline forecasts indicate that the future inflation path continues to be broadly in line with the target range of 4.0±1.0 percent in 2013-2014 and 3.0±1.0 percent for 2015, while inflation expectations remain firmly anchored. Domestic economic activity has also been growing at a solid pace, supported by firm demand and buoyant business sentiment. Steady policy settings will also allow policymakers to better assess evolving economic risks, given the current volatilities in global financial markets. At the same time, the Monetary Board noted that the balance of risks to the inflation outlook has shifted slightly toward the upside as oil prices have become more volatile amid ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Meanwhile, world economic prospects are seen to stay broadly subdued, thus tempering pressures on global commodity prices. The robust growth of lending to the productive sectors of the economy should also support the improvement in the economy's absorptive capacity and help moderate price pressures. As expected, the BSP's operational adjustment of its SDA facility has also contributed to the rise in domestic liquidity (M3) growth in July. As M3 growth rates are expected to decline once these adjustments have been completed, a temporary period of strong M3 growth is not expected to lead to significant inflationary pressures. Going forward, the BSP will continue to pay close attention to the outlook for prices and economic activity to ensure that monetary policy continues to safeguard non-inflationary economic growth."
Chile,2013-09-12,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 12 September 2013 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 5% (annual). International financial conditions show no significant changes from last month, but high volatility remains relating to the expectation of a partial withdrawal of the monetary stimulus in the United States and financial vulnerabilities in some emerging economies and peripheral European countries. Incoming information is consistent with the gradual recovery outlook for the U.S., while various Chinese indicators suggest that its slowdown has ceased in recent months. Commodity prices showed no clear trend in international markets, although the high variability of the oil price facing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East is worth mentioning. Domestically, recent output and demand figures continue along the lines of previous months: moderate growth in output and strong private consumption. Headline inflation is still within the tolerance range, while core measures continue to hover around 1% annually. Inflation expectations have remained near the target in the policy horizon. The consolidation of the trends outlined in the last Monetary Policy Report could call for adjustments to the monetary policy interest rate in the coming months. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. * The Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2013-09-12,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information, the Committee considers that the moderate economic recovery in the US has been sustained and that economic activities in the euro area appear to be emerging from their sluggishness to some degree, but that trends of economic growth in emerging market countries have differed from country to country. The Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward, helped primarily by improvements in the US economy, but judges that the uncertainties surrounding the scale of QE tapering by the US Federal Reserve and the implementations of fiscal consolidation in major countries, the financial instability in some emerging economies, and the geopolitical risk in the Middle East remain as downside risks to growth. In Korea, the Committee appraises the moderate economic growth to be continuing, with exports and consumption improving. On the employment front, the scale of increase in the number of persons employed has expanded in line with increases in the 50-and-above age group and the service sector. The Committee expects that the domestic economy will maintain a negative output gap for a considerable time going forward, although it forecasts that the gap will gradually narrow. Consumer price inflation declined slightly to 1.3% in August, from 1.4% the previous month, and core inflation excluding the prices of 1 agricultural and petroleum products also fell slightly to 1.3% from 1.5%. The Committee forecasts that inflation will remain low for the time being despite an increase in international oil prices, owing primarily to the inflation reducing effects of policies such as free childcare provision and to the downward stabilization of international agricultural prices. As for the housing market, sales prices in Seoul and its surrounding areas maintained their downtrend while the uptrend of those in the rest of the country slowed. The increase in leasehold-deposit prices in Seoul and its surrounding areas meanwhile accelerated, and the uptrend in these prices in the rest of the country continued. In the domestic financial markets, despite the heightened volatility in the international financial markets and the instabilities in the financial and foreign exchange markets of some emerging economies, stock prices have risen and the Korean won has appreciated, due mainly to the net inflows of foreigners' stock investment funds. Long-term market interest rates have fluctuated within a relatively narrow range. Looking ahead, while paying close attention to developments in and the influences of external risk factors, and monitoring the effects of the Base Rate cut and of the government's economic policies including the supplementary budget, the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as to keep consumer price inflation within the inflation target range over a medium-term horizon while ensuring that the growth potential is not eroded due to the continuation of slow growth."
Russia,2013-09-13,"The Bank of Russia External and Public Relations Department informs that on 13 September 2013 the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to implement a set of measures aimed at developing the system of monetary policy instruments as part of transition to inflation targeting. These measures include:. 1) introduction of Bank of Russia key rate by the unification of interest rates on one-week liquidity provision and absorption open market operations;. 2) formation of Bank of Russia interest rate corridor and optimisation of instruments for managing banking sector liquidity;. 3) change of refinancing rate role in the system of Bank of Russia instruments. These changes will increase monetary policy transparency and improve its understanding by economic agents which contribute to strengthening the interest rate and information channels of the monetary policy transmission mechanism and achieving the price stability — the ultimate goal of monetary policy. Bank of Russia interest rate corridor. The Bank of Russia Board of Directors' decision to set maximum interest rate on one-week deposit auctions equal to the minimum interest rate on one-week liquidity provision open market operations, and to cut interest rate on the overnight loans and loans, secured by non-marketable assets and guarantees, to the level of interest rate on one-day liquidity provision standing facilities (6.50 percentage per annum as at 13 September 2013) completes the forming of Bank of Russia interest rate corridor with the key rate as its main element. The Bank of Russia declares the interest rate on Bank of Russia one-week liquidity provision and absorption open market operations (5.50 percentage per annum as at 13 September 2013) to be Bank of Russia key rate. The Bank of Russia will use the key rate as the main indicator of the monetary policy stance. This will facilitate a better understanding of monetary policy decisions by economic agents. By 1 January 2016, the Bank of Russia is going to make the refinancing rate equal to the key rate. Before that, the refinancing rate will play a minor role. The interest rates on Bank of Russia one-day liquidity provision and absorption standing facilities form upper (6.50 percentage per annum as at 13 September 2013) and lower (4.50 percentage per annum as at 13 September 2013) borders of the interest rate corridor, respectively, which are symmetric relatively to the key rate. The change in the level of Bank of Russia key rate will lead to the automatic shift of the corridor borders by the same amount. The Bank of Russia determined the width of the interest rate corridor equal to 2 percentage points. This width is considered as optimal for limiting money market interest rates volatility while providing incentives for interbank market activity. Bank of Russia system of interest rate instruments and measures aimed at its development. In its further transition to inflation targeting in 2014, the Bank of Russia will continue to develop interest rate policy framework based on the interest rate corridor, with the focus on decreasing the number of instruments and eliminating their duplication. Bank of Russia one-week open market operations will remain the main instrument for managing banking sector liquidity. In order to create scope for the increase in the interbank market activity and development of credit institutions' liquidity management, starting 1 February 2014 the Bank of Russia stops conducting one-day REPO auctions on a daily basis and starts using one- to six-day REPO auctions as fine-tuning operations. In case of sharp changes in the level of banking sector liquidity caused by autonomous factors or changes in the demand of credit institutions for liquidity the Bank of Russia will promptly take decision on conducting these auctions. Standing facility liquidity provision operations will be conducted for one day only and collateralised by different types of assets (securities, credit claims, promissory notes, guarantees, gold, foreign currency). The single interest rate on these instruments will form the upper border of Bank of Russia interest rate corridor. Starting 1 February 2014, the Bank of Russia will suspend all standing facilities for terms exceeding 1 day. Starting 1 February 2014, the Bank of Russia will also suspend the following regular open market liquidity provision operations: lombard loans for all terms and three- to 12-month REPO auctions. In addition to the main open market and standing facility liquidity management operations the Bank of Russia will conduct auctions for the provision of three-month loans, secured by non-marketable assets, with floating interest rate on a regular basis. The floating component of the interest rate on credit auctions is linked to the level of Bank of Russia key rate. The minimum spread to the key rate will be set by the decision of the Bank of Russia Board of Directors (currently set at 0.25 percentage points). (Information “On auctions for the provision of loans, secured by non-marketable assets, with floating interest rate”). The use of this instrument by credit institutions will help decrease market collateral for main refinancing operations, held by the Bank of Russia, thereby improving the interbank market efficiency. The conduct of operations with floating rate will intensify the monetary policy signal, as the changes in interest rates will be transformed into the change of the cost of funds, previously provided by the Bank of Russia to credit institutions.

Peru,2013-09-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR SEPTEMBER 2013 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 4.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference rate at 4.25 percent. This decision is based on that economic growth in the country is close to the economy's potential level of growth, inflation expectations remain anchored within the target range, the rate of inflation has been affected by temporary factors on the side of supply, and international financial conditions are still uncertain, even though some positive signals have been observed in the developed economies. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants to consider future adjustments in monetary policy instruments. Inflation in August showed a rate of 0.54 percent due mainly to the rise in the prices of perishable food products and electricity. Inflation in the last 12 months rose from 3.24 percent in July to 3.28 percent in August. The rate of inflation without food and energy was 0.14 percent (2.46 percent in the last 12 months) and core inflation showed a rate of 0.31 percent (3.56 percent in the last 12 months). Inflation is expected to return to the target range in the third quarter as a result of an improvement in food supply conditions and of inflation expectations anchored to the target range. Current and advanced indicators of activity show that the growth of the Peruvian economy is close to its long-term sustainable level of growth and the indicators associated with the external market have shown a slight recovery, which has had a favorable impact on the prices of export products. The Board has been adopting measures aimed at making the reserve requirements regime more flexible in order to promote a more orderly evolution of credit as well as the dedollarization of credit. In September the mean maximum rate of reserve requirements in domestic currency was lowered from 19 to 17 percent and the marginal rate of reserve requirements in this currency was lowered from 25 to 20 percent. These measures have allowed to release immediately funds in domestic currency amounting to a total of 2 billion. Should it be necessary, the Board will adopt additional measures to make the regime of required reserves more flexible. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as described below: Overnight deposits: 3.45 percent. Direct repo and rediscount operations: 5.05 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.05 percent. The Monetary Program for October will be approved on the Board's meeting of October 10."
Turkiye,2013-09-17,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels: a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) at 4.5 percent, b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 3.5 percent, lending rate at 7.75 percent, and the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 6.75 percent. c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, lending rate at 10.25 percent. Recent data suggest that final domestic demand and exports continue to grow at a moderate pace. The current policy framework is improving the current account balance. The weakness in capital flows, cautious monetary policy stance and the macroprudential measures undertaken will gradually bring down the loan growth rates to more reasonable levels. Accordingly, gradual decline in the current account deficit excluding gold trade is expected to continue. Inflation is expected to fall further in the forthcoming period. However, core inflation indicators are likely to hover above the inflation target for some time due to the exchange rate volatility observed during the recent months. The impact of these developments on the pricing behavior is closely monitored. The Committee will maintain the cautious monetary policy stance and implement additional monetary tightening at the appropriate frequency until the medium term inflation outlook is in line with the medium term targets. Developments regarding price stability and financial stability will be closely monitored and necessary adjustments will continue to be made in the composition of Turkish lira liquidity provided by the Central Bank. Meanwhile, in order to contain the repercussions of uncertainties in global monetary policies on the domestic economy, increasing the predictability of the Turkish lira liquidity policy is deemed important. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
United States,2013-09-18,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in July suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace. Some indicators of labor market conditions have shown further improvement in recent months, but the unemployment rate remains elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector has been strengthening, but mortgage rates have risen further and fiscal policy is restraining economic growth. Apart from fluctuations due to changes in energy prices, inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will pick up from its recent pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee sees the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished, on net, since last fall, but the tightening of financial conditions observed in recent months, if sustained, could slow the pace of improvement in the economy and labor market. The Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, but it anticipates that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term. Taking into account the extent of federal fiscal retrenchment, the Committee sees the improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions since it began its asset purchase program a year ago as consistent with growing underlying strength in the broader economy. However, the Committee decided to await more evidence that progress will be sustained before adjusting the pace of its purchases. Accordingly, the Committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability. In judging when to moderate the pace of asset purchases, the Committee will, at its coming meetings, assess whether incoming information continues to support the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective. Asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee's economic outlook as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens. In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; James Bullard; Charles L Evans; Jerome H Powell; Eric S Rosengren; Jeremy C Stein; Daniel K Tarullo; and Janet L Yellen. Voting against the action was Esther L George, who was concerned that the continued high level of monetary accommodation increased the risks of future economic and financial imbalances and, over time, could cause an increase in long-term inflation expectations."
Egypt,2013-09-19,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release September 19, 2013 In its meeting held on September 19, 2013, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation by 50 basis points to 875 percent, 975 percent, and 925 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also cut by 50 basis points to 925 percen. Headline CPI inched up by 068 percent (m/m) in August compared to an increase of 086 percent in Jul. The annual rate declined to 975 percent from 1028 percent in July due to a favorable base effec. On the other hand, core CPI inched up by 014 percent (m/m) in August after increasing by 104 percent in July, bringing the annual rate to 897 percent from 906 percent recorded in the previous mont. The latest monthly developments in both headline and core inflation were largely driven by increases in several food price. Upside risks to the inflation outlook have moderated as the possibility of a rebound in international food prices is unlikely in light of recent global development. Meanwhile real GDP grew by 23 percent in the first nine months of 2012/2013, following a similarly feeble growth rate of 22 percent in 2011/201. This nascent recovery in economic activity came on the back of tentative signs of recovery in the construction and tourism sector. Nonetheless GDP growth remains to be partly suppressed by continuing weaknesses, albeit of lesser extent, in the manufacturing secto. Nonetheless GDP growth remains to be partly suppressed by continuing weaknesses, albeit of lesser extent, in the manufacturing secto. In the meantime, investment levels remained low given the heightened uncertainty that faced market participants since early 2011 and the weak credit growth to the private secto. Moreover downside risks continue to surround the global recovery on the back of challenges facing the Euro Area and the softening growth in emerging market. These factors pose downside risks to domestic GDP going forwar. The pronounced downside risks to domestic GDP combined with the persistently negative output gap since 2011 will limit upside risks to the inflation outlook going forwar. Given that the downside risks to the GDP outlook still outweigh the upside risks to the inflation outlook, the MPC decided to further cut the key CBE rate. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium‐ter. Dr Rania Al‐Mashat Sub Governor.

South Africa,2013-09-19,"South African Reserve Bank PRESS STATEMENT EMBARGO DELIVERY 19 September 2013 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Gill Marcus. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), domestic inflation has breached the upper end of the target range. This development was in line with our forecast and we continue to expect inflation to moderate somewhat in the final quarter of this year. While the outlook for the domestic economic growth environment remains unchanged, it has been overshadowed by protracted work stoppages. Where wage agreements have been reached, these have generally been above the headline inflation rate, contributing to the upside risk to the inflation outlook. During this period, global financial markets have been dominated by continued speculation about the speed and timing of tapering of quantitative easing by the. During this period, global financial markets have been dominated by continued speculation about the speed and timing of tapering of quantitative easing by the 2 US Fed. The uncertainty related to this event resulted in a high degree of volatility and weakening in a number of emerging market economies foreign exchange and bond markets since May. The decision by the Fed to delay tapering surprised the markets, and emerging market currencies in particular responded strongly with many seeing significant overnight currency appreciation. The Fed emphasised the data dependent nature of its decision, indicating that this respite could prove to be temporary, as speculation regarding the timing of future tapering is likely to continue whenever positive data emerges from the US. The year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas increased to 6,3 per cent in July and 6,4 per cent in August. Food and non-alcoholic beverages inflation measured 7,1 per cent in August, up from 6,8 per cent in July, while petrol prices increased at a year-on-year rate of 23 per cent. Core inflation, which excludes food, petrol and electricity, measured 5,1 per cent, down from 5,2 per cent in July, while administered prices excluding petrol moderated to 7,0 per cent. The headline producer price inflation for final manufactured goods accelerated to 6,6 per cent in July, up from 5,9 per cent in June. The inflation forecast of the Bank has deteriorated further since the previous meeting of the MPC. The forecast for 2013 is unchanged at an average of 5,9 per cent, but inflation is now expected to average 5,8 per cent in 2014 compared with 5,5 per cent in the previous forecast. The forecast for 2015 has been raised from. The forecast for 2015 has been raised from 3 5,2 per cent to 5,4 per cent, and inflation is expected to average 5,3 per cent in the final two quarters of that year. The current breach of the inflation target is still expected to be temporary, and the peak was possibly reached in August. The deterioration in the forecast is mainly due to changes in assumptions related to the exchange rate of the rand and petrol prices, but given the overnight developments these assumptions will be revisited on an ongoing basis. The forecast for core inflation for 2013 is 0,1 percentage point lower, at an average of 5,2 per cent. This measure is then expected to average 5,4 per cent and 5,3 per cent in the coming two years, compared with the previous forecasts of 5,2 per cent and 5,0 per cent respectively, and to measure 5,1 per cent in the final quarter of 2015. This upward drift of underlying inflation is due to the lagged effects of the depreciation of the rand exchange rate and the impact of higher unit labour costs. Inflation expectations, as measured in the survey conducted in the third quarter of 2013 by the Bureau for Economic Research, have remained stable around the upper end of the target range. It is of concern to the MPC that inflation is expected to average 6,0 per cent in 2013 and 6,2 per cent and 6,1 per cent in the subsequent two years respectively. Business respondents expect inflation to average 6,4 per cent in both 2014 and 2015, slightly lower than in the previous forecast, while expectations of trade unionists are unchanged from the previous survey, at 6,2 per cent and 6,3 per cent for these respective years. The 4 expectations of economic analysts have deteriorated slightly since the previous survey but still expect inflation to average below 6,0 per cent over the period, and to average 5,8 per cent and 5,5 per cent in 2014 and 2015 respectively. Global economic prospects have improved in a number of the advanced economies, but downside risks remain. Growth in the US appears to be gradually improving, despite fiscal headwinds, and most forecasts are for growth in excess of 2,5 per cent in 2014. There are, however, a number of downside risks to the outlook which were also highlighted by the Fed. Financial conditions have tightened since the initial tapering announcement, and there are fears that the significantly higher mortgage rates and the observed downturn in mortgage applications could derail the nascent recovery in the housing market, posing a risk to household consumption expenditure. Fiscal policy is also seen as a source of downside risk, with the debt ceiling issue expected to resurface in mid- October. Failure to find resolution could result in further unplanned fiscal expenditure cuts. The Eurozone emerged from its protracted recession in the second quarter of 2013 led by Germany, but economic growth is expected to remain weak and below trend for some time. This negative outlook is compounded by fragile political environments in a number of countries, including uncertainty regarding the ability of some of the peripheral countries to meet the conditions of their bail- out clauses amid stringent fiscal consolidation measures and deteriorating debt. This negative outlook is compounded by fragile political environments in a number of countries, including uncertainty regarding the ability of some of the peripheral countries to meet the conditions of their bail- out clauses amid stringent fiscal consolidation measures and deteriorating debt 5 dynamics, and slow progress towards a banking union. The Japanese economy appears to be responding to the stimulus packages and the weaker yen, but it is still too early to assess the sustainability of the recovery. Fears of a marked slowdown in China have abated somewhat following strong growth in industrial production in August, amidst easing liquidity and bank lending conditions. While there are some concerns that the recent improvement is based on an unsustainable credit boom, growth in excess of 7 per cent in 2014 is generally expected. The expectation of an end to US quantitative easing prompted a sell-off of emerging market assets, which has the risk of further undermining the weaker growth outlook that has been apparent for some time. While financial markets in these countries have reacted positively to the Fed's decision not to begin tapering at this stage, the underlying weaknesses are expected to persist. Monetary policy in the advanced economies remains highly accommodative, and forward guidance suggests that low policy rates will be maintained for some time. Inflation in the advanced economies remains very low but there is speculation that a faster-than-expected decline in the US unemployment rate could prompt an earlier start to normalisation of monetary policy in the US. Some emerging markets, notably Brazil. Indonesia. Turkey and India have either tightened monetary policy in response to currency depreciation, implemented a range of. Some emerging markets, notably Brazil. Indonesia. Turkey and India have either tightened monetary policy in response to currency depreciation, implemented a range of 6 direct controls on capital flows or engaged in direct intervention in the foreign exchange markets. The exchange rate of the rand has been highly volatile since the previous meeting of the MPC, against the backdrop of a widening current account deficit, domestic labour disputes, and the reversal of capital flows to emerging market economies. The rand's strong co-movement with other emerging market currencies suggests that external factors predominated over this period. Since the previous MPC meeting, the rand has fluctuated in a range between around R9,55 and R10,50 against the US dollar and appreciated by 2,3 per cent against the dollar, but is more or less unchanged on a trade weighted basis. The uncertainties related to possible changes in US monetary policy have been reflected in the volatile non-resident activity in the domestic bond and equity markets. Following net sales of domestic bonds to the value of R17,9 bn between May and August in reaction to the Fed tapering announcement, non-residents have been net purchasers of bonds in September to the value of R9,3 bn, bringing the cumulative total since the beginning of the year to R14,9 bn. Non- resident appetite for domestic equities has remained strong following net sales in 2011 and 2012, with year-to-date net purchases of R28,3 bn. The risks to the inflation outlook from the exchange rate remain elevated and dependent on its future trend. A sustained depreciation trend could pose a. A sustained depreciation trend could pose a 7 significant risk to the inflation outcome. While there are some signs of generalised price pressures evident in the producer price index, to date the pass- through to consumer price inflation has been relatively muted, given the weak pricing power in the current low growth environment. The rand is expected to remain sensitive to global sentiment as well as to the current account deficit, which widened to 6,5 per cent of GDP in the second quarter of 2013. The deficit is expected to narrow in the coming months in response to the depreciated currency. However, this response is expected to be slow, given the import-intensive nature of capital expenditure by the state-owned enterprises in particular. Furthermore, export revenues are hampered by weak external demand, strike activity in the mining and motor vehicles sectors in particular, and declining terms of trade. The stepping up of exports is critical to address the current account deficit. While the rand has appreciated significantly in the last few days, the experience of the past few months is indicative of its vulnerability to future changes in US monetary policy. The domestic growth outlook is unchanged since the previous MPC meeting. The real GDP growth rate of 3,0 per cent recorded in the second quarter of 2013 was driven mainly by a recovery in the manufacturing sector, following the marked contraction in the first quarter. Despite the rebound, growth was below the estimated potential of around 3,5 per cent and the negative output gap widened further. The Bank's forecast of GDP growth is unchanged: we still expect growth. The Bank's forecast of GDP growth is unchanged: we still expect growth 8 to average 2,0 per cent in 2013, and 3,3 per cent and 3,6 per cent in the next two years respectively. The composite leading business cycle indicator of the Bank declined slightly in June, continuing its broadly sideways movement, confirming the subdued growth outlook. Business sentiment remains weak: the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index declined from 48 index points in the second quarter to 42 index points in the third quarter. There are, however, tentative signs of improvement in the manufacturing sector. The Kagiso PMI increased to its highest level in 6 years, and in July the physical volume of manufacturing production increased by 3,5 per cent on a month-to- month basis, and 5,4 per cent year-on-year. Capacity utilisation also increased marginally in the second quarter of 2013 to 81,3 per cent. Despite these positive trends, manufacturing output is expected to be adversely affected by protracted strikes, particularly in the motor vehicle sector. Mining output, which contracted in the second quarter, is expected to contribute positively to growth in the third quarter, following strong increases in production in July and a relatively quick resolution of the strikes in the gold mining sector. Growth in real gross fixed capital formation remains relatively weak, at an annualised rate of 2,7 per cent in the second quarter of 2013. A positive feature is the acceleration in the growth of private sector fixed investment expenditure to 4,4 per cent, which more than offset the decline in outlays by the public corporations, mainly due to unplanned construction delays. Gross fixed capital 9 formation as a percentage of GDP increased marginally to 19,5 per cent in the second quarter, still well below the levels of around 24 per cent reached in 2008 and the National Development Plan target of 30 per cent by 2030. Employment trends remain extremely subdued, consistent with the slow pace of economic growth. According to the Quarterly Employment Statistics (QES) of Stats SA, formal non-agricultural employment increased by a mere 7,000 employees or 0,1 per cent between the quarters ended June 2012 and June 2013. Of great concern is the loss of jobs in the tradeable sectors of the economy. Over this period there was a loss of 23,000 employees in the mining sector and a total of 7,000 in the manufacturing and construction sectors, while there was an increase of 26,000 employees in the community, social and personal services industry. Growth in final consumption expenditure by households has been on a declining trend since the first quarter of 2012, but may have bottomed out, having increased from 2,3 per cent in the first quarter to 2,5 per cent in the second quarter. There was a notable increase in the consumption of durable goods, which could include pre-emptive buying ahead of possible exchange rate-induced price increases, as reflected in the sharp decline in new vehicle sales in August. The moderate trend in consumer demand is also reflected in the 2,8 per cent year-to-year increase in retail trade sales in July, and the month-on-month decline of 0,5 per cent. 10 The FNB/BER Consumer confidence index increased significantly in the third quarter and expenditure is expected to be positively affected by high wage settlements and positive wealth effects. Nevertheless consumption expenditure growth is expected to be constrained by low employment creation, high household debt levels, declining rates of credit extension to households, and high petrol and electricity price increases, all of which are likely to curtail discretionary spending. The trend of wage settlements remains an upside risk to inflation and job creation. The current wage bargaining round has seen a wide range of settlements, generally above the current inflation rate. According to Andrew Levy Employment Publications, the overall average wage settlement rate in collective bargaining agreements was 7,9 per cent in the first half of 2013 and this is likely to have increased in the third quarter. According to data derived from the QES, average salary and wages per worker over four quarters increased by 8,7 per cent in the quarter ending June 2013, but when accounting for productivity increases, the unit labour cost increase amounted to 6,8 per cent. The ultimate impact on inflation will depend in part on the increase in the total wage bill, as the impact of higher wages may be offset by job losses or slower employment creation. We are concerned that the increase in productivity, although relatively low, reflects job losses and a switch to more capital intensive production. 11 The moderate pace of bank credit extension to the private sector has been maintained with twelve-month growth of 8,7 per cent in total loans and advances recorded in July. Installment sale credit and leasing finance remained robust, while growth in general loans to households, which is mainly unsecured lending, declined to 20,2 per cent in July, the lowest rate of growth since August 2010. The shorter term trends for unsecured lending are more marked, with growth in the three months to July measuring 11,0 per cent and negative growth in loans of less than R30,000. Growth in mortgage credit extension has remained subdued. Twelve-month growth in credit extension to the corporate sector declined from 10,5 per cent in June to 8,7 per cent in July, with some indications that this reflects a lack of demand by corporates. They remain relatively cash flush and have also placed increasing reliance on corporate bond issues Food prices are a risk to the inflation outlook, although the continued downward trend of international food prices has helped to offset the impact of the weaker rand on maize and wheat prices. Consumer food inflation measured 7,4 per cent in August, while at the producer price level, manufactured food price inflation measured 7,5 per cent in July. Price increases of agricultural products, by contrast, were muted at 0,5 per cent in July, with year-on-year declines in the prices of cereals and meat, but strong increases, of 21,4 per cent, in fruit and vegetable prices. 12 The immediate risks to inflation from international crude oil prices appear to have abated for now following a decline in the political risk premium, but prices remain highly sensitive to developments in the Middle East in particular. Having increased to a level of around US$118 per barrel in response to events in Egypt and Syria, the price has since moderated to around US$110 as the risk of US military action in Syria has subsided. Petrol prices increased at a year-on-year rate of 23,0 per cent in August, but favourable base effects and the small decline in the price in September are likely to result in a far lower rate of petrol price inflation in that month. The combination of a lower oil price and a stronger exchange rate observed in recent days is likely to result in a further moderate price decline in October, reversing the expectation earlier in the month of a further significant increase. The Monetary Policy Committee assesses the risks to the inflation outlook to be on the upside, mainly due to exchange rate and wage pressures. The decision of the Fed to delay tapering has provided a temporary reprieve to the exchange rate. However, the continued uncertainty relating to the timing of the inevitable slowdown in bond purchases and its data dependent nature, imply that emerging market currencies, including the rand, are likely to experience a protracted period of volatility. In the short run these developments may have moderated the risk to inflation from the exchange rate, but medium to longer term risks remain, which will be assessed on an ongoing basis. In the short run these developments may have moderated the risk to inflation from the exchange rate, but medium to longer term risks remain, which will be assessed on an ongoing basis 13 The MPC remains mindful of the conflicting policy choices that it faces. The breach of the upper end of the inflation target is expected to be temporary, but the longer term trajectory is uncomfortably close to the upper end of the target range. At the same time, there are still no significant demand side pressures in the economy and consumption expenditure growth is subdued. The output gap continues to widen, and the employment data show that there is very little net employment creation in the economy, while employment in the manufacturing and mining sectors has been declining. Consumers remain under pressure with persistently high debt to disposable income ratios, further exacerbated by the rising cost of petrol and other administered prices. Currently, a sustained breach of the inflation target is not our central forecast, but the upside risks to the inflation outlook require careful monitoring. Should the risks to the medium-term inflation outlook deteriorate significantly the MPC will not hesitate to take appropriate action in order to maintain the integrity of the inflation targeting framework and to anchor inflation expectations at a lower level. At this stage, however, given the global uncertainties and downside growth risks, the MPC has decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 5,0 per cent per annum.

India,2013-09-20,"Mid-Quarter Monetary Policy Review: September 2013 Statement by Dr.Raghuram G. Rajan Governor. Reserve Bank of India ""Good Afternoon. In the mid-quarter review today, we began a calibrated change in the exceptional liquidity measures we introduced in July by cutting the Marginal ‘Standing Facility rate, which is the effective policy rate today by 75 basis points or 0.75 percentage points. We also reduced the minimum daily CRR balance that banks have to maintain to 95% of the requirement. We believe that easing the exceptional liquidity measures was warranted given that the external environment has improved and given that the Government and the RBI have used the time since the measures were put in place to narrow the current account deficit and to ease its financing. The calibrated withdrawal will provide a boost to growth, reduce the financing distortions that are emerging in the market, and reduce the strain on corporate and bank balance sheets. We remain vigilant about external market conditions and will do what is necessary if they deteriorate once again. We have also announced an intention to return to normal monetary operations where the repo rate will return to being the effective policy rate and liquidity conditions need not be as tight as they currently are. Let me emphasize that the difference between the MSF and repo rate will be brought down to 100 basis points. At the same time, recognizing that inflationary pressures are mounting and determined to establish a nominal anchor which will allow us to preserve the internal value of the rupee, we have raised the repo rate by 25 basis points. The intent here is that when the repo rate becomes the effective policy rate, it should be consistent with inflationary conditions in the economy. On net, these measures will reduce the cost of bank financing substantially while allowing us to take an appropriately precautionary stance on inflation. Let us remember that the postponement of tapering is only that, a postponement. We must use this time to create a bullet proof national balance sheet and growth agenda, which creates confidence in citizens and investors alike.2 At the Reserve Bank of India, my colleagues and I have been busy developing the measures we announced about two weeks ago. Yesterday, the RBI implemented the full liberalization of bank branching, with some safeguards to encourage inclusion. We announced both the FCNR(B) swap facility as well as the swap facility for bank borrowings. I am glad to say that banks have started bringing in money. Till yesterday, we had received $ 466 million through the FCNR(B) and $ 917 million through the swap facility to a total of nearly $ 1.4 billion. We have started the process to issue two kinds of retail inflation indexed retail certificates, one with a lump sum payment at the end and the other with indexed interest payments. We have set up the central credit registry for large bank borrowers. The various committees we announced are swinging into action. Over the next few weeks, together with the government, we will take a close look at corporate distress and bank NPAs to see how we can accelerate the process of resolution. Finally, we are taking a look at a variety of markets to deepen them and make them more vibrant. Measures will be announced periodically."" Alpana Killawala Press Release: 2013-2014/607 Principal Chief General Manager. Mid-Quarter Monetary Policy Review: September 2013 Monetary and Liquidity Measures On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, it has been decided to: reduce the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate by 75 basis points from 10.25 per cent to 9.5 per cent with immediate effect; reduce the minimum daily maintenance of the cash reserve ratio (CRR) from 99 per cent of the requirement to 95 per cent effective from the fortnight beginning September 21, 2013, while keeping the CRR unchanged at 4.0 per cent; and increase the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 25 basis points from 7.25 per cent to 7.5 per cent with immediate effect. Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF stands adjusted to 6.5 per cent and the Bank Rate stands reduced to 9.5 per cent with immediate effect. With these changes, the MSF rate and the Bank Rate are recalibrated to 200 basis points above the repo rate. Assessment 2. Since the First Quarter Review (FQR) in July, a weak recovery has been taking hold in advanced economies, with growth picking up in Japan and the UK and the euro area exiting recession. However, activity has slowed in several emerging economies, buffeted by heightened financial market turbulence on the prospect of tapering of quantitative easing (QE) in the US. The decision by the US Federal Reserve to hold off tapering has buoyed financial markets but tapering is inevitable. On the domestic front, growth has weakened with continuing sluggishness in industrial activity and services. The pace of infrastructure project completion is subdued and new project starts remain muted. Consumption, while relatively firm so far, is starting to weaken even in rural areas, with durable goods consumption hit hard. Consequently, growth is trailing below potential and the output gap is widening. Some pick-up is expected on account of the brightening prospects for agriculture due to kharif output and the upturn in exports. Also, as infrastructure investments are expedited, and as projects cleared by the Cabinet Committee on Investment come on stream, growth could pick up in the second half of the year. WPI inflation, which had eased in Q1 of 2013-14, has started rising again as the pass-through of fuel price increases has been compounded by the sharp depreciation of the rupee and rising international commodity prices. The negative output gap will exercise downward pressure on inflation, and the process will be aided as supply side constraints, especially relating to food and infrastructure, ease. However, the current assessment is that in the absence of an appropriate policy response. WPI inflation will be higher than initially projected over the rest of the year.25 per cent, aligned to the re-calibrated MSF rate. The intent has been to maintain tight liquidity conditions at the short end of the term structure until the measures designed to alter the path of the CAD and improve prospects for its stable funding take effect. As a number of these measures are now in place and because the external environment has improved, it is now possible for the Reserve Bank to contemplate easing these exceptional measures in a calibrated manner. As a first step, therefore, the MSF rate is reduced by 75 basis points. Furthermore, the minimum daily maintenance of the CRR prescribed by the Reserve Bank is brought down from 99 per cent of the requirement to 95 per cent. The timing and direction of further actions on exceptional measures will be contingent upon exchange market stability, and can be two-way. Further actions need not be announced only on policy dates. However, any further change in the minimum daily maintenance of the CRR is not contemplated. As the measures are unwound, the objective is to normalise the conduct and operations of monetary policy so as to allow the LAF repo rate to resume its role as the operational policy interest rate. However, inflation is high and household financial saving is lower than desirable. As the inflationary consequences of exchange rate depreciation and hitherto suppressed inflation play out, they will offset some of the disinflationary effects of a better harvest and the negative output gap. The need to anchor inflation and inflation expectations has to be set against the fragile state of the industrial sector and urban demand. Keeping all this in view, bringing down inflation to more tolerable levels warrants raising the LAF repo rate by 25 basis points immediately. The Reserve Bank will closely and continuously monitor the evolving growth- inflation dynamics with a readiness to act pre-emptively, as necessary. The policy stance and measures set out in this review begin the process of cautious unwinding of the exceptional measures, which will restore normalcy to financial flows. They are also intended to address inflationary pressures so as to provide a stable nominal anchor for the economy, thereby mitigating exchange market pressures and creating a conducive environment for the revitalisation of sustainable growth.

Israel,2013-09-23,"Inflation over the past 12 months and inflation expectations for the coming year are below the midpoint of the inflation target range. Indicators which became available this month continue to support the assessment thateconomic activity, excluding the effect of the start of natural gas production, continues to expand at the moderate rate which characterized it in the past two years, and stability in the labor market continues. With that, the decline in exports, against the background of the virtual standstill in world trade, continues, and there is moderation in the growth rate of private consumption. The growth in government expenditures is expected to moderate in 2014, and in the beginning of that year additional tax increases willcome into effec. The global picture indicates a possible slowdown in the pace of recovery in advanced economies, with continued moderation in growth of emerging economies. This month, the World Trade Organization reduced its forecast of trade growth, the Fed reduced its forecast for US growth, and the OECD reduced its growth forecast for the US and China. The global inflation environment continues to be low. The Fed announced that it will continue its quantitative easing program at the current volume, until additional evidence accumulates that indicates that the improvement in economic activity will be sustained. In light of the deferral of the tapering process, the uncertainty about its precise timing, its strength, and its consequences continues. Central banks of Europe, the UK, and Japan are expected to maintain a very accommodative stance of monetary policy for an extended period of time. With reduced geopolitical tension, and against the background of accommodative policy worldwide, there is again appreciation in the nominal effective exchange rate, with the shekel appreciating by 1.0 percent since the previous monetary discussion, and by 6.6 percent for the year to date. Home price appreciation continues, and mortgages continued to be taken out in large volumes. However, guidelines published by the Supervisor of Banks, which limit the share of repayment out of income, the share of the loan which may be granted at variable rate interest, and the term until final loan repayment, are expected to reduce the risk to mortgage borrowers and the banking system. To view this press release as a Word document. Background conditions. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: For the month as a whole, inflation expectations from various sources remained at a similar level to that ofthe previous month. Private forecasters' inflation expectations for the next 12 CPI readings are 1.9 percent, on average. Inflation expectations for the coming 12 months derived from banks' internal interest rates are 1.5 percent, and expectations derived from the capital market are 1.4 percent. Forward expectations for terms of 2 years and longer (monthlyaverages) remained stable, and range from 2.3-2.6 percent, while there was a slight decline in medium terms (4-7 years). Private forecasters' average projections are for the CPI for September to increase by 0.2 percent. The 1-year Telbor interest rate, which reached 1.5 percent during the month, declined to about 1.2 percent at the end of the month. The labor market:Budget data: In January-August, as a result of expenditures which were relatively low compared with the path of the budget approved by the Knesset on July 30, the cumulative government deficit was NIS 7.5 billion (about 0.75 percent of GDP) below the seasonal path consistent with the deficit ceiling for 2013. If current trends remain in place, the deficit for the full year of 2013 is expected to be about 4 percent of GDP. Tax receipts,which were lower than the seasonal path in the first months of the year, were in line with the path in recent months, though the improvement halted in August. Assuming full performance of budget expenditures and preservationof the tax rates set in law, the deficit in 2014 is expected to be 3.0 percent of GDP: in line with the deficit target."
Armenia,2013-09-24,"Press Release 24.09.2013 Interest rate unchanged, 8.5 percent In the September 24th of 2013 Meeting the Board of CBA decided to leave the Refinancing Rate of CBA unchanged, at an 8.5 percent level. There was 0.3 percent inflation in August of 2013 against 0.4 percent deflation recorded in the same period of the previous year, and the 12-month inflation in late September reached 9.3 percent. The Board admits that in the upcoming months the inflation will reduce to approach the forecast path. In view of easing inflationary pressures from both external and domestic environment as well as slowing economic activity, the Board reckons that current monetary conditions can allow keeping risks to expansion of the inflation environment and declining economic activity in balance. Given the inflation reduces gradually and the domestic demand remains sluggish, the Board will respond by easing the monetary conditions. The Board acknowledged that the developments in the external sector were in line with the projections. Trends of slowing global economy persisted whilst certain deflationary trends were observable in raw materials and food product markets in the world. On the back of such developments, no significant inflationary pressures from the external environment will be expected in the forecast horizon. The developments in the domestic economy marked a weakening domestic demand attributable to the slower private consumption growth rates and reduced private investment. In addition, the current fiscal policy is further leaving a contractionary impact on the domestic demand. The Board anticipates that in the short run the inflation will gradually reduce and return to its target level; furthermore, it will keep within the confidence band in the forecast horizon. More information on setting of the interest rate will be available in Press Release due on October 4th, 2013. Press Service of the Central Bank."
Georgia,2013-09-25,"25.09.13 NBG Keeps Its Policy Rate Unchanged at 3.75% The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on September 25, 2013 and decided to keep the refinancing rate unchanged at 3.75 percent. The overall annual CPI inflation in August was -0.4%, and the prices didn't changed compared to the previous month. The main driver of such price dynamics was the seasonal decrease in fruit and vegetables prices. The base effect also played a significant role. The annual inflation is expected to drop further in September, dues to the temporary supply-side factors. According to the existing forecasts inflation will remain low throughout this year and will approach its target value by the end of 2014. Despite the expansionary monetary policy the loan activity is still modest. As a result of lower than expected credit growth the aggregate demand is still weak. There are positive trends in the external sector. Domestic demand is somewhat stimulated by the foreign remittances, with the annual growth in August reaching 11.2%. The increase of tourism revenues is noteworthy as well. An important factor is the export growth, which constitutes an additional impetus for the aggregate demand. The forecasts of the National Bank have not changed since the last meeting of the MPC. Given that the previous reduction in the policy rate has not as yet had effect on the real economy, the National Bank sticks to the accommodative monetary policy and keeps the policy rate unchanged. The NBG will continue to monitor the developments in the economy and financial markets and will act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on November 6, 2013."
Czech Republic,2013-09-26,"Press conference of the CNB Bank Board 6th Situation Report on Economic and Monetary Developments 26 September 2013 The monetary policy decision and the stance of the CNB At the close of the meeting the Board decided unanimously to leave the two-week repo rate unchanged at 0.05%. Interest rates will remain at current levels (i.e. at technical zero) over a longer horizon until inflation pressures increase significantly. The CNB is ready to use the exchange rate if further monetary policy easing becomes necessary. The probability of launching foreign exchange interventions has not changed and remains high. Reasons for the decision within the context of the forecast Consistent with the forecast is a decline in market interest rates to zero, followed by a noticeable rise in rates only in 2015. Given the zero lower bound on monetary policy rates, this points to a need for easing monetary policy using other instruments. The current Inflation Report III/2013 forecast does not predict an increase in inflation pressures and no tangible risks of such an increase in inflation pressures can be identified either. The risks to the inflation forecast are slightly on the downside, tilted towards the need for slightly easier monetary conditions. The labour market broadly stagnated in 2013 Q2: Total employment grew. The share of unemployed persons has been slightly increasing (s.a.). The average nominal wage grew by just 1.2% y-o-y, with faster growth in the non- business sector than in the business sector. No cost-push inflation pressures are apparent and the outlook for administered prices is shifting downwards. Comparison of actual data with the CNB forecast Note: in percentages, for share of unemployed persons comparison of s.a. outcomes in July and August with forecast for 2013 Q3 8 Risks to the forecast The risks to the forecast are tilted towards a need for slightly easier monetary conditions.

Romania,2013-09-30,"In its meeting of 30 September 2013. The Board of the National Bank of Romania decided:. The NBR reiterates that it will closely monitor domestic and global economic developments so as, via the calibration of the monetary policy conduct and the adequate use of its available tools, to ensure price stability over the medium term and financial stability. The annual inflation rate remained on a downward path, reaching 3.67 percent in August 2013 from 4.41 percent in July due to the decline in volatile prices, of food items in particular, amid the ongoing negative output gap. The annual adjusted CORE2 inflation rate 1 dropped to 2.24 percent in August 2013. This trend, in line with the central bank's forecasts in the latest Inflation Report, strengthens the favourable outlook for the annual inflation rate to fall below the 2.5 percent target in the forthcoming period. The resumption in disinflation has enabled a new cycle of monetary policy easing, in the context of the central bank effectively anchoring inflation expectations and closely monitoring domestic and external developments. The recent pass-through of the policy rate cut to interbank rates and government bond yields shows the consolidation of monetary policy transmission. The impact on lending rates on new business in domestic currency to companies and households feeds through with a certain lag and is moderate for the time being. The update of the short-term projection by incorporating the latest macroeconomic data reconfirms the faster disinflation until the first part of 2014, driven by the transitory favourable impact of the VAT rate cut applied to bread and other bakery products and of this year's good crop. At the same time, this outlook is moderated by several factors, namely the faster cross-border deleveraging across the banking system and the volatility of investor risk appetite owing to global developments. Against this backdrop, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided to lower the monetary policy rate to 4.25 percent per annum from 4.5 percent previously. Hence, starting with 1 October 2013, the interest rate on the NBR's lending facility (Lombard) will be lowered to an annual 7.25 percent from 7.5 percent, while its deposit facility rate will stand at 1.25 percent per annum. The NBR Board has also decided to continue to pursue an adequate liquidity management in the banking system and to leave unchanged the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The ongoing adjustment of monetary conditions is aimed at preserving medium-term price stability, in line with the NBR's flat target of 2.5 percent, while also paving the way for the sustainable recovery of lending to the private sector, restoring confidence and achieving lasting economic growth. Economic activity has seen mixed developments, the improved outlook notwithstanding. Net exports, the main driver of economic rebound, continued to have a positive bearing on the performance of both manufacturing output and current account, offsetting the unfavourable impact of the slow recovery of final consumption and investment on annual GDP dynamics. The real annual rate of change of loans to the private sector remains in negative territory. However, credit institutions further enjoy considerable room for manoeuvre in cutting interest rates on lending to the real sector, subject to prudential rules. Cheaper loans in domestic currency will support and strengthen the sustainable growth of the Romanian economy. A balanced monetary policy stance, along with an adequate macroeconomic policy mix and the new precautionary financing arrangement concluded with international financial institutions, will contribute to consolidating the stability of the domestic economy and strengthening its resilience to external shocks. In line with the announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for 5 November 2013, when the new quarterly Inflation Report is to be examined. 1Calculated by excluding administered prices, volatile prices, as well as tobacco and alcohol prices from the consumer price index.

Euroarea,2013-10-02,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. I would like to thank Governor Noyer for his kind hospitality and express our special gratitude to his staff for the excellent organisation of today's meeting of the Governing Council. We will now report on the outcome of today's meeting, which was also attended by the Commission Vice-President. Mr Rehn. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Incoming information and analysis have further underpinned our previous assessment. Underlying price pressures in the euro area are expected to remain subdued over the medium term. In keeping with this picture, monetary and, in particular, credit dynamics remain subdued. Inflation expectations for the euro area continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. At the same time, real GDP growth in the second quarter was positive, after six quarters of negative output growth, and confidence indicators up to September confirm the expected gradual improvement in economic activity from low levels. Our monetary policy stance continues to be geared towards maintaining the degree of monetary accommodation warranted by the outlook for price stability and promoting stable money market conditions. It thereby provides support to a gradual recovery in economic activity. Looking ahead, our monetary policy stance will remain accommodative for as long as necessary, in line with the forward guidance provided in July. The Governing Council confirms that it expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. This expectation continues to be based on an unchanged overall subdued outlook for inflation extending into the medium term, given the broad-based weakness in the economy and subdued monetary dynamics. In the period ahead, we will monitor all incoming information on economic and monetary developments and assess any impact on the medium-term outlook for price stability. With regard to money market conditions, we will remain particularly attentive to developments which may have implications for the stance of monetary policy and are ready to consider all available instruments. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Following six quarters of negative output growth, euro area real GDP rose, quarter on quarter, by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2013, also supported by temporary factors related to unusually adverse weather conditions in some euro area countries earlier this year. Developments in industrial production data point to somewhat weaker growth at the beginning of the third quarter, while survey-based confidence indicators up to September have improved further from low levels, overall confirming our previous expectations of a gradual recovery in economic activity. Looking ahead, output is expected to recover at a slow pace, in particular owing to a gradual improvement in domestic demand supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance. Euro area economic activity should, in addition, benefit from a gradual strengthening of external demand for exports. Furthermore, the overall improvements in financial markets seen since last summer appear to be gradually working their way through to the real economy, as should the progress made in fiscal consolidation. In addition, real incomes have benefited recently from generally lower inflation. This being said, unemployment in the euro area remains high, and the necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors will continue to weigh on economic activity. The risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside. Developments in global money and financial market conditions and related uncertainties may have the potential to negatively affect economic conditions. Other downside risks include higher commodity prices in the context of renewed geopolitical tensions, weaker than expected global demand and slow or insufficient implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, and broadly in line with expectations, euro area annual HICP inflation decreased in September 2013 to 1.1%, from 1.3% in August. On the basis of current futures prices for energy, annual inflation rates are expected to remain at such low levels in the coming months. Taking the appropriate medium-term perspective, underlying price pressures are expected to remain subdued, reflecting the broad-based weakness in aggregate demand and the modest pace of the recovery. Medium to long-term inflation expectations continue to be firmly anchored in line with price stability. The risks to the outlook for price developments are expected to be still broadly balanced over the medium term, with upside risks relating in particular to higher commodity prices as well as stronger than expected increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, and downside risks stemming from weaker than expected economic activity. Turning to the monetary analysis, data for August indicate that the underlying growth of broad money (M3) and, in particular, credit remained subdued. Annual growth in M3 continued to be broadly stable at 2.3% in August, compared with 2.2% in July. Annual growth in M1 remained strong but decreased to 6.8% in August, from 7.1% in July. Net capital inflows into the euro area continued to be the main factor supporting annual M3 growth, while the annual rate of change of loans to the private sector remained weak. The annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) stood at 0.4% in August, broadly unchanged since the turn of the year. The annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was -2.9% in August, compared with -2.8% in July. Weak loan dynamics for non-financial corporations continue to reflect primarily their lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. Since the summer of 2012 substantial progress has been made in improving the funding situation of banks and, in particular, in strengthening the domestic deposit base in a number of stressed countries. In order to ensure an adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions in euro area countries, it is essential that the fragmentation of euro area credit markets declines further and that the resilience of banks is strengthened where needed. Further decisive steps to establish a banking union will help to accomplish this objective. To sum up, the economic analysis indicates that price developments should remain in line with price stability over the medium term. A cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. As regards fiscal policies, euro area countries should not unravel their efforts to reduce deficits and put high government debt ratios on a downward path. The draft budgetary plans that countries will now deliver for the first time under the “two-pack” regulations need to provide for sufficiently far-reaching measures to achieve the fiscal targets for 2014. Governments must also decisively strengthen efforts to implement the needed structural reforms in product and labour markets. These reforms are required not only to help countries to regain competitiveness and to rebalance within the euro area, but also to create more flexible and dynamic economies that generate sustainable economic growth and employment."
Poland,2013-10-02,"Warsaw, 2 October 2013 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 1-2 October 2013 The Council decided to keep NBP interest rates unchanged:  reference rate at 2.50% on an annual basis;  lombard rate at 4.00% on an annual basis;  deposit rate at 1.00% on an annual basis;  rediscount rate at 2.75% on an annual basis. Despite some improvement, economic conditions in the global economy remained moderate in 2013 Q3. Economic activity indicators improved in the largest developed economies, including the United States and euro area. At the same time, major emerging economies saw persistently low  as for those countries  economic activity growth. Moderate global economic activity was conducive to low inflation in many countries. Financial market sentiment improved somewhat, which was partially driven by the Federal Reserve postponing the quantitative easing tapering. Prices of some financial assets rose and exchange rates of emerging currencies, including the zloty, strengthened. In Poland, the August data on industrial and construction output as well as on retail sales confirmed that economic growth remained relatively weak, although stronger than a quarter before. Simultaneously, the improvement in economic climate indicators suggests a possibility of the gradual recovery continuing in the coming quarters. In August 2013 the decline in corporate employment was again narrowed (in annual terms), amidst a slight fall in the unemployment rate (in seasonal adjusted terms). However, unemployment persists at elevated level, which supports slow wage growth. Growth in lending to the private sector remains limited. In August, annual growth in loans to enterprises and households continued at a sluggish pace, whereas a gradual recovery was seen in consumer credit. CPI inflation remained at 1.1% y/y in August, i.e. markedly below the NBP inflation target (2.5%). At the same time, most core inflation measures declined slightly, while inflation net of food and energy prices remained stable. Producer prices in industry continued to fall. Developments of inflation indices confirm still weak demand and cost pressures in the economy. This is against the background of low inflation expectations, notwithstanding their certain increase in September. In the opinion of the Council, gradual economic recovery is likely to continue in the coming quarters, however, inflationary pressure will remain subdued. The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged. Given low inflation pressure and a moderate scale of the expected recovery, in the Council's assessment 1/2 interest rates should be kept unchanged at least until the end of 2013, which will support return of inflation to the target in the medium term."
South Korea,2013-10-10,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information, the Committee considers that the economic recovery in the US has been sustained and that the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area appears to be easing, while the trends of economic growth in emerging market countries, above all China, have shown signs of recovery to some extent. The Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward, but judges that the heightening of uncertainties surrounding the US government budget bill and debt ceiling increase, and the likelihood of changes in global financial market conditions related to QE tapering by the US Federal Reserve are acting as downside risks to growth. In Korea, the Committee appraises the moderate economic growth to be continuing, with exports showing buoyancy and domestic demand also improving. On the employment front, the scale of increase in the number of persons employed has expanded in line with increases in the 50-and-above age group and the service sector. The Committee expects that the domestic economy will maintain a negative output gap for a considerable time going forward, although it forecasts that the gap will narrow. Consumer price inflation fell from 1.3% the previous month to 0.8% in September, due mainly to declines in the prices of agricultural and petroleum products, but core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices rose from 1.3% to 1.6%. The Committee forecasts that, despite increases in some public utility fees, inflation will remain low for the time being, owing primarily to the inflation reducing effects of policies such as free childcare provision and to the downward stabilization of international agricultural prices. As for the housing market, the scale of decline in sales prices in Seoul and its surrounding areas narrowed while the uptrend of those in the rest of the country continued. The increase in leasehold-deposit prices in Seoul and its surrounding areas meanwhile accelerated, and the uptrend in these prices in the rest of the country continued. The domestic financial markets have shown generally stable movements, due in large part to the scale of QE in the US remaining unchanged. Stock prices have risen substantially and the Korean won has appreciated, driven mainly by net inflows of foreigners' stock investment funds. Long-term market interest rates have fallen slightly in line with those in major economies. Looking ahead, while paying close attention to developments in and the influences of external risk factors, and monitoring the effects of the Base Rate cut and of the government's economic policies including the supplementary budget, the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as to keep consumer price inflation within the inflation target range over a medium-term horizon while ensuring that the growth potential is not eroded due to the continuation of slow growth."
Russia,2013-10-14,"The Bank of Russia Press Service informs that on 14 October 2013 the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to maintain the Bank of Russia key rate at 5.50 percentage per annum. The decision was based on the assessment of inflation risks and economic growth prospects. The dynamics of the key macroeconomic indicators suggested that the pace of economic growth remained low. Production activity and investment demand remained subdued. Producer confidence indicators continued to deteriorate. At the same time the unemployment rate stayed at the relatively low level. Consumer demand supported by the real wage and retail lending growth remained the major driver for the economic growth. Nevertheless, given subdued investment activity and sluggish recovery of external demand, the Bank of Russia expects economic growth rate to remain low in the medium term. According to the Bank of Russia estimates, gross output stays slightly below its potential level, while substantial widening of the negative output gap is not expected. In September and in the beginning of October, annual CPI inflation decreased considerably and as of 7 October 2013 was estimated at 6.0% which corresponded to the upper bound of the target range for the current year. In September the rate of inflation declined in all consumer market segments. At the same time the dynamics of services prices made a substantial contribution to inflation decrease due to changes in terms of the regulated prices and tariffs indexation. In September the core inflation annual rate remained at 5.5%. The absence of significant demand-side inflationary pressure in the conditions of gross output staying slightly below its potential level is one of the factors of the decline in core inflation in recent months. According to the Bank of Russia estimates, given the improvement of food market conditions due to favourable assessments of this year harvest, inflation will continue to slow down, staying within the target range until the end of the year. If current macroeconomic tendencies continue, inflation is projected to decline further in 2014. Nevertheless, more pronounced downward trends in inflation expectations need to be formed to ensure the achievement of inflation goals in the medium term.

Peru,2013-10-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR OCTOBER 2013 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 4.25% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference rate at 4.25 percent. This decision is based on the following factors: economic growth in the country is close to the economy's potential level of growth; inflation expectations remain anchored within the target range; the supply factors that affected inflation are reversing, and international financial conditions are still uncertain, even though recent indicators of global activity show some recovery. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants to consider future adjustments in monetary policy instruments. Inflation in September showed a rate of 0.11 percent due mainly to the rise in the prices of perishable food products and electricity. Inflation in the last 12 months rose from 3.28 percent in August to 3.83 percent in September. The rate of inflation without food and energy was 0.08 percent (2.58 percent in the last 12 months) and core inflation showed a rate of 0.22 percent (3.60 percent in the last 12 months). Inflation is expected to remain within the target range in the following months as a result of an improvement in food supply conditions and of inflation expectations anchored to the target range. Current and advanced indicators of activity show that the growth of the Peruvian economy is close to its long-term sustainable level of growth, while the indicators associated with the external market have shown a slight recovery, which has had a favorable impact on the prices of export products. The Board has been adopting measures aimed at making the reserve requirements regime more flexible in order to promote an orderly evolution of credit and provide the financial system with greater sources of credit in soles. In October the mean maximum rate of reserve requirements in domestic currency was lowered from 17 to 16 percent and the marginal rate of reserve requirements in this currency was lowered from 20 to 16 percent. In addition to this, additional reserve requirements conditional to the expansion of credit in foreign currency have been established to consolidate the dedollarization of loans. These reserve requirements will be applied if a bank's balance of loans in dollars in the domestic market exceeds 5 percent of the balance at September 2013. Should it be necessary, the Board will adopt additional measures to make the regime of required reserves more flexible. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as described below: Overnight deposits: 3.45 percent. Direct repo and rediscount operations: 5.05 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.05 percent. The Monetary Program for November will be approved on the Board's meeting that will be held on November 7, 2013."
Chile,2013-10-17,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 17 October 2013 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to lower the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points, to 4.75% (annual). In the global economy, a weaker medium-term scenario has consolidated, characterized by slower world growth, lower terms of trade for Chile, less favorable financial conditions and the maturing of the global cycle of mining investments. Most recently, the Federal Reserve's decision to postpone the moderation of its asset purchase plan has translated into a decline in long-term interest rates and a depreciation of the dollar. On the other hand, the fiscal agreement reached in the United States is temporary, so further financial tensions cannot be ruled out. The world prices of fuels and agricultural products dropped in the past month, while metal prices remained stable. Domestically, economic activity has proceeded at a moderate pace, in line with the scenario in the last Monetary Policy Report. Final demand has reduced its rate of expansion, although not as sharply as was forecast. Various indicators anticipate that it will decelerate further. Inflation has evolved below projections, remaining in the lower part of the tolerance range, while market expectations foresee a slower normalization towards 3%. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. * The Spanish original prevails."
Turkiye,2013-10-23,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels: a) One-week repo rate (the policy rate) at 4.5 percent, b) Overnight Interest Rates: Borrowing rate at 3.5 percent, lending rate at 7.75 percent, and the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 6.75 percent. c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, lending rate at 10.25 percent. Recent data suggest that final domestic demand and exports continue to grow at a moderate pace. The present policy framework is contributing to the improvement in the current account balance. The cautious monetary policy stance, the macroprudential measures undertaken and weak capital flows will gradually bring down the loan growth rates to more reasonable levels. Accordingly, gradual decline in the current account deficit excluding gold trade is expected to continue. Inflation is expected to fall further in the forthcoming period. However, core inflation indicators are likely to hover above the inflation target for some time due to the exchange rate volatility observed during the recent months. The impact of these developments on the pricing behavior is closely monitored. The Committee will maintain the cautious monetary policy stance and continue implementing additional monetary tightening at the appropriate frequency until the medium term inflation outlook is in line with the medium term targets. Developments regarding price stability and financial stability will be closely monitored and necessary adjustments will continue to be made in the composition of Turkish lira liquidity provided by the Central Bank. Meanwhile, in order to contain the repercussions of uncertainties in global monetary policies on the domestic economy, maintaining the increased predictability of the Turkish lira liquidity policy is deemed important. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
Israel,2013-10-28,"Inflation over the past 12 months, and inflation forecasts and expectations for the year ahead, remain within the inflation target range, and below the midpoint of the target range. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets, particularly in light of the continuing uncertainty in the global economy. The Bank willuse the tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stabilityof the financial system, and in this regard will keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. To view this press release as a Word document. Inflation data:Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Inflation expectations from various sources declined slightly, compared with the previous month. Private forecasters' inflation expectations for the next 12 CPI readings declined to 1.7 percent, on average. Inflation expectations derived from the capital market remained essentially unchanged, at 1.5 percent, while expectations for the next 12 CPI readings derived from banks' internal interest rates were 1.3 percent. Forward expectations for terms of 2-3 years (monthly averages) increased slightly this month, to 2.8 percent; expectations for medium terms remained stable at 2.4 percent, and for terms of 8-10 years there was a slight decline, to 2.0 percent. Based on projections of most private forecasters, as well as on data inherent in the Telbor interest rate and the makam curve, no change is expected in theBank of Israel interest rate in the coming three months. Real economic activity: The picture of the state of real economic activity is similar to that of the previous month: continued growth at a rate slightly below 3 percent (excluding the effect of natural gas production), although several indicators point to some slowdown, primarily in exports, in the third quarter. The Composite State of the Economy Index for September increased by 0.3 percent, among other things against the background ofthe increase in imports and the effect of beginning natural gas productionfrom the Tamar reservoir, and despite a prolonged decline in the industrial production index. Goods exports (excluding ships, aircraft, and diamonds)remained unchanged in September, and declined by 10 percent in the third quarter, compared with the second quarter, deriving primarily from high technology industries. Similarly, an employment weighted exports index, which gives a higher weight to labor intensive industries, indicates an extended trend of moderation since the middle of 2011. Exports of business services (excluding start-ups) declined by 4 percent in July, compared with June. ThePurchasing Managers Index continues a trend of decline, and in September it reached 44.9 points. This, while Bank Hapoalim's Consumer Confidence Index increased for the fourth consecutive month, against the background of gains on the capital market and continued stability in the labor market. According to an index based on Google searches, there was an increase this month in the probability that domestic demand will increase faster than the long term rate. The labor market: Labor force survey data for August indicate that the unemployment rate declined by 0.1 percent, to 6.1 percent, though among the prime working ages, the rate increased by 0.2 percent, to 5.4 percent. Additionally, there was an increase in the share of those employed on a full time basis. Nominal wages increased by 1.4 percent and real wages increased by 0.6 percent in May-July, based on seasonally adjusted data, compared with February-April. Health tax receipts by the National Insurance Institute, which provide an indication of total wage payments in the economy, were 4.7 percent higher in August-September, on a nominal basis, than in the corresponding two months of the previous year. Over time, a declining trend can be noted in their rate of growth. In July, there was an increase of 0.3 percent in the number of employee posts, though since the beginning of 2013 there has been a virtual standstill in the number of employee posts in the business sector. In September, there was a decline of 7.8 percent in the number of job vacancies, to its lowest level since the beginning of the year. Budget data: In January-September, the cumulative deficit in thegovernment's domestic activity was NIS 12.6 billion below the seasonal path consistent with the deficit ceiling for 2013 of 4.65 percent of GDP. The below-path deficit reflects an expenditure level which is NIS 8.7 billion lower than the path consistent with full performance of budget expenditures, and revenues which are NIS 3.9 billion above the path consistent with the revenues estimated in the budget. Assuming that there will be some increase in expenditure levels relative to the budget approved by the Knesset, the deficit in 2013 is expected to be in the range of 3.5-4.0 percent of GDP. The foreign exchange market: From the monetary policy discussion on September 22, 2013, through October 25, 2013, the shekel weakened by 0.7 percent against the dollar, even as most currencies strengthened against the dollar. The shekel weakened by 2.66 percent against the euro, and by 1.5 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. Since the beginning of the year, the shekel has appreciated by 5.3 percent in terms of the effective exchange rate. The capital and money markets: From the monetary policy discussion on September 22, 2013, through October 25, 2013, the Tel Aviv 25 Index increasedby 3.3 percent, similar to the global trend. Government bond yields declined along the entire curve, and the yield to maturity on a 10-year unindexedbond declined from 3.84 percent to 3.56 percent. The yield differential between 10-year Israeli government bonds and equivalent 10-year US Treasury securities declined slightly, to only 105 basis points. Makam yields declined along the entire curve, primarily against the background of the interest rate reduction last month, and the 1-year yield declined during the period to only 0.9 percent. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-year CDS spread declined slightly, from 117 basis points to only 108 basis points. The Tel-Bond 60 Index increased slightly, by about 1 percent. At the same time, spreads in the corporate bond market remained low. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in September, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 14.1 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 5.4 percent. Developments in the credit markets: The total outstanding debt of the business sector increased by about NIS 4.8 billion in August, to NIS 786 billion, (an increase of 0.6 percent). The increase derived primarily from the depreciation of the shekel against the dollar, which increased the shekel value of foreign currency denominated debt, and from the increase in the CPI, which increased the value of CPI-indexed debt. Net debt raised totaled only about NIS 0.5 billion: about NIS 1.9 billionraised in tradable bonds was partly offset by approximately NIS 1.5 billion in repayment of bank loans. The private nonfinancial sector issued only about NIS 1 billion in bonds in September, compared with a monthly average of NIS 2.3 billion since the beginning of the year, against the background of seasonality related to the New Year holiday season. Outstanding householddebt increased by 1.0 percent in August, to NIS 402.2 billion, with an increase of 0.9 percent in households' housing debt, to NIS 284 billion. In September, there was a seasonal decline to about NIS 3.5 billion in new mortgages granted by banks, compared with a monthly average of NIS 4.4 billion since the beginning of the year. The average interest rate on new unindexed, variable-rate mortgages remained virtually unchanged in September, while the interest rate on CPI-indexed mortgages increased by about 0.1 percentage points. Guidelines issued by the Supervisor of Banks which limit the payment to income ratio, the share of the loan which may be granted at variable rate interest, and the term until final loan repayment are expected to be reflected in housing credit characteristics in the coming months. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (based on residential rents) declined by 0.1 percent in September, following consecutive increases each month since February. In the twelve months ending in September, this component increased by 2.7 percent, similar to the 12 months which ended in August. Home prices, which are published in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of home prices but are not included in the CPI, increased by 0.2 percent in July-August, and over the 12 months ending in Augustthey increased by 9.3 percent, compared with 9.8 percent in the 12 months ended in July. The number of building starts, on an annualized basis, remains above 41,000. In August, the number of transactions in the housing market declined, in line with a decline in the level of readiness to purchase a home, as reflected in the consumer confidence survey by the Central Bureau of Statistics. The global economy: The International Monetary Fund lowered its global growth forecast for 2013 by 0.3 percent, to 2.9 percent, and for 2014 by 0.2 percent, to 3.6 percent. In the IMF's Global Financial Stability Report, there is a change in the mix of risks faced by the global economy. The main risk derives from effects related to the process of monetary policyin the US and other economies becoming less accommodative: should that lead to sharper than expected increases in yields, it could threaten stability, primarily in emerging markets which may face capital outflows. In contrast, the report emphasized the improved financial situation in the eurozone. Over the course of the month, concern of a fiscal crisis in the US increased, against the background of the government shutdown and the lack ofan agreement to raise the debt ceiling: an agreement which was reached only at the last minute, and which will need to be discussed again in another three months. Against the background of this lack of clarity, as well as the weak employment data that were published, market assessments are that the start of the tapering process of Federal Reserve bond purchases will be postponed to the end of the first quarter of 2014. Macro data published in the US were for the most part disappointing. In Europe, for the first time in a long while, the ECB increased its growth forecast for 2013: by 0.2 percent, to a projected contraction of 0.4 percent; it also lowered its 2014 forecast by 0.1 percent, to 1 percent. Macro data were mixed; purchasing managers indices indicated slight expansion; the unemployment rate declined slightly, and industrial production and retail sales indicated continued contraction at the annual level and a slight improvement at the monthly level. Stress tests planned for the banking system are expected to indicate the need to strengthen banks' capital, which may make it difficult to expand credit to the business sector and to entrench growth. In Japan, the expansion program is apparently leading to only a slight improvement in macro data. In most emerging markets, the slowdown in economic activity continues, against the background of stability in commodity prices and the tightening of financial conditions. With that, growth in China accelerated in the third quarter to a rate of 7.8 percent, from 7.5 percent in the second quarter; however, the IMF's forecast indicates expected moderation in growth and also warned about risk in the credit market. Oil and metals prices increased slightly this month. Inflation forecasts in advancedeconomies remained low, while accelerating in emerging markets, mainly in Brazil. India and China. <br>The main considerations behind the decision The decision to keep the interest rate for November 2013 unchanged at 1 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to entrench the inflation rate within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel and in the global economy, the monetary policies of major central banks, and developments in the exchange rate of the shekel. The following are the main considerations underlying the decision: Inflation over the past 12 months, and inflation forecasts and expectations for the year ahead, remain within the inflation target range, and below the midpoint of the target range. The decision to keep the interest rate for November 2013 unchanged at 1 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to entrench the inflation rate within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The following are the main considerations underlying the decision:. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decision for November 2013 will be published on November 11, 2013. The decision regarding the interest rate for December 2013 will be published at 17:30 on Monday. November 25, 2013."
Hungary,2013-10-29,"At its meeting on 29 October 2013, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by 20 basis points from 3.60% to 3.40%, with effect from 30 October 2013. In the Council's judgement, the Hungarian economy is likely to expand gradually this year, followed by a further pick-up in growth next year. The level of output remains below its potential and unemployment exceeds its long-term level determined by structural factors. The Council expects external economic activity to strengthen and weak domestic demand conditions to persist. As a result, inflationary pressures in the economy are likely to remain subdued in the medium term. Data for September suggest that inflationary pressures remain low. Recent movements in the consumer prices index have also reflected temporary effects. The Bank's measures of underlying inflation capturing medium-term developments in inflation remained broadly unchanged relative to previous months. The low rate of underlying inflation since the beginning of the year reflects the disinflationary impact of weak domestic demand. Subdued wage dynamics suggest that companies are adjusting to higher production costs mainly through the labour market, and therefore the pass-through into consumer prices is likely to be moderate. The low inflation environment may help anchor inflation expectations. In the Council's judgement, therefore, inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate, close to the target over the medium term as the temporary effects wane. In the current environment, monetary policy can contribute to meeting the inflation target over the medium term by maintaining accommodative monetary conditions. Economic growth is likely to improve gradually in the coming quarters, supported by both exports and domestic demand components. The improvement in domestic demand is likely to be gradual, reflecting ongoing deleveraging and the cautious behaviour of households. Export growth is expected to continue in line with the rate of growth of external demand, which is expected to pick up markedly starting from the end of this year. Perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy have improved over the past month. Uncertainties about the tapering of asset purchases by the Federal Reserve followed by the disagreements over the US federal budget led to volatility in global financial markets. However, these concerns diminished towards the end of the period. In the Council's judgement, changes in sentiment in global financial markets continue to pose a risk, which in turn calls for maintaining a cautious approach to policy. In the Council's judgement, there remains a significant degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate over a sustained period. Inflation is expected to remain around the target over the forecast period, which provides scope to ease monetary policy further. Global financial markets have stabilised following a period of increased volatility. A sustained and marked shift in perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy may influence the room for manoeuvre in monetary policy. In the Council's view, considering the outlook for inflation and the real economy and taking into account perceptions of the risks associated with the economy, further cautious easing of monetary conditions may follow."
India,2013-10-29,"Second Quarter Review of Monetary Policy 2013-14 Statement by Dr.Raghuram G. Rajan. Governor. Reserve Bank of India ""Good Morning and welcome to the Reserve Bank. Today, continuing the process begun in September, we have announced the following policy measures: we have reduced the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate by 25 basis points from 9.0 per cent to 8.75 per cent with immediate effect; we have also increased the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 25 basis points from 7.5 per cent to 7.75 per cent with immediate effect; and the liquidity provided through term repos of 7-day and 14-day tenor has been increased from 0.25 per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) of the banking system to 0.5 per cent with immediate effect. Assessment Our policy decisions are based on a detailed assessment of the global and domestic macroeconomic situation. The outlook for global growth has improved modestly and the prospect of delay in the taper of the Federal Reserve's bond purchases has brought calm to financial markets. Domestically, while industrial activity has weakened, strengthening export growth, signs of revival in some services along with the expected pick-up in agriculture could increase the real GDP growth from 4.4 per cent in Q1 to a central estimate of 5.0 per cent for the year as a whole. The revival of large stalled projects and the pipeline cleared by the Cabinet Committee on Investment may buoy investment and overall activity towards the close of the year. On inflation, both wholesale and consumer price inflation are likely to remain elevated in the months ahead, warranting anappropriate policy response. We have calibrated liquidity management to the system's requirements. We are providing liquidity through overnight LAF repos, through export credit refinance and through 7-day and 14-day term repos. We have also given greater flexibility in managing reserve requirements. Going forward, however, the more durable strategy for mitigating mismatches between the supply of, and demand for, funds is for banks to step up efforts to mobilise deposits.2 On the external sector, a perceptible narrowing of the trade deficit coupled with policy interventions have brought some calm to the foreign exchange market, but normalcy will be restored only when the demand for dollars from public sector oil marketing companies is fully returned to the market. Policy Stance and Rationale We began a calibrated change in the exceptional liquidity measures since September. As steps to contain the current account deficit started taking effect in an improving external environment and as volatility in the foreign exchange market ebbed, it became possible for us to unwind the exceptional liquidity tightening measures. With the reduction of the MSF rate and the increase in the repo rate in this review, the process of re-aligning the interest rate corridor to normal monetary policy operations is now complete. However, it is important to break the spiral of rising price pressures in order to curb the erosion of financial saving and strengthen the foundations of growth. It is in this context that the LAF repo rate has been increased by 25 basis points. Curbing mounting inflationary pressures and managing inflation expectations will help strengthen the environment for growth by fostering macroeconomic and financial stability. The Reserve Bank will closely monitor inflation risk while being mindful of the evolving growth dynamics. Developmental and Regulatory Policies We plan to build the Reserve Bank's developmental measures over the next few quarters on five pillars. These are: a. Clarifying and strengthening the monetary policy framework. Strengthening banking structure through new entry, branch expansion, encouraging new varieties of banks, and moving foreign banks into better regulated organizational forms. Broadening and deepening financial markets and increasing their liquidity and resilience so that they can help absorb the risks entailed in financing India's growth. Expanding access to finance to small and medium enterprises, the unorganized sector, the poor, and remote and underserved areas of the country through measures to foster financial inclusion. Improving the system's ability to deal with corporate distress and financial institution distress by strengthening real and financial restructuring as well as debt recovery. Action on the monetary policy framework will follow the submission of the Dr.Urjit Patel Committee report. A number of measures to strengthen bank structures and financial markets have already been announced, and more will follow as they are worked out. The strategy to expand financial inclusion will be informed by the Dr.Nachiket Mor Committee report, though significant efforts to explore the use of technology are already under way. I invite you all to go through Part B of the Policy Statement which lays out developmental and regulatory initiatives. I will only list a few important ones. We are3 discussing other measures and the fact that I do not mention them does not mean that they are not on the table, only that more work is needed to get them to the point where they can be announced. In formulating these measures, we have listened to concerns that have been expressed to us. For instance, a number of banks have expressed concerns about the difficulty of settling electronic funds transfers when the markets have closed. Keeping this in mind, we have revised the timing of MSF operations. With effect from November 5, 2013 they will be conducted between 7.00 pm and 7.30 pm instead of between 4.45 pm and 5.15 pm. I believe this new timing will help the banks greatly in their reserve management and help free up liquidity for the economy. Turning to other measures The report of the Group to operationalise the countercyclical capital buffer framework in India (Chairman: Shri B. Mahapatra) will be placed on our website by end-November for comments. The draft of the proposed framework for dealing with Domestic Systemically Important Banks in India will be placed on our website by end- November. The scheme of subsidiarisation of foreign banks in India in order to reduce the risks they pose to the system while giving them the near national treatment promised in the past will be placed on our website within two weeks. It will be guided by the two cardinal principles of reciprocity and single mode of presence. Inflation Indexed National Saving Securities (IINSSs) will be launched for retail investors in November/December 2013. Guidelines on cash settled 10-year interest rate futures contracts will be issued by mid-November so that the product can be launched by the exchanges by end-December. A number of suggestions from the FSLRC report to improve the interaction between the RBI and its regulated entities are being implemented. I thank you for your attention and on behalf of the Reserve Bank, my best wishes to everyone for a Happy Diwali."" Alpana Killawala Press Release : 2013-2014/872 Principal Chief General Manager."
United States,2013-10-30,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September generally suggests that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace. Indicators of labor market conditions have shown some further improvement, but the unemployment rate remains elevated. Available data suggest that household spending and business fixed investment advanced, while the recovery in the housing sector slowed somewhat in recent months. Fiscal policy is restraining economic growth. Apart from fluctuations due to changes in energy prices, inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will pick up from its recent pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee sees the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished, on net, since last fall. The Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, but it anticipates that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term. Taking into account the extent of federal fiscal retrenchment over the past year, the Committee sees the improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions since it began its asset purchase program as consistent with growing underlying strength in the broader economy. However, the Committee decided to await more evidence that progress will be sustained before adjusting the pace of its purchases. Accordingly, the Committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability. In judging when to moderate the pace of asset purchases, the Committee will, at its coming meetings, assess whether incoming information continues to support the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective. Asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee's economic outlook as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens. In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; James Bullard; Charles L Evans; Jerome H Powell; Eric S Rosengren; Jeremy C Stein; Daniel K Tarullo; and Janet L Yellen. Voting against the action was Esther L George, who was concerned that the continued high level of monetary accommodation increased the risks of future economic and financial imbalances and, over time, could cause an increase in long-term inflation expectations."
Egypt,2013-10-31,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release October 31, 2013 In its meeting held on October 31, 2013, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation unchanged at 875 percent, 975 percent, and 925 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also kept unchanged at 925 percen. Headline CPI increased by 157 percent (m/m) in September compared to an inch up of 068 percent in August, bringing the annual rate to 1015 percent in September from 974 percent in Augus. On the other hand, core CPI increased by 170 percent (m/m) in September after inching up by 014 percent in August, pushing the annual rate to 1115 percent in September from 897 percent recorded in the previous mont. The latest monthly developments in both headline and core inflation were driven by increases in several food prices combined with a number of non‐food price. The latter, however, were mostly confined to seasonal items associated with Haj season and the beginning of the school yea. Going forward, while inflation numbers are projected to continue to be affected by seasonal patterns associated with Eid festivities and the beginning of the school year, upside risks to the inflation outlook continue to moderate as the possibility of a rebound in international food prices is unlikely in light of recent global development. Meanwhile real GDP growth registered 15 percent in 2012/2013 Q4, bringing the annual growth rate for the whole year of 2012/2013 to 21 percent, following a similarly feeble growth rate of 22 percent recorded in 2011/201. Economic activity remained sluggish in 2012/2013 on the back of weak growth rates in most of the key sectors, namely manufacturing, construction and tourism, in addition to the contraction in the petroleum secto. In the meantime, investment levels remained low given the heightened uncertainty that faced market participants since early 2011 and the weak credit growth to the private secto. Looking ahead, downside risks that surround the global recovery on the back of challenges facing the Euro Area and the softening growth in emerging markets could pose downside risks to domestic GDP going forwar. The pronounced downside risks to domestic GDP combined with the persistently negative output gap since 2011 will limit upside risks to the inflation outlook going forwar. Given the mixed balance of risks surrounding the inflation and the GDP outlooks at this juncture. MPC judges that the current key CBE rates are appropriat. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium‐ter. Dr Rania Al‐Mashat Sub Governor.

Romania,2013-11-05,"The NBR Board has examined and approved the new quarterly Inflation Report, which will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled for 7 November 2013. The latest macroeconomic data point to faster disinflation attributed to the significant decline in food prices as a result of the bumper crops, the cut in the VAT rate for bread and some bakery products and the fading away of the negative base effect manifest in 2012. To these factors added the impact of the persistent negative output gap and the improvement in inflation expectations. Given the influence of the above-mentioned factors, the annual inflation rate dropped to 1.88 percent in September 2013 from 3.67 percent a month earlier. At the same time, the average annual inflation rate fell to 4.8 percent in September 2013, from 5.1 percent in the previous month. The annual inflation rate measured by the harmonised index of consumer prices, a relevant indicator to ensure EU-wide comparability and to assess the degree of convergence with the European Union, averaged out at 4.1 percent in September 2013, down from 4.4 percent in the previous month. The improvement in inflation developments and the related outlook has enabled the central bank to gradually adjust the monetary policy stance over the past few months, under conditions compatible with effectively anchoring inflation expectations and in parallel with closely monitoring domestic and external developments. Exports, together with this year's bumper crops, have been the main driver of the recent economic upturn in Romania, contributing to a substantial correction of the balance-of-payments current account deficit and boosting industrial production. At the same time, domestic demand has seen modest recovery, which is envisaged to strengthen gradually. The real annual dynamics of loans to the private sector are still in negative territory, despite a relative improvement in the developments in domestic currency loans. The successive policy rate cuts in the recent months have favourably fed through, albeit with a certain lag, to lending rates to the real sector. The consolidation of the monetary policy transmission mechanism thus paves the way for the revival of sustainable lending, restoration of confidence and the support provided to economic growth. There is still room for lowering lending rates for companies and households, in compliance with prudential rules. In today's meeting, the NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which foresees a decline in inflation rate to all-time lows in the first half of 2014, amid the ongoing transitory impact of this year's crops and the lower VAT rate for some bakery products. According to the updated projection, inflation rate will experience a temporarily steeper fall over the coming months and will remain thereafter inside the variation band around the flat 2.5 percent target until the end of the projection horizon. The risks associated with the updated projection are primarily related to the external environment, stemming from capital flow volatility, owing to cross-border deleveraging across the banking system and to the variability of investors' risk appetite. Against this backdrop, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided to lower the monetary policy rate to 4.0 percent per annum from 4.25 percent previously. Hence, starting with 6 November 2013, the interest rate on the NBR's lending facility (Lombard) will be lowered to an annual 7.0 percent from 7.25 percent, while its deposit facility rate will stand at 1.0 percent per annum. The NBR Board has also decided to continue to pursue adequate liquidity management in the banking system and to leave unchanged the existing levels of minimum reserve requirement ratios on both leu- and foreign currency-denominated liabilities of credit institutions. The gradual adjustment of monetary conditions is aimed at sustainably preserving price stability over the medium term in line with the flat annual target of 2.5 percent. This conduct will help anchor inflation expectations at low levels and ensure sound, lasting recovery of lending to the private sector. The consistent implementation of an adequate macroeconomic policy mix, in line with the new precautionary external financing arrangement signed with the international financial institutions, will also help consolidate stability and growth prospects of the Romanian economy, thereby strengthening its resilience to external shocks. The NBR reiterates that it will closely monitor domestic and global economic developments so as, via the proper calibration of the monetary policy conduct and the adequate use of all its available tools, to ensure price stability over the medium term and financial stability. The new quarterly Inflation Report will be released to the public in a press conference on 7 November 2013. In line with the announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for 8 January 2014.

Georgia,2013-11-06,"06.11.13 NBG Keeps Its Policy Rate Unchanged at 3.75% The Monetary Policy Committee of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) met on November 6, 2013 and decided to keep the refinancing rate unchanged at 3.75%. The annual headline CPI inflation in October was 0.2%, and the price increase mostly affected seasonal products. It should be mentioned that core inflation (net of food and energy prices) has been characterized by a growing trend during the past two quarters. According to existing forecasts, inflation will remain low throughout the coming period and will approach its target value by the end of 2014. Economic activity was growing in the third quarter. However, at present the GDP gap (the deviation from its potential level) is still negative, which pushes the price level down. The gap is expected to gradually close during the coming six quarters, thus helping to move inflation closer to its target level. As a result of monetary easing, the credit activity of banks is gradually improving, although the demand for loans is still weak, hindering the transmission of monetary policy to the economy. Along with weakened demand, inflation is being pushed down by temporary supply-side factors, such as the base effect, changes in regulated prices, etc. Trends in the external sector remain positive, somewhat stimulating aggregate demand. The growth rate of foreign remittances remained high in the third quarter, reaching 14.1%. The current account deficit is expected to improve as well, serving as an additional source for the increase in aggregate demand. Given that the previous reduction of the policy rate has not as yet had its full effect on the real economy, the National Bank is sticking to the accommodative monetary policy and is keeping the policy rate unchanged. The NBG will continue to monitor developments in the economy and financial markets and will act accordingly. The next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee will be held on December 18, 2013."
Poland,2013-11-06,"Warsaw, 6 November 2013 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 5-6 November 2013 The Council decided to keep NBP interest rates unchanged:  reference rate at 2.50% on an annual basis;  lombard rate at 4.00% on an annual basis;  deposit rate at 1.00% on an annual basis;  rediscount rate at 2.75% on an annual basis. Global economic activity remains moderate. In 2013 Q3. GDP growth in the euro area was probably similar to a quarter before, while growth in the United States was negligibly slower. At the same time, in a few major emerging market economies, including China, economic growth stayed low as for these economies. Moderate global economic activity has been conducive to low inflation in many countries. Following a temporary deterioration of sentiment due to uncertainty about fiscal policy in the United States, prices of some financial assets, including the zloty, have risen of late. In Poland, industrial and construction output as well as retail sales in 2013 Q3 confirm low, yet accelerating economic growth. At the same time, improving leading indicators point to gradual recovery continuing into quarters to come. Gradual improvement in economic conditions is coupled with a minor increase in corporate employment, yet it is still lower than a year ago. Unemployment rate is still elevated, which contributes to slow wage growth. Growth in lending to the private sector remains limited. In September, annual growth in loans to enterprises and households stayed low, while since mid-year consumer credit growth has been gradually gathering pace. In September. CPI inflation edged down to 1.0% y/y, i.e. remaining markedly below the NBP inflation target (2.5%). At the same time, core inflation measures stabilized or declined slightly. Annual growth in producer prices in industry stayed negative. Recent developments of inflation indices along with low inflation expectations confirm that demand and cost pressures in the economy remain low. The Council got acquainted with the inflation and GDP projection prepared by the Economic Institute, being one of the inputs to the Council's decisions on the NBP interest rates. In line with the November projection based on the NECMOD model  prepared under the assumption of unchanged NBP interest rates and taking into account data available until 21 October 2013 (projection cut-off date)  there is a 50-per cent 1/2 probability of inflation running in the range of 0.9-1.0% in 2013 (as compared to 0.6-1.1% in the July projection), 1.1-2.2% in 2014 (as against 0.4-2.0%) and 1.1-2.6% in 2015 (as against 0.7-2.4%). At the same time, the annual GDP growth  in line with the November projection  will be, with a 50-per cent probability, 1.0-1.5% in 2013 (as compared to 0.5- 1.7% in the July projection), 2.0-3.9% in 2014 (as against 1.2-3.5%) and 2.1-4.5% in 2015 (as against 1.6-4.2%). In the opinion of the Council, gradual economic recovery is likely to continue in the coming quarters, however, inflationary pressure will remain subdued. November projection of GDP and inflation confirms this assessment. The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged. In the opinion of the Council, lowering interest rates in the first half of 2013 and keeping them unchanged in the second half of the year supports recovery of the domestic economy, gradual return of inflation to the target and stabilisation in the financial markets. Considering the current statistical data as well as the projection of GDP and inflation that confirm low inflationary pressure and the expected moderate economic recovery, the Council assesses that NBP interest rates should be kept unchanged at least until the end of the first half of 2014. The Council adopted the Inflation Report  November 2013."
Czech Republic,2013-11-07,"Press conference of the CNB Bank Board 7th Situation Report on Economic and Monetary Developments 7 November 2013 The monetary policy decision and the stance of the CNB At the close of the meeting the Board decided unanimously to leave the two-week repo rate unchanged at 0.05%. Interest rates will remain at current levels (i.e. at technical zero) over a longer horizon until inflation pressures increase significantly. The existing forecast does not predict such an increase in inflation pressures and no tangible risk in this direction can be identified either. The Board also decided to start using the exchange rate as an additional instrument for easing the monetary conditions. The CNB will intervene on the FX market to weaken the koruna so that the exchange rate of the koruna against the euro is close to CZK 27/EUR. 2 Reasons for the decision within the context of the forecast Consistent with the forecast is a significant decline in market interest rates well below zero, followed by a rise in rates above the current levels only at the end of 2014. Given the zero lower bound on interest rates, this points to a significant need to ease monetary policy using other instruments. An alternative scenario quantifying the use of the exchange rate of the koruna confirms that a sustained weakening of the exchange rate is an effective instrument for accelerating the return of inflation towards the target. 3 The exchange rate as an additional monetary policy instrument So far the CNB has used its standard instruments to ease the monetary conditions. The key monetary policy rate was lowered gradually, reaching the technical zero bound in autumn 2012. In order to avoid long-term undershooting of the inflation target and to speed up the return to the situation in which it will be able to use its standard instrument, i.e. interest rates, the CNB has started to use the exchange rate as an additional monetary policy instrument. The CNB is resolved to intervene on the FX market in such volumes and for such duration as needed to reach the desired exchange rate level with the aim of hitting its inflation target in the future. The baseline versus alternative scenario of the forecast Consistent with the baseline scenario of the forecast is a decline in market interest rates, which cannot occur in practice, pointing to a need to use a different monetary policy instrument. As a result of the Bank Board's decision to start using the exchange rate, the alternative scenario becomes the most probable description of expected future economic developments. The following slides describe first the baseline scenario and then the alternative scenario. The message of the forecast (baseline scenario with negative rates) Food prices and administered prices together with tax changes continue to be the source of current inflation, but their contribution is decreasing. The domestic economy continues to dampen inflation significantly. At the beginning of 2014 inflation will fall to zero due to an unwinding of the effects of VAT changes and a drop in administered prices. In the following period inflation will grow again towards the target. However a gradual recovery has already been observed since 2013 Q2. Next year, the economy will grow by 1.5% and the growth will accelerate to 3% in 2015. The koruna exchange rate will be broadly flat in the near future. At the longer end of the forecast it will appreciate only very slowly. Consistent with the forecast is a significant decline in market interest rates well below zero, followed by a rise in rates above the current levels only at the end of 2014. In the alternative scenario, the exchange rate takes over the stabilising role of monetary policy. The CNB will intervene on the foreign exchange market to weaken the koruna so that the exchange rate of the koruna against the euro is close to CZK 27/EUR. This facilitates an earlier return of headline and monetary-policy relevant inflation to the 2% target compared to the baseline scenario even with interest rates being at the zero lower bound. At a shorter horizon. GDP growth recovers more quickly compared to the baseline scenario."
Euroarea,2013-11-07,"Ladies and gentlemen. I am very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. I will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, during which we took a number of decisions on key ECB interest rates, forward guidance and liquidity provision. First, based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to lower the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem by 25 basis points to 0.25% and the rate on the marginal lending facility by 25 basis points to 0.75%. The rate on the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%. These decisions are in line with our forward guidance of July 2013, given the latest indications of further diminishing underlying price pressures in the euro area over the medium term, starting from currently low annual inflation rates of below 1%. In keeping with this picture, monetary and, in particular, credit dynamics remain subdued. At the same time, inflation expectations for the euro area over the medium to long term continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. Such a constellation suggests that we may experience a prolonged period of low inflation, to be followed by a gradual upward movement towards inflation rates below, but close to, 2% later on. Accordingly, our monetary policy stance will remain accommodative for as long as necessary. It will thereby also continue to assist the gradual economic recovery as reflected in confidence indicators up to October. Second, following today's rate cut, the Governing Council reviewed the forward guidance provided in July and confirmed that it continues to expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. This expectation continues to be based on an overall subdued outlook for inflation extending into the medium term, given the broad-based weakness of the economy and subdued monetary dynamics. Third, we continue to monitor closely money market conditions and their potential impact on our monetary policy stance. We are ready to consider all available instruments and, in this context, we decided today to continue conducting the main refinancing operations (MROs) as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary, and at least until the end of the 6th maintenance period of 2015 on 7 July 2015. This procedure will also remain in use for the Eurosystem's special-term refinancing operations with a maturity of one maintenance period, which will continue to be conducted for as long as needed, and at least until the end of the second quarter of 2015. The fixed rate in these special-term refinancing operations will be the same as the MRO rate prevailing at the time. Furthermore, we decided to conduct the three-month longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) to be allotted until the end of the second quarter of 2015 as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment. The rates in these three-month operations will be fixed at the average rate of the MROs over the life of the respective LTRO. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Real GDP in the euro area rose by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2013, following six quarters of falling output. Developments in survey-based confidence indicators up to October are consistent with continued, albeit modest, growth in the second half of the year. Looking ahead, output is expected to continue to recover at a slow pace, in particular owing to a gradual improvement in domestic demand supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance. Euro area economic activity should, in addition, benefit from a gradual strengthening of demand for exports. Furthermore, the overall improvements in financial markets seen since last year appear to be gradually working their way through to the real economy, as should the progress made in fiscal consolidation. In addition, real incomes have benefited recently from generally lower energy price inflation. This being said, unemployment in the euro area remains high, and the necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and private sectors will continue to weigh on economic activity. The risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area continue to be on the downside. Developments in global money and financial market conditions and related uncertainties may have the potential to negatively affect economic conditions. Other downside risks include higher commodity prices, weaker than expected domestic demand and export growth, and slow or insufficient implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation decreased in October 2013 to 0.7%, from 1.1% in September. This decline was stronger than expected and reflected, in particular, lower food price inflation, a larger fall in energy prices and some weakening in services price inflation. On the basis of current futures prices for energy, annual inflation rates are expected to remain at low levels in the coming months. Underlying price pressures in the euro area are expected to remain subdued over the medium term. At the same time, inflation expectations for the euro area over the medium to long term continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. Such a constellation suggests that we may experience a prolonged period of low inflation, to be followed by a gradual upward movement towards inflation rates below but close to 2% later on. Taking into account today's decisions, the risks to the outlook for price developments are broadly balanced over the medium term. Upside risks relate in particular to higher commodity prices as well as stronger than expected increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, and downside risks stem from weaker than expected economic activity. Turning to the monetary analysis, data for September confirm the subdued underlying growth of broad money (M3) and, in particular, credit. Annual growth in M3 moderated to 2.1% in September, from 2.3% in August. Annual growth in M1 remained strong at 6.6%, reflecting a preference for liquidity, although it was below the peak of 8.7% observed in April. Net capital inflows into the euro area continued to be the main factor supporting annual M3 growth, while the annual rate of change of loans to the private sector remained weak. The annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) stood at 0.3% in September, broadly unchanged since the turn of the year. The annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was -2.7% in September, compared with -2.9% in August. Overall, weak loan dynamics for non-financial corporations continue to reflect primarily their lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. At the same time, the October 2013 bank lending survey tentatively signals a stabilisation in credit conditions for firms and households, in the context of still weak loan demand. Since the summer of 2012 substantial progress has been made in improving the funding situation of banks. In order to ensure an adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions in euro area countries, it is essential that the fragmentation of euro area credit markets declines further and that the resilience of banks is strengthened where needed. The ECB's comprehensive assessment before it adopts its supervisory role under the single supervisory mechanism will further support this confidence-building process. It will enhance the quality of information available on the condition of banks and result in the identification and implementation of necessary corrective actions. Further decisive steps to establish a banking union will help to restore confidence in the financial system. To sum up, taking into account today's decisions, the economic analysis indicates that we may experience a prolonged period of low inflation, to be followed by a gradual upward movement towards inflation rates below, but close to, 2% later on. A cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. As regards fiscal policies, the euro area budget deficit is projected to decline further from 3.1% of GDP in 2013 to 2.5% in 2014, according to the European Commission's autumn 2013 economic forecast. At the same time, the euro area government debt ratio is expected to rise from 95.5% of GDP in 2013 to 95.9% in 2014. In order to put high public debt ratios on a downward path, governments should not unravel their efforts to reduce deficits and sustain fiscal adjustment over the medium term. The composition of fiscal consolidation should be geared towards growth-friendly measures which have a medium-term perspective and combine improving the quality and efficiency of public services with minimising distortionary effects of taxation. Governments must also decisively strengthen efforts to implement the needed structural reforms in product and labour markets. Progress has been made in reducing current account deficits and unit labour cost differentials, but substantial efforts still need to be undertaken with a view to further improving competitiveness, supporting rebalancing within the euro area and creating more flexible and dynamic economies that in turn generate sustainable economic growth and employment."
Malaysia,2013-11-07,"At the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 3.00 percent. The global economy continues to improve at a moderate pace. In the major advanced economies, recovery remains gradual and uneven. In Asia, growth has been sustained by improvements in export performance amid moderating domestic economic activity. Although volatility in the global financial markets has receded, markets remain vulnerable to setbacks and changes in sentiment. Looking ahead, there remain considerable risks that could affect the pace of the global recovery. In the Malaysian economy, the expansion in domestic activity was supported by improvements in exports. Private consumption and investment activity also continued to sustain domestic demand amid a slower pace in public sector spending. Going forward, the growth momentum will benefit from the expected improvement in the external sector amid some moderation in domestic demand. Domestic investment activity will however continue, led by private sector capital spending and the ongoing implementation of infrastructure projects. Domestic demand is expected to moderate, reflecting the public sector consolidation and some moderation in private consumption. Uncertainties in the global environment may also affect the overall growth momentum. Inflation rose to 2.6% in September, reflecting mainly the increase in petrol prices. For the first nine months of the year, inflation remained low at 1.8%. Looking ahead, inflation is expected to edge up driven by domestic cost factors. However, the inflation outlook is expected to be tempered by a stable external price environment, moderate domestic demand pressures, expansion in domestic capacity and improvements in food production and distribution. In the MPC's assessment, there continue to be uncertainties in the balance of risks surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation. The MPC will continue to carefully assess the global and domestic economic and financial developments and their implications on the overall outlook for inflation and growth of the Malaysian economy. The meeting also approved the schedule of MPC meetings for 2014. In accordance with the Central Bank of Malaysia Act 2009, the MPC will convene six times during the year. The meetings will be held over two days, with the Monetary Policy Statement released at 6 p.m. on the second day of the MPC meeting 1.

Russia,2013-11-08,"On 8 November 2013 the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to maintain the Bank of Russia key rate at 5.50 percentage per annum. The decision was based on the assessment of inflation risks and economic growth prospects. The dynamics of the key macroeconomic indicators suggests that the pace of economic growth remains low. Production activity and investment demand remain subdued. Despite increase in particular producer confidence indicators it is too early to draw a conclusion about a reversal in their dynamics. Consumer demand supported by the real wage and retail lending growth remains the major driver for the economic growth. According to the Bank of Russia estimates, gross output stays slightly below its potential level. At the same time the unemployment rate stays at the relatively low level. Nevertheless, given subdued investment activity and sluggish recovery of external demand, the Bank of Russia expects economic growth rate to remain low in the medium term, while substantial widening of the negative output gap is not forecasted. In October, annual CPI inflation increased to 6.3% which exceeded the upper bound of the target range for the current year. The acceleration of monthly inflation was attributed to non-monetary factors including rise in prices for fruits and vegetables, which was unusual for this season, and increase in prices for certain animal products. In October the core inflation annual rate remained at 5.5%. The absence of significant demand-side inflationary pressure in the context of gross output staying slightly below its potential level is one of the factors containing rise in non-food prices and core inflation in recent months. According to the Bank of Russia estimates, factors responsible for acceleration of food prices growth have short-term effect. If current macroeconomic tendencies continue, inflation is projected to decline further in 2014. Nevertheless, more pronounced downward trends in inflation expectations need to be formed to ensure the achievement of inflation goals in the medium term. The Bank of Russia will continue to monitor inflation risks and the downside risks to economic growth. In making monetary policy decisions the Bank of Russia will be guided by the inflation goals and inflation forecast as well as economic growth prospects. The next meeting of the Bank of Russia Board of Directors on monetary policy issues is planned to be held on 13 December 2013; the press-release on the Board of Directors' decision is planned to be published at 13:30 Moscow time.

Pakistan,2013-11-13,"STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN MONETARY POLICY DECISION 13th November, 2013 While the challenges for macroeconomic stability in the external sector remain, the fundamentals of the economy going forward in the backdrop of the recent policy and reform measures appear stable. Notwithstanding rising inflation, the prospects of an economic revival inspired by successful political transition and the resolution of energy related circular debt issue are encouraging. To ensure the economy remains on stable path, further structural reforms are in progress. Although it is too early to conclude about their impact, there are some indications of pickup in economic activity. The growth in LSM has accelerated with year on year increase of. percent during Q1-FY14. Similarly exports have also marginally picked up, growing at. percent in Q1-FY14. The deterioration in the external accounts has continued in FY14, largely on account of weak financial inflows. The external current account had deficit of $1. billion in Q1-FY14, similar to that witnessed in the previous quarter. With imports picking up at relatively higher pace than exports, the widening of the trade deficit mainly explains this. Moreover the financial account balance had net outflow of $68 million. Further taking into account substantial repayments to the IMF. SBP reserves declined by $1. billion during Q1-FY14. The SBP reserves stand at $4. billion as of 1st November 2013. Besides these fundamental factors, the speculative sentiments on account of IMF end September 2013 targets resulted in exchange rate volatility. Such sentiments are an attribute of uncertainty over foreign exchange flows, which are expected to be reduced with sustainable improvement in the external accounts. In this regard, the progress on reforms part of the IMF program is likely to play critical role. For instance, the resolution of the energy related circular debt issue has resulted in improved supply of electricity, which is helpful for the growth in exports. Successful completion of structural benchmarks under the IMF program will also ensure additional financial inflows from other IFIs. In the absence of such reforms, the burden of adjustment falls disproportionately higher on interest and exchange rates that may perpetuate speculative sentiments in the market. Carrying out reforms, particularly those related to fiscal consolidation, are critical for the economy. For instance, expanding the base of direct taxes and rationalizing their rates are key for sustainable expansion of revenue collection. These are also superior to all other indirect taxes, which are regressive in nature and require much broader documentation of the economy. While the fiscal authorities have already progressed in this regard by increasing the GST rate, bringing the informal sector in the tax net is an arduous task. Consequently it is difficult to bring down the fiscal deficit significantly. Keeping fiscal deficit, as evident from the financing side, for Q1-FY14 within the target is plausible; however, the SBP estimates that the fiscal deficit for FY14 would be slightly higher than the budgeted. percent. The decline in the estimated FY14 fiscal deficit, compared to percent in FY13, owes much to the realization of non tax revenues such as the CSF. The first installment of CSF ($322 million) has been realized in October 2013 and the remaining is expected in the current and the forthcoming quarters. Page of STATE BANK OF PAKISTAN Similarly, the realization of the other proceeds is also critical to maintain the deficit within this estimated level. What is more important to consider is the fact that these are either one-off receipts or may not be relied upon on long term basis. more permanent solution still lies in the tax reforms. Similarly rationalization of expenditures is also important. The revision in power tariffs is expected to contribute in curtailing subsidies and thus creating fiscal space for other expenditures. Such fiscal consolidation measures, however, have their inflationary consequences also. Adjustments in administered prices are directly reflected in higher inflation and raise inflationary expectations, as is evident from the current trends in CPI inflation. After witnessing significant decline in FY13, inflationary pressures are resurging and could be observed in the sharp increase in inflation during the first four months of FY14. This trend is being contributed by both food and non-food group, however, the reversal in CPI food inflation is relatively sharper. With the continuing of these trends CPI inflation is likely to remain at an elevated level, between 10. to 1. percent. An increase in inflation while keeping the market interest rates at the current level can increase the incentive for borrowings and discourage savings in the economy. This can potentially increase demand pressure through consumption as well as dampen investment, and thus the productive capacity of the economy. In addition, with fragile external flows, negative real return can encourage outflow of foreign exchange increasing the pressure on exchange rate. In light of the above, the Central Board of Directors of the State Bank of Pakistan has decided to increase the policy rate by 50 bps to 10 percent to take effect 18th November, 2013. Page of."

Based on currently available information the Committee considers that the trend of economic recovery in the US has been maintained despite the temporary slowdowns in improvement of some economic indicators, and that the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area appears to have continued to ease, albeit weakly, while the trends of economic growth in emerging market countries, above all China, have continued to show signs of recovering. The Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward, but judges that the likelihood of changes in global financial market conditions related to QE tapering by the US Federal Reserve, and the continued uncertainties surrounding the US government's budget bill and the increase in its debt ceiling pose downside risks to growth. In Korea, indicators related to domestic demand slumped temporarily, but as exports have sustained their buoyancy the Committee appraises the economic recovery to have continued in line with the trend of growth. On the employment front, the scale of increase in the number of persons employed has expanded, led by increases in the 50- and-above age group and the service sector. The Committee expects that the domestic economy will maintain a negative output gap for a considerable time going forward, although it forecasts that the gap will narrow. Consumer price inflation fell slightly from 0.8% the previous month to 0.7% in October, due mainly to expansions in the extents of decline in the prices of agricultural and petroleum products, but core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices was 1.6% as in the previous month. The Committee forecasts that inflation will remain low for the time being, owing primarily to the inflation reducing effects of policies such as free childcare provision and to the downward stabilization of international agricultural prices. As for the housing market, sales prices in Seoul and its surrounding areas turned upward while the uptrend of those in the rest of the country increased slightly. Leasehold-deposit prices sustained their high rate of increase of the previous month in Seoul and its surrounding areas, and their uptrend in the rest of the country accelerated. The domestic financial markets have moved mainly in response to the reaching of agreement in the US fiscal negotiations and to changes in the expectations of a delay in QE tapering. Stock prices have fallen again, after having risen substantially, in line with shifts in the flows of foreigners' stock investment funds, and the Korean won has depreciated recently, after having sustained a trend of appreciation due to continuation of the current account surplus. Long-term market interest rates have risen, after fluctuating within a narrow range. Looking ahead, while paying close attention to developments in and the influences of external risk factors, and monitoring the effects of the Base Rate cut and of the government's economic policies including the supplementary budget, the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as to keep consumer price inflation within the inflation target range over a medium-term horizon while ensuring that the growth potential is not eroded due to the continuation of slow growth."
Peru,2013-11-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR NOVEMBER 2013 BCRP LOWERED THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE TO 4.0% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to lower the monetary policy reference rate to 4.0 percent. The new level of the reference rate is compatible with an inflation forecast of 2.0 percent in the 2014-2015 forecast horizon and also takes into account that: economic growth in the country is slowing down to rates below the economy's potential level of growth; recent indicators show a lower growth in the world economy; inflation expectations have declined and remain anchored within the target range, and the supply factors that affected inflation transitorily are reversing. This decision is preventive and does not imply a sequence of reductions in the reference interest rate. Inflation in October showed a rate of 0.04 percent (3.04 percent in the last 12 months). Inflation without food and energy registered a rate of 0.13 percent (2.76 percent in the last 12 months) and core inflation showed a rate of 0.23 percent (3.69 percent in the last 12 months). Inflation is expected to remain within the upper band of the target range in the following months due to the lagging effect of the supply shocks and to converge thereafter to the 2 percent target in 2014. Current and advanced indicators of activity show a weakening in the level of economic activity reflecting the lower growth recorded by our exports as a result of both the economic slowdown of our main trading partners and lower export prices. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants and, if necessary, will implement additional easing measures in the BCRP monetary policy instruments. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to reduce the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as described below: Overnight deposits: 3.20 percent. Direct repo and rediscount operations: 4.80 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.80 percent. The Monetary Program for December will be approved on the Board's meeting to be held on December 12, 2013."
Chile,2013-11-19,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 19 November 2013 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to lower the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points, to 4.5% (annual). In the global economy, incoming activity and expectations figures are consistent with a scenario of gradual recovery of advanced economies, led by the United States, and more moderate growth in emerging economies. World-level inflation is still low, partly explained by recent declines in commodity prices. The central banks of the main economies have confirmed their decision to maintain their expansionary monetary policies for a prolonged period. In particular, the ECB lowered its monetary policy rate and renewed some measures to inject liquidity, while the Federal Reserve has held on to its asset purchase plan. The dollar has appreciated across the board in international markets, albeit more intensely against the currencies of emerging economies. Domestically, economic activity has continued to evolve at a moderate pace, in line with the scenario depicted in the last Monetary Policy Report. Third-quarter data and revised figures of earlier quarters confirm the slowdown of all the components of final demand, as was projected. Inflation is behaving moderately and market expectations foresee that it will gradually normalize toward 3% within the next 24 months. Both the nominal and the real exchange rate have depreciated. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. * The Spanish original prevails."
Nigeria,2013-11-19,"Central Bank of Nigeria Communique No. 92 of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting of Monday 18 and Tuesday 19 November, 2013 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met on November 18 and 19, 2013 against the backdrop of widespread uncertainties and risks of deflation in the global economy but stable domestic macroeconomic conditions. Eleven (11) out of the twelve (12) members were in attendance. The Committee reviewed the global and domestic economic environment from January to October 2013 and re-assessed the short- to medium-term risks to inflation, domestic output and financial stability and the outlook for the rest of the year. International Economic Developments The global economy is currently adjusting structurally to the evolving growth dynamics in the advanced and emerging market economies. While growth in the advanced economies has resumed, growth in the emerging economies has slowed down. Global growth averaged 25 per cent in the first half of 2013, same as in the second half of 2012. The United States 1 (US). Japan and a few European countries just emerging from recession are helping to drive the current growth. Improvement in US output is anchored by enhanced industrial production buoyed largely by strong private demand and extra-ordinary accommodative monetary policy. The political standoff over fiscal sustainability, which led to a shutdown of the US Government in October, 2013, was moderated, however, by discretionary spending during the period. Strong signs of growth resumption have emerged from some euro area economies, especially Portugal and Greece. Given the changing global growth dynamics, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) revised its global economic growth forecast in October to 29 per cent in 2013 and 36 per cent in 2014. Global inflation is estimated to fall from 375 per cent in 2012 to 30 per cent in 2013, but could rise marginally in 2014. Food and fuel prices continued to positively moderate global consumer price inflation. In the light of these developments, most central banks responded by either maintaining current policy stance or moderately easing the policy rate in the last three months. The financial markets expect monetary conditions to remain easy through the first quarter of 2014. Indications to this came from the Fed Chairman- designate during her Senate screening. In addition, the Bank of England has given signals that its quantitative easing would continue to late 2014 while the Bank of Japan has also indicated that its quantitative easing would continue until inflation reaches a 20 per cent target. Domestic Economic and Financial Developments Output The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) estimated that real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by 681 per cent in the third quarter of 2013, which was higher than the 618 per cent in Q2, and 648 per cent Q3 of 2012, respectively. Overall growth for 2013 was projected at 687 per cent, up from 658 per cent in 2012, indicating that the economy is remaining on its steady growth trajectory. The non-oil sector remained the major engine of growth recording 795 per cent compared with a decline of 053 per cent for the oil sector in the third quarter of 2013. Agriculture wholesale and retail trade, and services 3 continued to be the drivers of non-oil sector growth contributing 250, 196, and 282 per cent, respectively. The relatively strong domestic growth forecast in an environment of sluggish global growth and sturdy signs of deflation reflected the continuing favourable conditions for increased agricultural production and incentives for strong macroeconomic management. Prices The moderation in consumer price inflation, which began in the fourth quarter of 2012, continued in the third quarter of 2013. The year-on-year headline inflation moderated to 78 per cent in October 2013 from 80 per cent in September. Also food inflation declined to 92 per cent in October from 94 per cent in September 2013. Core inflation, however, rose to 76 per cent in October 2013 from 74 per cent in September. Thus the decline in headline inflation reflected the moderation in food prices. The Committee observed with satisfaction that in the last four months, all the three measures of inflation continued to be within the single digit inflation target. However the Committee noted the potential risks to inflation of increased aggregate spending in the run-up to the 2015 elections. Monetary. Credit and Financial Market Developments Broad money supply (M2) contracted by 616 per cent in October 2013 over the level at end-December 2012. When annualised. M2 contracted by 739 per cent, in contrast to the growth of 824 per cent in the corresponding period of 2012. M2 was also below the growth benchmark of 1520 per cent for 2013. Aggregate domestic credit (net), however, grew by 732 per cent in October 2013, which annualised to a growth rate of 878 per cent over the end-December 2012 level, in contrast to the contraction of 330 per cent in the corresponding period of 2012. The annualised growth rate in aggregate domestic credit (net) at end-October 2013 of 878 per cent was below the provisional benchmark of 2298 per cent for 2013. The decline in M2 was traced mainly to decline in net credit to Federal Government and Net Foreign Assets and other assets (net). Overall Government spending in the 2nd Half of 2013 has been more moderate than it was in the earlier part of the year. The erosion of the fiscal buffers through the depletion of the ECA has further exposed the economy to vulnerabilities while the fall in oil revenue has left capital inflows as the only source of external reserves accretion. The Federal Government debt has also risen phenomenally along with its deposits at the deposit money 5 banks, showing the Government as a net creditor to the system. This underscores the urgent need for the immediate implementation of the Treasury Single Account. The continued delay in returning government accounts to the Central Bank is adding to the huge cost of government debt due to poor cash flow management. Reserve money (RM) declined marginally by N13848 billion or 298 per cent to N4,,51151 billion at end-October 2013, from N4,,64999 billion at end-September 2013. The level of RM at end-October 2013, was below the fourth quarter indicative benchmark of N5,,00988 billion by N49837 billion or 995 per cent. Interest rates in all segments of the money market reflected the tight liquidity conditions in the banking system. The weighted average inter-bank call and OBB rates opened at 1799 and 1692 per cent on September 25, 2013 but closed at 1250 and 1173 per cent, respectively, on November 15, 2013. The capital market continued its rally with the equities market providing the lead. Market Capitalization (MC) increased by 350 per cent from N897 trillion to N1212 6 trillion in the review period. Improved earnings and investor confidence in macroeconomic management and substantial portfolio inflows (as foreign investors took advantage of the favourable domestic economic environment) accounted for the upswing in capital market activities. Generally equity market valuations remained close to their long run median suggesting that equity prices were fully valued and the stock valuations were close to economic fundamentals. External Sector Developments The naira exchange rate remained stable at the w/rDAS and inter-bank segments of the foreign exchange market. The exchange rate at the w/rDAS-SPT during the review period opened at N15731/US$ (including 1% commission) and closed at N15763/US$, representing a depreciation of N032k. The average official exchange rate during the period was N15738/US$. The inter-bank selling rate opened at N16000/US$ and closed at N15865/US$, averaging N16015/US$, representing an appreciation of N135k for the period. However at the BDC segment of the foreign exchange market, the selling rate opened at N16200/US$ and is hovering around N167US$ at present, reflecting the impact of reduction in 7 dollar supply to the segment-as part of the CBN anti-money laundering measures. The Committee noted the increase in external reserves to US$4537 billion as at November 15, 2013, representing an increase of US$126 billion or 285 per cent above the level of US$4411 billion at end- September 2013. External reserves increased by US$095 billion or 214 per cent on a year- on-year basis over the US$4447 billion at end-November 2012. The Committee continued to express its disappointment at the low rate of reserve accretion in spite of strong oil prices; which is a result of the absence of fiscal savings. The Committee’s Considerations The Committee recognized the importance of taking into consideration not just the static indices at the point of meeting but overall strategic objectives and targets, as well as the outlook for the domestic economy and the external environment, especially with this being the last meeting for 2013. The Committee noted the decline in inflation and the benign outlook going into the first half of 2014. It further noted the positive impact of monetary 8 policy in engendering a stable exchange rate regime and attracting portfolio investment thus driving the strong recovery of asset prices on the Nigerian Stock Exchange. It also noted that global monetary conditions were likely to remain loose going into Q1::2014 for a number of reasons. First in the USA, it is clear that the incoming Federal Reserve Chairperson. Janet Yellen, does not see tapering as imminent given the on-going disputes around the budget and the weakness of economic recovery. In England, although recovery appears to be firmly on track, the BoE is clearly not going to consider raising rates until unemployment falls to 7%, probably in late 2014. The BoJ is likely to continue with QE until inflation reaches its 2% target which is a long way off, and the ECB has just lowered its benchmark rate to avert the risk of deflation. For these reasons, the Committee does not anticipate any major internal or external shocks before its next meeting in January 2014. The MPC also noted that AMCON is expected to reduce its debt by N1 trillion in December 2013. The CBN has directed that AMCON redeem its Bonds for cancellation by exchanging them for FGN Treasury Bills on its books. Consequently the only impact of the repayment is that the Balance 9 Sheet of AMCON (and the contingent liability on the FGN from its guarantee of AMCON Bonds) will shrink by N1 trillion. This is positive for the economy and the credit rating of the FGN and the banking industry. Its impact on the markets will be minimal given that only AMCON’s Balance Sheet is affected significantly and AMCON is not a player in these markets. The outlook for 2014, however, portends some potential headwinds that may lead to further tightening in monetary conditions. It is expected that 2014 will be the year for QE- tapering in the US and interest rate rises in Europe, both of which will lead to some pressure on the exchange rate and stock prices due to the impact on capital flows. It is also the year in which election spending is likely to take place domestically, thus bringing more pressure to bear from the fiscal side. As a result, the MPC is of the view that we are not yet at the end of the tightening cycle and may need to tighten further in response to these eventualities next year. The Committee also noted that, while Federal Government spending overall in 2013 has not been significantly higher than in 2012, oil revenues have continued to decline in spite of the relative stability in oil price and output when compared with preceding years. As a result. Excess Crude 10 savings have fallen from about $115b at year-end 2012 to less than $5b on November 14. External Reserves have remained in excess of $45billion only because of a massive inflow in portfolio funds. The implication of this is that financial markets are extremely fragile and susceptible to external shocks. The MPC again calls on the Fiscal Authorities to rebuild buffers in the excess crude account, and this can be done by blocking fiscal leakages in the oil sector and increasing oil revenues. Clearly the major risk on the fiscal side at present is not one of escalation of spending but loss of revenue from oil exports. Finally the Committee formally adopted an inflation target of 6-9% in 2014. It also noted that ECOWAS Heads of State have set a 5% target at the Convergence Council. The MPC reaffirmed its commitment to moving Nigeria firmly into being a low-inflation environment in the medium term. However the MPC recognizes the high cost of rapid adjustment and plans to make the transition gradually. Decision Having considered the success of Monetary Policy in attaining price and exchange rates stability; the potential headwinds in 2014; the ultimate goal of transiting to a truly low – inflation environment; and the need to retain 11 portfolio flows in view of the erosion of fiscal reserve buffers, the committee decided as follows: 1. Nine members voted to keep MPR at 12% +/- 2%; private sector CRR at 12%; public sector CRR at 50% and Liquidity Ratio at 30% 2. One member voted for a 05% reduction in MPR and an increase in public sector CRR from 50% to 75% 3. One member voted for 05% reduction in MPR and an increase in public sector CRR from 50% to 100% The Committee has therefore decided by a majority vote of 9 to 2, to hold all rates at current levels. Thank you for Listening Sanusi Lamido Sanusi. CON Governor Central Bank of Nigeria 19th November, 2013 12."
Turkiye,2013-11-19,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Lending rate at 7.75 percent, borrowing rate at 3.5 percent, and the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 6.75 percent, b) One-week repo rate at 4.5 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, lending rate at 10.25 percent. Data released since the last meeting suggest that final domestic demand and exports continue to grow at a moderate pace. The present policy framework is contributing to the improvement in the current account balance. The cautious monetary policy stance, recently announced macroprudential measures, and weak capital flows will bring down the loan growth rates to more reasonable levels. Accordingly, moderate decline in the current account deficit excluding gold trade is expected to continue. Inflation indicators are likely to hover above the inflation target for some time due to the exchange rate volatility observed during the recent months. In order to contain the impact of these developments on the pricing behavior, the Committee decided to strengthen the cautious stance and reduce the volatility of short term money market rates. To this end, one month repo auctions will be terminated, as a result of which interbank money market rates will materialize around 7.75 percent. The Committee stated that the cautious monetary policy stance should be maintained until the inflation outlook is in line with the medium term targets. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
South Africa,2013-11-21,"South African Reserve Bank PRESS STATEMENT EMBARGO DELIVERY 21 November 2013 STATEMENT OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE Issued by Gill Marcus. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), the headline inflation rate has returned to within the inflation target range. Despite this favourable development, inflation is expected to remain uncomfortably close to the upper end of the target band. Moreover, the upside risks to the inflation outlook remain elevated, dominated by uncertainties primarily relating to both the timing and the speed of the tapering of the US Fed's bond purchasing programme. The domestic growth outlook remains fragile, with third quarter growth expected to have been adversely affected by the protracted work stoppages in the motor vehicle sector in particular, which also contributed to a decline in exports. Both business and consumer confidence remain at low levels. The MPC therefore 2 continues to face the dilemma of upside risks to inflation against a backdrop of a weaker growth outlook and a possible further depreciation of the currency. Having breached the upper end of the inflation target range in July and August, the year-on-year inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban areas declined to 6,0 per cent in September and 5,5 per cent in October. Food and non-alcoholic beverages inflation surprised on the downside, moderating to 4,3 per cent from 6,0 per cent in September, and contributing 0,6 percentage points to the annual CPI increase, compared with 0,9 percentage points in the previous month. Petrol prices increased at a year-on-year rate of 9,3 per cent, down from 12,8 per cent in September. Core inflation, which excludes food, petrol and electricity, was unchanged at 5,3 per cent, while administered price inflation excluding petrol increased marginally to 7,1 per cent. The headline producer price inflation for final manufactured goods was unchanged in September at 6,7 per cent. The headline inflation forecast of the Bank is more or less unchanged since the previous meeting of the MPC. The forecast average inflation rates for 2013 and 2014 are 5,8 per cent and 5,7 per cent respectively, both years 0,1 percentage point lower than in the previous forecast. The forecast for 2015 is unchanged at 5,4 per cent, with inflation expected to average 5,3 per cent in the final quarter of that year. Inflation is expected to remain within the target range for the entire forecast period, with a peak of 5,9 per cent in the second quarter of 2014. 3 The forecast for core inflation for 2013 is unchanged at an average of 5,2 per cent, but has deteriorated for 2014 when it is expected to average 5,6 per cent compared with the forecast of 5,4 per cent previously. The forecast for 2015 remains at 5,3 per cent, ending the year at 5,1 per cent. This upward drift of the underlying inflation measure continues to be driven by the lagged effects of the depreciation of the rand exchange rate and the impact of higher unit labour costs. The global economy is characterised by a hesitant multispeed recovery. The outlook for the US remains positive following third quarter growth of 2,8 per cent, notwithstanding the fiscal headwinds and the unresolved budget and fiscal cliff issues, which remain downside risks. The employment data have generally been positive, prompting speculation that the Fed may begin cutting back on its programme of bond purchases sooner than previously anticipated. There is a great deal of uncertainty around the timing and pace of tapering. The timing is likely to be highly sensitive to labour market developments, and we expect the pace to be gradual to avoid undue impacts on financial markets. However, as evidenced earlier this year, the financial markets reaction will be key to the process and to spillover effects. While the UK economy also appears to be growing relatively strongly, with annualised growth of 3,2 per cent in the third quarter of 2013, hopes for a rebound in the Eurozone have been undermined by weak growth in the third. While the UK economy also appears to be growing relatively strongly, with annualised growth of 3,2 per cent in the third quarter of 2013, hopes for a rebound in the Eurozone have been undermined by weak growth in the third 4 quarter. Having emerged from a prolonged recession in the second quarter, the region recorded an annualised growth rate of 0,4 per cent in the third quarter, with contractions in a number of countries, including France and Italy, and a slowdown in Germany. The Japanese economy shows signs of a sustained recovery, but growth moderated to 1,9 per cent in the third quarter, from around 4 per cent in the previous two quarters. The slowdown in emerging markets remains broad-based but there are signs that some countries, particularly in emerging Asia, may be responding to the recovery in the advanced economies. The outlook for China has also improved and it is expected to maintain its growth rate of around 7,5 per cent, amid recent moves towards further structural reforms. Subdued growth is expected in most of the larger Latin American economies, including Brazil and Mexico. Monetary policy in the advanced economies is expected to remain highly accommodative for some time against the backdrop of subdued headline and core inflation as well as persistently high rates of unemployment. Despite the expected reversal of quantitative easing, the US policy rate is expected to remain at the zero bound for much longer, while slow growth and the risk of deflation prompted the recent further easing of monetary policy by the ECB. Inflation in the UK has declined to below the upper threshold of 2,5 per cent. Emerging market economies are facing generally higher inflation dynamics, due in part to exchange rate reactions to expectations of Fed tapering. Inflation pressures have 5 prompted monetary policy responses in a number of countries including Brazil. India and Indonesia, who have all raised rates. Speculation regarding tapering has been the main driver of rand exchange rate volatility since the previous meeting of the MPC. The rand appreciated to around R9,55 against the US dollar following the September decision by the Fed to delay tapering, and then reached a level of around R10.45 following the November FOMC meeting when market expectations were for an earlier start to tapering. More recently the rand has appreciated somewhat as the expected timing was pushed back by the markets, and also in response to the SARS release of new trade data. The rand has depreciated by 17 per cent against the US dollar since the beginning of the year, and by 15 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. The exchange rate of the rand remains an increasingly upside risk to the inflation outlook, notwithstanding the relatively slow pass-through to consumer prices to date. The challenge facing the MPC is not only to anticipate the timing and speed of Fed tapering, but also to try to assess the extent to which tapering is already priced into the exchange rate. There is a risk that, should there be a stronger or more disorderly response by the markets to actual Fed tapering, the reaction of the exchange rate could be more extreme. These developments have been reflected in the non-resident activity in the domestic bond and equity markets. In September and October, when 6 expectations of Fed tapering were modified, non-residents were net buyers of bonds to the value of R17 billion, more or less reversing the net sales that followed the initial reaction in May. Since early November, however, when risk aversion returned, net sales of bonds have amounted to R9,7 billion. At the same time, net sales of equities have amounted to R14,5 billion. Year to date, non- resident purchases of bonds and equities have totalled R12,8 billion and R4,8 billion respectively. A further risk is the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments, which makes the exchange rate more sensitive to possible capital flow slowdowns or reversals. In the second quarter of 2013 the deficit amounted to 6,5 per cent of GDP, and the published trade data suggest that a further deterioration of the trade account can be expected following the temporary collapse of motor vehicle exports and significantly higher imports in the third quarter. The actual outcome may be ameliorated to some extent by the recent inclusion by SARS of South Africa's merchandise trade data with its Southern African Customs Union (SACU) partners in the trade statistics, made possible by the modernisation of the customs data collections systems. The new inclusive data have resulted in a significant adjustment to the trade statistics published by SARS. However, in compiling the balance of payments accounts in the past, the Bank made estimates of South Africa's trade with Botswana. Lesotho. Namibia and. However, in compiling the balance of payments accounts in the past, the Bank made estimates of South Africa's trade with Botswana. Lesotho. Namibia and 7 Swaziland, based on various sources. The historical trade data in the balance of payments accounts will be revised to account for the differences between the new data and our own previous estimates. These revisions will be published in the December Quarterly Bulletin on 3rd December, and may also result in minor revisions to the GDP data. Nevertheless, the underlying trend of the current account is not expected to change significantly. The domestic economic growth outlook remains fragile. Following a rebound of growth to an annualised 3,0 per cent in the second quarter of 2013, the third quarter outcome is expected to be significantly lower, and more in line with the 0,9 per cent recorded in the first quarter of this year. The Bank's forecast for growth in 2013 has been revised down from 2,0 per cent to 1,9 per cent, while the forecasts for 2014 and 2015 have been revised down to 3,0 per cent and 3,4 per cent respectively, from 3,3 per cent and 3,6 per cent. This is consistent with the Bank's composite leading business cycle indicator which continues to trend sideways, while the RMB/BER business confidence index at 43 points was more or less unchanged in the fourth quarter, indicative of a subdued outlook. The adverse third quarter growth outcome is largely due to a quarter-to-quarter contraction of 2,1 per cent in the manufacturing sector, in part a consequence of the protracted strikes that resulted in a 27,9 per cent decline in the production of motor vehicles, parts and accessories in that quarter. Reflecting these developments, the Kagiso PMI declined to 50,0 index points in September from. Reflecting these developments, the Kagiso PMI declined to 50,0 index points in September from 8 55,6 points in August, but recovered somewhat to 50,7 index points in October. Industrial action and safety related stoppages also impacted negatively on mining output, but despite negative growth in August and September, a positive quarter- to-quarter growth rate of 1,4 per cent was recorded. Encouragingly, the construction sector is showing signs of recovery with a generally steady upward trend in the value of real building plans passed, and the confidence of building contractors in the business confidence index increasing to its highest level in almost six years. The moderating trend in the growth of consumption expenditure by households that has been evident for some time appears to have continued into the third quarter. Retail trade sales recorded a quarter-to-quarter increase of only 0,4 per cent in that quarter, and a month-to-month contraction of 0,7 per cent in September, although wholesale trade was more robust. This is consistent with the FNB/BER consumer confidence index which had reached a 10 year low in the third quarter of 2013, with only a marginal improvement in the fourth quarter. The trends in credit extension are likely to constrain consumption expenditure in the short to medium term. Twelve-month growth in total loans and advances measured 8,4 per cent in September, down from 9,0 per cent in August, while the quarterly growth rate was 5,3 per cent in the third quarter. There are clear indications of a sharp decline in lending to households. Twelve-month growth in 9 general loans to households, mostly unsecured lending, declined to 14,2 per cent in September, the lowest rate of growth since February 2010, while annualised growth over three months was 2,8 per cent. In August and September a contraction was recorded in this category. Growth in mortgage lending, at below 3 per cent, remained subdued despite a small acceleration in September, mainly driven by commercial mortgages. By contrast, instalment sale credit remained buoyant, while twelve-month growth in total loans and advances to companies increased to 10,6 per cent. Household consumption expenditure is, however, expected to be supported to some extent by wage trends. According to Andrew Levy Employment publications, the overall average wage settlement rate in collective bargaining agreements was 7,9 per cent in the first nine months of 2013, compared with 7,6 per cent for 2012 as a whole. Although a number of these settlements are generally well below the initial demands, they are considerably above the upper band of the inflation target, and pose a potential risk to the inflation outlook. According to the Quarterly Labour Force Survey of Statistics South Africa, the official unemployment rate moderated to 24,7 per cent in the third quarter of 2013, from 25,5 per cent a year earlier. This follows an increase in employment of 2,8 per cent or 383,000 jobs over that period. This implies that the economy has only now returned to the same levels of employment attained before the crisis. These figures, however, are in contrast to the Quarterly Employment. These figures, however, are in contrast to the Quarterly Employment 10 Statistics of StatsSA which showed a 0,1 per cent growth in the formal non- agricultural sector from June 2012 to June 2013, and which correlates more closely with GDP trends. Fiscal policy, as outlined in the Medium Term Budget Policy Statement, continues to be countercyclical, attempting to balance the need to support the economy and the need for fiscal consolidation. A deficit of 4,2 per cent is projected for the current fiscal year, and is expected to narrow to 3,0 per cent by 2015/16. Non-interest real expenditure growth is capped at an average of 2,2 per cent over the next three years, and the three-year agreement with civil service unions, due to expire in 2015, is expected to limit the growth in the public sector wage bill. This pace of consolidation should stabilise the net national debt at 44 per cent in 2017/18. Food price inflation moderated to 4,2 per cent in October, from 6,0 per cent in September, with the deceleration in price increases being broad-based. Final manufactured producer food price inflation declined from 7,5 per cent peak in July to 6,8 per cent in September. Agricultural product prices increased by 4,3 per cent at the producer price level in September, with cereals and other crop prices declining by 6,8 per cent. This was in line with lower international food commodity prices, which offset the impact of the weaker exchange rate to some extent. While food price inflation may continue to moderate in the short term,. While food price inflation may continue to moderate in the short term, 11 upside pressures can be expected from the exchange rate and the fact that meat price declines, due in part by drought-induced culling, are unlikely to persist. International oil prices have remained relatively contained below the US$110 per barrel level since the previous MPC meeting. These prices continue to be dominated by political developments in the Middle East, and the global growth outlook. Should international oil prices and the exchange rate remain at current levels, a small increase in the domestic petrol price is likely in December following a cumulative 48 cents decrease in October and November. It is important to note, however, that further weakness in the exchange rate will pass through quickly into these prices. Despite the better-than-expected October inflation outcome, the Monetary Policy Committee continues to assess the risks to the inflation outlook to be on the upside, mainly as a result of further potential exchange rate pressures. Tapering by the Fed is inevitable, but until a decision is taken financial markets globally are likely to experience heightened volatility. There is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the extent to which US policy actions are already priced in to the exchange rate. Compounding the risks to the exchange rate is the stubbornly wide current account deficit, notwithstanding recent revisions to the trade data. The deficit increases South Africa's sensitivity to global spillover effects. The MPC is mindful 12 of the adjustment lags and will be watching carefully for signs of a positive current account response. We need to take advantage of the depreciated exchange rate and not allow the benefits to be eroded through higher wage and other input prices. Action will be required should the adjustment mechanism not operate effectively. While the exchange rate impact on CPI is increasingly evident in the core inflation measure, to date the pass-through has been relatively muted. But this is unlikely to persist should there be a significant further depreciation. At the same time the policy dilemma is underlined by the deterioration in the growth outlook. The committee assesses the risks to be on the downside, amid continued supply disruptions and low business and consumer confidence. The downward trend of household consumption expenditure is indicative of relatively weak demand conditions in the economy, and slower bank credit extension to households is likely to reinforce this trend. The inflation forecast remains uncomfortably close to the upper level of the inflation target range but our central forecast remains within the target. Given the increased upside risks to the outlook, we do not see room for further monetary accommodation. We will continue to monitor developments carefully on an ongoing basis and remain committed to act as required. The MPC has decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at 5,0 per cent per annum at this stage. 13 MPC meeting dates for 2014: January: Monday 27 to Wednesday 29 March: Tuesday 25 to Thursday 27 May: Tuesday 20 to Thursday 22 July: Tuesday 15 to Thursday 17 September: Tuesday 16 to Thursday 18 November: Tuesday 18 to Thursday 20 Gill Marcus GOVERNOR Contact person: Candice Jeffreys +27 12 313 4209 Candice."
Israel,2013-11-25,"The inflation environment remains low, despite the greater thanexpected increase in the CPI for October. The rate of inflation over the past 12 months was near the midpoint of the target, and a decline in inflation expectations for the coming year is observed. In the third quarter, the growth rate declined and weakness was seen in manufacturing and exports, but initial indicators for the fourth quarterpoint to some recovery. Likewise, the decline in unemployment and the increase in the employment rate continued in the third quarter, though the increase in employment was focused in public services, in contrast to the virtual standstill over time in business sector employment. Over the month since the previous interest rate decision, the shekel weakened by about 0.9 percent against the dollar, but the shekel's weakness was more moderate than that of most currencies against the dollar. The shekel strengthened by about 0.5 percent against the effective exchange rate. Monetary policy in major economies remains very accommodative. Despite the apparent improvement in the US labor market, there is still uncertainty regarding the date that a tapering process will begin. The ECB reduced its interest rate this month by 0.25 percentage points, and reiterated its commitment to accommodative policy for an extended period. The OCED revised its global growth forecast downward, primarily due to expected additional moderation in emerging market economies, while its forecast for overall OECD growth remained virtually unchanged. The increase in housing prices continues, along with a rapid pace of new mortgages taken out. Guidelines published by the Supervisor of Banks, which limit the share of repayment out of income, the share of the loan which may be granted at variable rate interest, and the term until final loan repayment, are expected to reduce the risk to mortgage borrowers and the banking system. To viewthis press release as a Word document. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor developments in the Israeli and global economies and in financial markets, particularly in light of the continuing uncertainty in the global economy. The Bank will use the tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decision for December 2013 will be published on December 9, 2013. Thedecision regarding the interest rate for January 2014 will be published at 17:30 on Monday. December 23, 2013. Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for October increased by 0.3 percent, compared with analysts' projections for no change, on average. The CPI was influenced by increases in the fruit and vegetables and the clothing and footwear components, which were moderated by a decline in the transport and communication component. The rate of inflation measured over the preceding 12 months was 1.8 percent, slightly below the midpoint of the inflation target range. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Inflation expectations from various sources continued to decline slightly this month. Private forecasters' inflation expectations for the next 12 CPI readings declined to 1.6 percent, on average. Inflation expectations derived from the capital marketdeclined to 1.3 percent, while expectations for the next 12 CPI readings derived from banks' internal interest rates declined slightly, to 1.2 percent. Inflation expectations for medium and long terms remained unchanged and are slightly above the midpoint of the inflation target range. Based on projections of most private forecasters, as well as on data inherent in the Telbor interest rate and the makam curve, there is an expectation, viewed as low probability, of one reduction in the Bank of Israel interest rate in the coming three months. Real economic activity: The first estimate of National Accounts data forthe third quarter indicates a decline in the rate of growth, to 2.2 percent (all National Accounts data below are in annualized terms, seasonally adjusted). The decline in growth resulted from a decline in exports (excludingdiamonds and start-ups), which contracted by 12.4 percent to reach their lowest level since 2010, and an increase of 10.8 percent in imports (civilian, excluding ships, aircraft, and diamonds). Domestic uses increased by a relatively high rate, with notable growth of 16.9 percent in fixed capital formation. It is likely that the volatility in quarterly National Accounts data is influenced by the method of calculating the impact of natural gas production. Initial indicators for the fourth quarter point to some recovery,with foreign trade data for October showing 5.6 percent growth in exports.Growth was especially pronounced in high tech exports, but an employment weighted exports index, which gives a higher weight to labor intensive industries, increased as well. An increase in VAT revenues from domestic production began to increase again, and Consumer Confidence Indices compiled by Bank Hapoalim and by the Central Bureau of Statistics improved in October. The Climate Index, based on the Business Tendency Survey of the Central Bureau of Statistics, indicates a 0.28 percent monthly rate of growth in November, but with a marked deterioration in manufacturing, stemming from a decline in orders for exports and in manufacturing. Manufacturing weakness can also be seen in the trend of decline in the Industrial Production index, a trend which has continued for about a year, and in the Purchasing Managers Index, which continues to be situated below the 50-point level, considered the boundary between economic expansion and contraction. The Composite State of the Economy Index for October increased by 0.2 percent, similar to previous months. An index based on Google searches, which serves as a leading indicator for private consumption, moderated slightly this month, but continues to indicate the probability that domestic demand will increase faster than the long term rate. The labor market: Labor force survey data indicate an increase in the employment rate, from 59.3 percent in the second quarter to 59.9 percent in the third quarter, and a decline in the unemployment rate, from 6.8 percent to 6.1 percent. Among the prime working ages, too, the employment rate increased, from 74.2 percent to 74.5 percent, and the unemployment rate declined from 5.9 percent to 5.3 percent. Nominal wages increased by 1.3 percent and real wages increased by 0.6 percent in June-August, based on seasonally adjusted data, compared with March-May. Health tax receiptsby the National Insurance Institute, which provide an indication of total wage payments in the economy, were 5.6 percent higher in September-October, on a nominal basis, than in the corresponding two months of the previous year: reflecting an increase in their growth rate after an extended decline in recent months. In August, the trend of increase in employee posts in public services continued, with a virtual standstill in employee posts in the business sector, and increased salaries in both sectors. In October, there was an increase of 3.8 percent in the number of job vacancies, but it was focused in industries such as health and education. Excludingthose industries, the decline in the number of job vacancies in the private sector continued. Budget data: In January-October, the cumulative deficit in the government's domestic activity was NIS 11.7 billion below the seasonal path consistent with the deficit ceiling for 2013 of 4.65 percent of GDP. The below-path deficit reflects an expenditure level which is NIS 9.4 billion lower than the path consistent with full performance of budget expenditures, and revenues: deriving from, among other things, one-time taxevents: which are NIS 2.2 billion above the path consistent with the revenues estimated in the budget. Assuming that there will be some increase in the rate of expenditure from the budget, and taking into account additional one-time revenues expected to be received by the end of the year, the deficit in 2013 is expected to be around 3.5 percent of GDP. The expenditure path and taxes planned under the 2014 budget are consistent with the deficit target for that year (3 percent of GDP). The foreign exchange market: From the monetary policy discussion on October 27, 2013, through November 22, 2013, the shekel weakened by 0.9 percentagainst the dollar, while most other currencies weakened more significantly against the dollar. The shekel strengthened by 1.4 percent against the euro, and by 0.5 percent in terms of the nominal effective exchange rate. Since the beginning of the year, the shekel has appreciated by 5.7 percent in terms of the effective exchange rate. The capital and money markets: From the monetary policy discussion on October 27, 2013, through November 22, 2013, the Tel Aviv 25 Index increased by 4 percent, a rate higher than that in most advanced economies and in contrast to the trend of decline in emerging markets. Government bond yields declined slightly along the CPI-indexed curve, and increased slightly on theunindexed curve. The yield to maturity on a 10-year unindexed bond increased from 3.56 percent to 3.62 percent. The yield differential between 10-year Israeli government bonds and equivalent 10-year US Treasury securities declined markedly, to only 87 basis points. Makam yields declined along the entire curve, and the 1-year yield declined during the period to only 0.85 percent. Israel's sovereign risk premium as measured by the five-yearCDS spread remained virtually unchanged, at only 108 basis points. The Tel-Bond 60 Index increased by about 0.6 percent. At the same time, spreads in the corporate bond market remained low. The money supply: In the twelve months ending in October, the M 1 monetary aggregate (cash held by the public and demand deposits) increased by 13.5 percent, and the M 2 aggregate (M 1 plus unindexed deposits of up to one year) increased by 5.6 percent. Developments in the credit markets: The total outstanding debt of the business sector declined by about NIS 5.4 billion in September, to NIS 786 billion, (a decline of 0.7 percent). The decline derived primarily from the appreciation of the shekel against the dollar and from about NIS 0.3 billionin net debt repaid. The private nonfinancial sector issued about NIS 3.7 billion in bonds: mostly tradable bonds: in October, compared with a monthly average of NIS 2.5 billion since the beginning of the year. With that, bond market spreads stabilized at a low level. Outstanding household debt increased by 0.2 percent in September, to NIS 403 billion, with an increase of 0.5 percent in households' housing debt, to NIS 285 billion. In October, there were about NIS 4.4 billion in new mortgages taken out, similar to the monthly average since the beginning of the year. The average interest rate on new unindexed, variable-rate mortgages declined by about 0.23 percentage points in October, against the background of the Bank of Israel interest rate reduction. In the CPI-indexed track, the interest rate on variable rate mortgages increased by about 0.06 percentage points, while theinterest rate on fixed rate mortgages increased by 0.35 percentage points,against the background of the guidelines published by the Supervisor of Banks in August. The housing market: The housing component of the CPI (based on residential rents) resumed its increase, increasing by 0.1 percent in October. In the twelve months ending in October, this component increased by 3.7 percent,compared to an increase of 2.7 percent in the 12 months ended in September. Home prices, which are published in the Central Bureau of Statistics survey of home prices but are not included in the CPI, increased by 0.6 percentin August-September, and earlier indices were revised upward. Overthe 12 months ending in September prices increased by 10.1 percent, similar to their increase in the 12 months ended in August. The number of building starts, on an annualized basis, was about 42,500 in August. In September,the decline in the number of housing transactions continued, but this is apparently the result of seasonal factors. The global economy: The global situation indicates continued moderate growth of the global economy with a steady decline in growth forecasts. The OECD revised its global growth forecast downward this month, primarily as a result of expectations of further moderation in emerging market economies. The US returns to lead the global economy with generally encouraging data. Third quarter GDP grew by 2.8 percent (due to, among other things, an increase in inventory), and employment data dispelled concern that the politicaluncertainty would have a severe negative impact on the economy, showing a larger than expected increase in nonfarm payrolls. Against this background,there were assessments that the tapering process may start as early as December, but most estimations still point to the first quarter of 2014 as thelikely time for the process to begin. In contrast, in Europe, there was increased evidence that growth is still not stable. GDP grew during the thirdquarter at a moderate (quarterly) rate of 0.1 percent, and manufacturing and services purchasing indices were disappointing. Against this background,and the decline in the inflation rate over the past 12 months to 0.7 percent, the ECB, reduced its interest rate to a record low level of 0.25 percent, and the President of the ECB reiterated his commitment to continue accommodative monetary policy for a long time. Credit rating agency S&P reduced France's credit rating this month. In Greece, uncertainty increased following demands for continued budget cuts, while in Portugal. Ireland and Spain, there were indications of an improvement in the fiscal situation. In order to meet the inflation target set in the Czech Republic, its central bank announced this month a threshold level for the exchange rate of the koruna against the euro, and declared that it would intervene in the market in order to prevent an appreciation beyond that exchange rate. In the UK, data were published pointing to the entrenchment of growth, and the Bank of England increased its growth forecast for this year and for next year.In Japan, third quarter growth was 0.5 percent, as expected. In emerging markets, prices declined in the capital and foreign exchange markets, against the background of continued concerns about the tapering process. In China, several macro figures surprised to the upside, and the credit growth rateslowed, while the authorities declared an outline for reforms to strengthen the free market over the next ten years, and the Governor of the central bank announced his intention to make the exchange rate regime more flexible. Prices of oil, agricultural commodities and metals declined this month, and the global inflation environment is low, to the point of concern about deflation in some countries. The main considerations behind the decision. The decision to keep the interest rate for December 2013 unchanged at 1 percent is consistent with the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, which is intended to entrench the inflation rate within the price stability target of 1-3 percent a year over the next twelve months, and to support growth while maintaining financial stability. The path of the interest rate in the future depends on developments in the inflation environment, growth in Israel and in the global economy, the monetary policies of major central banks, and developments in the exchange rate of the shekel. The following are the main considerations underlying the decision: ; The inflation environment remains low, despite the greater thanexpected increase in the CPI for October. The Bank will use the tools available to it to achieve its objectives of price stability, the encouragement of employment and growth, and support for the stability of the financial system, and in this regard will keep a close watch on developments in the asset markets, including the housing market. ; The minutes of the monetary discussions prior to the interest rate decision for December 2013 will be published on December 9, 2013."
Hungary,2013-11-26,"At its meeting on 26 November 2013, the Monetary Council reviewed the latest economic and financial developments and voted to reduce the central bank base rate by 20 basis points from 3.40% to 3.20%, with effect from 27 November 2013. In the Council's judgement, the expansion of the Hungarian economy is likely to continue this year, followed by a further pick-up in growth next year. While the pace of activity is strengthening, the level of output remains below its potential and high, but falling, unemployment exceeds its long-term level determined by structural factors. The Council expects external economic activity to strengthen gradually and weak domestic demand conditions to persist. As a result, inflationary pressures in the economy are likely to remain subdued in the medium term. Inflation continued to fall in October, mainly reflecting developments in food and administered prices, in addition to the decline in fuel prices. The Bank's measures of underlying inflation capturing medium-term developments in inflation remained broadly unchanged relative to previous months. The low rate of underlying inflation since the beginning of the year reflects the disinflationary impact of weak domestic demand and the external environment. Subdued wage dynamics suggest that companies are adjusting to higher production costs mainly through the labour market, and therefore the pass-through into consumer prices is likely to be limited and gradual. The low inflation environment may help anchor inflation expectations. In the Council's judgement, therefore, inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate over the medium term. In the current environment, monetary policy can contribute to meeting the inflation target over the medium term by maintaining accommodative monetary conditions. The preliminary estimate of GDP growth for the third quarter suggests a gradual improvement in the outlook for economic growth. Growth is expected to pick up further in the coming quarters, with both exports and domestic demand components likely to be contributing to this. The improvement in domestic demand is likely to be gradual, reflecting ongoing deleveraging and the cautious behaviour of households. Export growth is likely to continue in line with the expansion in external demand, which is expected to pick up markedly starting from the end of this year. Overall, the global financial environment has been volatile recently, due to uncertainty about the future of non-conventional measures used by global central banks. There has been a slight deterioration in perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy, simultaneously with a new wave of capital outflows from emerging markets. In the Council's judgement, the global financial environment remains supportive overall, but volatile sentiment in global financial markets continues to pose a risk, which in turn calls for maintaining a cautious approach to policy. In the Council's judgement, there remains a significant degree of unused capacity in the economy and inflationary pressures are likely to remain moderate over a sustained period. A further reduction in interest rates is consistent with meeting the 3% inflation target in the medium term. Global financial markets continue to be volatile. A sustained and marked shift in perceptions of the risks associated with the Hungarian economy may influence the room for manoeuvre in monetary policy. In the Council's view, considering the outlook for inflation and the real economy and taking into account perceptions of the risks associated with the economy, further cautious easing of policy may follow."
Armenia,2013-12-02,"Press Release 12.02.2013 Interest rate unchanged, 8 percent In the February 12th of 2013 Meeting the Board of CBA decided to leave the Refinancing Rate of CBA unchanged, at 8 percent. There was 2.9 percent inflation recorded in January of 2013, and the 12-month inflation reached 2.6 percent, staying close to the lower bound of the confidence band of 4 percent ±1.5 pp. The Central Bank estimates that in the first half of 2013 the 12-month inflation will grow and in the forecast horizon it will stabilize around the target. The Board admitted that because uncertainties over political solutions to debt problems in industrialized economies are persisting, it is anticipated that world economic growth rates would slowly recover. Given small impact of external demand, international prices of major raw materials and food products will behave relatively steady whilst staying at existing high levels. In 2012, with the economy potential and agricultural output volumes growing, a real consumption surplus growth was discernible in a low inflation environment; in the forecast horizon it is anticipated that such surplus growth would gradually stabilize around the equilibrium level. Under such conditions economic growth is expected to slow to some extent and rest at a long-term steady-state level. In expectation of sluggish private demand and neutral impact of the fiscal policy, one will see a non-inflationary influence on domestic prices from the domestic economy. The Board summed up that in view of the aforementioned developments in external and domestic economies the currently used policy rate may remain the tool with which the 4.0 percent target of the 12-month inflation can be reached. Currently, risks in the forecast horizon are estimated as balanced, associated with the development perspective of external and domestic economies. In the event such risks materialize in whatever direction, the Central Bank may consider adjusting the policy rate as appropriate. More information on the setting of interest rate will be available in Inflation Report which will be due in the coming 10 days. The Central Bank Public Relations."
Poland,2013-12-04,"Warsaw, 4 December 2013 Information from the meeting of the Monetary Policy Council held on 3-4 December 2013 The Council decided to keep NBP interest rates unchanged:  reference rate at 2.50% on an annual basis;  lombard rate at 4.00% on an annual basis;  deposit rate at 1.00% on an annual basis;  rediscount rate at 2.75% on an annual basis. Growth in global economic activity remains moderate. In 2013 Q3. GDP growth accelerated slightly in the United States, while in the euro area it slowed down to a level somewhat above zero. At the same time, economic activity growth in the major emerging economies continued to run at a low  as for those countries  level. Moderate growth in global economic activity and decline in energy prices were conducive to inflation decrease in many countries. The monetary policy of major central banks remains highly expansionary. In November, the European Central Bank lowered its main policy rate, whereas other major central banks maintained the current scale of their monetary expansion. In Poland. GDP data for 2013 Q3 confirmed the continuation of a gradual economic recovery. After several quarters of declining, domestic demand increased somewhat in 2013 Q3, driven by rising consumption and a slight increase in investment. This was accompanied by lower positive contribution of net exports and still negative contribution of change in inventories to GDP growth. October saw a minor slowdown in the annual growth of industrial output and retail sales. Construction and assembly output continued to fall, albeit at a slower pace. Yet, business climate indicators suggest a further gradual recovery in the coming quarters. The gradual improvement in economic conditions is accompanied by fading negative trends in the labour market. According to the Labour Force Survey, in 2013 Q3 the number of persons working in the economy was slightly higher than a year before. This contributed to a small decline in the unemployment rate in annual terms, which however remains elevated. In 2013 Q3 wage growth in the economy increased somewhat. Growth in lending to the private sector remains limited. In October, the annual increase in lending to enterprises and households persisted at a low level. However, since mid-2013 growth in consumer loans has been gradually gathering pace. 1/2 Demand and cost pressures in the economy remain low. CPI inflation in October fell to 0.8% y/y (from 1.0% y/y in September), continuing well below the inflation target of 2.5%. This was accompanied by persistently low core inflation and a fall in producer prices in industry. At the same time, inflation expectations remained low. In the opinion of the Council, gradual economic recovery is likely to continue in the coming quarters, however, inflationary pressures will remain subdued. Therefore, the Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged. The Council maintains its assessment that NBP interest rates should be kept unchanged at least until the end of the first half of 2014. In the opinion of the Council, lowering interest rates in the first half of 2013 and keeping them unchanged in subsequent quarters supports recovery of the domestic economy, gradual return of inflation to the target and stabilisation in the financial markets."
Euroarea,2013-12-05,"Ladies and gentlemen. I am very pleased to welcome you to our press conference. I will now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by the Commission Vice-President. Mr Rehn. Based on our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Incoming information and analysis have confirmed our assessment and monetary policy decisions of last month. Underlying price pressures in the euro area are expected to remain subdued over the medium term. In keeping with this picture, monetary and credit dynamics remain subdued. At the same time, inflation expectations for the euro area over the medium to long term continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. Such a constellation suggests that we may experience a prolonged period of low inflation, to be followed by a gradual upward movement towards inflation rates below, but close to, 2% later on. Our monetary policy stance will remain accommodative for as long as necessary, and will thereby continue to assist the gradual economic recovery in the euro area. In this context, the Governing Council confirmed its forward guidance that it continues to expect the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time. This expectation continues to be based on an overall subdued outlook for inflation extending into the medium term, given the broad-based weakness of the economy and subdued monetary dynamics. With regard to money market conditions and their potential impact on our monetary policy stance, we are monitoring developments closely and are ready to consider all available instruments. Let me now explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. Following a rise of 0.3% in the second quarter of 2013, real GDP in the euro area increased by 0.1%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter. Developments in survey-based confidence indicators up to November are consistent with a positive growth rate also in the fourth quarter of the year. Looking ahead to 2014 and 2015, output is expected to recover at a slow pace, in particular owing to some improvement in domestic demand supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance. Euro area economic activity should, in addition, benefit from a gradual strengthening of demand for exports. Furthermore, the overall improvements in financial markets seen since last year appear to be working their way through to the real economy, as should the progress made in fiscal consolidation. In addition, real incomes have benefited recently from lower energy price inflation. At the same time, unemployment in the euro area remains high, and the necessary balance sheet adjustments in the public and the private sector will continue to weigh on economic activity. This assessment is also reflected in the December 2013 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, which foresee annual real GDP declining by 0.4% in 2013 before increasing by 1.1% in 2014 and 1.5% in 2015. Compared with the September 2013 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the projection for real GDP growth for 2013 has remained unchanged and it has been revised upwards by 0.1 percentage point for 2014. The risks surrounding the economic outlook for the euro area are assessed to be on the downside. Developments in global money and financial market conditions and related uncertainties may have the potential to negatively affect economic conditions. Other downside risks include higher commodity prices, weaker than expected domestic demand and export growth, and slow or insufficient implementation of structural reforms in euro area countries. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation increased in November 2013 to 0.9%, from 0.7% in October. The increase was broadly as expected and reflected, in particular, an upward base effect in energy prices and higher services price inflation. On the basis of prevailing futures prices for energy, annual inflation rates are expected to remain at around current levels in the coming months. Over the medium term, underlying price pressures in the euro area are expected to remain subdued. At the same time, inflation expectations for the euro area over the medium to long term continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. Broadly in line with this assessment, the December 2013 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area foresee annual HICP inflation at 1.4% in 2013, at 1.1% in 2014 and at 1.3% in 2015. In comparison with the September 2013 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the projection for inflation for 2013 has been revised downwards by 0.1 percentage point and for 2014 it has been revised downwards by 0.2 percentage point. The risks to the outlook for price developments are seen to be broadly balanced over the medium term. Upside risks relate to higher commodity prices and stronger than expected increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, while downside risks stem from weaker than expected economic activity. Concerning the staff macroeconomic projections, let me inform you that the Governing Council has decided to publish more details as of December 2013. You will receive this material today after the press conference. Turning to the monetary analysis, data for October confirm the assessment of subdued underlying growth in broad money (M3) and credit. Annual growth in M3 moderated to 1.4% in October, from 2.0% in September. Annual growth in M1 remained strong at 6.6%, reflecting a preference for liquidity, although it was below the peak of 8.7% observed in April. Net capital inflows into the euro area continued to be the main factor supporting annual M3 growth, while the annual rate of change of loans to the private sector remained weak. The annual growth rate of loans to households (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) stood at 0.3% in October, broadly unchanged since the beginning of the year. The annual rate of change of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for loan sales and securitisation) was -2.9% in October, following -2.8% in September and -2.9% in August. Overall, weak loan dynamics for non-financial corporations continue to reflect their lagged relationship with the business cycle, credit risk and the ongoing adjustment of financial and non-financial sector balance sheets. Since the summer of 2012 substantial progress has been made in improving the funding situation of banks. In order to ensure an adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions in euro area countries, it is essential that the fragmentation of euro area credit markets declines further and that the resilience of banks is strengthened where needed. The ECB's comprehensive assessment before it adopts its supervisory role under the single supervisory mechanism will further support this confidence-building process. It will enhance the quality of information available on the condition of banks and result in the identification and implementation of necessary corrective actions. Further decisive steps to establish a banking union will help to restore confidence in the financial system. To sum up, the economic analysis indicates that we may experience a prolonged period of low inflation, to be followed by a gradual upward movement towards inflation rates below, but close to, 2% later on. A cross-check with the signals from the monetary analysis confirms this picture. As regards fiscal policies, the Governing Council welcomes the European Commission's assessment of the 2014 draft budgetary plans which were submitted in October for the first time under the “two-pack” regulations. In order to put high public debt ratios on a downward path, governments should not unravel their efforts to reduce deficits and sustain fiscal adjustment over the medium term. In particular, consolidation measures should be growth-friendly and have a medium-term perspective, so as both to improve public services and minimise the distortionary effects of taxation. At the same time, there is a need to push ahead with product and labour market reforms, in order to improve competitiveness, raise potential growth, generate employment opportunities and foster the adaptability of our economies."
Egypt,2013-12-05,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release December 5, 2013 In its meeting held on December 5, 2013, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut the overnight deposit rate, overnight lending rate, and the rate of the CBE's main operation by 50 basis points to 825 percent, 925 percent, and 875 percent, respectivel. The discount rate was also cut by 50 basis points to 875 percen. Headline CPI increased by 106 percent (m/m) in October compared to 157 percent in September, bringing the annual rate to 1044 percent in October from 1015 percent in the previous mont. The latest monthly developments in headline inflation were largely driven by higher prices of several domestic food items on the back of supply bottlenecks in the distribution channels, despite the decline in international food prices, in addition to the effect of Eid festivitie. Moreover these bottlenecks also caused a sharp rise in the prices of butane gas cylinder. On the other hand, core CPI increased by 117 percent (m/m) in October following an increase of 170 percent in September on the back of the above mentioned increases in food price. Despite of the monthly increase, the annual rate remained at 1115 percent in October on the back of favorable base effects from last yea. While upside risks to the inflation outlook continue to moderate as the possibility of a rebound in international food prices is unlikely in light of recent global developments, annual inflation could increase above their current levels in November and December, despite of the expected seasonal slowdown in the monthly rates (unfavorable base effect. Meanwhile real GDP growth registered 15 percent in 2012/2013 Q4, bringing the annual growth rate for the whole year of 2012/2013 to 21 percent, following a similarly feeble growth rate of 22 percent recorded in 2011/201. Economic activity remained sluggish in 2012/2013 on the back of modest growth rates in most of the key sectors, namely manufacturing, construction and tourism, in addition to the contraction in the petroleum secto. In the meantime, investment levels remained low given the heightened uncertainty that faced market participants since early 2011 and the weak credit growth to the private secto. Looking ahead, downside risks that surround the global recovery on the back of challenges facing the Euro Area and the softening growth in emerging markets could pose downside risks to domestic GDP going forwar. The pronounced downside risks to domestic GDP combined with the persistently negative output gap since 2011 will limit upside risks to the inflation outlook going forwar. Given that the downside risks to the GDP outlook outweigh the upside risks to the inflation outlook, the MPC decided to cut the key CBE rate. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium‐ter. Dr Rania Al‐Mashat Sub Governor.

Armenia,2013-12-11,"Press Release 12.11.2013 Interest rate lowered by 0.5 percent In the November 12th of 2013 Meeting the Board of CBA decided to cut the Refinancing Rate of CBA by 0.5 percent to 8.0 percent. There was 0.3 percent inflation in October of 2013 against 1.2 percent inflation recorded in the same period of the previous year; the 12-month inflation continued to reduce and in late October it reached 7.1 percent. The down-sloping path of inflation was mainly driven by tightened monetary conditions and lower-than-projected economic growth rates. The Board reckons that the 12-month inflation will subside in the upcoming months too, pointing to the inflationary expectations as they further remain anchored. The Board acknowledged that the developments in the external sector were in line with the projections. Trends of slower global economic recovery were maintained whilst certain non-inflationary trends were observable in raw materials and food product markets in the world. On the back of such developments, no significant inflationary pressures from the external environment will be expected in the forecast horizon. The developments in the domestic economy for the past nine months marked some slowing in the economic growth rates amid reduced value added in construction as well as high inflationary environment fuelled by the increases in energy tariffs. The Government's fiscal policy carried out early in the year also contributed to the weakening of the domestic demand. However, starting from the fourth quarter, the Government is implementing an expansionary fiscal policy, which will continue throughout the next year, according to the draft budget 2014. The Board believes currently lax monetary conditions match up with the slowing of economic activity and mitigating inflationary environment, while further course of the monetary policy of the CBA will also depend on how the fiscal policy will progress. The Board has consensus that, in expectation of economic developments, the 12-month inflation would reduce faster than previously forecast and return to its target in the mid of 2014. The Board also anticipates that in the forecast horizon the inflation would remain within the confidence band. More information on setting of the interest rate will be available in Inflation Report (Q4 2013 Monetary Policy Program) due on November 22nd, 2013. Press Service of the Central Bank."
Philippines,2013-12-11,"Statement by BSP Governor Amando M Tetangco. At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to keep the BSP's key policy rates at3.50 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) facility and 5.50 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) facility. The interest rates on term RRPs. RPs, and special deposit accounts (SDAs) were also kept steady. The reserve requirement ratios were left unchanged as well. The Monetary Board's decision is based on its assessment that the inflation environment remains manageable. While inflation forecasts have slightly risen due to the recent increase in global oil prices, utility rate adjustments, and the impact of the recent typhoons, the future inflation path continues to be within the target over the policy horizon since the uptick is expected to be largely transitory. Meanwhile, market expectations of inflation remain consistent with the target range. Nonetheless, the Monetary Board is mindful that the balance of risks to the inflation outlook is still weighted toward the upside given the potential increases in food prices as well as the pending petitions for further adjustments in utility rates. At the same time, the Monetary Board pays close attention to the evolving economic growth and liquidity dynamics and their implications for price and financial stability. While global economic conditions could be challenging, prospects for domestic activity are expected to stay firm, supported by buoyant domestic demand as well as favorable consumer and business sentiment. Moreover, as credit expands in lock-step with output growth, the economy's improved absorptive capacity will likewise be sustained, thus mitigating inflation pressures. Going forward, the BSP will continue to monitor emerging price and output conditions to ensure the consistency of the monetary policy stance with stable prices and sustainable economic growth."
Chile,2013-12-12,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 12 December 2013 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile kept the monetary policy interest rate at 4.5% (annual). In the global economy, incoming figures are consistent with the scenario depicted in our Monetary Policy Report. Our trading partners are growing somewhat below their historic average, but a recovery is expected in the coming quarters, grounded on the rebound of developed economies, especially the United States, and the stabilization of emerging markets. Over the past month, commodity price indexes showed increases in most components, including copper. Global inflation remains low. Market expectations are that the tapering of the Federal Reserve's asset purchase program will begin in the coming months, so U.S. long-term interest rates have risen, and the dollar has appreciated in world markets. International financial conditions remain tighter than they were in the first part of this year or in previous years, with harsher effects on those more vulnerable emerging economies. The Chilean economy has been gradually losing strength. Output is growing slightly below trend, and a slowdown is observed in domestic expenditure, as described in the Monetary Policy Report. The peso has depreciated. Recent inflation indicators, as well as private expectations, are consistent with inflation converging to the target within the monetary policy horizon. The Board reiterates its commitment to conduct monetary policy with flexibility, so that projected inflation stands at 3% over the policy horizon. Any future changes in the monetary policy rate will depend on the implications of domestic and external macroeconomic conditions on the inflationary outlook. * The Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2013-12-12,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to leave the Base Rate unchanged at 2.50% for the intermeeting period. Based on currently available information the Committee considers that the trend of economic recovery in the US has been sustained and that the sluggishness of economic activities in the euro area appears to have continued to ease, while economic growth trends in emerging market countries, above all China, have been maintained. The Committee forecasts that the global economy will sustain its modest recovery going forward, but judges that the likelihood of changes in global financial market conditions related to QE tapering by the US Federal Reserve, and the continued US fiscal uncertainties remain as downside risks to growth. In Korea, the Committee appraises the economic recovery to be continuing in line with the trend of growth, as domestic demand and exports have both increased. On the employment front, the scale of increase in the number of persons employed has expanded substantially in line with increases in the 50-and-above age group and in the service sector. The Committee expects that the domestic economy will maintain a negative output gap for a considerable time going forward, although it forecasts that the gap will narrow. Consumer price inflation rose from 0.7% the previous month to 0.9% in November, due mainly to the slower downward trends in the prices of agricultural and petroleum products, increases in the prices of some industrial goods and the hike in electricity charges. Core inflation excluding agricultural and petroleum product prices also rose from 1.6% to 1.8%. The Committee forecasts that, due largely to the stability of international agricultural prices, inflation will remain low for the time being, but that it will be higher than its current level. As for the housing market, sales prices in Seoul and its surrounding areas maintained their level of the previous month while the uptrend of those in the rest of the country increased slightly. The rise in leasehold- deposit prices slowed in Seoul and its surrounding areas, while the uptrend in the rest of the country kept to its pace of the previous month. In the domestic financial markets, stock prices have fallen substantially and long-term market interest rates have risen, affected by expectations of the US Federal Reserve's QE tapering. The Korean won has strengthened while fluctuating in line with the influences of the continued current account surplus and outflows of foreigners' securities investment funds. Looking ahead, while paying close attention to developments in and the influences of external risk factors, and monitoring the effects of the Base Rate cut and of the government's economic policies including the supplementary budget, the Committee will conduct monetary policy so as to keep consumer price inflation within the inflation target range over a medium-term horizon while ensuring that the growth potential is not eroded due to the continuation of slow growth."
Russia,2013-12-13,"On 13 December 2013 the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to maintain the Bank of Russia key rate at 5.50 percent per annum. The decision was based on the assessment of inflation risks and economic growth prospects. The dynamics of the key macroeconomic indicators suggests that the pace of economic growth remains low. Production activity and investment demand remain subdued while producer confidence indicators have not been improving. Consumer demand supported by the real wage and retail lending growth remains a major driver of economic growth. According to the Bank of Russia estimates, gross output remains slightly below its potential. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate stays at a relatively low level. In November and in early December, annual CPI inflation increased and as of 9 December 2013 was estimated at 6.5%, which exceeded the upper bound of the target range for the current year. The acceleration of inflation was mainly attributed to rise in prices of fruits and vegetables, which was unusual for this season, and of some animal products. In November the core inflation annual rate amounted to 5.6%. The absence of significant demand-side inflationary pressure in the context of gross output staying slightly below its potential is one of factors constraining rise in non-food prices in recent months. According to the Bank of Russia estimates, the factors affecting acceleration of price growth have short-term effect. The Bank of Russia forecasts that inflation will resume the declining trend in the first half of 2014 and achieve the target in the second half of the year. The expected sluggish recovery of external demand and the subdued investment activity will constrain inflation dynamics. Nevertheless, the observed increase in inflation may affect economic agents' expectations and, thus, poses inflation risks. Therefore, the downward trend in inflation expectations needs to be formed to ensure a way of achieving an inflation target in the medium term. The Bank of Russia will continue to monitor the inflation risks and the downside risks to economic growth. The Bank of Russia will take into account the inflation targets and the inflation forecast, as well as economic growth prospects when making monetary policy decisions. The next meeting of the Bank of Russia Board of Directors on monetary policy issues is planned to be held on 14 February 2014; the press-release on the Board of Directors' decision is planned to be published at 13:30 Moscow time.

Peru,2013-12-15,"MONETARY PROGRAM FOR DECEMBER 2013 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 4.0% The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference rate at 4.0 percent. This level of the reference rate is compatible with an inflation forecast of 2 percent in the forecast horizon (2014  2015) and takes into account that: inflation expectations remain anchored within the inflation target range; GDP has been recording lower growth rates than the country's potential level of growth; recent indicators show some recovery in the world economy, and the supply factors that affected inflation are reversing. Inflation in November showed a rate of -0.22 percent and thus inflation in the last 12 months declined from 3.04 percent in October to 2.96 percent in November. Inflation without food and energy registered a rate of 0.19 percent (2.89 percent in the last 12 months) and core inflation showed a rate of 0.20 percent (3.68 percent in the last 12 months). Inflation is forecast to remain initially close to the upper band of the target range in the following months due to the lagging effect of the supply shocks and to converge thereafter to the 2 percent target in 2014. A slowdown in the pace of economic growth has been observed until the third quarter as a result of the lower growth recorded by our exports due to the deceleration of economic activity in our main trading partners and due to lower export prices. Indicators of activity at November indicate a recovery of economic activity in the last quarter. The rate of reserve requirements in domestic currency was lowered from 16 to 15 percent in December with the purpose of supporting the dynamism of credit in soles. The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants and, if necessary, will implement additional measures to ease its monetary policy instruments. The Board of the Central Bank also approved to reduce the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as described below: Overnight deposits: 3.20 percent. Direct repo and rediscount operations: 4.80 percent. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 4.80 percent. The Monetary Program for January 2014 will be approved on the Board's meeting to be held on January 9, 2013."
Czech Republic,2013-12-17,"Press conference of the CNB Bank Board 8th Situation Report on Economic and Monetary Developments 17 December 2013 The monetary policy decision and the stance of the CNB At the close of the meeting the Board decided unanimously to leave interest rates unchanged. The two-week repo rate remains at 0.05%, the discount rate at 0.05% and the Lombard rate at 0.25%. The Board also decided to continue using the exchange rate as an additional instrument for easing the monetary conditions and confirmed the CNB's commitment to intervene on the FX market to weaken the koruna so that the exchange rate of the koruna against the euro is kept close to CZK 27. The Board repeated that it regards the commitment as one-sided. This means that the CNB will prevent excessive appreciation of the koruna exchange rate below CZK 27/EUR by using FX interventions, i.e. by selling koruna and buying foreign currency. On the weaker side of the CZK 27/EUR level, the CNB is allowing the exchange rate to float according to supply and demand on the FX market. More information on the CNB's exchange rate commitment can be found on the CNB website 2 Reasons for the decision Consistent with the baseline scenario of the forecast was a significant decline in market interest rates well below zero, which could not occur in practice. Following the November decision of the Bank Board, the outlook assuming the use of the exchange rate as an additional monetary policy instrument became the most likely scenario of future economic developments. This alternative scenario showed that a sustained weakening of the exchange rate close to CZK 27/EUR is needed to eliminate the threat of longer-term deflation and accelerate the return of inflation towards the target amid zero interest rates. The CNB continues to regard the level of the exchange rate commitment close to CZK 27/EUR as an appropriate choice. Newly available information confirms the message that the CNB will keep the exchange rate close to CZK 27/EUR at least until early 2015. The October data suggest a recovery in some industrial branches amid a continuing downturn in construction and retail sales. In line with CNB expectations, the labour market remains weak: Total employment recorded slower y-o-y growth and switched to a decline in q-o-q terms. The general unemployment rate (s.a.) stagnated in both y-o-y and q-o-q terms. The decline in agricultural producer prices deepened in November, as did the decline in import prices in October. In line with expectations, industrial producer price inflation accelerated slightly in November.

Turkiye,2013-12-17,"The Monetary Policy Committee (the Committee) has decided to keep the short term interest rates constant at the following levels: a) Overnight Interest Rates: Lending rate at 7.75 percent, the interest rate on borrowing facilities provided for primary dealers via repo transactions at 6.75 percent, and borrowing rate at 3.5 percent, b) One-week repo rate at 4.5 percent, c) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates (between 4:00 p.m.  5:00 p.m.): Borrowing rate at 0 percent, lending rate at 10.25 percent. Data released since the last meeting suggest that final domestic demand and exports continue to grow at a moderate pace. The present policy framework is contributing to the improvement in the current account balance. The cautious monetary policy stance, the announced macroprudential measures, and weak capital flows will bring down the loan growth rates to more reasonable levels. Accordingly, the moderate decline in the current account deficit excluding gold trade is expected to continue. Inflation is expected to fall further in the forthcoming period. However, core inflation indicators are likely to hover above the target for some time. The Committee assessed that the current stance of the monetary policy is appropriate to contain inflationary risks. Accordingly, it is indicated that interbank money market rates will materialize close to 7.75 percent and the weighted average cost of funding will materialize at 6.75 percent or above in the forthcoming period. The Committee stated that the cautious monetary policy stance should be maintained until the inflation outlook is in line with the medium term targets. It should be emphasized that any new data or information may lead the Committee to revise its stance. The summary of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting will be released within five working days."
India,2013-12-18,"Mid-Quarter Monetary Policy Review: December 2013 Monetary and Liquidity Measures On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation, it has been decided to: keep the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) unchanged at 7.75 per cent; and keep the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks unchanged at 4.0 per cent of net demand and time liability (NDTL). Consequently, the reverse repo rate under the LAF will remain unchanged at 6.75 per cent, and the marginal standing facility (MSF) rate and the Bank Rate at 8.75 per cent. Assessment The outlook for global growth continues to remain moderate, with an uneven recovery across industrial countries. Activity in major emerging market economies (EMEs) barring China has decelerated on account of weak domestic demand, notwithstanding some improvement in export performance. While volatility in financial markets has receded, it could pick up again following the inevitable taper of quantitative easing in the US, given the large dependence of EMEs on external financing. In India, the pick-up in real GDP growth in Q2 of 2013-14, albeit modest, was driven largely by robust growth of agricultural activity, supported by an improvement in net exports. However, the weakness in industrial activity persisting into Q3, still lacklustre lead indicators of services and subdued domestic consumption demand suggest continuing headwinds to growth. Tightening government spending in Q4 to meet budget projections will add to these headwinds. In this context, the revival of stalled investment, especially in the projects cleared by the Cabinet Committee on Investment, will be critical. Retail inflation measured by the consumer price index (CPI) has risen unrelentingly through the year so far, pushed up by the unseasonal upturn in vegetable prices, double-digit housing inflation and elevated levels of inflation in the non-food and non-fuel categories. While vegetable prices seem to be adjusting downwards sharply in certain areas, the feed-through to much-too-high headline CPI inflation remains to be seen. Wholesale inflation has also gone up sharply from Q22 onwards, with upside pressures evident across all constituent components. High inflation at both wholesale and retail levels risks entrenching inflation expectations at unacceptably elevated levels, posing a threat to growth and financial stability. There are also signs of a resumption of high rural wage growth, suggesting second round effects that cannot be ignored. High and persistent inflation also increases the risks of exchange rate instability. With the normalization of exceptional monetary measures, liquidity conditions have improved, as reflected in the steady decline in the access to the MSF. Capital inflows under the Reserve Bank's swap facilities for banking capital and non-resident deposits augmented domestic liquidity significantly from the end of November. Over the first two weeks of December, banks refrained from utilising the limits under the overnight LAF repo and export credit refinance, and, in fact, excess liquidity was parked with the Reserve Bank through reverse repo. Anticipating the temporary tightness in liquidity starting from mid-December 2013 on account of advance tax payments, the Reserve Bank conducted additional 14-day term repo auction of 100 billion on December 13, augmenting the normal access to liquidity from the Reserve Bank to the tune of 1.5 per cent of NDTL (i.e., about 1.2 trillion) under overnight repos, term repos, and the export credit refinance facility. The Reserve Bank also opened a refinance facility of 50 billion for the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) aimed at addressing liquidity stress faced by medium, micro and small enterprises. Liquidity is being managed with a view to ensuring that there is adequate credit flow to the productive sectors of the economy. The narrowing of the trade deficit since June through November, on positive export growth and contraction in both oil and non-oil imports, should bring the current account deficit (CAD) down to a more sustainable level for the year as a whole. Robust inflows into the swap windows opened by the Reserve Bank during August- November have contributed significantly to rebuilding foreign exchange reserves thus covering possible external financing requirements and providing stability to the foreign exchange market. Looking ahead, these favourable developments should help to build resilience to external shocks. Policy Stance and Rationale Recent readings suggest that headline inflation, both retail and wholesale, have increased, mainly on account of food prices. While CPI and wholesale price index (WPI) inflation excluding food and fuel have been stable, despite a steady and necessary increase in administered prices towards market levels, the high level of CPI inflation excluding food and fuel leaves no room for complacency. There is, however, reason to wait before determining the course of monetary policy. There are indications that vegetable prices may be turning down sharply, although trading mark-ups could impede the full pass-through into retail inflation. In addition, the disinflationary impact of recent exchange rate stability should play out into prices. Finally, the negative output gap, including the recent observed slowdown in services growth, as well as the lagged effects of effective monetary tightening since July, should help contain inflation. The policy decision is a close one. Current inflation is too high. However, given the wide bands of uncertainty surrounding the short term path of inflation from its high current levels, and given the weak state of the economy, the inadvisability of overly reactive policy action, as well as the long lags with which monetary policy works, there is merit in waiting for more data to reduce uncertainty.3 There are obvious risks to waiting for more data, including the possibility that tapering of quantitative easing by the US Fed may disrupt external markets and that the Reserve Bank may be perceived to be soft on inflation. The Reserve Bank will be vigilant. Even though the Reserve Bank maintains status quo today, it can help guide market expectations through a clearer description of its policy reaction function: if the expected softening of food inflation does not materialise and translate into a significant reduction in headline inflation in the next round of data releases, or if inflation excluding food and fuel does not fall, the Reserve Bank will act, including on off-policy dates if warranted, so that inflation expectations stabilise and an environment conducive to sustainable growth takes hold. The Reserve Bank's policy action on those dates will be appropriately calibrated. Alpana Killawala Press Release : 2013-2014/1223 Principal Chief General Manager."
United States,2013-12-18,"Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in October indicates that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace. Labor market conditions have shown further improvement; the unemployment rate has declined but remains elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, while the recovery in the housing sector slowed somewhat in recent months. Fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint may be diminishing. Inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will pick up from its recent pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate. The Committee sees the risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having become more nearly balanced. The Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, and it is monitoring inflation developments carefully for evidence that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term. Taking into account the extent of federal fiscal retrenchment since the inception of its current asset purchase program, the Committee sees the improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions over that period as consistent with growing underlying strength in the broader economy. In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions, the Committee decided to modestly reduce the pace of its asset purchases. Beginning in January, the Committee will add to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $35 billion per month rather than $40 billion per month, and will add to its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $40 billion per month rather than $45 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. The Committee's sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability. If incoming information broadly supports the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings. However, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens. The Committee also reaffirmed its expectation that the current exceptionally low target range for the federal funds rate of 0 to 1/4 percent will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. The Committee now anticipates, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6-1/2 percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; William C Dudley. Vice Chairman; James Bullard; Charles L Evans; Esther L George; Jerome H Powell; Jeremy C Stein; Daniel K Tarullo; and Janet L Yellen. Voting against the action was Eric S Rosengren, who believes that, with the unemployment rate still elevated and the inflation rate well below the target, changes in the purchase program are premature until incoming data more clearly indicate that economic growth is likely to be sustained above its potential rate.

Thailand,2013-12-20,"No 56 /2013 Outcome of the Joint Meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) and Financial Institutions Policy Committee (FIPC) on 20 December 2013 The Bank of Thailand announced the outcome of the second joint meeting of MPC and FIPC for 2013 as follows. The Committees viewed that risks to the Thai financial stability have reduced somewhat from the last meeting due to moderation in household debt, real estate market and credit expansion in line with greater risks in economic growth outlook. Domestic expenditures and investments, both public and private, were weaker than expected. Meanwhile export recovery has not gained traction and may not benefit fully from global economic recovery due to supply-side constraints. Furthermore business sentiment has been dampened by political situation. Financial and liquidity conditions of the corporate sector remained broadly sound, though with lowering profitability prospect, especially for small and medium enterprises, as a result of an economic slowdown. The Thai financial market experienced more volatilities in the second half of 2013 due mainly to uncertainty of the US plan to reduce the asset purchase program (QE tapering). Although the Fed's latest announcement on QE tapering which will commence in January 2014 may help ease market uncertainty, volatilities in the financial markets still remain. The Thai banking system is strong and capable of weathering increased risks to the economic outlook. Asset quality and profitability are sound with high level of capital, provision and liquidity, thereby enabling banks to provide financing to the economy. Going forward, the Committees viewed that the key risks to the Thai financial stability that warrant close monitoring include: political uncertainty; and financial market volatilities caused by capital flows.

Israel,2013-12-23,"The inflation environment is within the target range, slightly below its midpoint. The CPI reading for November surprised to the downside, and there wasa moderate increase in expectations, from various sources, for inflation over the year ahead, though they all remain slightly below the midpoint of the inflation target. Data that became available this month indicate that the growth rate of the economy is stable, and there are even signs of some recovery in activity, including exports. Given the forecasts for recovery in the global economy and in global trade, the Research Department forecast indicates a moderate increase in the rate of growth (excluding the effect of natural gas production) next year. The unemployment rate remains low, though conflicting trends in the labor market: an increase in employment in public services and a decline in business sector employment: continue. After depreciating in the days before the previous monetary discussion, the shekel has strengthened since then by 1.1 percent against the nominal effective exchange rate. From a longer term perspective, after marked appreciation in the first half of the year, there has not been a trend of change in the effective exchange rate in recent months. The Federal Reserve announced the beginning of the process of tapering its quantitative easing, and at the same time reiterated its commitment to a low federal funds rate for a considerable period, which resulted in a moderate effect on bond yields. Against the background of low inflation and a slow recovery, monetary policy in major economies remained highly accommodative. Recent data from the housing market indicate a moderation in the rateof price increases, in the number of transactions, and in mortgages granted, alongside a decline in risk characteristics of mortgages and indicationsof increased supply. With that, a change in trend in the housing market cannot yet be indicated. To view this press release as a Word document. To Forecast. Inflation data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for November declined by 0.4 percent, compared with forecasters' projections for a decline of 0.2 percent, on average. Among the index components, there were marked declines in the fruit and vegetables, furniture, and food components, and a marked increase in the clothing and footwear component. The rate of inflation measured over the preceding 12 months was 1.9 percent, near the midpoint of the inflation target range. Inflation and interest rate forecasts: Inflation expectations from various sources increased slightly this month. Private forecasters' inflation projections for the next 12 CPI readings averaged 1.8 percent. Inflation expectations derived from the capital market reached 1.6 percent, while expectations for the next 12 CPI readings derived from banks' internalinterest rates were 1.3 percent. Inflation expectations for medium terms increased by 0.1 to 0.2 percent, while expectations for longer terms remained essentially unchanged, and are slightly above the midpoint of the inflation target range. Most private forecasters do not expect a change in the Bank of Israel interest rate in the next three months, while data derived fromthe Telbor interest rates and the makam curves indicate expectations of some probability of one reduction in the Bank of Israel interest rate in the coming three months. Real economic activity: Data that became available this month indicate that the growth rate of the economy is stable, and there are even signs of some recovery in activity. Foreign trade data indicate an increase of 4 percent in goods imports, primarily of capital goods, and a decline of 1.5 percent in exports (excluding ships, aircraft and diamonds) in November. This decline followed three months of increases, so that trend data continues to indicate an increase in exports, led by high technology industries, primarily pharmaceuticals. Exports of business services (excluding start-up companies)increased by 2 percent in September, and posted similar growth in the third quarter. Following surpluses in the current account of the balance of payments in the first half of the year, there was a third quarter deficit of $400 million, reflecting mainly an increase in the deficit in the goods account. The Composite State of the Economy Index increased in November by 0.2 percent, a similar rate to previous months. The Climate Index, based on theBusiness Tendency Survey of the Central Bureau of Statistics, was unchanged in December, and continues to fluctuate in a range indicating a 0.25 to 0.3 percent monthly rate of growth. Consumer Confidence indices declined this month, primarily due to the negative perception of the state of employment and expectations of growth in unemployment. An index based on Google searches, which serves as a leading indicator for private consumption, declinedslightly this month, but continues to indicate the probability that domestic demand will increase faster than the long term rate. The Purchasing Managers Index continued to decline this month, and is situated below the 50-point level, considered the boundary between economic expansion and contraction. The labor market: Labor Force Survey data for October indicate an increase of 0.4 percentage points in the labor force participation rate and in the employment rate among the principal working ages (25-64), so that theunemployment rate among this age group remained virtually unchanged at 5.3 percent. Similar trends were recorded among the general working-age population, and the overall unemployment rate declined to 5.9 percent. At the same time, there was a slight increase in the rate of those employed on a fulltime basis. The trend of increase in the number of employee posts in public services continued, with a decline in the number of employee posts in thebusiness sector. Nominal wages increased by 0.9 percent, and real wages increased by 0.1 percent, in July-September, compared with April-June. Health tax receipts by the National Insurance Institute, which provide an indication of total wage payments in the economy, were 5.7 percent higher in October-November, on a nominal basis, than in the corresponding two months of the previous year: reflecting an increase in their growth rate after an extended decline since the beginning of 2011. Israeli Employment Service data indicate an increase in the number of newly unemployed persons in October compared with September, but this is apparently a seasonal increase following the holiday period, and the data do not indicate a deterioration in the unemployment situation. The Ministry of the Economy's Employers Survey for the third quarter indicates an increase in the number of job vacancies, and employers' expectations havemoved from negative to neutral. Budget data: In January-November, the cumulative deficit in the government's domestic activity was NIS 13.8 billion below the seasonal path consistent with the deficit ceiling for 2013 of 4.65 percent of GDP. The below-path deficit primarily reflects an expenditure level which is NIS 10.2 billion lower than the path consistent with full performance of budgetexpenditures, and revenues which are NIS 3.6 billion above the path consistent with the revenue forecast in the budget. As such, the deficit in 2013 is expected to be around 3 percent of GDP. In November, the increase in VATreceipts on domestic production continued: domestic gross VAT collection increased by about 26 percent in real terms compared with November of 2012 (about 21 percent excluding legislative changes). The Research Department Staff Forecast: This month the Research Department updated its macroeconomic forecast. The notice about the forecast is published concurrently with this release. According to the revised forecast, the inflation rate in 2014 will be 1.8 percent, near the midpoint of the inflation target; the Bank of Israel interest rate, according to the Research Department forecast, is expected to reach 1.25 percent toward the end of 2014. GDP growth in 2013 is expected to be 3.5 percent (3.6 percent in the previous forecast), and 2.6 percent (similar to the previous forecast) excluding the effect of natural gas production from the Tamar site. For 2014, the growth rate is projected to be 3.3 percent (3.4 percent in the previous forecast), and excluding the effect of natural gas production, the growth rate isforecast to be 2.9 percent, compared with a projection of 2.7 percent in the previous forecast.

Armenia,2013-12-24,"Press Release 24.12.2013 Interest rate lowered by 0.25 percent In the December 24, 2013 Meeting the Board of CBA decided to lower the Refinancing Rate of CBA by 0.25 percent to 7.75 percent. There was 0.9 percent inflation in November of 2013 against 1.4 percent inflation recorded in the same period of the previous year; the 12-month inflation continued to reduce and in late November it reached 6.6 percent. Inflation is reducing at a faster rate than forecasted, therefore in the end of the year the 12-month inflation will be around the upper bound of the confidence band. The Board acknowledged that the developments in the external sector were mainly in line with the projections. Trends of slower global economic recovery are maintained while no inflationary trends are anticipated in raw materials and food product markets in the world. The Board estimates that despite the fourth quarter's expansionary fiscal policy, economic growth rates remain sluggish driven by investment behavior and slowed down growth rates in private consumption. Given the external and domestic economic developments as well as further reduction in inflation, the Board of the CBA finds it reasonable to continue easing monetary conditions. Further directions of the monetary policy of the CBA will depend on peculiarities of the fiscal policy in 2014. The Board has consensus that, in expectation of economic developments, the 12-month inflation will reduce further to return its target of 4 percent in the upcoming months and will stay within the confidence band in the forecast horizon. More information on setting of the interest rate will be available in Press Release due on November 28th of 2013. Press Service of the Central Bank."
