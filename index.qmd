`gingado` seeks to facilitate the use of machine learning in economic and finance use cases, while promoting good practices. This package aims to be suitable for beginners and advanced users alike. Use cases may range from simple data retrievals to experimentation with machine learning algorithms to more complex model pipelines used in production.

## Overview

`gingado` is a free, open source library built different functionalities:

* [**data augmentation**](https://bis-med-it.github.io/gingado/augmentation.html), to add data from official sources, improving the machine models being trained by the user;

* **relevant** [**datasets**](https://bis-med-it.github.io/gingado/datasets.html), both real and simulated, to allow for easier model development and comparison;

* **automatic** [**benchmark model**](https://bis-med-it.github.io/gingado/benchmark.html), to assess candidate models against a reasonably well-performant model;

* **machine learning-based** [**estimators**](https://bis-med-it.github.io/gingado/estimators.html), to help answer questions of academic or practical importance;

* **support for** [**model documentation**](https://bis-med-it.github.io/gingado/documentation.html), to embed documentation and ethical considerations in the model development phase; and

* [**utilities**](https://bis-med-it.github.io/gingado/utils.html), including tools to allow for lagging variables in a straightforward way.

Each of these functionalities builds on top of the previous one. They can be used on a stand-alone basis, together, or even as part of a larger pipeline from data input to model training to documentation!

New functionalities are planned over time, so consider checking frequently on `gingado` for the latest toolsets.

## Attribution

If you use this package in your work, please consider citing @gingado.

In BibTeX format:
```
@techreport{gingado,
    author = {Araujo, Douglas KG},
    title = {gingado: a machine learning library focused on economics and finance},

```

Over time, new tools that are described in specific papers might be added (eg, a machine learning-based econometric estimator). Please consider citing them as well if used in your work. Specific information, if any, can be found in the documentation.

## Design principles

The choices made during development of `gingado` derive from the following principles, in no particular order:

* **flexibility**: users can use `gingado` out of the box or build custom processes on top of it;

* **compatibility**: `gingado` works well with other widely used libraries in machine learning, such as `scikit-learn` and `pandas`; and

* **responsibility**: `gingado` facilitates and promotes model documentation, including ethical considerations, as part of the machine learning development workflow.

For more information about `gingado`, please read the [paper](https://www.bis.org/publ/work1122.pdf).
