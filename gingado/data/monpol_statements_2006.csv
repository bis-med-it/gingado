Philippines,2006-01-11,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board maintained the BSP's key policy interest rates at 7.5 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.75 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. The Monetary Board noted that recent evidence of easing inflation pressures supports an unchanged policy setting. Easing energy prices, favorable food prices and the appreciation of the peso should help keep price pressures at bay in the near term. In addition, demand-side pressures on consumer prices appear to be still limited given the sustained deceleration in core inflation, indications of easing money growth and the slowdown in aggregate demand, particularly consumer spending. There has also been relatively little indication thus far of second-round effects from ongoing supply shocks. Nonetheless, there continue to be a number of risks to the inflation outlook. World energy prices continue to be the dominant source of uncertainty in the outlook for inflation given limited global surplus production capacity. Moreover, there is still the risk of second-round effects given the expected price pressures in the pipeline. Potential shifts in the public's inflation expectations likewise continue to be a policy concern. The Monetary Board reiterates that it remains committed to the BSP's price stability objectives and will continue to closely monitor the evolving conditions for consumer prices, aggregate demand, domestic liquidity and other factors in order to determine the appropriate stance of monetary policy and undertake action if necessary. Monetary authorities also continue to support the National Government's use of non-monetary measures to address supply-side risks, particularly those related to food supply and the effects of high oil prices, and will thus continue to strengthen representation and coordination with the relevant government agencies."
Chile,2006-01-12,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 12 January 2006 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 4.5% (annual). Annual inflation is within the 2%-4% target range and core inflation measures CPIX and CPIX1 (that exclude fuels, perishables and some regulated rates, among others) have remained below 3% per annum. Other inflationary trend indicators and the various measures of expected inflation continue to be well anchored. Projections are that—after being temporarily around 4% per annum during the first quarter— the rate of inflation will be under 3% for some time to later converge to the center of the target range in the normal policy horizon of 12 to 24 months. Economic activity has resumed a growth pace above the trend, which implies that the deceleration of previous months may have been partly transitory. Although the annual growth pace of job creation has moderated, salaried employment continues to grow vigorously. The external environment concerning the Chilean economy is still favorable and domestic financial conditions continue to be expansionary. The decision to pause is no indication of a change in the strategy of normalization of the monetary impulse. The Board estimates that further increases in the interest rate in future months are still necessary to attain, in the most likely scenario, an annual inflation rate around 3% over the normal policy horizon. * The Spanish original prevails."
Euroarea,2006-01-12,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I would first like to express to all of you our best wishes for the New Year and welcome you to this press conference. Let me now report on the outcome of today's meeting of the ECB's Governing Council, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we have decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged following the increase of 25 basis points on 1 December 2005. The information which has become available since then supports the assessment that an adjustment of our very accommodative monetary policy stance was warranted. It remains essential to keep medium to long-term inflation expectations in the euro area solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. Such anchoring of inflation expectations is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. Maintaining price stability over the medium term is our guiding principle, and we will consistently apply it when examining new information, making our judgements and taking decisions. With interest rates across the whole maturity spectrum remaining historically low in both nominal and real terms, and with our monetary policy stance remaining accommodative, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments with respect to risks to price stability over the medium term. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, turning first to the economic analysis. According to the information available, real GDP growth did indeed improve in the second half of 2005, as we expected. According to Eurostat's first estimate, real GDP grew at a quarter-on-quarter rate of 0.6% in the third quarter of 2005, compared with 0.4% in the second quarter. The breakdown of GDP data for the third quarter of 2005 confirmed a stronger contribution from domestic demand. Moreover, recent economic indicators and survey data support the view that the expansion of economic activity broadly maintained its momentum in the fourth quarter of 2005 and will continue to do so in the first months of 2006, notwithstanding the impact of high oil prices. Looking further ahead, the conditions remain in place for sustained growth of economic activity, in line with our staff projections and other available forecasts. On the external side, the continued strength of global demand should support euro area exports. On the domestic side, investment should further benefit from continued very favourable financing conditions, robust corporate earnings and gains in corporate efficiency. Consumption growth should gradually rise, broadly in line with expected developments in disposable income. Risks to this outlook for economic growth continue to lie on the downside and relate to high and volatile oil prices, concerns about global imbalances and the level of consumer confidence in the euro area, although the latter is improving. Turning to price developments, annual HICP inflation was 2.2% in December, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, compared with 2.3% in November and 2.5% in October. This decline was the result of some relaxation of earlier tensions in oil and petrol markets. Nevertheless, annual HICP inflation rates are expected to remain at elevated levels over the short term, mainly on account of the most recent increases in oil prices and some adverse base effects. Beyond the short term, indirect effects of past oil price rises on other components of the price index may gradually materialise, and already announced changes to administered prices and indirect taxes can be expected to have an upward impact. Meanwhile, wage increases have remained moderate over recent quarters. All in all, the information available remains consistent with the scenario for price developments as reflected in the December staff projections. Risks to this scenario remain on the upside and include further rises in oil prices, additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, as well as  more fundamentally  potential second-round effects in wage and price-setting behaviour. It is therefore crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities also in the context of a more favourable economic environment. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 moderated somewhat in November, but remained very robust, mainly owing to the stimulative impact of the prevailing low level of interest rates. The strong growth of M3 continues to be driven by significant contributions from its most liquid components. The growth of loans to the private sector  and, in particular, mortgage borrowing  has strengthened further over recent months, from already rapid rates of growth. Against this background, price dynamics in the housing markets need to be monitored closely. Liquidity in the euro area remains ample by all plausible measures. Strong monetary and credit growth in a context of already ample liquidity in the euro area points to upside risks to price stability over medium to longer horizons. To sum up, the economic analysis suggests that some upward impact on HICP inflation will result from the indirect effects of recent oil price rises and already announced changes to administered prices and indirect taxes. It also indicates that risks to price stability over the medium term remain on the upside. This assessment is confirmed by cross-checking the economic analysis with the monetary analysis. It is essential that such risks do not affect medium-term inflation expectations, which need to remain firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. Monetary policy can thereby effectively contribute to sustainable economic growth and job creation. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments with respect to risks to price stability over the medium term. As regards fiscal policy, most euro area countries have submitted their updated stability programmes, which include their medium-term budget plans. The upcoming assessment of these programmes by the ECOFIN Council and their subsequent implementation provide an opportunity to forcefully underpin the commitment to sound fiscal policies and the rigorous implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact. This effect is likely to be considerable if emphasis is given to well-defined and credible consolidation measures, restraint in expenditure commitments, and the incorporation of fiscal measures into a comprehensive and growth-friendly reform agenda. With respect to structural reforms, the Governing Council welcomes the ECOFIN Council's Conclusions of 6 December 2005 on the Lisbon National Reform Programmes and the intended response to the challenges of globalisation. In fact, the process of international economic and financial integration, characterised by strong growth in trade and capital flows, has been one of the driving factors behind the rise in Europe's prosperity over the past decades. The ongoing transformation of the world economy, reflecting technological advances and the entrance of new economies into the world market, again offers great opportunities in terms of higher living standards. In order to translate these chances into achievements. Europe would greatly benefit from more flexible labour and product markets so as to speed up the necessary changeover from contracting to expanding activities and to minimise adjustment costs. It would also profit considerably from a more stimulative business environment which fosters the ability to innovate, invest and create new firms. Moreover, a fully operational EU internal market, including for services, offers great opportunities. The initiatives taken to relaunch the Lisbon strategy are a welcome step in the right direction."
South Korea,2006-01-12,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (3.75%) for the intermeeting period. (An unofficial English translation based on the Korean original of the decision on monetary policy taken by the Monetary Policy Committee on January 12, 2006 is attached). In the real economy, while exports continue to exhibit robust growth and private consumption has seen a rapid pace of increase, facilities investment has shown a recovery momentum. On the other hand, an improvement of construction investment has not yet been sufficient. Meanwhile, the current account is still running a surplus, thanks to that on the goods account. Both consumer price inflation and core inflation maintain overall stability. Nevertheless, there are latent inflationary pressures due to the economic recovery and persistently high oil prices. Real estate prices have shown a rebound in certain areas. In the financial markets, overall liquidity conditions are favorable and financial institutions‘ loans continue to increase steadily. Taking the above economic and financial conditions into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (3.75%) for the intermeeting period."
Peru,2006-01-15,"Press Release MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JANUARY 2006 CENTRAL BANK RAISES REFERENCE RATE FROM 3,25% TO 3,50% The Board of the Central Bank acknowledge the following information: The Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) increased 0,4 percent in December. Thus, the inflation rate registered in 2005 was 1,5 percent, at the lower limit of the target range (1,5 percent  3,5 percent). With this result the inflation target is accomplished by fourth consecutive year. Since 2006, the inflation target will be evaluated continuously. The economic activity has a sustained growth, being forecasted a 6,3 percent growth for 2005, the highest rate observed since 1997. The growing tendency of the trade balance surplus continues, being forecasted a record level for 2005 of US$ 4 751 million (equivalent to 6 percent of GDP and greater in US$ 1 958 million than the previous year). The average exchange rate increased 1,4 percent in December from 3,38 per dollar in November to 3,43 per dollar in December. Thus, in 2005, the sol depreciated 4,4 percent in nominal terms and 4 percent in real terms. In December, the Bank intervened with US$ 644 million in the foreign exchange market with foreign currency sales by US$ 345 million and Adjustable Certificates of Deposits (CDRBCRP) by US$ 300 million to avoid excessive market volatility. During last month, the bank's balance of net forward sales increased in US$ 581 million, the public purchases of dollars in the spot market were US$ 80 million and the bank's exchange position grew by US$ 40 million. The possibility of this raising volatility in the electoral period had been already anticipated in the Inflation Report, against which the Central Bank preventively accumulated exchange position and international reserves in the last two years (US$ 2,9 billion and US$ 3,9 billion, respectively), reaching balances of US$ 7 451 million and US$ 14 097 million, respectively, at the end of 2005. The average interest rate of the interbank market was 3,33 percent in December, higher than the one observed in the previous month (3,02 percent), while the corporate prime rate for loans in soles passed from 4,0 percent to 4,4 percent. In this month, the BCRP carried out 35 repo auctions in order to stabilize the interbank interest rate around the reference interest rate (3,25 percent in December). The Board of the Central Bank approved to raise the reference interest rate for the interbank market from 3,25 percent to 3,50 percent. This decision has been take considering: The dynamism of the economic activity for 2006 (5,0 percent) is consistent with the inflation target (from 1,5 to 3,5 percent). The raise in the interest rate will cooperate to reduce the exchange rate volatility. The Bank will continue, if necessary, selling exchange currency and auction of Adjustable Certificate Deposits (indexed to the exchange rate) to reduce the pressure over prices, the stability on the exchange rate, and the economic activity in general. As mentioned in the December Press Release, this decision does not imply a sequence of raises in the reference interest rate. It was approved to raise the lending and deposits interest rates for the Central Bank operations: For direct repos and monetary regulation credits, the rate raises to 4,25 percent. For overnight deposits, the rate raises to 2, 75 percent. In the case that the interbank interest rate be higher than 4,25 percent, monetary regulation credits and direct repos will be charged with the market interbank interest rate. The interest rates for the following operations in dollars between the Central Bank and the Financial System are: Monetary regulation credits: 1-month LIBOR plus one percent point. Overnight deposits: overnight LIBOR minus 3/8 of a percentage point. Swap: the commission raises to a level that implies a minimum annual effective cost of 4,25 percent. Reserve requirement in foreign deposits subject to payment: 2,25 percent. For 2006, the Board of the Central Bank will release its monthly monetary program the following dates: February 2nd March 2nd April 6th May 4th June 1st July 6th August 3rd September 7th October 5th November 2nd December 7th The Central Bank will release its Inflation Report the following dates: February 3rd June 2nd October 6th."
Thailand,2006-01-18,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 18 January 2006 Ms. Atchana Waiquamdee. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand, announces that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance. The main issues discussed are as follows: 1. During the first eleven months of 2005, the Thai economy continued to expand. Despite a slight moderation in domestic demand in the fourth quarter, external demand was still robust and is expected to remain so in 2006. The MPC viewed that the growth momentum should carry on going forward, being supported by a positive outlook on exports and private investment. Pressure on internal stability remains. Although headline inflation softened from 59 per cent in November to 58 per cent in December, core inflation edged up from 24 per cent to 26 per cent. External stability has improved, however, as the current account turned around from being in deficit throughout the first half of 2005 to being in surplus since July. The MPC viewed that the Thai economy still has momentum for a continued expansion while headline inflation begins to moderate. Nevertheless price pressure remains and the real interest rates are still negative. Against that background, the MPC judged that the policy interest rate should be raised again to keep future core inflation within the target. The MPC therefore decided to raise the 14-day repurchase rate by 25 basis points from 400 to 425 per cent per annum, effective immediately."
Egypt,2006-01-19,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release January 19, 2006 The Central Bank of Egypt decided to reduce its overnight deposit rate by 50 basis points to 825 percent per annum and cut the discount rate by one percen. In its monthly meeting held on January 19, 2006, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to reduce the overnight deposit rate to 825 percent from 875 percent and the overnight lending rate to 1025 percent from 1075 percen. This was coupled with another decision to cut the discount rate to 9 percent from 10 percen. This decision was based on an assessment of recent economic developments, in particular the consistently declining inflation rates and easing inflationary pressure. In addition, the recent economic developments reveal that the pick up in economic growth has accelerated in late 2004/05 and early 2005/0. However this acceleration has not been inflationar. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments, especially the factors underlying inflation, and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates in either direction, if necessary, to ensure price stability over the medium-ter.

Malaysia,2006-01-20,"On 20 January 2006, at its first meeting for the year 2006. Bank Negara Malaysia's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to leave the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) unchanged at 3 percent. Malaysia's economic growth is expected to gain momentum in 2006, with the risk of inflation still remaining. Going forward. Bank Negara Malaysia will continue to assess developments in the domestic and international economy and their implications for the medium term prospects for growth and inflation.

Hungary,2006-01-23,"1. At its meeting on 23 January 2006, the Monetary Council considered the latest economic and monetary developments and left the central bank base rate unchanged at 6.00%. Macroeconomic data released since its previous interest rate-setting meeting have not changed the Council's overall assessment of domestic economic performance. Consumer price inflation in December was broadly in line with expectations. In the medium term, the Council expects domestic economic growth to be balanced and inflation to be consistent with the 3% medium-term target. The year-on-year rate of inflation, at 3.3% in December, was below the 4% target, remaining within the ±1 tolerance band; and core inflation fell to 1.3%, a historical low. The Council's expectation is that core inflation will rise to levels around 3% in the medium term. The reduction in VAT rates in January has made it more difficult to evaluate inflation developments, and is also likely to introduce a degree of uncertainty to distinguishing between persistent and temporary effects in the months ahead. Short and long-term yields both fell in the early weeks of 2006, simultaneously with the increase in investors' risk appetite around the world. However, significant risks continue to surround Hungary's economic balance and convergence process. In the Monetary Council's view, official interest rates are currently at adequate levels to meet the medium-term inflation objective. The Council continues to stress the importance of reducing the general government borrowing requirement, in order to achieve sustainable economic growth and keep inflation on track around the target. Delays in fiscal consolidation will increase the vulnerability of the Hungarian economy and reduce the room for monetary policy manoeuvre. 2. The Council's evaluation of meeting the 2005 inflation target. The year-on-year rate of inflation, at 3.3% in December, was below the 4% target and remained within the ±1 tolerance band. This meant that the Bank's inflation target for 2005 was met, despite the rise in energy prices. In 2005, annual average consumer price inflation was 3.6% and annual average core inflation was 2.1%. Disinflation affected a wide range of products. Annual average core inflation, the best gauge of long-term inflation developments, fell to 1.3% towards end-2005. Rapid disinflation of prices showing fairly stable movements is a sign of price stability becoming broad based. The fall in inflation was particularly marked in the case of goods competing with imports, which may have been explained by a combination of global, regional as well as domestic developments. Tradables prices also fell to historical lows in developed countries, implying that imported inflation remained slow. Disinflation of tradables prices was also explained by changed trade patterns in the aftermath of Hungary's EU accession and by the resulting increase in competition in the domestic market. Finally, following the financial market turbulence, characterising the second half of 2003, the exchange rate appreciated and then stabilised, which also supported the disinflation process. In early 2005, inflation developments showed clear signs of returning to a more stable path; and the one-off price increasing effect of the 2004 tax measures did not build in expectations. Domestic demand did not trigger significant inflationary pressure. Household consumption growth was moderate throughout the whole year, remaining significantly below the rates of earlier years, and contributed to the pattern of economic growth becoming more favourable. Simultaneously with improvements in the investment climate and the outlook for inflation, the Council continued the series of small interest rate reductions  begun in spring 2004  with further pronounced cuts. As a result of the Council's interest rate policy, the base rate fell to 6.00% by year-end, while the forint exchange rate remained in a territory which contributed to inflation returning to levels consistent with price stability. Despite the significant fall in short-term yields, however, the continued high level of long-term yields continues to reflect the risks to the long-term economic path. Labour market developments also supported the fall in inflation. The pick-up in business activity was fuelled by higher corporate productivity and, consequently, it did not increase the demand for labour. Rising labour supply also reduced wage inflation pressure. Private sector wage inflation was downwards from 2004 H2, and the rise in corporate sector ULC slowed to levels consistent with price stability."
Israel,2006-01-23,"23.1.2006 The Bank of Israel's interest rate for February 2006 up by 25 basis points to 4.75 percent The interest rate for February 2006 will rise by 25 basis points to 4.75 percent. Thisincrease is required to continue to support price stability within the limits of the inflation target range set by the government, defined as betweenone percent and three percent inflation a year. The decision to raise the interest rate at this time was based on the expectation thatthe rise in interest rates abroad would continue, and in particular in theUS, and that the contraction of the interest-rate differential between thesheqel and the dollar would affect the exchange rate and hence inflation. The current rise in the interest rate will strengthen the resilience of theeconomy, especially in the light of heightened geopolitical uncertainty, and against the background of the continued relatively rapid growth that is expected to lead to the closure of the output gap and thus to upward pressure on prices. Expectations of inflation one year forward are consistent with the target range, but these are based on market assessments that the interest rate will rise. The Bank ofIsrael will continue to monitor economic developments closely, with the intention of achieving the government's inflation target. The Bank will continue to support the attainment of the range of objectives of economic policy, particularly in the areas of encouraging employment and growth, and will strive to maintain the stability of the financial system. In this context it should be emphasized that fiscal discipline constitutes an important element in the continued maintenance of economic stability. 23.1.2006 The Bank of Israel's interest rate for February 2006 up by 25 basis points to 4.75 percent. The Bank of Israel's interest rate for February 2006 up by 25 basis points to 4.75 percent. The interest rate for February 2006 will rise by 25 basis points to 4.75 percent."
Poland,2006-01-31,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 31 January 2006 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 30-31 January 2006 The Council decided to lower the NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage point to the following levels: reference rate 4.25% on an annual basis; lombard rate 5.75% on an annual basis; deposit rate 2.75% on an annual basis; rediscount rate 4.50% on an annual basis. Since the Council's meeting in December 2005, no significant changes have been observed in the prospects for economic growth and inflation in the external environment of the Polish economy. In December the annual growth rate of consumer prices in the euro area decreased to 2.2% from 2.3% recorded in November, while in the United States it dropped from 3.5% to 3.4%. Since the December Council meeting, oil prices have risen (the Brent oil price has grown by USD 6.9 per barrel, i.e. by 12.4%). On the other hand, the forecast oil prices for 2006 have not changed significantly so far. Still, high uncertainty persists as to the effect of the high growth in oil prices on the economic growth rate and inflation. Data published since the Council's previous meeting indicate the continuation of growth tendencies in the Polish economy, which have been observed since 2005 Q2. According to GUS estimates, the GDP growth rate in Poland in 2005 reached 3.2% and was slightly lower than the expectations of both the NBP and most market analysts. The recently published GUS estimates point to an increased role of domestic demand, investment in particular, in GDP growth in 2005. Since mid-2005, the industrial output has been on a gradual increase. In December 2005 the growth rate of industrial output  for the third consecutive month  exceeded the expectations of both external forecasters and the NBP, and amounted to 9.2% y/y, (8.5% in November). In seasonally adjusted terms this growth was even higher and stood at 13.3%, as compared to 7.4% a month before. December also saw an acceleration of growth in construction. The annual growth in the construction and assembly output rose to 8.3% in December as compared to 5.9% in November, i.e. from 8.6% to 10.6% in seasonally adjusted terms. In the period May-November 2005 the moderate upward trend in retail sales was continued. The annual growth of retail sales in this period ranged between 5.0 and 8.0%. The employment in the corporate sector has been growing since the beginning of 2005. In December 2005 employment in the enterprises was higher than a year before by 2.5% and recorded the highest annual growth rate recorded in 2005. Moreover, the BAEL survey (Labour Force Survey) in 2005 Q3 indicates an acceleration of the recovery in the labour market. In 2005 Q3, the growth rate of working persons in the economy increased (growth of 2.8% y/y as compared to 1.9% in 2005 Q2 and - excluding private farming - of 3.7% in comparison to 2.7% in 2005 Q2). Along ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51, with that, unemployment continued to decrease (according to BAEL, the unemployment rate was at 17.4% in 2005 Q3, in comparison to 18.2% a year before, whereas according to the data from the labour offices  it reached 17.6% in December in comparison to 19.0% a year before). The recovery in the labour market is accompanied by a considerable increase in the labour supply. In 2005 Q3, the economically active figure stood at 17.4 million (growth of 1.7% y/y), which was the highest level recorded since the first BAEL survey in 1992. December reported a lower growth of wages in the corporate sector (nominal growth of 1.5% y/y as compared to 6.9% y/y in December and 6.4% y/y in November). Growth in wages was much lower than in the previous months due to the shift in the payments of the annual bonus in the mining industry, which had increased the growth rate in the previous two months. In 2005 Q4 as a whole, the nominal growth of wages in the corporate sector stood at 4.8%, this being the highest rate in 2005. It means that increased growth in output was in this period accompanied by acceleration in the growth of wages. It should be emphasised that a necessary condition for a sustained acceleration in economic growth grounded in the rise of employment is that - in the longer run - the growth in real wages is not faster than the growth in labour productivity. The annual growth in consumer prices in December declined to 0.7%. The decrease in the annual inflation mainly reflected the decline in the prices of food and fuels. The fall in food prices in December resulted, among other things, from their high supply, introduction of restrictions on Polish food exports to Russia and the decreased demand for poultry caused by the bird flu effect. The drop in fuel prices was mainly due to the reduction in distribution margins. The continuing appreciation of the zloty was an important factor favouring the decline in inflation. ”Net” inflation stabilized at a low level and amounted to 1.1% in November and December. The remaining core inflation measures stayed in the range of -0.4%-1.0%. In January inflation expectations of households decreased to 0.9% against 1.5% in the previous month. This decline was mostly associated with the decrease in inflation in November 2005. December 2005 saw a slight increase  for the first time since April 2005  in producer prices in industry in annual terms (growth of 0.5% y/y; i.e. fall of 0.4% m/m). The low level of producer prices in industry resulted from a stronger than a year ago zloty exchange rate and a moderate growth in domestic demand. The NBP inflation projection presented in the January Inflation Report was prepared on the basis of data available as of 2 January 2006 and so, among others, it does not account for the GUS estimates of GDP in 2005. The projection indicates that with a 50-percent probability the annual GDP growth should stay in the range of 3.8%-5.1% in 2006, 3.4%-5.2% in 2007 and 3.6%-5.5% in 2008, respectively. The January inflation projection indicates that growth in prices in 2006 will be lower than expected in the August projection. In 2007 inflation will accelerate and at the end of the year should be close to the level from the projection presented in August 2005. Assuming unchanged interest rates, there is a 50-percent probability that inflation will stay within the range of 0.5%-2.3% in 2006 Q4 (compared to 1.0%-3.1% in the August Report) 1.1%-3.6% in 2007 Q4 (compared to 1.2%- 4.1%) and 0.8%-3.9% in 2008 Q4. It has to be emphasised that the inflation projection and the distribution of probabilities presented in the Report do not account for all sources of uncertainty related to the scale of future rise in employment, the impact of globalisation effects on price processes, the economic policy of the government in the years to come and the path of the exchange rate. Moreover, the projection does not allow for the latest developments which may have great bearing on the forecast growth of prices. On the one hand, oil prices in January 2006 were higher than accounted for in the projection. On the other, the zloty exchange rate in January was stronger and the data on national accounts indicate that the GDP growth in 2005 Q4 and the whole of 2005 was slightly lower, while the rise in investments was significantly higher, than assumed in the January projection. #NAME? The next meeting of the Council will be held on 21-22 February 2006."
United States,2006-01-31,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4-1/2 percent. Although recent economic data have been uneven, the expansion in economic activity appears solid. Core inflation has stayed relatively low in recent months and longer-term inflation expectations remain contained. Nevertheless, possible increases in resource utilization as well as elevated energy prices have the potential to add to inflation pressures. The Committee judges that some further policy firming may be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance. In any event, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to foster these objectives. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Alan Greenspan.

Euroarea,2006-02-02,"Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to welcome you to our press conference and report on the outcome of today's meeting of the ECB's Governing Council. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we have decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. We have also concluded that the most recent information from the economic analysis broadly underpins our assessment of the outlook for price developments and the euro area economy, and that monetary and credit growth remains strong and liquidity ample. Against this background, we will exercise vigilance so as to ensure the solid anchoring of long-term inflation expectations at levels in line with price stability. Such vigilance is also warranted, given the historically low levels of both nominal and real interest rates across the whole maturity spectrum and the overall accommodative stance of monetary policy. In order for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting growth and employment in the euro area, inflation expectations must be firmly anchored. Turning first to the economic analysis, recent data continue to lend support to the scenario for economic activity embodied in the December 2005 Eurosystem staff projections. Hence, our assessment of the outlook for growth in the euro area has been broadly confirmed. Economic activity started to improve and broaden in the second half of 2005 and, on the basis of the latest indicators and survey data, it appears that this process has basically continued, taking into account the usual degree of volatility of quarterly growth rates. Looking ahead, the conditions remain in place for economic growth to continue over the coming quarters. The external environment is favourable, providing support for euro area exports. Investment is expected to remain strong, benefiting from an extended period of very favourable financing conditions, balance sheet restructuring, and accumulated and ongoing gains in earnings and business efficiency. Consumption growth should also strengthen over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, as the labour market situation gradually improves. This outlook for economic activity is also confirmed by available forecasts. Downside risks to economic growth, relating, in particular, to persistently high and volatile oil prices and concerns about global imbalances, still dominate on the external side. In relation to price developments, annual HICP inflation was 2.2% in December, down from 2.3% in November and 2.5% in October. Over the short term, annual inflation rates may again increase somewhat, reflecting in particular renewed increases in energy prices and some base effects. Looking further ahead, indirect effects of past oil price rises on other components of the price index may gradually materialise, and already announced changes to administered prices and indirect taxes can be expected to have an upward impact on HICP inflation. Meanwhile, wage dynamics have remained moderate over recent quarters and are assumed to remain so for the time being, reflecting, in particular, global competitive pressure. All in all, currently available information is broadly in line with the scenario embodied in the December 2005 Eurosystem staff projections for HICP inflation over this year and next. Risks to this outlook for price developments remain on the upside and include further rises in oil prices, a pass-through of oil prices into consumer prices stronger than currently envisaged, additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, and  more fundamentally  potential second-round effects on wage and price-setting behaviour. It is therefore crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities also in the context of a more favourable economic environment. Turning to the monetary analysis, the annual growth rate of M3 remains robust, even though it moderated further in December. This moderation can be explained in part by an apparent resumption of the unwinding of past portfolio shifts, which exerts a dampening effect on headline M3 growth. However, the trend rate of monetary expansion remains strong, reflecting the stimulative impact of the prevailing low level of interest rates. In particular, growth in the most liquid components of M3 continues to be very robust and the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector has increased further. Mortgage borrowing is particularly buoyant, implying a need to monitor developments in the housing market closely. Overall, strong monetary and credit growth in a context of already ample liquidity in the euro area points to risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. To sum up, the economic analysis suggests that indirect effects stemming from past oil price rises and already announced changes to administered prices and indirect taxes can be expected to have an upward impact on annual HICP inflation over the coming years. It also indicates that risks to price stability over the medium term remain on the upside. Cross-checking the outcome of our economic analysis with that of our monetary analysis supports the case for vigilance to ensure that the risks to price stability over the medium to longer term do not materialise. It is indeed essential that such risks do not affect medium and long-term inflation expectations, which need to remain firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. This is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution to sustainable economic growth and job creation. As regards fiscal policy, recent information points to somewhat better than expected outcomes for 2005 in a number of countries and for the euro area as a whole. With the improvements in economic growth, determined fiscal consolidation is now even more important. In particular, countries with excessive deficits must take this opportunity to reduce their fiscal imbalances in a decisive and sustainable manner. This would strongly support the European fiscal framework as established by the Stability and Growth Pact. Delaying consolidation would be both inappropriate in the short term and risky in the longer term. Adjustment efforts should be based on credible, fully specified measures as part of a comprehensive consolidation programme. Any windfall gains from higher than expected growth or other factors should be allocated to speeding up deficit reduction. This would help to prevent a repeat of past experiences, when complacency in good times contributed to persistent budgetary disequilibria. With respect to structural reforms, the Governing Council discussed a range of issues relating to the euro area services sector. Services-related activities represent an important input for other sectors of the economy and account for a large, growing share of output and employment in the euro area, standing, in both cases, at around 70% in recent years. Given the services sector's increasingly important role, the need to ensure a fully integrated internal market for services in the European Union is at the forefront of the European policy agenda. Structural reforms aimed at increasing competition in both EU and international services markets would allow firms to benefit from economies of scale and should be expected to increase economic efficiency. This would support both a higher level and stronger growth rate of labour productivity in the services sector, promote a more dynamic economy and create more jobs. Moreover, a higher level of competition in the services market should have a dampening impact on prices and would contribute to the reduction of price stickiness in some areas of the services sector. Overall, opening up the services sector to new entrants would tend to foster more efficient and flexible services markets, facilitate adjustment processes and increase the resilience of the euro area to economic shocks. This would support economic growth and employment in the longer run."
South Africa,2006-02-02,"Issued by Mr T T Mboweni. Governor of the South African Reserve Bank. The inflation outlook remains promising despite the risks posed by an uncertain global environment. World growth is expected to remain buoyant in most regions, although international oil price developments continue to weigh on global growth and inflation prospects. At the same time, world growth has underpinned international commodity prices which, along with positive non-resident investor sentiment, have contributed to the recent strength in the rand. This has been despite monetary policy tightening in a number of countries, in particular the United States of America and the euro area. Domestically, there are few signs of a slowdown in domestic demand. Output growth in the manufacturing and mining sectors have shown some signs of moderation in the final quarter of 2005, although overall growth is expected to remain relatively strong. Domestic demand conditions and oil price uncertainties pose the biggest risk to the inflation outlook. Inflation as measured by the consumer price index for metropolitan and other urban areas excluding the interest cost on mortgage bonds (CPIX) declined to 3,7 per cent in November, but increased to 4,0 per cent in December. Although domestic petrol prices were decreased by a total of R0,61 in these two months, these prices nevertheless increased on a year-on-year basis by 17,7 per cent and 16,0 per cent respectively. If petrol prices were excluded from this index. CPIX inflation would have measured 3,0 per cent and 3,4 per cent in November and December respectively. For the year as a whole. CPIX inflation averaged 3,9 per cent in 2005 compared to 4,3 per cent in 2004. Services price inflation has declined consistently since June 2005, and measured 5,0 per cent and 4,7 per cent in November and December respectively, compared to 5,2 per cent in October. Administered price inflation has also continued to decline, falling to 7,5 per cent and 7,0 per cent in November and December respectively. If petrol prices were excluded, administered prices would have increased at a year-on-year rate of 4,3 per cent in each of the three months to December 2005, more or less in line with overall CPIX inflation. Clothing and footwear continue to put downward pressure on inflation, and prices in these two categories declined at year-on-year rates of around 4 per cent in the last 4 months of 2005. By contrast, food prices rose at an annual rate of 4,0 per cent in December, compared to the average for the year of 2,1 per cent. The December increase in food prices was mainly attributable to meat prices which rose at a year-on-year rate of 6,9 per cent, compared to 1,1 per cent the previous month. Production price inflation has exhibited a more discernible rising trend, with year-on-year producer price inflation measuring 4,5 per cent and 5,1 per cent in November and December respectively. Imported goods inflation measured 5,7 per cent and 6,5 per cent in these two months while domestically produced goods increased by 4,0 per cent and 4,6 per cent respectively. Producer price inflation for 2005 as a whole averaged 3,1 per cent compared to 0,6 per cent the previous year. Since the last MPC meeting, the inflation forecast of the South African Reserve Bank has changed somewhat, with the inflation trajectory now expected to follow a more moderately rising trend compared to that discussed at the previous meeting. According to the central forecast. CPIX inflation is expected to peak at around 4,9 per cent in the first quarter of 2007 whereafter it is expected to decline slowly to reach around 4,7 per cent at the end of the forecast period. As usual the MPC considered the factors that brought about this outlook as well as the related risks. The robust domestic demand is an important factor which could negatively affect the inflation outcome. To date, however, there have not been any significant inflationary consequences, although this could change if demand growth were to accelerate unchecked. Indications are that household consumption expenditure growth has remained strong. According to the latest FNB/BER survey, consumer confidence reached a record high in the fourth quarter of 2005. New vehicle sales reached an all-time high in December, and increased by 25,7 per cent over the year as a whole. Retail sales have also continued to grow robustly, and recent trading and earnings updates from retailers, as well as credit extension data, suggest that sales growth in November and December of 2005 probably matched or exceeded the 7,7 per cent year-on-year growth recorded in October. The strong domestic demand has been underpinned by the growth in credit extension. Total loans and advances to the private sector grew at year-on-year rates of around 20 per cent during October and November 2005, and rose to 21,4 per cent in December. This growth in total loans and advances has been driven mainly by an increase in asset-backed credit. Mortgage advances extended to the household sector remain particularly strong. Asset price developments and their related wealth effects have probably also contributed to the consumption boom. The housing market remains buoyant, although the rate of increase in house prices has moderated somewhat. In December 2005, the ABSA house price index increased on a month-on-month basis by 0,7 per cent. Moreover the recent stellar performance of the JSE Securities Exchange could also impact on consumer demand. During the past few months, share prices have continued to reach new highs. Since reaching a low point for 2005 in April, the all-share index has increased by approximately 60 per cent. The brisk domestic demand has had an impact on the current account deficit which increased to 4,7 per cent of GDP in the third quarter of 2005. A sizeable trade surplus was recorded in December following a sharp decline in imports. This has contributed to a significant narrowing of the trade deficit from R19,6 billion in the third quarter to R1,4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2005. This is likely to result in a narrowing of the current account deficit in that quarter. Continued strong domestic demand is expected to maintain pressure on the current account. However the current account deficit continues to be more than adequately financed by capital inflows which in turn are being attracted by improved economic growth prospects in South Africa. The overall balance of payments has remained in surplus, and the level of official gross gold and foreign exchange reserves increased to US$22,2 billion at the end of January 2006. The coincident business cycle indicator declined slightly in October 2005, although indications are that the economy is still growing at a healthy but perhaps more moderate pace. The physical volume of mining production declined in October and November, while manufacturing output declined in October, mainly as a result of supply issues in the petroleum industry related to the change to lead-free fuel. Although refinery shut-downs continued into November, manufacturing output recovered somewhat in that month, recording a year-on-year growth of 2,1 per cent. The latest Investec Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) also indicates that there might be a general slackening in manufacturing sector growth. The various business confidence indices indicate that confidence generally remains at high levels. Two exogenous factors, namely oil and food price developments, are potential risks to the inflation outlook. At the time of the last MPC meeting the price of Brent crude oil was around US$55 per barrel, but since the beginning of 2006 international oil prices have risen again to levels of around US$65 per barrel. Apart from continued strong demand for oil, upward pressure on prices has emanated from supply threats related to geo-political concerns. The higher prices have already resulted in a domestic petrol price increase of R0,14 per litre in February, which more than offset the R0,06 per litre decrease in January. Developments in food price inflation are also a potential concern. As noted earlier, food price inflation has accelerated but is still relatively low. Food price inflation is expected to be higher in 2006 partly as a result of the low base in 2005. Furthermore, the higher food price inflation evident in production prices, along with higher maize prices also point to a possible acceleration in retail food price inflation going forward. There are a number of factors which have contributed to the positive inflation outlook. These include continued fiscal discipline, low world inflation and well-anchored inflation expectations. Inflation expectations as indicated in the long-term break-even inflation rates, measured as the yield differential between conventional bonds and inflation-linked bonds, point to some improvement in inflation expectations since the last meeting. Nominal wage growth recorded a year-on-year increase of 7,9 per cent in the third quarter of 2005. However positive productivity growth ensured that unit labour cost increases have remained consistent with the inflation target. Unit labour cost in the formal non-agricultural sectors recorded annual increases of 3,5 per cent and 4,2 per cent in the second and third quarters of 2005 respectively. Unit labour cost in manufacturing grew at an annual rate of 0,2 per cent in the third quarter. These moderate trends in wage increases are consistent with the latest Andrew Levy Employment Publications report which shows that average wage settlements declined from 6,9 per cent in 2004 to 6,3 per cent in 2005. Since the last meeting of the MPC, the nominal effective exchange rate of the rand has appreciated by approximately 1,7 per cent. During this period, the rand has fluctuated between R6,75 to the US dollar in November 2005 and R5,95 in January, and is currently trading at levels around R6,10. The strengthening of the rand was in part a reflection of US dollar depreciation. In addition, the rand was supported by high commodity prices, expectations of further foreign direct investment inflows, positive South African economic data as well as strong demand from non-residents for South African equities. There are significant risk factors to the inflation outlook that the Monetary Policy Committee is mindful of. Nevertheless, the Monetary Policy Committee has decided for now to leave the repo rate unchanged at 7 per cent per annum. The MPC will continue to exercise vigilance in order to ensure that CPIX inflation stays within the inflation target range."
Philippines,2006-02-08,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board maintained the BSP's key policy interest rates at 7.5 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.75 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. The Monetary Board's assessment of recent economic data continues to support keeping policy settings unchanged. The sustained easing of core inflation, combined with indications of weaker demand based on consumer spending data and slowing domestic liquidity growth, suggests minimal demand-side pressures on goods and services in the near term. As a result, the impact of rising inputs costs on consumer prices also remains muted. The strength of the peso also helps to offset potential near-term pressures on the cost side. Monetary authorities expect the impact of the RVAT to consist mainly of one-off increases in prices and is unlikely to fuel a sustained rise in inflation. In addition, mitigating measures are also being planned to cushion the impact of the RVAT increase. The BSP fully supports the non-monetary measures of the National Government to address sharp price increases in major commodities and services. The BSP remains focused on achieving the inflation target for 2007 and addressing the risks to future inflation. Global energy prices continue to be a key risk factor in the outlook for inflation. Spot and futures of oil have again assumed an upward path given geopolitical tensions in major oil producing countries. In the near term, oil prices are expected to remain sensitive to news relating to supply disruptions given limited surplus production capacity. In addition, second round effects, particularly in the form of wage adjustments, and any adverse shift in inflation expectations due to the RVAT increase will continue to be monitored closely. The Monetary Board continues to assess the evolving conditions for consumer prices, aggregate demand, domestic liquidity and other factors in order to determine the appropriate stance of monetary policy and undertake action if necessary."
Romania,2006-02-08,"In its meeting of February 8, 2006, the Board of the National Bank of Romania analysed the latest monetary and macroeconomic developments and their prospects, and decided the following:. The NBR Board also examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report that will be released to the public in a press conference organized on February 15, 2006, along with a 12-month calendar of NBR Board meetings dedicated to monetary policy issues. The inflation rate reached 8.6 percent at the end of last year versus 9.3 percent in 2004, marginally overshooting the upper limit of the target band of 6.5-8.5 percent, associated with the 7.5 percent target. The slippage arose due to sharp adjustments in administered prices, substantial increases in disposable incomes following the introduction of the flat tax, rises in volatile food prices under the impact of floods, as well as non-government credit expansion. However, core inflation, which monetary policy is better able to influence effectively, stayed on a downward path, with its decrease becoming stronger in the last part of 2005. The overall analysis of economic developments reveals a slowdown in economic growth, with consumption staying at an unsustainable level and with strong investment dynamics. Domestic output has lagged significantly behind demand expansion, deepening both external and domestic imbalances. Credit expansion continued, with leu-denominated loans witnessing a revival of their growth while foreign exchange credit saw a deceleration in pace following the NBR measures implemented in the latter part of 2005. Foreign exchange reserves saw a steep rise throughout last year, reaching an adequate level, amounting to the equivalent of 6.1 months of imports, which has allowed the central bank to refrain from foreign exchange market interventions since October 2005, in the context of maintaining the managed float exchange rate regime. The approaching European Union integration implies the achievement of significant disinflation, an overriding objective that requires a mix of tight economic policies - monetary, fiscal and wage, together with an acceleration of structural reforms. Under the circumstances, the NBR Board adopted a comprehensive set of measures to tighten monetary policy. Therefore, the NBR Board has decided to raise the monetary policy rate to 8.5 percent a year from 7.5 percent and to maintain the practice of substantial sterilization of excess liquidity via open-market operations, a decision which will help keep the effective monetary policy rate on a path consistent with meeting the medium-term inflation objective. Moreover, in order to increase the predictability and efficiency of one-month deposit-taking operations, the NBR Board decided to set a timetable of auctions for such deposits, which will be held on a weekly basis, every Monday. In order to contain the accelerated dynamics of non-government credit, especially of foreign exchange borrowing, and taking into account the need to minimize a resurgence of volatile capital inflows, the NBR Board decided to increase the minimum reserve ratio on foreign exchange denominated liabilities of credit institutions to 40 percent from 35 percent, starting with 24 March - 23 April 2006 maintenance period, and also decided to maintain the prudential measures adopted so far. The measures to tighten monetary policy, along with rapid implementation of the legislation regulating the lending activity of the non-bank financial institutions will help bring inflation back on the trajectory set under the forecast horizon, which has been extended to eight quarters from six quarters previously coming into line with the time frame of complete transmission of monetary policy impulses through the economy. The NBR Board also considers that maintaining the inflation targets at 5 percent for 2006 and 4 percent for 2007 while implementing a consistent package of restrictive economic policies and providing a medium-term outlook would better anchor inflation expectations, thus ensuring a smooth achievement of an effective disinflation process and the convergence towards the inflation levels recorded in the EU. The NBR Board reaffirms that it is ready to use the entire available array of instruments to counter inflationary pressures."
Chile,2006-02-09,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 9 February 2006 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.75% (annual). The external scenario relevant to the Chilean economy continues to be favorable, with a persistently high copper price and an advantageous international financial environment. Internally, financial conditions are still expansionary. Domestic demand is showing signs of moderating its fast growth rate and activity growth continues above its trend. The above reaffirms that output deceleration of the third quarter of last year may have been partly transitory, in line with projections in the latest Monetary Policy Report. Although the annual growth pace of job creation has moderated, salaried employment continues to grow vigorously. Twelve-month inflation was just above 4%, and core inflation measures CPIX and CPIX1 (that exclude fuels, perishables and some regulated utilities, among others) are already around 3%. Although annualized inflation is expected to remain over 4% in the short term, prospects remain that it will converge to 3% during the course of this year, consistently with the baseline scenario described in the latest Monetary Policy Report. Other indicators of the inflation trend and the various measures of expected inflation continue well anchored around the center of the target range. The Board believes that, in the most likely scenario, it will continue with the gradual reduction of the prevailing monetary stimulus, in order to maintain expected inflation around 3% per annum over the normal policy horizon of 12 to 24 months. * The Spanish original prevails.

Peru,2006-02-15,"Press Release MONETARY PROGRAM FOR FEBRUARY 2006 CENTRAL BANK RAISES REFERENCE RATE FROM 3.50% TO 3.75% The Board of the Central Bank acknowledge the following information: The Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) rose 0.5 percent in January, explained by temporary price rises of poultry (8.6 percent) and other food as potato and vegetables, related the two latter with sowings delays. Thus, the CPI inflation rate over the last twelve months was 1.9 percent, within the target range (1.5 percent  3.5 percent). It is expected the convergence of inflation toward its target level (2.5 percent) in 2006. The economic activity would have been accelerated its growth in the fourth quarter (7.5 percent), being maintained the estimation of a 6.3 percent growth for 2005, the highest rate since 1997. The indicators of consumer confidence are located also in their higher levels ever registered. The growing tendency of the trade balance surplus is maintained, being forecasted a record of US$ 1 676 million for the fourth quarter 2005, reaching an annual surplus of US$ 5 163 million or 6.6 percent of GDP. The terms of trade increased 7.0 percent that year due to the 18.4 percent increase of export prices. The average exchange rate average diminished 0.9 percent in January, from 3.43 per dollar in December to 3.39 per dollar. Thus, in January, the real exchange rate diminished 0.3 percent (4.0 percent of real depreciation in the last twelve months). The pressures for the nominal exchange rate increase at the beginning of month were dissipated completely in the second two-week period, so the exchange rate closed January at 3.31 per dollar. In the first two-week period of January, the Central Bank intervened with US$ 364 million in the exchange market (sales of US$ 355 million and placements of Adjustable Certificates of Deposit (CDRBCRP) by US$ 9 million) to avoid an excessive exchange rate volatility. During last month, the bank's balance of net forward sales increased US$ 202 million, the public purchases of dollars in the spot market were of US$ 172 million and the bank's exchange position diminished by 1 US$ 69 million. Since January 17, the Central Bank has not intervened in the exchange market. The average interest rate of the interbank market was 3.58 percent in January, higher than the one observed in the previous month (3.33 percent), while the corporate prime rate for loans in soles passed from 4.4 percent to 5.2 percent. In this month, the BCRP carried out repo auctions in order to stabilize the interbank interest rate around the reference interest rate (3.50 percent in January). The country risk indicator diminished from 206 bps at the end of December to 160 bps at the end of January. In turn the 15-year maturity sovereign bond yield in soles diminished from 8.3 to 8.0 percent. The Board of the Central Bank approved to raise the reference interest rate for the interbank market from 3.50 percent to 3.75 percent. This decision has been take considering: The dynamism of the economic activity for 2006 (5.0 percent) is consistent with the continuous accomplishment of inflation target (from 1.5 to 3.5 percent). The raise in the interest rate will cooperate to reduce the exchange rate volatility. The Bank will continue, if necessary, selling exchange currency at spot market and auctions of Adjustable Certificate Deposits (CDRBCRP) to avoid undesirable effects over prices and economic activity in general. As mentioned in the Press Releases of the two previous Monetary Programs, this decision does not imply a sequence of raises in the reference interest rate. It was approved to raise the lending and deposits interest rates for the Central Bank operations: For direct repos and monetary regulation credits, the rate raises to 4.50 percent. For overnight deposits, the rate raises to 3.00 percent. In the case that the interbank interest rate be higher than 4.50 percent, monetary regulation credits and direct repos will be charged with the market interbank interest rate. 2 The interest rates for the following operations in dollars between the Central Bank and the Financial System are: Monetary regulation credits: 1-month LIBOR plus one percent point. Overnight deposits: overnight LIBOR minus 3/8 of a percentage point. Swap: the commission raises to a level that implies a minimum annual effective cost of 4.50 percent. Reserve requirement in foreign deposits subject to payment: 2.25 percent.

Malaysia,2006-02-22,"Bank Negara Malaysia today announced that the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) is raised by 25 basis points to 3.25 percent. The ceiling and floor rates of the corridor for the OPR are correspondingly increased to 3.50 percent and 3.00 percent respectively. Malaysia's economic growth strengthened in the second-half of 2005 and is expected to gain momentum in 2006, sustained by private sector demand and strong economic growth in the global and regional economies. Inflationary conditions have remained, mainly on account of higher energy prices and rising costs. While inflationary pressures are not expected to intensify, the rate of inflation is expected to remain in the region of the current levels for some time. The change in the OPR is intended to align monetary conditions to the current environment. The stance of monetary policy continues to remain supportive of economic activity. Going forward, monetary policy would respond to new developments that have implications for the medium term prospects for price stability and sustainable economic growth.

Poland,2006-02-28,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 28 February 2006 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 27-28 February 2006 The Council decided to lower the NBP interest rates by 0.25 percentage point to the following levels: reference rate 4.00% on an annual basis; lombard rate 5.50% on an annual basis; deposit rate 2.50% on an annual basis; rediscount rate 4.25% on an annual basis. Since the Council's meeting in January 2006, no significant changes in the outlook for economic growth and inflation in the external environment of the Polish economy have been observed. In January, the annual growth of consumer prices in the euro area increased to 2.4% from 2.2% in December, while in the United States it rose from 3.4% to 4.0%. The price of crude oil decreased between the January meeting of the Council and 24 February 2006 (Brent oil price dropped by USD 4.6 per barrel, i.e. by 7.0%). The average Brent oil price in February was 5.7% lower than in January. Despite that, the average oil price for 2006 forecasted by analysts in the Reuters survey increased from USD 55.2 in January to USD 58.0 in February 2006, i.e. 5.1%. Still, high uncertainty persists as to the effect of the large increase of oil price on economic growth and inflation. The data published since the Council's previous meeting indicate the continuation of growth tendencies in the Polish economy, which have been observed since 2005 Q2. The upward trend in the annual growth of industrial output observed for the past two quarters points to a recovery in industry. In January 2006 the growth of industrial output was consistent with the expectations of both majority of external forecasters and the NBP, and amounted to 9.5% y/y. At the same time. GUS revised upwards the data on output growth in December 2005 (from 9.2% to 9.6%). In seasonally adjusted terms, growth in the industrial output in January amounted to 7.4% as compared to 13.3% in December 2005. January saw a drop in the output in construction, which resulted mainly from unfavourable weather conditions. The annual growth in the construction and assembly output dropped to -7.8% down from 8.2% recorded in December 2005, i.e. to -3.2% from 10.6% in seasonally adjusted terms. The growth of retail sales exceeded the expectations and amounted to 8.6% y/y in nominal terms (a little lower in real terms) this being the highest growth since July 2005. To some extent this surge resulted from increased sales of fuels, which was due to very low temperatures recorded in January 2006. 2005 Q4 brought a marked acceleration in the growth of wages in the economy. It amounted to 5.1% y/y as compared to 3.4% y/y in 2005 Q3. The data on higher wage growth combined with ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51, the estimated GDP and employment indicate that the growth of unit labour costs in the economy most probably increased in the 2005 Q4 Wage growth in the corporate sector in January was 3.6% y/y. This growth was affected by shifting of bonus payments in mining and quarrying, which significantly lowered wage growth in this sector in January. The employment in the corporate sector has been growing since the beginning of 2005. In January 2006, employment in the corporate sector was 2.6% higher than a year before. The unemployment rate in January rose as a result of seasonal factors to 18.0%, but it decreased by 1.4 percentage point as compared to the corresponding period a year before. It should be emphasised that a necessary condition for a sustained acceleration of economic growth, which should not threaten the achievement of the inflation target is that  in the longer run  the growth in real wages does not outpace the growth in labour productivity. According to preliminary data, the annual consumer prices growth in January stayed at the previous month's level (0.7% y/y) and was lower than the expectations of both the NBP and market analysts. The annual inflation stabilised despite an increase in the annual growth rate of food, housing and energy prices. The low inflation was driven by higher-than-expected drop in growth of prices of fuels, newspapers, magazines and electronic equipment. At present, it is difficult to assess to what extent this drop will prove permanent. February 2006 saw further decrease in households' inflation expectations (0.6% against 0.9% in the previous month). To a large extent, this development was related to the drop in inflation in December 2005. January 2006 saw an increase in annual growth of producer prices in industry up to 0.5% y/y as compared to 0.2% in December (0.4% m/m against -0.7% in December). This rise occurred even though the effective exchange rate of the Polish zloty was stronger than a year before. The developments in the economy after the publication of the January inflation projection, coupled with zloty appreciation and lower than expected inflation, increase the probability of inflation in 2006 running below the level presented in the projection. In the projection horizon, the growth in domestic demand and unit labour costs will be gradually pushing inflation back to the target. Factors that may be decreasing domestic inflation include the growing imports from low costs countries and increasing flexibility of the labour market. In turn, the growing migration of the Polish workforce to EU countries may have the opposite effect. Moreover, if growth of employment was sustained at a larger scale than in the projection, this would lead to inflation running higher than in the projection. Uncertainty factors still include the situation in the oil market and also the impact of a potential increase in budget deficit in relation to that envisaged in the convergence programme. The Council maintains its belief that implementing an economic strategy focused on creating conditions which ensure introduction of the euro at the earliest possible date would be most favourable for Poland and would contribute to higher long-term economic growth. The next meeting of the Council will be held on 28-29 March 2006."
Euroarea,2006-03-02,"Ladies and gentlemen, let me welcome you to our press conference and report on the outcome of today's meeting of the ECB's Governing Council. The meeting was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup. Prime Minister Juncker, and Commissioner Almunia. At today's meeting, we decided to increase the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. This decision reflects the upside risks to price stability that we have identified on the basis of both our economic and monetary analyses. The adjustment of interest rates will contribute to ensuring that medium to long-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability, which is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. Interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum still remain at very low levels in both nominal and real terms, and our monetary policy remains accommodative. While this policy stance reflects our current assessment, we will continue to monitor closely all developments with respect to risks to price stability. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, quarter-on-quarter real GDP growth in the euro area was 0.3% in the fourth quarter of 2005. This was considerably lower than the strong 0.6% recorded in the previous quarter. However, looking through the short-term volatility and assessing recent economic indicators and survey information, the evidence suggests that economic activity is improving. Accordingly, we should see stronger growth rates over the short term, as also reflected in various indicator-based estimates. Looking further ahead, the conditions remain in place for ongoing economic expansion in the euro area. The external environment remains favourable, providing support for euro area exports. Investment is expected to remain strong, benefiting from an extended period of very favourable financing conditions, corporate balance sheet restructuring and gains in earnings and business efficiency. Consumption growth should also strengthen gradually over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, as the labour market situation gradually improves. The March ECB staff macroeconomic projections have provided an additional input into our analysis of the prospects for economic activity. These projections foresee average annual real GDP growth in a range between 1.7% and 2.5% in 2006, and between 1.5% and 2.5% in 2007. The results constitute a slight upward revision to the Eurosystem staff projections of December 2005, mainly reflecting a somewhat stronger outlook for private investment over the projection horizon. Most recent forecasts by international organisations and private sector institutions give a broadly similar picture. In the view of the Governing Council, downside risks to this outlook for growth relate mainly to oil price developments and global imbalances. Turning to price developments, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 2.3% in February 2006, compared with 2.4% in January. In the short run, inflation rates are likely to remain at above 2%, with the precise levels depending strongly on future energy price developments, which have recently been relatively volatile. Beyond the short term, changes in administered prices and indirect taxes are expected to significantly affect inflation in 2006 and 2007, and an upward impact can also be expected from the indirect effects of past oil price increases. At the same time, wage dynamics in the euro area have remained moderate over the recent past; our working assumption is that this will continue to be the case, due not least to strong global competitive pressures, particularly in the manufacturing sector. Moderate wage trends have helped to contain domestic inflationary pressure despite strong oil price increases. Therefore, looking ahead, it is crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities in this regard, also in the context of a more favourable economic environment. Further input into our assessment of the outlook for price developments is again provided by the March ECB staff projections. Annual HICP inflation is projected to lie between 1.9% and 2.5% in 2006, and between 1.6% and 2.8% in 2007. Compared with the December 2005 Eurosystem staff projections, these ranges imply a slight upward revision to the profile for HICP inflation over the coming years, reflecting mainly an increase in the assumption for future oil prices, in line with market expectations. Risks to the outlook for price developments remain on the upside and include further increases in oil prices, a stronger pass-through of oil price rises into consumer prices than currently anticipated, additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, and  more fundamentally  stronger wage and price developments than expected due to second-round effects of past oil price increases. Turning to the monetary analysis, the Governing Council has again discussed the assessment of monetary developments in depth. The annual growth rate of M3 remains robust, notwithstanding signs of a resumption of the unwinding of past portfolio shifts into monetary assets, which exerts a dampening effect on headline M3 growth. Looking through the short-term effects generated by such portfolio behaviour, the trend rate of monetary expansion remains strong, reflecting the stimulative impact of the low level of interest rates. Moreover, the annual growth rate of credit to the private sector has strengthened further over recent months, with borrowing by households  especially loans for house purchase  and non-financial corporations rising at a marked pace. Overall, strong monetary and credit growth in an environment of ample liquidity in the euro area points to risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. To sum up, annual inflation rates are projected to remain elevated in 2006 and 2007, and the economic analysis indicates that risks to price stability over the medium term remain on the upside. Given the strength of monetary growth and the ample liquidity situation, cross-checking the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms that upside risks to price stability prevail. By acting in a timely fashion, the Governing Council is helping to keep medium and long-term inflation expectations in line with price stability and thereby making an ongoing contribution to sustainable economic growth and job creation. The Governing Council will continue to monitor closely all developments to ensure that risks to price stability do not materialise. As regards fiscal policies, while some countries plan to maintain or attain budgetary positions close to balance or in surplus over the horizon of their stability programmes, progress towards sound public finances in the euro area as a whole remains slow. A number of countries continue to report severe imbalances, and in some of them consolidation efforts barely attain the minimum required by the revised Stability and Growth Pact, despite the improving growth outlook. At the same time, the fiscal costs of population ageing cast a shadow over the long-term fiscal outlook for most euro area countries. It is therefore essential that countries pursue a more determined consolidation, introducing concrete and effective measures where needed. These consolidation efforts will more easily succeed if they are embedded in a comprehensive reform programme that adequately prepares for the long-term fiscal challenges. This will enhance the credibility of the revised Pact and create confidence in a sound and growth-friendly fiscal environment. The broader implications of population ageing also require attention in other fields of economic policy. Comprehensive structural reforms in labour and product markets and the creation of a favourable and competitive environment for firms are vital to support potential growth and raise employment rates as the demographic effects materialise. Completing the EU internal market  including the market for services  should be a key priority. On the labour supply side, tax and benefit system reforms are essential to provide stronger incentives for people to stay in or enter the labour market. On the labour demand side, there is a need to promote wage flexibility and address labour market rigidities. Moreover, better education and training are important for the development of human capital. The forthcoming meeting of the European Council on 23-24 March 2006 will review progress made with the Lisbon strategy, which was relaunched last year. We strongly support the initiatives taken by the European Commission and the European Council to revive this reform process. A full and effective realisation of the necessary reforms is the key to the long-term economic success of the European Union."
Philippines,2006-03-08,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board maintained the BSP's key policy interest rates at 7.5 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.75 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. In its assessment of the monetary policy stance, the Monetary Board noted that prevailing conditions continue to provide room for the BSP to keep its policy rates steady in the near term. Despite the immediate impact of the VAT, the February inflation rate was within the BSP's forecast range for the month, and thus remains consistent with the projected path for inflation. The latest BSP forecasts continue to show a decelerating trend for inflation beginning in the second half of 2006. In addition, modest improvements in aggregate demand and bank lending amid the sustained slowdown in liquidity growth imply limited demand-side pressures on prices. Positive sentiment has also continued to strengthen the peso exchange rate, thus providing continued stability to domestic prices of imports. The Monetary Board recognizes that the outlook for inflation continues to be accompanied by various risks. The two-percentage point hike in the VAT rate, for example, has already prompted a round of one-time price increases, although it is not expected to fuel sustained inflation. Mitigating measures against the impact of the VAT rate hike will also help cushion its effect on consumer prices. International oil prices also remain a potential source of additional inflation pressure, as the global oil market remains sensitive to uncertainties about worldwide supply. The prospect of continued cost-side pressures may also lead to calls for wage increases. Against this backdrop, the Monetary Board reiterates its commitment to achieving the inflation target for 2007 and addressing the risks to future inflation. Managing the risk of potential second-round effects in wage- and price-setting remains a key priority for monetary policy, and authorities continue to watch closely for indications of any adverse shift in inflation expectations. The Monetary Board will continue to assess the evolving conditions for consumer prices, aggregate demand, domestic liquidity and other factors in order to determine the appropriate stance of monetary policy."
Thailand,2006-03-08,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 8 March 2006 Ms. Atchana Waiquamdee. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand, announces that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance. The main issues discussed are as follows. In 2005 Q4, the Thai economy grew at a slower pace compared with the previous quarter, and economic indicators in January 2006 pointed to a continued moderation in domestic demand. Nevertheless external demand expanded well, and the MPC viewed that the growth momentum should carry on going forward, being supported by a positive outlook on exports in accordance with favourable global economic trends. Pressure on internal stability remains. Although headline inflation has started to moderate, the MPC expected core inflation to stay high with some probability of exceeding the target range going forward. Meanwhile external stability has improved, with the current account continuing to be in surplus. With price pressure remaining and real interest rates still negative, the MPC judged that the policy interest rate should be raised again to keep future core inflation within the target. The MPC therefore decided to raise the 14-day repurchase rate by 25 basis points from 425 to 450 per cent per annum, effective immediately."
South Korea,2006-03-09,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (4.00%) for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). In the real economy, exports continue to exhibit steady growth, the recovery of private consumption has been maintained, and facilities investment is still recovering gradually. On the other hand, an improvement of construction investment has not yet been sufficient. Meanwhile, the current account is still running a surplus, although its scale has narrowed in reflection of the increased import demand. Both consumer price inflation and core inflation maintain overall stability. Nevertheless, there are latent inflationary pressures due to the economic recovery and persistently high oil prices. The recent rebound in real estate prices has continued centering on certain areas. In the financial markets, overall liquidity conditions are favorable and financial institutions‘ loans continue to increase steadily led by those to small and medium enterprises. Taking the above economic and financial conditions into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (4.00%) for the intermeeting period."
Peru,2006-03-15,"Press Release N° 012-2006-BCRP MONETARY PROGRAM FOR MARCH 2006 CENTRAL BANK RAISES REFERENCE INTEREST RATE FROM 3.75% TO 4.00% The Board of the Central Bank acknowledge the following information: The Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) rose 0.55 percent in February, explained by temporary price rises of poultry, potato and eggs (0.51 percentage points). Thus. CPI inflation rate over the last 12 months was 2.7 percent, within the target range (1.5  3.5 percent). Core inflation over the last 12 months was 0.9 percent. It is expected that the inflation rate over last 12 months be maintained around the target level (2.5 percent) through 2006. Economic activity grew 7.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005, thus GDP increased 6.7 percent in 2005, the highest growth rate since 1997. The indicators of consumer confidence are also located in their higher levels ever registered. The growing trend of the trade balance surplus is maintained, reaching a record of US$ 1 676 million for the fourth quarter of 2005, and an annual surplus of US$ 5 163 million or 6.6 percent of GDP. The terms of trade increased 7.0 percent that year due to the 18.4 percent increase of export prices. The average exchange rate decreased 3.1 percent in February to 3.29 per dollar from 3.39 per dollar in January. Thus, in February, the real exchange rate diminished 3.5 percent (0.5 percent of real appreciation in the last 12 months). During most of the month downward pressures on the nominal exchange rate were observed; however, during the last 2 days, upward pressures were registered, so the exchange rate closed February in 3.30 per dollar. Thus, it is maintained the high volatility of the exchange rate observed in the last months. In February, the Central Bank intervened purchasing US$ 59 million in the exchange market to avoid an excessive exchange rate volatility. It is worth to mention that no purchases were carried out since September of 1 the previous year. During February, the bank's balance of net forward sales of foreign currency was reduced in US$ 120 million, the public sales of dollars to banks in the spot market were of US$ 262 million and the bank's exchange position increased in US$ 74 million. The average interest rate of the interbank market was 3.82 percent in February, higher than in the previous month (3.58 percent), while the corporate prime rate for loans in soles increased from 5.1 percent to 5.4 percent in the same period. In February, the BCRP continued carrying out repo auctions in order to stabilize the interbank interest rate around the reference interest rate (3.75 percent in February). The country risk indicator dropped from 160 bps at the end of January to 143 bps at the end of February. This indicator reached a lowest level of 128 bps on February 27. The 15-year maturity sovereign bond yield in soles decreased from 8.0 to 7.5 percent. The Board of the Central Bank approved to raise the reference interest rate for the interbank market from 3.75 percent to 4.00 percent. This decision was taken considering that: The expected dynamism of the economic activity for 2006 (5.0 percent) is consistent with the continuous accomplishment of inflation target (from 1.5 to 3.5 percent). The raise of the reference interest rate will contribute to prevent situations of upward volatility in the exchange market. The Bank will continue, if necessary, with their interventions to reduce the exchange rate volatility, selling foreign currency at the spot market and auctioning Adjustable Certificate Deposits (CDRBCRP) to avoid undesirable effects on inflation and economic activity in general. This decision does not imply a sequence of interest rates rises. It was approved to raise the lending and deposits interest rates for the Central Bank operations: For direct repos and monetary regulation credits, the rate raises to 4.75 percent. For overnight deposits, the rate raises to 3.25 percent. In the case that the interbank interest rate be higher than 4.75 percent, monetary regulation credits and direct repos will be charged with the market interbank interest rate. The interest rates for the following operations in dollars between the Central Bank and the Financial System are: 2 Monetary regulation credits: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point. Overnight deposits: overnight LIBOR minus 3/8 of a percentage point. Swap: the commission raises to a level that implies a minimum annual effective cost of 4.75 percent. Reserve requirement deposits in foreign currency subject to payment: 2.25 percent. The session in which the Board will approve the following Monetary Program (April) will be held on April 6th, 2006. . 3."
Chile,2006-03-16,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 16 March 2006 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 4.75% (annual). Despite fluctuations due mainly to the incidence of changes in fuel prices, inflation has been in line with expectations in the last Monetary Policy Report. Annual CPI inflation is temporarily somewhat above 4%, and core inflation CPIX (that excludes fuels and perishables) is at 3.5%. Nonetheless, core inflation CPIX1 (that also excludes some regulated utility rates) and other inflation trend indicators, as well as the various measures of inflation expectations are still well anchored around the center of the target range. Output has continued to grow at a pace above its trend, leaving behind the relative weakness it showed the third quarter of last year. Domestic demand growth has slowed, although less than forecast in the last Monetary Policy Report, as a result of stronger consumption. Salaried employment continues to expand vigorously. The favorable external scenario faced by the Chilean economy looks somewhat better than in recent months, and domestic financial conditions are still expansionary. The Board considers that the information analyzed is insufficient to warrant acceleration, on this occasion, of the pace of monetary policy normalization. Notwithstanding the above, it reaffirms that future increases in the policy rate are still necessary to attain, in the most likely scenario, an inflation rate around 3% per annum over the normal policy horizon of 12 to 24 months. * The Spanish original prevails."
Hungary,2006-03-20,"At its meeting on 20 March 2006, the Monetary Council considered the latest economic and monetary developments and left the central bank base rate unchanged at 6.00%. Macroeconomic data released in recent weeks have reinforced the Council's overall assessment of domestic economic performance: economic prospects continue to be favourable both abroad and at home. Although the tax cuts early in 2006 have resulted in a smaller-than-expected fall in prices and, therefore, annual consumer price inflation may turn out higher in 2006 than expected earlier, recent data on wages and consumer prices as well as disinflation of market services prices which started in the early months of the year have not, overall, changed the favourable medium-term outlook for inflation. There was a marked change in international capital markets in March relative to earlier periods. Signs of tighter monetary conditions became prevalent in developed countries, which also weighed on emerging markets through the decline in investors' willingness to take risks around the world. In the past, the Monetary Council has on occasions drawn attention to the risks arising from a turnaround in the extremely favourable environment in international capital markets. Such risks, becoming increasingly discernible, underline the need to reduce the government budget deficit. It is by correcting economic imbalance that the effects of the unfavourable international processes can be mitigated. The Monetary Council considers meeting the medium-term inflation target as its most important duty. Were the changes in the international capital market environment or domestic balance to have a lasting effect on the underlying factors of the outlook for inflation, the Council will take them into account in taking its decisions."
Israel,2006-03-27,"27.3.2006 The Bank of Israel raises the interest rate for April 2006 by 25 basis points to 5 percent The interest rate for April 2006 will rise by 25 basis points to 5 percent. The decision to raise the interest rate is intended to help maintain price stability within the limits of the target of between one percent and three percent inflation a year determined by the government Background conditions The most recent economic data indicate relatively rapid growth in Israel. Thus, the composite state-of-the-economy index rose by 0.3 percent in February. Against the background of continued relatively rapid growth in the global economy and the expectation that the government's macroeconomic strategy will continue, growth is expected to be sustained. In February the CPI rose faster than anticipated (by 0.6 percent). The main surprise occurred in prices of non-seasonal foods. The actual price rise (in the previous twelve months) was 3.1 percent, slightly above the upperlimit of the inflation target. Inflation expectations for the next twelve months, derived from the capital market and economists' forecasts, are thatinflation will be close to the midpoint of the target range, under the assumption that the interest rate will continue to rise. The financial markets remained stable. Yields to all terms rose by 10 basis points from the beginning of March, and the exchange rate of the NIS hardly changed. Share prices went up in March, and the Tel Aviv 100 Index rose by 4.4 percent. In the major economies, the gradual process of rising interest rates continued. The European Central Bank increased its interest rate in March by 25 basis points, and the interest rate in the US is expected to continue rising moderately. Until the formation of a new government, budgetary policy will be governed by the law that in the absence of an approved budget, monthly expenditure is limited to one-twelfth of the previous year's budget. This ensures that budgetary policy will remain restrained during the period until the approval of a new budget. The Bank of Israel expects that the new government will continue to follow the responsible fiscal policy pursued in the last few years. During the last month there was no significant change in the level of geopolitical uncertainty. The main considerations that led to the decision Against this background, the Bank of Israel focused on the main factors that could affect the inflation environment in the coming twelve months: Increases in demand and the gradual contraction of the output gap; Developments in interest rates abroad and the interest-rate differential between the United States and Israel. Increases in demand in Israel and the process of utilizing the surplus production capacity continue to narrow the gap between potential and actual GDP (the output gap). This holds the potential for increasing the rate of inflation and accelerating the rise of nominal wages. There are several methods of measuring the output gap, but whichever method is used it is clear that the gap is narrowing. The increase in the rate of inflation over the previous twelve months from a level slightly below the price-stability range a year ago to a level slightly above it in February 2006 reflects at least in part the effect of the contraction of the output gap. Interest rates in the major world markets are expected to continue rising moderately. The Bank of Israel considers the interest-rate differential vis-?-vis abroad to be one of the important factors affecting the exchange rate and hence inflationary pressures. This is a factor that contributes to the decision to raise the interest rate for April. However, the Bank of Israel does not consider that a constant interest-rate differential vis-?-vis abroad is necessary in order to achieve the inflation target, but that the appropriate differential is affected by global and domestic economic developments. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor economic developments closely, with the intention of achieving the government's price-stability target.In addition, the Bank will continue to support the attainment of the rangeof objectives of macroeconomic policy, particularly with respect to increasing employment, maintaining growth and bolstering financial stability. 27.3.2006 The Bank of Israel raises the interest rate for April 2006 by 25 basis points to 5 percent. The Bank of Israel raises the interest rate for April 2006 by 25 basis points to 5 percent. The interest rate for April 2006 will rise by 25 basis points to 5 percent. The decision to raise the interest rate is intended to help maintain price stability within the limits of the target of between one percent and three percent inflation a year determined by the government. Background conditions. The most recent economic data indicate relatively rapid growth in Israel. The main considerations that led to the decision. Against this background, the Bank of Israel focused on the main factors that could affect the inflation environment in the coming twelve months:. Increases in demand and the gradual contraction of the output gap;. Developments in interest rates abroad and the interest-rate differential between the United States and Israel."
Romania,2006-03-27,"In its meeting of March 27, 2006, the Board of the National Bank of Romania (NBR) has decided the following:. The NBR Board reaffirms that it is ready to use the entire available array of instruments to ensure the achievement of its medium-term disinflation goal and consolidate the European Union convergence process. The analysis of recent developments in macroeconomic and monetary indicators and of their prospects shows the disinflation process is in line with the forecast trajectory, with annual consumer price inflation remaining above the target band (plus/minus one percentage point around the 5 percent target). In February 2006, year-on-year inflation rate dropped to 8.49 percent from 8.89 percent in the previous month, helped by tight monetary conditions. In the financial area, broad money saw robust year-on-year growth amid an accelerated rise in demand deposits, while non-government credit expansion continued, supported by a faster increase in leu-denominated loans. It is worth noting that the monetary policy and prudential measures taken by the NBR last year have triggered a deceleration in the dynamics of foreign-currency denominated loans, which accounted for 52.3 percent of total non-government credit in January 2006 versus about 60 percent in the similar period of 2005. The comprehensive set of measures aimed at tightening monetary conditions which was adopted by the NBR in February 2006 has led to an increase in the effective sterilization rate (to marginally above 8 percent from 6.72 percent in January 2006). Banks' deposit rates for non-bank customers have picked up slightly while lending rates have slipped further against the background of heightened bank competition for market shares. In this context, the NBR Board believes that, at least in the short run, persistent domestic demand pressures as well as potential supply-side shocks (administered price adjustments and changes in excise duties regime) call for a more restrictive monetary policy stance. The adequate control of liquidity via open-market operations will trigger a rise in the effective sterilization rate towards 8.5 percent. Meanwhile, the increase in the minimum reserve requirements on foreign exchange-denominated liabilities of credit institutions to 40 percent from 35 percent (starting with the March 24 - April 23, 2006 maintenance period) will make its effect manifest in the upcoming period. In this context, the monetary policy stance is set to tighten further. In light of the available data, the NBR Board has decided to maintain the monetary policy rate at 8.5 percent per annum and to continue to significantly sterilize excess liquidity via open-market operations. The NBR Board reaffirms its readiness to use the entire available array of instruments to counter inflationary pressures and maintain disinflation on the projected trajectory, counting also on the support of other components of the macroeconomic policy mix. According to the announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for May 11, 2006, when a new quarterly Inflation Report is to be analyzed."
United States,2006-03-28,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4-3/4 percent. The slowing of the growth of real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2005 seems largely to have reflected temporary or special factors. Economic growth has rebounded strongly in the current quarter but appears likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace. As yet, the run-up in the prices of energy and other commodities appears to have had only a modest effect on core inflation, ongoing productivity gains have helped to hold the growth of unit labor costs in check, and inflation expectations remain contained. Still, possible increases in resource utilization, in combination with the elevated prices of energy and other commodities, have the potential to add to inflation pressures.

Poland,2006-03-29,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 29 March 2006 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 28-29 March 2006 The Council decided to leave the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e.: reference rate 4.00 % on an annual basis; lombard rate 5.50 % on an annual basis; deposit rate 2.50% on an annual basis; rediscount rate 4.25% on an annual basis; Since the Council's meeting in February 2006, the forecasts of inflation and economic growth in the euro area for 2006 have been slightly revised upwards. In February 2006 the annual growth rate of consumer prices in the euro area decreased to 2.3% from 2.4% y/y recorded in January, and GDP growth in 2005 Q4 reached 1.7% y/y, falling slightly short of the expectations. In the United States. CPI inflation decreased to 3.6% from 4.0%. From the February meeting of the Council to 27 March 2006, oil prices increased (Brent oil price rose by USD 2.8 per barrel, i.e. by 4.6%). The average Brent oil price in March was by 3.0% higher than in February. March was another consecutive month which saw the rise in the average price of this commodity in 2006 as forecasted by analysts in the Reuters survey (by 1.8% as compared to the previous month's forecasts). Still, uncertainty persists as to the effect of the increase in oil prices on economic growth and inflation. The data on national accounts in 2005 Q4 confirm that since 2005 Q2 the economic growth has accelerated. GDP growth in 2005 Q4 reached 4.2% y/y and hit its highest level since 2004 Q3. 2005 Q4 saw acceleration in the growth rate of gross fixed capital formation (up to 9.8% y/y) and domestic demand (up to 5.0% y/y) coupled with decreasing contribution of net exports to GDP growth (-0.8 percentage point as compared with 2.1 percentage points recorded in 2005 Q3). The upward trend in the annual growth rate of industrial output observed for the last seven months points to a strengthening recovery in industry, in particular in the manufacturing sector. In February 2006 the growth of industrial output exceeded the expectations of the majority of external forecasters and the NBP, and amounted to 10.1% y/y. At the same time. GUS (CSO) revised upwards the data on output growth in January 2006 (from 9.5% y/y to 9.8% y/y). In seasonally adjusted terms, growth in industrial output in February amounted to 9.8% y/y as compared to 7.4% y/y in January 2006. The drop in the construction and assembly output was lower than in the previous month (-3.5% y/y as compared with -7.8% y/y in January and 0.6% y/y against -3.7% y/y, respectively, in seasonally adjusted terms). The drop in the construction and assembly output resulted mainly from unfavourable weather conditions. The growth of retail sales  just like in January  exceeded the expectations and amounted to 10.2% y/y in nominal terms. The growth of retail sales in real terms was broadly in line with the nominal growth rate and hit its highest level since April 2004. Higher growth of retail ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51, sales was coupled with increasing growth rate in household lending: consumer loans (increase of 19.3% y/y in February) and housing loans (increase of 42.6% y/y in February). After the period of corporate lending decline in annual terms that was observed between May 2004 and April 2005, the growth of corporate lending is now positive and accelerating (increase of 4.6% y/y in February as compared with 3.5% y/y in January). The growth of corporate lending might be limited by the fact that enterprise hold significant own funds associated with their good financial results in 2005. The accelerating economic growth increases the demand for labour. Since December 2004 the employment in the corporate sector has been steadily growing. In February the employment in enterprises was 2.5% higher than a year before (as compared with a rise of 2.6% y/y in January). According to BAEL (LFS) in 2005 Q4 there were 2.4% more persons working in the economy than one year before. The growth in the number of persons working outside private farming is soaring (a rise of 3.5% y/y in 2005 Q4 compared with 3.7% y/y in Q3). The rise in the demand for labour is coupled with an increase in economic activity recorded for the past three quarters. In 2005 Q4 the number of the economically active increased by 0.8% y/y. Along with that, unemployment was still declining in annual terms (according to BAEL, the unemployment rate in Q4 was 16.7% against 18.0% a year before, whereas according to the labour office data it stood at 18.0% in February as compared with 19.4% a year before). The economic recovery is accompanied by acceleration of wages. In February the wage growth in the enterprise sector amounted to 4.8% y/y (against 3.6% y/y in January). The data for 2005 Q4 revealing the accelerating wage growth in the economy and a rise in the number of working persons and GDP confirm that unit labour cost growth in the economy has increased. In industry the joint increase in productivity in January and February 2006 amounted to 8.6% y/y, while the growth of average wage equalled 4.0% y/y. It should be emphasised that a necessary condition for a sustained acceleration of economic growth which would not pose a threat to the achievement of the inflation target is that  in the longer run  the growth in wages does not outpace the growth in labour productivity. The annual consumer price growth in February was at 0.7%. The impact of medium-term macroeconomic factors on inflation overlapped with the influence of short-term developments. In March the GUS re-estimated the CPI in January in line with a new weight structure used in its calculation. As a result, the growth of consumer prices in January was downward adjusted by 0.1 percentage point (to 0.6% y/y). The low increase in inflation in February 2006 against January resulted from an increased growth of food and alcoholic beverages' prices, which was observed despite a still large food supply. At the same time, the rise in inflation was curbed by a larger-than- expected drop in fuel prices, in connection to the fact that distribution margins were held at a low level. Additionally, the drop in inflation was supported by decreasing prices of clothes and footwear. Core inflation indicators remained low (in February they ranged between -0.3% y/y and 0.8% y/y). The low level of all core inflation indices confirms continuation of low inflationary pressure. In March, inflation expectations of households remained low (0.6%, i.e. exactly the same as in the previous month). February 2006 saw an increase in annual growth of producer prices in industry up to 0.7% y/y as compared to 0.3% y/y in January (-0.1% m/m against 0.4% in January). This rise occurred even though the effective exchange rate of the zloty was stronger than a year before. As a result of both external and internal factors, since the last meeting of the Council the zloty has depreciated by 5.0% against the euro and 3.9% against the US dollar. Short-term factors may with large probability be conducive to inflation remaining below the inflation target in 2006 Q2 and possibly also in Q3. In turn, in the projection horizon (i.e. in 2007 and 2008) the growth in domestic demand and unit labour costs will be gradually pushing inflation back to the target (2.5%), as it was presented in the January projection. The data significant for the -2 - projection (BAEL data for 2005 Q4) and the interest rate cuts in January and February 2006 support this assessment. The Council maintains its belief that implementing an economic strategy focused on creating conditions which ensure introduction of the euro at the earliest possible date would be most favourable for Poland and would contribute to a higher long-term economic growth. The next meeting of the Council will be held on 19 April 2006 and will focus on the draft Inflation Report. The Report will be finally approved at the Council's meeting held on 25-26 April 2006."
Philippines,2006-04-05,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board maintained the BSP's key policy interest rates at 7.5 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.75 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. The Monetary Board noted that prevailing conditions for prices continue to provide room for the BSP to keep policy rates steady in the near term. In particular, the recent easing in oil prices and continued stability of the peso should help keep inflation pressures in check in the near term. Demand and credit indicators continue to suggest softness, while liquidity growth has stabilized to single-digit levels. Inflation expectations on the whole appear to remain stable. The outlook for inflation also continues to support keeping policy rates steady. The RVAT rate increase in February appears to have caused mainly one-time increases in prices, and sustained pressures do not appear to be a likely prospect. The March inflation rate was within the BSP's forecast range for the month, and is thus consistent with the projected path for inflation. The BSP's projected path for inflation suggests a deceleration in the second half of 2006 as cost-side pressures subside, and a reversion to the inflation target of 4-5 percent by 2007. Nevertheless, monetary authorities remain alert to the potential sources of additional inflation pressures. Oil market futures data, for example, continue to suggest an outlook of volatile oil prices over the policy horizon, given that expectations of tight global supply remain. Pending adjustments in domestic power transmission charges could also lead to increases in retail energy costs. The continued strength of the peso also increases the potential risk of a disorderly adjustment in the event of a reversal in market sentiment, and authorities thus remain alert to signs of renewed exchange market pressure. The Monetary Board remains strongly committed to achieving the inflation target for 2007 and addressing the risks to future inflation. The Monetary Board will continue to closely monitor and assess the conditions for prices, aggregate demand, domestic liquidity and other factors in order to determine the appropriate stance of monetary policy."
Euroarea,2006-04-06,"Ladies and gentlemen, let me welcome you to our press conference and report on the outcome of today's meeting of the ECB's Governing Council. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we have decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged, following the increase of 25 basis points on 2 March 2006. The information which has become available since then confirms our assessment that a further adjustment of our accommodative monetary policy stance was warranted to address upside risks to price stability. It remains essential to ensure that medium to long-term inflation expectations in the euro area are kept solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. Such anchoring of inflation expectations is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. With interest rates across the whole maturity spectrum still at very low levels in both nominal and real terms, and monetary and credit growth remaining strong and liquidity ample, our monetary policy remains accommodative. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. Turning first to the economic analysis, recent information has confirmed our assessment of an improved outlook for economic growth in the euro area, following the more subdued developments in late 2005. On the basis of the latest data, survey releases and various indicator-based estimates, it appears that growth is strengthening and broadening in the first half of 2006. Indeed, the conditions remain in place for solid growth over the coming quarters. Activity in the world economy remains strong, providing support for euro area exports. Investment activity is expected to remain solid, benefiting from an extended period of very favourable financing conditions, balance sheet restructuring, and accumulated and ongoing gains in earnings and business efficiency. Consumption growth should also strengthen over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, as the labour market situation continues to gradually improve. This outlook for economic activity is also confirmed by available forecasts from international organisations and private sector institutions. The risks to economic growth appear to be broadly balanced over the shorter term. Further ahead, downside risks still relate to potential increases in oil prices and concerns about global imbalances. Turning to price developments, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 2.2% in March 2006, compared with 2.3% in February and 2.4% in January. In the short run, inflation rates are likely to remain above 2%, with the precise levels depending largely on developments in the more volatile components of the index. Beyond the short term, changes in administered prices and indirect taxes are expected to significantly affect inflation in 2006 and 2007, and an upward impact may also be expected from the indirect effects of past oil price increases. At the same time, wage dynamics in the euro area have remained moderate over recent quarters and growth in wages is expected to remain contained, partly reflecting strong global competitive pressures, particularly in the manufacturing sector. Over the recent past, moderate wage trends have helped to dampen domestic inflationary pressures; looking ahead, it is crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities in this regard, also in the context of a more favourable economic environment. Risks to the outlook for price developments remain on the upside and include further increases in oil prices, a possibly stronger pass-through of oil price rises into consumer prices than currently anticipated, additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, and  more fundamentally  stronger wage and price developments than expected due to second-round effects of past oil price increases. Turning to the monetary analysis, the latest developments confirm that the stimulative impact of the low level of interest rates remains the dominant factor behind the high trend rate of monetary expansion. Moreover, the annual growth rate of credit to the private sector has continued to increase over recent months, with borrowing by households  especially loans for house purchase  and non-financial corporations rising rapidly. Overall, strong monetary and credit growth in an environment of ample liquidity in the euro area continues to point to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. To sum up, annual inflation rates are projected to remain elevated in 2006 and 2007, and the economic analysis indicates that the risks to price stability remain on the upside. Given the strength of monetary growth and the ample liquidity situation in a context of improving economic activity, cross-checking the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability over the medium to long term prevail. It is essential that medium-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. Accordingly, the Governing Council will continue to monitor very closely all developments to ensure that risks to price stability do not materialise, thereby making an ongoing contribution to sustainable economic growth and job creation. As regards fiscal policies, while the budgetary results reported for 2005 are mostly better than anticipated a few months ago, the budget balances planned for 2006 imply no significant progress in fiscal consolidation for the euro area as a whole. Given the economic outlook, a faster pace of deficit reduction is necessary. Delaying fiscal consolidation in times of improving economic activity implies risks for the medium term, as has been observed in the past. Speeding up deficit reduction on the basis of credible and fully specified measures as part of a comprehensive reform programme would help to enhance confidence in the medium-term prospects of the euro area and prevent a repeat of past experiences, when complacency in good times contributed to persistent budgetary disequilibria. As regards structural reforms, the Governing Council welcomes the call by the European Council, which met in Brussels on 23-24 March 2006, to maintain the momentum of the re-launched Lisbon strategy for growth and employment. As emphasised by the European Council, the focus should now be on ensuring the effective, timely and comprehensive implementation of the measures agreed in the national reform programmes presented by Member States and, if necessary, on strengthening them. These measures are designed to, among other things, enhance the sustainability and quality of public finances, promote flexible labour and product markets, support a favourable business environment, and ensure a fully operational EU internal market, including the markets for energy and services. Applying comprehensive structural reforms is of particular importance for the euro area countries, in order to increase wage and price flexibility and the resilience to shocks, facilitate structural adjustment, raise potential output growth and job creation, and reduce price pressures, thereby facilitating the task of the single monetary policy."
Egypt,2006-04-06,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release April 6, 2006 The Central Bank of Egypt decided to reduce its overnight deposit rate by 25 basis points to 8 percent per annu. In its meeting held on April 6, 2006, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to reduce the overnight deposit rate to 8 percent from 825 percent and the overnight lending rate to 10 percent from 1025 percen. This decision was based on an assessment of recent economic developments since the last MPC meeting, in particular inflation rates which are holding up at moderate level. In addition, the recent economic developments reveal that the pick up in economic growth has accelerated through the first half of 2005/0. However this acceleration has not been inflationary given the existence of unutilized capacity in several economic sector. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments, especially the factors underlying inflation, and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates in either direction, if necessary, to ensure price stability over the medium-ter.

South Korea,2006-04-07,"In the real economy, exports continue to exhibit steady growth, the recovery of private consumption has been maintained, and facilities investment is still recovering gradually. On the other hand, an improvement of construction investment has not yet been sufficient. Meanwhile, the current account has shifted into deficit reflecting a sharp increase in imports. Both consumer price inflation and core inflation maintain overall stability. Nevertheless, there are latent inflationary pressures due to the economic recovery and persistently high oil prices. The recent rebound in real estate prices has continued. In the financial markets, overall liquidity conditions are favorable and financial institutions‘ loans continue to increase steadily led by those to small and medium enterprises. Taking the above economic and financial conditions into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (4.00%) for the intermeeting period."
Thailand,2006-04-10,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 10 April 2006 Mr. Bandid Nijathaworn. Deputy Governor. Monetary Stability. Bank of Thailand, announces that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance. The main issues discussed are as follows. Having assessed the economic data in the first 2 months of 2006, the MPC viewed that the Thai economy grew satisfactorily, in particular the export sector that expanded well due to favourable world economic conditions and became the driving force behind the overall growth. Meanwhile domestic demand stemming from both consumption and investment continued to moderate from the previous quarter, but still on an expanded path. Overall economic stability had improved. Although headline inflation edged up slightly in March 2006 but on the quarterly average basis was lower than the previous quarter. Core inflation remained quite stable for the last 3-4 months and is expected to decline in the second half of this year. Meanwhile external stability had improved, with the current account continued to be in surplus while the baht appreciated in line with the regional currencies. The MPC deemed that although headline inflation had declined from the previous quarter but real deposit rates still remained negative. Furthermore the overall economy expanded satisfactorily. The MPC therefore decided to raise the 14-day repurchase rate by 25 basis points from 450 to 475 per cent per annum, effective immediately."
Chile,2006-04-13,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 13 April 2006 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points, to 5% (annual). The external scenario relevant for the Chilean economy continues to be very favorable, with the copper price considerably above earlier projections. In the first quarter of this year, domestic demand has shown some moderation in its high growth rate, in line with the projection scenario considered in the last Monetary Policy Report. In the same period, output showed signs of less than expected growth, influenced by circumstantially poor performance from some sectors. Job creation has resumed its growing annual expansion rhythm and, in particular, salaried employment continues to grow strongly. At the same time, internal financial conditions continue to be expansionary. Inflation has continued along a similar path to that expected in the last Monetary Policy Report. Annual inflation measures CPI and CPIX (that exclude fuels and perishables) are temporarily upper half of the target range. On the other hand, both core inflation CPIX1 (that also excludes some regulated utility rates), and other inflation trend indicators, and the different measures of inflation expectations, continue to be well anchored around the center of the target range. The Board considers that, in the most likely scenario, gradual adjustments to the interest rate continue to be necessary to maintain projected inflation around 3% per annum in the normal policy horizon. The timing of these adjustments will depend on the implications of news in economic activity, exchange rate and prices, over the expected path of inflation. * The Spanish original prevails."
South Africa,2006-04-13,"Strong consumer demand and rising international oil prices continue to pose a threat to the inflation outlook. Household consumption spending has continued to grow at high levels, and there are few signs of moderation. Consumer confidence is at an all-time high, and this has been reflected in higher household debt, strong credit extension and a widening of the current account deficit of the balance of payments. These developments have occurred against a backdrop of resurgent international oil and other commodity prices, and a strongly growing world economy. Robust global growth, persistent international imbalances and the perceived need for caution going forward has resulted in further monetary policy tightening by many of the world's major central banks, and the general expectation is that the international interest rate cycle has not yet reached its peak. World inflation, however, remains under control at low levels. Inflation as measured by the consumer price index for metropolitan and other urban areas excluding the interest cost on mortgage bonds (CPIX) increased by 4,5 per cent in February of this year, having measured 4,0 per cent and 4,3 per cent in the previous two months respectively. Petrol price increases are the main cause of this upward trend in inflation. If petrol prices were excluded. CPIX inflation would have averaged 3,4 per cent in December 2005 and 3,3 per cent in both of the subsequent two months. Transport running costs increased at year-on-year rates of 21,5 per cent and 24,6 per cent in January and February 2006 respectively. Services price inflation has continued to decline steadily, to the extent that in January and February this year it was lower than goods price inflation. In February, services price inflation measured 4,0 per cent compared to goods price inflation of 4,8 per cent. Administered price inflation excluding petrol is now significantly lower than overall CPIX inflation, and measured 3,6 per cent and 3,5 per cent in January and February respectively. Some categories of goods continued to contribute significantly to the favourable inflation outcome. Of note were the price declines in the categories of clothing and footwear, and furniture and equipment. By contrast, food price inflation edged up further at rates of 4,3 per cent and 4,5 per cent in January and February respectively. This was mainly as a result of significant year-on-year increases in the prices of meat, fish and fruit. Prices of grain products however rose at very low rates, despite the sizeable increase in maize prices during the latter part of 2005. Production price inflation remained unchanged at 5,5 per cent in February compared to January. Imported goods inflation measured 6,4 per cent and 6,9 per cent in these two months, while prices of domestically produced goods increased by 5,2 per cent and 5,1 per cent respectively. The higher imported price inflation is primarily due to the impact of increased energy prices. If energy costs were excluded, production price inflation would have measured 3,5 per cent in both January and February. The inflation outlook remains benign, although there are significant risks. The most recent central forecast of the Bank is similar to that seen at the February 2006 meeting of the MPC. According to the forecast, inflation is expected to peak at a level just below 5 per cent in the first quarter of 2007, and then decline to a level of around 4,6 per cent, and remain there till the end of the forecast period in 2008. A number of factors have contributed to this positive inflation outlook. Wage settlements thus far have continued to be generally well contained and in line with the inflation target range. In the fourth quarter of 2005, nominal unit labour cost in the formal non-agricultural sector of the economy increased over 4 quarters at a rate of 2,5 per cent, compared to a revised figure of 4,5 per cent in the previous quarter. For the year as a whole, unit labour cost increased by 3,3 per cent, compared to 6,5 per cent in 2004. The latest Andrew Levy Employment Publications report shows that wage settlements averaged 6,3 per cent in the first quarter of 2006. These wage developments reflect to some extent entrenched expectations that inflation will remain within the inflation target range. Further evidence of this is contained in the latest inflation survey conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research (BER) at the University of Stellenbosch. According to this survey, all respondents expected inflation to decline further in the first quarter of 2006. CPIX inflation expectations for 2006 declined from an average of 5,2 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year to an average of 4,4 per cent in the first quarter of 2006. When expectations regarding 2006 were recorded in the first quarter of 2004, the expected average inflation rate was 6,4 per cent. According to the survey. CPIX inflation is expected to remain below 5 per cent over the forecast period to the end of 2008. Inflation expectations as indicated in the long-term break-even inflation rates, measured as the yield differential between conventional bonds and inflation-linked bonds, also continue to reflect expectations that inflation will remain within the inflation target range. The exchange rate of the rand fluctuated somewhat in the period since the last MPC meeting. In line with emerging-market and commodity currencies, the rand depreciated against the US dollar, reaching a level of almost R6,40 in the third week of March. Thereafter it appreciated, and in early April it briefly fell below the R6,00 to the US dollar level, before settling at its current level of around R6,12. This is similar to the level prevailing at the last MPC meeting. On a trade-weighted basis, the rand has not changed much since the last meeting, but has appreciated by around 2 per cent since the beginning of the year. The reasons for these movements include changes in the exchange rate of the US dollar against the euro; changes in investor sentiment towards emerging markets; and continued inflows to the domestic foreign exchange market. In addition, strong commodity price movements, in particular gold and platinum prices, have generally supported the exchange rate of the rand. Fiscal policy is expected to remain supportive of monetary policy, with a moderate deficit of 1,5 per cent of GDP forecast for the 2006/07 fiscal year. Higher than expected tax revenue collection in the past financial year resulted in a revised estimated deficit of 0,5 per cent of GDP, compared to an initial estimate of 3,1 per cent. South Africa's GDP growth, although still robust, has shown some signs of moderation in the past few months to levels more in line with potential output. Growth in 2005 measured 4,9 per cent, the highest growth rate since the early 1980s. However by the fourth quarter of last year, the quarterly annualised growth rate had declined to 3,3 per cent, mainly due to a contraction in the mining sector and a slowdown in the manufacturing sector. Indications are that both manufacturing and mining real growth remain under pressure in the first quarter of 2006. Overall business confidence nevertheless remains high: for example in the latest RMB/BER Business Confidence Index which shows that the index is marginally below the record high measured in late 2004. Despite the positive elements in the inflation outlook, there are a number of significant risks, all of which are seen to be on the upside. Consumer demand continues to grow at a brisk pace and shows few signs of abating. In 2005 household consumption expenditure grew by 6,9 per cent. Similar levels of growth have been recorded since the middle of 2003 when nominal interest rates began to decline. The latest FNB/BER consumer confidence index for the first quarter of 2006 surpassed its previous high in the previous quarter. Growth in motor vehicles sales has moderated slightly, but the levels are still high. Consumer demand is also underpinned by wealth effects arising from strong asset price growth. Prices on the JSE Securities Exchange continued to reach new highs, and according to the ABSA house price index, house prices also continued to increase, although at a slower year-on-year rate of 13,7 per cent in March. Growth in credit extension to the private sector reflects the increase in consumer expenditure. Growth over twelve months in total loans and advances accelerated from 21,3 per cent in December 2005 to 22,2 per cent in February 2006. Asset backed credit growth accelerated from 25,5 per cent to 27 per cent over the same period. These developments have, amongst others, contributed to a further decline in gross national savings to 13 per cent of GDP, and an increase in household indebtedness: the ratio of household debt to disposable income had risen to just below 66 per cent in the final quarter of 2005. The cost of servicing this debt, while still low, nevertheless increased from 6¾ per cent of disposable income in the third quarter of 2005 to 7 per cent in the fourth quarter. Developments on the current account of the balance of payments are becoming an increasing source of concern to the MPC. The current account deficit as a percentage of GDP averaged 4,2 per cent in 2005, compared to 3,4 per cent in 2004. In the fourth quarter, the deficit had risen to 4,5 per cent of GDP, despite a contraction in the trade deficit during this period. This was due to increased interest and dividend payments, an inevitable consequence of increased capital inflows. As noted in previous statements, current account deficits are a reflection of higher domestic expenditure and are not in themselves inflationary. There is however a possible risk to the exchange rate if the deficits are perceived to be unsustainable, particularly if the deficits are reflecting higher consumption expenditure. To date the deficits have been more than financed by capital inflows which in turn are being attracted in part by the improved growth prospects in the economy. These inflows enabled the Bank to further increase its holdings of foreign exchange reserves. By the end of March, official gross foreign exchange reserves had increased to US$23 billion, while the international liquidity position had increased to US$19,5 billion. International factors also pose a risk to the inflation and interest rate outlook. In February the price of Brent crude fell to around US$55 per barrel. This respite was short-lived, and as a result of renewed geopolitical tensions and tight demand and supply conditions, international oil prices have risen significantly. Brent crude is currently trading at levels of almost US$70 per barrel. The price of 93 octane petrol increased by R0,22 per litre in April, which more than offset the R0,11 per litre decline in March. Currently the under-recovery on the petrol price is averaging around R0,30 per litre. The MPC perceives the risks to inflation to be on the upside. In particular, the MPC is mindful of the threats posed by strong credit extension, consumer demand, the widening current account deficit and rising international oil prices. Nevertheless, given the benign inflation outlook at present, and having considered all the relevant factors, the Committee has decided to keep the repo rate unchanged at 7 per cent per annum."
Peru,2006-04-15,"Press Release MONETARY PROGRAM FOR APRIL 2006 CENTRAL BANK RAISES REFERENCE RATE FROM 4.00% TO 4.25% The Board of the BCRP acknowledge the following information: The Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) increased 0.46 percent, evolution explained by rises in school tuition fees and in the prices of some food products, such as sugar and potato. As a result, the CPI inflation rate over the last twelve months was 2.5 percent, in the middle of the target range (1.5 percent  3.5 percent). On the other hand, the underlying inflation over the last 12 months was 1.4 percent. Inflation is expected to converge to its target level (2.5 percent) throughout 2006. Economic activity grew 4.4 percent in January 2006, with a 7.0 percent increase in the domestic demand. As in previous months, the indicators on consumer trust are recorded at the highest levels. The evolution of the trade balance and terms of trade continues to be positive. The trade balance showed an accumulated surplus for the last 12 months of US$ 5,210 million by February, while the terms of trade in the first bimester increased in 13.7 percent with respect to the same period last year due to a 24.1 percent increase in export prices. The average exchange rate increased 1.6 percent in March, rising from 3.29 per dollar in February to 3.34 per dollar, as a result of which the real exchange rate increased 1.5 percent in March (1.6 percent of real depreciation in the last twelve months). The Central Bank did not intervene in the exchange market in March. During this month, the bank's balance of net forward sales increased by US$ 470 million, the public purchases of dollars in the spot market were US$ 516 million, and the bank's exchange position increased in US$ 95 million. The average interest rate of the interbank market was 4.12 percent in March (3.82 percent higher than last month's), while the corporate prime rate for loans in soles went from 5.4 percent to 6.1 percent in the same period. In this month, the BCRP continued carrying out significative repo auctions in order to stabilize the interbank interest rate around the reference interest rate (4.0 percent in March). Exceptional upward pressures on the interbank rate were recorded in the last days of March and first days of April, coinciding with the beginning of the period for income tax payments. The country risk indicator rose from 143 pbs at the end of February to 187 pbs at the end of March. In turn, the 15-year maturity sovereign bond yield increased from 7.5 to 8.2 percent. The Board of the Central Bank approved to raise the reference interest rate for the interbank market from 4.00 percent to 4.25 percent. This decision has been taken considering that : The dynamism of economic activity for 2006 (5.0 percent) is consistent with the continuous accomplishment of the inflation target (from 1.5 to 3.5 percent). The raise in the interest rate will contribute to reduce the exchange rate volatility. If necessary, the Bank will continue to sell exchange currency at spot market and auctions of Adjustable Certificate Deposits (CDRBCRP) to avoid undesirable effects over prices and economic activity in general. This decision does not imply a sequence of raises in the reference interest rate. The Board approved the following interest rates for the Central Bank operations: For direct repos and monetary regulation credits, the rate rises to 5.0 percent. For overnight deposits, the rate rises to 3.50 percent. The interest rates for the following operations in dollars between the Central Bank and the Financial system are established as follows: Monetary regulation credits: 1-month LIBOR plus one percent. Overnight deposits: overnight LIBOR minus 3/8 of a percentage point. Swap: the commission is raised to a level that implies a minimum annual effective cost of 5.0 percent. Reserve requirements in foreign deposits subject to payment remain at 2.25 percent. In order to improve liquidity provision for financial entities, the Board approved implementing the following measures: Include CDRBCRP among the securities for temporary repos, provided that financial entities have no available CDBCRP or BTP, and according to liquidity conditions in the market. Likewise. CDRBCRP are included in the list of guarantees for Monetary Regulation Credits. Include the private sector (non-financial) securities in local currency listed as assets that may be used for monetary regulation credits among the securities for direct repos. The Board will approve the following Monetary Program (May 2006) on the session to be held on May 4, 2006."
Hungary,2006-04-24,"At its meeting on 24 April 2006, the Monetary Council considered the latest economic and monetary developments and left the central bank base rate unchanged at 6.00%. In the Council's evaluation, there were contrasting developments in the key factors affecting the outlook for inflation in the first quarter of 2006 relative to earlier months. The fall in inflation expectations and the sharp decline in market services price inflation have recently influenced inflation prospects favourably. However, the weaker-than-earlier exchange rate and a rise in imported inflation may have offsetting effects. The forint's weakness in early March  if the exchange rate remains at its lower level over a sustained period  may put upward pressure on inflation on the horizon relevant for monetary policy. Risks of higher inflation have recently been exacerbated by the latest surge in the world market price of oil. On the other hand, the March inflation figures appear to reinforce the favourable effect on the longer-term outlook of the decline in market services price inflation which has been underway since early 2006. With regard to the durability of this trend, the Monetary Council attaches particular importance to labour market participants also adjusting to the low inflation outlook. Overall, in the Monetary Council's judgement the balance of risks to inflation has recently moved to the upside relative to earlier periods; however, changing the interest rate level is currently not justified, due to offsetting macroeconomic effects. The Monetary Council will continue to monitor closely developments affecting inflation, and stand ready to take actions as necessary to maintain price stability. In the aftermath of the General Election, the Monetary Council once again makes a point of emphasising that the high level of budget deficit continues to be the ultimate source of risks to Hungarian economic balance. For this reason, the new government coming to office will have to show commitment to a budgetary adjustment and, consequently, to take specific actions as soon as possible. The new government will only be able to make the largest contributions to long-term, stable economic growth, if it ensures a sustainable fiscal position by implementing a credible convergence programme."
Israel,2006-04-24,"24.4.2006 The Bank of Israel raises the interest rate for May 2006 by 25 basis points to 5.25 percent The interest rate for May 2006 will rise by 25 basis points to 5.25 percent. The decision to raise the interest rate is intended to help maintain price stability within the limits of the target of between 1 percent and 3 percent inflation a year as determined by the government. Background conditions Economic data indicate continued rapid growth, seen in all sectors of the economy. This growth is expected to continue against the background of continued relatively rapid growth in the global economy and the expectation that the government's macroeconomic strategy will continue. The CPI in the past 12 months increased by 3.6 percent, slightly above the upper limit of the inflation target. The CPI has increased 0.6 percent since the beginning of the year, a slightly faster pace than most of the forecasts and than the seasonal path consistent with the inflation target. Inflation expectations for the next twelve months, derived from the capital market and economists' forecasts, are that inflation will be close to the midpoint of the target range, under the assumption that the interest rate willcontinue to rise, as is reflected in the bond market. In the financial markets, the NIS has appreciated against the dollar by 2.6 percent since the beginning of April. The strengthening of the NIS was due mainly to the trend of a weakening dollar globally. In the bonds market, long-term nominal yields rose by 10 basis points, a lower pace than the rise in equivalent yields in the US, such that the yield spread contracted. In addition, share prices went up in April and the Tel Aviv 100 Index rose by 4.9 percent. Globally, the gradual process of rising interest rates continued in the major economies, which is expected to continue in the near future. The trend of rising world input prices, and particularly oil prices, continued withthe price of oil increasing in April by 9.6 percent. Until the budget for 2006 is approved, government expenditure will continue to be governed by the law on the absence of an approved budget, in which monthly expenditure is limited to one-twelfth of the previous year's budget. On the revenues side, the continued rapid rise in real economic activity lead to a growth in tax revenues. The main considerations behind the decision The decision to raise the May interest rate was based on the existence of pressures acting to raise prices, which can be seen already in the relatively rapid rise in prices in the past 12 months and in the first quarter inparticular. The main factors that could affect the inflation environment in the future are: Rate of growth in the economy and the expansion in demand. The expansion in demand in the economy and the process of exhausting surplus production capacity create upward pressure on prices and nominal wages in the future. Rising input prices--particularly of oil--globally. Aslong as this trend continues, the risk that this will translate into rising prices in the economy grows. It is noted that the strengthening of the NIS against the dollar in recent weeks is likely to provide a moderating force on inflationary pressures. The continued strengthening of the NIS against the dollar is influenced byboth domestic and global factors. In this context, the Bank notes that there is an expectation that interest rates will continue to rise globally. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor economic developments closely--including developments in budget policy--with the intention of achieving the government's price-stability target.Subject to this, the Bank will continue to support the attainment of a range of objectives of macroeconomic policy, particularly with respect to increasing employment and growth. In addition, the Bank will continue to support financial stability. 24.4.2006 The Bank of Israel raises the interest rate for May 2006 by 25 basis points to 5.25 percent. The Bank of Israel raises the interest rate for May 2006 by 25 basis points to 5.25 percent. The interest rate for May 2006 will rise by 25 basis points to 5.25 percent. Background conditions.

Malaysia,2006-04-26,"Bank Negara Malaysia today announced that the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) is raised by 25 basis points to 3.50 percent. The ceiling and floor rates of the corridor for the OPR are correspondingly increased to 3.75 percent and 3.25 percent respectively. With strong growth in world trade projected in 2006. Malaysia will benefit directly through higher exports, as well as better terms of trade due to the higher prices for Malaysia's commodity exports. Domestic spending is expected to be sustained. Consumer spending is expected to be well supported by steady employment and income growth, favourable credit conditions, and the positive effect of the favourable external performance. The current higher prices reflect rising costs and there continues to be limited evidence of the second-round effects. Based on present and future expectations, the policy rate will therefore only need to respond to new developments and information that become available going forward. Inflation is expected to be higher in the first half of 2006, and moderate during the second half of the year. This current rise in inflation has been built into the earlier forecast of average inflation for 2006. At this new level, the OPR continues to be below the neutral level. Going forward, monetary policy will balance the risks to price stability and sustainable economic growth. The MPC also decided that the decisions of future MPC meetings will be informed to the public through a press release on the same day. Bank Negara Malaysia 26 April 2006."
Poland,2006-04-26,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 26 April 2006 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 25-26 April 2006 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e.: reference rate 4.00% on an annual basis; lombard rate 5.50% on an annual basis; deposit rate 2.50% on an annual basis; rediscount rate 4.25% on an annual basis. Since the Council's meeting in March 2006, the forecasts of economic growth in the euro area and the United States for 2006 have been slightly revised upwards. Besides, in the United States the 2006 inflation forecasts have been slightly raised while in the euro area the 2006 inflation forecasts have been slightly lowered. In March 2006 the annual growth of consumer prices in the euro area decreased to 2.2% from 2.3% recorded in February, and in the United States to 3.4% from 3.6% respectively. Since the March meeting of the Council, oil prices climbed, hitting the highest level in history (Brent oil price rose by USD 9.9 per barrel, i.e. by 15.3%). March was another consecutive month which saw the rise in the average price of this commodity as forecasted for 2006 by analysts in the Reuters survey (by 5.2% as compared to the previous month's forecasts). Still, uncertainty persists as to the effect of the increase in oil prices on economic growth and inflation. The upward trend in the annual growth rate of industrial output observed for the last eight months points to a strengthening recovery in industry, in particular in manufacturing. In March 2006 the growth of industrial output largely exceeded the expectations of the majority of external forecasters and the NBP, and amounted to 16.4% y/y i.e. the highest level since April 2004. In seasonally adjusted terms, growth in industrial output in March amounted to 13.6% y/y as compared to 9.8% y/y in February 2006. After falling for two months mainly as a result of unfavourable weather conditions. March saw a strong rise in the construction and assembly output (15.5% y/y as compared with -3.5% y/y in February, and 8.3% y/y as compared with 0.6% y/y in seasonally adjusted terms). The rise in retail sales was larger than expected and amounted to 10.1% y/y in nominal terms. Lending to households has continued on an upward trend: consumer loans registered an increase of 18.9% y/y in March (compared with 19.3% y/y in February), while the growth rate of housing loans stepped up to 45.9% y/y (compared with 42.6% y/y in February). The growth of corporate lending remains moderate (an increase of 3.8% y/y in March against 4.7% y/y in February). The growth in lending to enterprises may be limited by the fact that enterprises hold considerable own funds in connection with their good financial results in 2005. The accelerating economic growth increases the demand for labour. Since December 2004 the growth of employment in the corporate sector has been accelerating. In March employment in enterprises was 2.7% higher than a year before (as compared with a rise of 2.5% y/y in February). ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51. March saw a continued fall in unemployment in annual terms (down to 17.8% from 19.2% recorded a year before). The economic recovery is accompanied by acceleration of wage growth. In March the wage growth in the corporate sector stepped up to 5,4% y/y (against 4.8% y/y in February). A necessary condition of sustainable acceleration of economic growth not threatening the achievement of the inflation target is to ensure that in the long run wages do not grow faster than labour productivity. The annual consumer price growth in March fell to 0.4%. The drop in the inflation rate in March 2006 in relation to February was driven by a fall in food and non-alcoholic beverage prices, a slight drop in fuel prices and the fading out of the statistical base effect occurring in the case of the internet services prices. In March 2005 the prices of internet services increased considerably following the introduction of the VAT on those services. Core inflation indicators remained low (in March they ranged between -0.6% y/y and 0.7% y/y). The low level of all core inflation indices confirms continuation of low inflationary pressure. In April, inflation expectations of households remained low (0.6%, i.e. exactly the same as in the previous month). March 2006 saw an increase in annual growth of producer prices in industry up to 0.9% y/y as compared to 0.7% y/y in February (0.7% m/m in March against -0.1% in February). Such a month-on-month rise of producer prices was last observed in April 2005. The increase in the annual growth of PPI occurred even though the effective exchange rate of the zloty was stronger than a year before. In line with the NBP inflation projection presented in the April Inflation Report, the annual GDP growth will be with 50% probability within the range of 3.9-5.0% in 2006 (as compared with 3.8-5.1% in the January projection); 3.4-5.8% in 2007 (as compared with 3.4-5.2%) and 3.5-6.2% in 2008 (as compared with 3.6-5.5%). The April inflation projection indicates that the growth rate of consumer prices is likely to be slightly lower in 2006, similar in 2007, but in 2008 slightly higher than that expected in the January Report. Under constant interest rates, with 50% probability inflation will be within the range of 0.5-2.0% in 2006 Q4 (as compared with 0.5-2.3% in the January projection), 1.3-3.4% in 2007 Q4 (as compared with 1.1-3.6%) and 1.2-3.9% in 2008 Q4 (as compared with 0.8-3.9%). It should be emphasised that the inflation projection presented in the Report does not account for all sources of uncertainty. This primarily applies to the scale of the future impact of globalisation on inflation, the growth of workforce, the direction of economic policy in the coming years and the exchange rate developments. Besides, the projection was prepared on the basis of data available until 24 March 2006 and thus does not account for crude oil and fuel prices, which are considerably higher than those assumed in the projection, higher estimates of GDP and wages in the economy in 2006 Q1 and slightly lower than forecasted CPI in 2006 Q1. However, “net” inflation in 2006 Q1 was consistent with the April projection. The Council maintains its assessment that with large probability inflation will in 2006 Q2 and maybe Q3 remain below the inflation target mainly due to short-term factors. If the developments in the economy were consistent with the April NBP inflation projection, then the current level of the reference rate of the central bank would support a gradual return of inflation to the target over the projection horizon and would also be conducive to keeping economic growth at a pace, which is consistent with the potential output growth, determined by the structural features of the Polish economy. The fact that inflation and core inflation has stayed below the previous forecasts for a relatively long period may be an indication that the impact of the factors which may slow down the returning of inflation to the target in relation to that accounted for in the projection is stronger than previously assumed. Factors which could potentially accelerate the return of inflation back to the target include a higher wage growth than assumed in the projection, provided it would not be -2 - accompanied by sufficiently fast increase of productivity, further oil price hikes or a deterioration of the public finance situation in relation to that envisaged in the Convergence Programme. The Council maintains its belief that the most favourable scenario for Poland would be to implement an economic strategy focused on creating conditions which would ensure the introduction of the euro at the earliest possible date, which would be conducive to a higher long- term economic growth. The Council also approved the Financial Report of the National Bank of Poland prepared as of 31 December 2005. Balance of Payments of the Republic of Poland for 2005 Q4 and the April Inflation Report. The next meeting of the Council will be held on 18 May 2006 and will focus on the draft Report on the implementation of monetary policy guidelines in 2005. The Report will be finally approved at the Council's meeting held on 30-31 May 2006."

Lending interest rate is decreased to 19.25 percent from 19.50 percent. c) The interest rates applicable to overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealer banks via repo transactions within the framework of open market transactions are reduced to 15.25 percent from 15.50 percent. The Monetary Policy Committee has concluded that recent developments do not significantly change the medium-term outlook elaborated in the Inflation Report published in January. In the recent period, economic growth displayed a stable trend, investments and increases in productivity continued while secondary effects of the prices of oil and other commodities remained limited. When items such as energy, unprocessed food and alcoholic beverages-tobacco that are beyond the control of monetary policy are excluded, the general trend of inflation is observed to be downwards. Annual inflation is expected to display a downward trend from the second quarter of the year onwards. However, the cautious approach in monetary policy should be maintained in view of the continuation of price increases in the services sector, the weakening contribution of demand conditions to inflation and the persisting high and volatile oil prices. Moreover, the international liquidity conditions are being closely monitored. In the light of currently available information, policy rates are less likely to increase, rather than decrease or remain stable in the medium-term. It should be noted that new data will be monitored carefully in the near-term. This policy perspective will ensure that inflation is in line with the target path around mid-2007. Meanwhile, it should be emphasized that any new data and information associated with the inflation outlook will potentially lead the Monetary Policy Committee to revise its future stance.

Philippines,2006-05-03,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the BSP's key policy interest rates at 7.5 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.75 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. The Monetary Board cited a number of factors which support the maintenance of current policy settings in the near term. First, inflation is expected to decelerate by the second half of 2006. Second, average inflation rate by 2007 is expected to hit the targeted 4-5 percent in the absence of renewed domestic or external shocks. The Monetary Board also considered the evidence of stable core inflation, limited demand-based pressures, and a relative absence of second-round effects on wage- and price-setting. Inflation expectations were found to remain manageable and in support of keeping policy rates unchanged. The Monetary Board recognized, however, that the balance of risks to the inflation outlook remains tilted toward the upside, particularly given the recent uptrend in domestic oil prices. The prospect of continued oil price increases in the next few months, along with expected adjustments in domestic power costs, point to a continuing build-up in supply-side pressures. Such a prospect increases not only the risks to inflation expectations but also the likelihood of second-round effects. Managing the risks to inflation expectations, as well as the risk of potential second-round effects in wage- and price-setting, thus remains the key policy priority. At the same time, given that price pressures remain rooted in supply-side sources, the Monetary Board will continue to support the use of non-monetary measures by concerned government agencies which can more directly address the impact of increased transport and energy costs. The Monetary Board remains strongly committed to achieving the inflation target for 2007 and addressing the risks to future inflation. The Monetary Board will continue to closely monitor and assess the conditions for prices, aggregate demand, domestic liquidity and other factors in order to guide the appropriate response of monetary policy."
Euroarea,2006-05-04,"Ladies and gentlemen, let me welcome you to our press conference and report on the outcome of today's meeting of the ECB's Governing Council. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we have decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. Overall, the information which has become available since our last meeting broadly confirms our earlier assessment of the outlook for price developments and economic activity in the euro area, and that monetary and credit growth remains very dynamic. Against this background, the Governing Council will exercise strong vigilance in order to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. Such vigilance is particularly warranted in a context of ample liquidity and still very low levels of nominal and real interest rates across the whole maturity spectrum, implying an overall accommodative monetary policy stance. For monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting growth and employment in the euro area, inflation expectations must be firmly anchored. Let me now explain our assessment in more detail, turning first to the economic analysis. The data that have become available since the start of the year point to a re-acceleration of economic growth in the first quarter of 2006, following the moderation observed in the last quarter of 2005. In addition, the latest indicators and survey information point to continued growth in the second quarter and lend support to the scenario of a gradual broadening in economic activity as embodied in the March 2006 ECB staff projections. Business confidence is particularly buoyant, which, in principle, bodes well for investment, and the recovery in consumption and employment appears to be proceeding, albeit still gradually. Looking further ahead, the conditions remain in place for continued growth over the coming quarters. Activity in the world economy is expected to remain strong, providing continued support for euro area exports. Investment growth should benefit from an extended period of very favourable financing conditions, balance sheet restructuring, and gains in earnings and business efficiency. Consumption growth should also strengthen over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, as the labour market situation continues to improve. This favourable outlook for economic growth is broadly in line with available forecasts from international organisations and the private sector. Considering the information available, risks to this scenario appear broadly balanced over the shorter term, although recently oil prices have again demonstrated high volatility and their potential for posing downside risks to growth. This underlines the need for further improvement in the transparency of oil markets and further investment in this sector. Concerns about global imbalances continue to prevail over longer horizons, as do risks relating to protectionism. With regard to price developments, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 2.4% in April 2006, compared with 2.2% in March and 2.3% in February. In the short term, annual inflation rates are likely to remain above 2%, with the month-to-month profile largely dependent on developments in oil prices and the strength of their pass-through to other prices along the production chain. Beyond the short term, changes in administered prices and indirect taxes are expected to affect inflation significantly in 2007 and a further upward impact may also be expected from the indirect effects of past oil price increases. At the same time, wage dynamics in the euro area have remained moderate in recent quarters and wage growth is expected to remain contained, partly reflecting global competitive pressures, particularly in the manufacturing sector. Recent wage moderation has helped to dampen domestic inflationary pressures. Looking ahead, it is equally crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities in this regard, not least with a view to fostering employment growth. Risks to the outlook for price developments remain on the upside and include further increases in oil prices, a stronger pass-through of oil price rises into consumer prices than currently anticipated, additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, and  more fundamentally  stronger wage developments than expected at present, possibly due to second-round effects stemming from past oil price increases. Turning to the monetary analysis, in a context of ample liquidity in the euro area, monetary and credit growth remains very dynamic. In particular, the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector has continued to increase over recent months and has now reached double-digit levels. Credit growth has also become more broadly based across sectors, with borrowing both by households  especially for house purchase  and by non-financial corporations growing more strongly. Monetary growth continues to be driven mainly by the expansion of its most liquid components. Thus the latest developments confirm that the stimulative impact of the low level of interest rates remains the dominant factor behind the current high trend rate of monetary expansion. Overall, further acceleration of monetary and credit growth in this environment continues to point to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. Monetary developments, therefore, require careful monitoring, especially in the light of the strengthening of economic activity and, in particular, of strong asset price dynamics, especially in housing markets. To sum up, annual inflation rates are projected to remain elevated in 2006 and 2007 and the economic analysis confirms that the risks to price stability continue to lie on the upside. Some of these risks appear to have increased in view of the renewed strength of oil prices. Given strong money and credit growth in a context of already ample liquidity, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium to longer term. It therefore remains crucial to ensure that medium to long-term inflation expectations in the euro area are kept solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability  a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution to sustainable economic growth and job creation. Accordingly, particular vigilance is of the essence in order to ensure that risks to price stability do not materialise. With respect to fiscal policies, there are some signs that the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact and commitment to the rules have improved since last year's revision. However, fiscal targets in a number of cases are rather lenient and their attainment is still subject to considerable risks. The Governing Council therefore supports any further reinforcement of fiscal consolidation efforts that also takes full advantage of a more favourable economic environment. Appropriately ambitious fiscal targets as part of a comprehensive structural reform programme would bring deficit and debt ratios down more rapidly. This is decisive in order to secure the sustainability of public finances. Such strategies would also boost confidence in the economic prospects of the euro area. As regards structural reforms, the Governing Council again stresses the importance of undertaking comprehensive reforms to ensure open, competitive and well-functioning labour and product markets, including the promotion of wage and price flexibility and the fostering of an attractive environment for investment and innovation. The need for such reforms has again been highlighted by recent oil price developments, as they would enhance the resilience of the euro area economy to external shocks. There is a broad and firm consensus that openness and flexibility are beneficial in promoting growth and employment and it is now essential to turn the agreed reform plans into actions and to strengthen them where necessary. By pushing forward with ambitious structural reforms, euro area countries will also lend support to the ongoing economic recovery."
United States,2006-05-10,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5 percent. Economic growth has been quite strong so far this year. The Committee sees growth as likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace, partly reflecting a gradual cooling of the housing market and the lagged effects of increases in interest rates and energy prices. As yet, the run-up in the prices of energy and other commodities appears to have had only a modest effect on core inflation, ongoing productivity gains have helped to hold the growth of unit labor costs in check, and inflation expectations remain contained. Still, possible increases in resource utilization, in combination with the elevated prices of energy and other commodities, have the potential to add to inflation pressures. The Committee judges that some further policy firming may yet be needed to address inflation risks but emphasizes that the extent and timing of any such firming will depend importantly on the evolution of the economic outlook as implied by incoming information. In any event, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to support the attainment of its objectives. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; Timothy F Geithner. Vice Chairman; Susan S Bies; Jack Guynn; Donald L Kohn; Randall S Kroszner; Jeffrey M Lacker; Mark W Olson; Sandra Pianalto; Kevin M Warsh; and Janet L Yellen. In a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 25-basis-point increase in the discount rate to 6 percent. In taking this action, the Board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston. New York. Philadelphia. Cleveland. Richmond. Atlanta. Chicago. St. Louis. Minneapolis. Dallas, and San Francisco."
Chile,2006-05-11,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 11 May 2006 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 5% (annual). The external scenario relevant for the Chilean economy continues to be very favorable, with the copper price increasing sharply to levels considerably above earlier projections. Available information continues to indicate that domestic demand is moderating its fast growth. It also confirms less-than expected growth for the first quarter, although because of one-off effects on specific sectors. Employment continues to grow at high rates, especially the salaried component. Internal financial conditions continue to be expansionary, although lately they show signs of attenuation. The inflation trend has continued in line with projections. Annual inflation measures CPI and CPIX (that excludes fuels and perishables) are temporarily at the upper half of the target range. On the other hand, core inflation CPIX1 (that also excludes some regulated utility rates), other inflation trend indicators and the different measures of expected inflation, continue to be well anchored around the center of the target range. While fuel prices have risen, other cost pressures are well contained. The decision to take a pause does not modify the Board's evaluation that, in the most likely scenario, additional increases in the interest rate in coming months continue to be necessary to have annual inflation around 3% in the normal monetary policy horizon. * The Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2006-05-11,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (4.00%) for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). In the real economy, exports continue to exhibit steady growth, the recovery of private consumption has been maintained, and facilities investment is still recovering gradually. On the other hand, an improvement of construction investment has not yet been sufficient. While the surplus on the goods account continues, the current account is in deficit mainly due to increased repatriation of dividends. Both consumer price inflation and core inflation maintain overall stability. Nevertheless, there are latent inflationary pressures due to the economic recovery and run-up in oil prices. The recent rebound in real estate prices has continued. In the financial markets, overall liquidity conditions are favorable and financial institutions' loans have shown a sharp increase. Taking the above economic and financial conditions into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (4.00%) for the intermeeting period."
Romania,2006-05-11,"In its meeting of May 11, 2006, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided the following:. The NBR Board also examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report that will be released to the public in a press conference organized on May 16, 2006. The analysis of the most recent developments in macroeconomic and monetary indicators shows a continued disinflation process, reinvigorated economic growth as well as the persistence of an unsustainable expansion of consumption. The slowdown in administered price growth (energy, medicines, fixed telephony tariffs) and in volatile food prices during the first months of 2006 triggered a temporary, better than expected drop in inflation, with year-on-year consumer price inflation falling to 6.92 percent in April from 8.6 percent in December 2005. Although disinflation has continued, the short-term inflation outlook has worsened following the impact of increases in indirect taxation on tobacco and alcohol products and of a deterioration of inflation expectations due to uncertainties related to the calendar of administered price adjustments. Growing investment and strong household consumption dynamics, also supported by credit expansion have contributed to an increase in excess demand, while external imbalances have widened. The increase of non-government credit remained robust against the background of heightened bank competition and a change in its structure, where the growing share of lending in lei has led to an improvement of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. The NBR Board believes that implementation of a balanced mix of economic policies (monetary, fiscal, income and structural) is essential to consolidate the disinflation process and continue the convergence process with the European Union. As a part of this mix, the NBR Board envisages to keep a restrictive monetary policy stance for a longer period of time. Under these circumstances and in light of the available data, the NBR Board has decided to maintain the monetary policy rate at 8.5 percent per annum, a decision which, on the background of a consolidation of disinflation will increase the restrictiveness of monetary conditions. It also decided to continue to pursue a firm control of money market liquidity by significant sterilization of excess liquidity via open-market operations. The NBR is restating it will continue to closely monitor monetary and macroeconomic trends in order to appropriately use its entire array of available instruments with the aim to counter inflationary pressures and bring inflation on the forecast trajectory over the medium term. The NBR Board also examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, a document that assesses the recent macroeconomic context, presents the inflation outlook as well as the main challenges and risks for monetary policy in the coming period. The report will be released to the public in a press conference organized on May 16, 2006. According to the announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for June 27, 2006."
Peru,2006-05-15,"Press Release MONETARY PROGRAM FOR MAY 2006 CENTRAL BANK RAISES REFERENCE RATE FROM 4.25% TO 4.50% The Board of the BCRP acknowledge the following information: The recent evolution of the inflation rate is associated to a rise in the prices of some products in particular, and this rise is connected to transitory factors affecting the supply. The Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) increased 0.51 percent in April, 0.45 percentage points of which are explained by a rise in the price of sugar. In the case of the accumulated inflation for January-April 2006 (2.0 percent), the prices of sugar, poultry meat, and potato account for 1.3 percent of this figure. In the case of the inflation rate over the last twelve months (2.9 percent), again the rise in the prices of potato and sugar, as well as in the price of fuels, account for 1.5 percentage points. The core inflation rate an indicator that expresses the trend in price increases, but isolates the most volatile components of the CPI- over the last 12 months was 1.4 percent. Economic activity recorded a growth of 4.9 percent in February 2006, with a 7.5 percent increase in the domestic demand (private investment grew by 23.3 that month). As in previous months, demand indicators show the constant dynamism of economic activity. The average exchange rate decreased 0.27 percent in April, falling from 3.34 in March to 3.33 per dollar, as a result of which the real exchange rate increased 0.2 percent (a 2.1 percent real depreciation in the last twelve months) due to the depreciation of the dollar against other currencies. The BCRP did not intervene in the exchange market in April. The Central Bank continued carrying out significant repo auctions in April in order to both revert exceptional upward pressures on the interbank interest rate and to stabilize it around the reference interest rate (4.25 percent in April). The average interest rate in the interbank market was 4.26 percent at the end of April (4.76 percent lower than last month's), while the corporate prime rate for loans in soles went from 7.3 at the end of March to 6.4 percent at the end of April. The country risk indicator decreased from 187 basis points at the end of March to 181 basis points at the end of April. In turn, the 15-year maturity sovereign bond yield decreased from 8.25 to 8.06 percent. The Board of the Central Bank approved to raise the reference interest rate for the interbank market from 4.25 percent to 4.50 percent. This decision has been made taking into account the following considerations: The dynamism of economic activity for 2006 (5.0 percent) is consistent with the continuous accomplishment of the inflation target (between 1.5 and 3.5 percent). The rise in the interest rate will contribute to reduce volatility in the exchange market. If necessary, the Bank will intervene and reduce volatility by selling exchange currency at spot market and carrying out auctions of Adjustable Certificate Deposits (CDRBCRP) in order to avoid undesirable effects over prices and economic activity in general. This decision does not imply a sequence of rises in the reference interest rate. The Board approved the following interest rates for the Central Bank operations: For direct repo operations and for rediscount facilities, the rate rises to 5.25 percent. For overnight deposits, the rate rises to 3.75 percent. The interest rates for the following operations in dollars between the Central Bank and the Financial system are established as follows: Rediscount facilities: 1-month LIBOR plus one percent. Overnight deposits: overnight LIBOR minus 3/8 of a percentage point. Swap: the commission is raised to a level that implies a minimum annual effective cost of 5.25 percent. Reserve requirements in foreign deposits subject to payment remain at 2.25 percent. The Board will approve the following Monetary Program (June 2006) on the session to be held on June 1, 2006."
Egypt,2006-05-18,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release May 18, 2006 The Central Bank of Egypt decided to keep its overnight deposit rate unchanged at 8 percent per annum and the lending rate at 10 percent per annu. In its meeting held on May 18, 2006, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain the overnight deposit and the overnight lending rates at 8 percent and 10 percent, respectivel. This decision was based on an assessment of recent domestic and external economic developments since the last MPC meetin. Domestically domestic inflation rates continued to hold at moderate level. On the other hand, externally, risks to global inflation are still skewed to the upside and uncertainty surrounds the international interest rate outloo. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments, especially the factors underlying inflation, and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates in either direction, if necessary, to ensure price stability over the medium-ter.

Malaysia,2006-05-22,"At its meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to leave the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) unchanged at 3.50 percent. The assessment of overall economic outlook indicates that the underlying trend has not changed since the monetary policy statement in April. The Malaysian economy is expected to maintain its momentum on the basis of favourable domestic and external conditions. Malaysia is not insulated from the inflationary forces being felt globally. However, at this stage, limited evidence of second round effects and lack of indications of demand-induced inflationary pressures imply that the monetary policy response can take a pause. Monetary policy will continue to be vigilant to inflationary risks and would respond to any risk of inflation becoming a threat to the medium and longer-term prospects of the economy. The course of monetary policy in the coming months would be determined by the Bank's assessment of the implications of new developments and information for the medium term prospects for price stability and sustainable economic growth.

Turkiye,2006-05-25,"b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Within the framework of the Late Liquidity Window Facility, the CBRT overnight borrowing interest rate applicable between 4:00 p.m.  4:30 p.m. at Interbank Money Market is 9.25 percent. Lending interest rate is 19.25 percent. c) The interest rates applicable to overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealer banks via repo transactions within the framework of open market transactions are 15.25 percent. The Committee perceives that the latest incoming data about output, demand and inflation are largely consistent with the medium-term outlook elaborated in the Inflation Report, putting aside the recent volatility in financial markets. Despite the rise in inflation during the first four months of 2006, the rate of increase in the index, including April, which is calculated by excluding items such as alcoholic beverages- tobacco, energy, gold and unprocessed food that are beyond the control of monetary policy, remains steady at low levels. However, after the recent financial turbulences, it has become more likely that inflation might realize above the 2006 year-end inflation target. The Central Bank will surely respond if there are strong indications that the inflation could considerably deviate from the targets in the medium-term. In light of available information, it should be noted that, although it is still early to change the medium-term outlook, the policy rates are less likely to decrease in the short-term. In the coming period, the policy rate decisions will be conditional on the international liquidity conditions, changes in risk premiums and other developments. The direction and magnitude of policy response can vary depending on whether the effects of fluctuations are temporary or permanent. It should be emphasized that any new data and information associated with the inflation outlook will potentially lead the Monetary Policy Committee to revise its future stance.

Israel,2006-05-29,"29.5.2006 The Bank of Israel leaves the interest rate for June 2006 unchanged at 5.25 percent The interest rate for June 2006 will remain unchanged at 5.25 percent. The decision to leave the interest rate unchanged is consistent with the achievement of price stability within the limits of the target of between 1 percent and 3 percent inflation a year as determined by the government. Background conditions National Accounts data for the first quarter of the year indicated rapidgrowth in the economy, faster than expected. The monthly indicators continue to point to further and firmer growth. Growth is accompanied by an improvement in the labor market: unemployment rate in the first quarter fell to 8.7 percent and the number of employees in the business sector continued torise. The recovery in the labor market is accompanied by wage rises, although labor productivity has also increased such that average unit labor costs have remained unchanged. The CPI in the past 12 months increased by 3.8 percent, above the upper limit of the inflation target. However in the coming months, 12-month inflation is expected to converge to within the target range. Inflation expectations for the next 12 months, derived from the capital market and economists' forecasts, are that inflation will be close to the midpoint of the targetrange, under the assumption that the Bank of Israel will raise the interest rate by about 50 basis points by the end of the year. Throughout April and in the first half of May, the NIS appreciated sharply--by 5 percent against the dollar and by 2.8 percent against the currency basket. The strengthening of the NIS was due to a combination of global factors--that is the weakening of the dollar globally--and local factors connected, inter alia, to the new government's commitment to maintaining the budgetary policy, the positive developments of the Israeli economy and the positive evaluations of foreign investment houses including the expected raising of Israel's credit rating. From May 9, a trend began of sharp drops on the stock markets in the emerging economies, accompanied by the depreciation of their currencies against the dollar. Morgan Stanley's Emerging Markets Share Index fell by 15 percent. The NIS in this period depreciated against the dollar by only 1.5 percent. According to the budget figures and the government's declared statements, it is expected that the new government will continue with a responsible fiscal policy. The rapid increase in real economic activity brought an increase in tax revenues, while government expenditure in the period January to April was low, reflecting the absence of an approved budget: Until the 2006 budget is approved, government expenditure will continue to be governed bythe law on the absence of an approved budget, in which monthly expenditureis limited to one-twelfth of the previous year's budget. The main considerations behind the decision In examining all major factors that are expected to affect future price development, a number of opposing forces were found: On the one hand, rapid growth and improved employment point to possible inflationary pressures during the coming year. These pressures could also continue to push up nominal wages in the economy. On the other hand, several factors act to moderate the inflationary pressures: The strengthening of the NIS at a cumulative rate of 3.5 percent since the beginning of April moderates the forces pushing prices up. Maintainingbudgetary discipline and reducing national debt as a percentage of GDP will support growth while holding back the mounting demand pressures in the economy. An examination of all the factors led to the decision to leave the interest rate unchanged this month. This was taken in the light of expectations that inflation will converge to within the target range in the coming months and to the midpoint of the range in 12 months' time. This expectation is based on estimates by the capital market and forecasts that the Bank of Israel will raise the interest rate by some 50 basis points by the end of the year. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor economic developments closely with the intention of achieving the government's price-stability target. Subject to this, the Bank will continue to support the attainment of a range of objectives of macroeconomic policy, particularly with respect to increasing employment and growth. In addition, the Bank will continue to supportfinancial stability. 29.5.2006 The Bank of Israel leaves the interest rate for June 2006 unchanged at 5.25 percent. The Bank of Israel leaves the interest rate for June 2006 unchanged at 5.25 percent. The interest rate for June 2006 will remain unchanged at 5.25 percent. Background conditions.

Philippines,2006-05-31,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the BSP's key policy interest rates at 7.5 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.75 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. The Monetary Board is of the view that current evidence supports the maintenance of current policy settings. First, the inflation path continues to suggest a deceleration beginning in the second half of 2006. Second, average inflation for 2007 is expected to hit the 4-5 percent target in the absence of new supply shocks. Third, core inflation and other demand indicators continue to indicate limited demand-based pressures. Finally, the Monetary Board concluded that inflation expectations remain well-anchored and that there is relatively little indication thus far of second-round effects from supply shocks. Nevertheless, the balance of risks to future inflation remains on the upside and closely related to movements in oil prices. Steady world oil demand against a backdrop of limited surplus production capacity will likely keep world oil prices high. Oil prices are likely to be vulnerable to market concerns of geopolitical risks in major oil-producing economies. Possible adjustments in domestic power costs could also lead to a continuing environment of supply-side pressures. Such a scenario could increase the risk of an adverse shift in the public's inflation expectations as well as second-round effects in wage- and price-setting. Thus, the Monetary Board agreed that its key policy priority remains that of managing the risks to inflation expectations and the risk of potential second-round effects on wage- and price-setting. At the same time, the Monetary Board will strengthen its support for non-monetary measures to address high oil prices by concerned government agencies, given that price pressures remain on the supply-side. The Monetary Board remains strongly committed to achieving the inflation target for 2007 and addressing the risks to future inflation and stands ready to act in the event that risks to the outlook for inflation and to public expectations escalate."
Poland,2006-05-31,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 31 May 2006 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 30-31 May 2006 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e.: reference rate 4.00% on an annual basis; lombard rate 5.50% on an annual basis; deposit rate 2.50% on an annual basis; rediscount rate 4.25% on an annual basis. Since the Council's meeting in April 2006, the forecasts of economic growth for 2006 and inflation for 2006-2007 in the United States have been slightly revised upwards. Growth and inflation forecasts for 2006-2007 in the euro area have remained unchanged. In April, the annual growth of consumer prices increased both in the euro area (to 2.4% from 2.2% in March) and in the United States (to 3.5% from 3.4%). Since the Council's meeting in April, oil prices in the world markets have fallen (by 5.3%). In contrast. April saw a rise in the average price of this commodity as forecast for the years 2006-2007 by analysts in the Reuters survey (3.5% for 2006 and 4.4% for 2007 as compared to the previous month's forecasts). Still, uncertainty persists as to the effect of high oil prices on economic growth and inflation. Since the Council's meeting in April 2006, the GUS (CSO) revised upwards the nominal GDP growth in particular quarters of 2005. At the same time, the GUS revised upwards the growth of prices in the economy (GDP deflator) in 2005. As a result. GDP growth in real terms in 2005 amounted to 3.4% y/y (as compared to the initial estimate of 3.2% y/y). GUS data on GDP in 2006 Q1 confirm that since 2005 Q2 the economic growth has been accelerating. The real GDP growth in 2006 Q1 amounted to 5.2% y/y (compared with 4.3% in 2005 Q4). The real GDP growth in 2006 Q1 was higher than expected in the April Inflation Report. Private consumption rose by 5.1% y/y (as compared with 2.8% in 2005 Q4) and the contribution of net exports to GDP growth was 0.7 percentage point (versus minus 1.1 percentage point in 2005 Q4). Gross fixed capital formation increased by 7.4% y/y (against 10.1% y/y in 2005 Q4) and public consumption rose by 3.4% y/y (against 5.1% y/y in 2005 Q4). Growth of private consumption and the contribution of net exports to GDP growth were higher than forecasted in the April Inflation Report, whereas the increase in gross fixed capital formation and public consumption was lower than expected in the April Report. The April figures on output, retail sales and labour market indicate the ongoing economic recovery in Poland. The growth of industrial output in April 2006 reached 5.8% y/y (as compared to 16.4% y/y in March) and was in line with the NBP's expectations, although below the average of forecasts of external analysts. Lower output growth as compared to the previous month was mainly the result of a lower number of business days than a year before. In seasonally adjusted terms, the ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51, growth of industrial output remained high and amounted to 10.2% y/y (against 13.6% y/y in March 2006). In April the construction and assembly output increased by 4.1% y/y as compared to 15.5% y/y in March - 4.9% y/y as compared to 8.3% y/y, respectively, in seasonally adjusted terms. The growth in retail sales  although slightly below market expectations  accelerated (an increase by 13.2% y/y against 10.1% y/y in March in nominal terms). This was the highest increase since April 2004, when retail sales jumped significantly preceding Poland's EU entry. The growth of household lending has continued at a robust pace: in April consumer loans registered an increase of 17.6% y/y (against 18.9% y/y in March) while the growth of housing loans amounted to 41.1% y/y (against 45.9% y/y in March). The growth of corporate lending remains moderate (an increase of 3.4% y/y in April against 3.8% y/y in March). The accelerating economic growth increases the demand for labour. Since December 2004 the growth of employment in the corporate sector has been accelerating. In April 2006 employment in enterprises was 2.8% higher than a year before. April also saw a fall in the rate of registered unemployment in annual terms (down to 17.2% from 18.7% recorded one year before). The economic recovery is accompanied by wage growth. In 2006 Q1 the average wage growth in the economy reached 4.7% y/y in nominal terms (against 5.1% y/y in 2005 Q4). In April 2006 the corporate sector registered a wage growth of 4.0% (as compared to 5.4% y/y in March). In industry, total labour productivity growth in January-April 2006 amounted to approx. 9.0% y/y while the growth rate of average nominal wage over the same period reached 4.4% y/y. In the recent period the declarations of wage increases as well as signals of rising wage demands in part of the public sector have intensified. If these demands are met wage pressure in the remaining part of the public sector may rise and in this way wage growth in the whole economy may accelerate. At the same time, higher wage rises would have led to increased tensions in the public finance and, consequently, would hamper the reduction of the public finance deficit. A necessary condition of sustainable acceleration of economic growth not threatening the achievement of the inflation target is to ensure that wages do not grow faster than labour productivity in the long run. The annual growth of consumer prices in April rose to 0.7% (as compared with 0.4% y/y in March). This rise in the annual inflation against March 2006 was mainly the result of increased energy prices, primarily due to the increase of prices of natural gas connected with a hike in gas tariffs'  and fuel prices. The majority of core inflation measures went up as well, even though their level remained low (core inflation measures in April ranged between -0.6% y/y and 1.0% y/y). This low level of all core inflation indices indicates that inflationary pressure continues to be low. May 2006 did not bring any significant changes to the inflation expectations of households, which also remained low. In April 2006, producer prices in industry reported a rise of 1.4% m/m against 0.7% m/m in March, i.e. 1.8% y/y against 0.9% y/y. This rise was mainly brought about by a considerable growth in commodity prices. The increase in annual growth rate of producer prices (PPI) occurred even though the effective exchange rate of the zloty was 7.7% stronger than a year before. The Council maintains its belief that implementing an economic strategy focused on creating conditions which ensure introduction of the euro at the earliest possible date would be most favourable for Poland and would contribute to higher long-term economic growth. The balance of risk for future inflation has not changed significantly since the Council's last meeting, yet a risk factor related to wage pressures in the budget sector has appeared. The Council has also approved the Report on Monetary Policy Implementation in 2005 and the Report on the Operations of the National Bank of Poland in 2005. The next meeting of the Council will be held on 27-28 June 2006."
Thailand,2006-06-07,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 7 June 2006 Ms. Atchana Waiquamdee. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand, announces that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance. The main issues discussed are as follows. In the first quarter of 2006, the Thai economy grew satisfactorily, with the export sector expanding particularly well due to supportive world economic conditions. Nonetheless latest indicators on private demand conditions showed signs of softness and public investment could be partly delayed. The MPC thus viewed that there is a probability that the economy could slow down going forward. However with the oil prices surging more than expected and causing inflation to clearly accelerate beyond the MPC's previous projections, there continued to be a need to maintain the tightening policy stance at this time. Therefore the MPC decided to raise the 14-day repurchase rate by 25 basis points from 475 to 500 per cent per annum, effective immediately. Provided that there are no unexpected developments, especially a continued acceleration of inflation, the MPC viewed that today's increase has brought the policy interest rate to the level which is appropriate for achieving economic stability and supporting sustainable growth in the long run."
Euroarea,2006-06-08,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to the press conference here in Madrid. I would particularly like to thank Governor Caruana for his kind hospitality and express our special gratitude to the staff of the Banco de España for their excellent organisation. Let me now report on the outcome of today's meeting, which was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup. Prime Minister Juncker, and Commissioner Almunia. At today's meeting, we decided to increase the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. This decision reflects the upside risks to price stability over the medium term that have been identified through both our economic and monetary analyses. The further withdrawal of monetary accommodation will thus contribute to ensuring that longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. As stressed on previous occasions, such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. Overall, also after today's increase, the key ECB interest rates are still low by historical standards, liquidity is ample and our monetary policy remains accommodative. Given the outlook for price developments and the dynamism of money and credit growth in the euro area, we will continue to monitor closely all developments to ensure price stability over the medium and longer term. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. All the main indicators of economic activity that have recently become available are positive. According to Eurostat's first estimate, on a quarter-on-quarter basis, real GDP grew by 0.6% in the euro area in the first quarter of 2006, compared with 0.3% in the previous quarter, with domestic demand making a significant contribution. The expected re-acceleration of real GDP growth in the first months of 2006 has thus materialised, confirming our view that economic growth is broadening and becoming more sustained. This assessment is further supported by information on activity in the second quarter  such as various confidence surveys and indicator-based estimates  which continues to be encouraging. Looking further ahead, the conditions are in place for growth in the euro area to remain close to its trend potential rate, despite the impact of the rise in oil prices. Growth in the economies of the euro area's main trading partners remains robust, providing support for euro area exports. Strong investment growth is expected to continue, benefiting from favourable financing conditions, corporate balance sheet restructuring, and gains in earnings and business efficiency. Consumption growth should continue to strengthen gradually over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, as the labour market situation gradually improves. This outlook is also reflected in the June Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, which provide additional input into our analysis of the prospects for economic activity. The projections foresee average annual real GDP growth in a range between 1.8% and 2.4% in 2006, and between 1.3% and 2.3% in 2007. The growth projections for 2006 are broadly unchanged from the ECB staff projections of March 2006, while those for 2007 are slightly lower, reflecting mainly the recent rise in oil prices. Most recent forecasts by international organisations and private sector institutions give a broadly similar picture. It is the Governing Council's view that risks to these projections for economic growth are broadly balanced over the shorter term, while longer-term downside risks relate mainly to potential further oil price rises, global imbalances and protectionism. Turning to price developments, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, annual HICP inflation increased to 2.5% in May, compared with 2.4% in April and 2.2% in March. Although no detailed information is available as yet, this increase probably stems from energy price developments. In the months to come and in 2007, inflation rates are likely to remain above 2%, the precise levels depending on future energy price developments. While the moderate evolution of labour costs in the euro area is expected to continue in 2007  also reflecting ongoing global competitive pressures, particularly in the manufacturing sector  indirect effects of past oil price increases and the announced changes in indirect taxes are expected to have a significant upward effect on inflation. Against this background, it is crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities. Further input into our assessment of the outlook for price developments is provided by the June Eurosystem staff projections. Annual HICP inflation is projected to lie between 2.1% and 2.5% in 2006, and between 1.6% and 2.8% in 2007. Compared with the March 2006 ECB staff projections, these ranges imply a slight upward shift to the profile for HICP inflation in 2006, largely reflecting the assumption of higher oil prices. In the view of the Governing Council, risks to the outlook for price developments remain on the upside and include further increases in oil prices, a stronger pass-through of past oil price rises into consumer prices than currently anticipated, additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, and  more fundamentally  stronger than expected wage developments due to second-round effects of past oil price increases. Turning to the monetary analysis, the Governing Council again had a thorough discussion of underlying developments in money and credit. In a context of already ample liquidity and very strong monetary and credit growth, the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector has increased further in recent months to reach double-digit levels. Borrowing by households  especially for house purchase  and by non-financial corporations has been growing very strongly. At the same time, monetary growth has risen further over the past few months, with the annual growth rate of M3 standing at 8.8% in April. The rapid rate of monetary growth continues to be driven mainly by the expansion of its most liquid components. Thus, the latest developments confirm that the stimulative impact of the low level of interest rates remains the dominant factor behind the current high trend rate of monetary expansion, which signals inflationary risks over the medium to longer term. The further acceleration of monetary and credit growth in this environment of already ample liquidity points to increased upside risks to price stability at longer horizons. Monetary developments, therefore, require careful monitoring, in particular in the light of strong dynamics in housing markets. To sum up, annual inflation rates are projected to remain elevated in 2006 and 2007, with risks to this outlook on the upside. Given the strength of monetary and credit growth and the ample liquidity situation, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms that upside risks to price stability over the medium term prevail. A further adjustment of interest rates was therefore warranted. By acting in a timely fashion, the Governing Council is helping to keep medium and long-term inflation expectations in line with price stability, thereby making an ongoing contribution to sustainable economic growth and job creation. Overall, our monetary policy remains accommodative and the Governing Council will continue to monitor closely all developments to ensure that risks to price stability do not materialise. With regard to fiscal policies, the forecasts published recently by the Commission point to a broadly unchanged situation in the euro area in 2006 and 2007; deficit ratios are expected to remain at around the 2005 level of 2.4%, while debt ratios, after declining only marginally, are forecast at levels still above 70% of GDP. This is disappointing against the background of the economic outlook. Most countries with an excessive deficit have not corrected their position in a timely manner. Furthermore, there is a risk of consolidation delays in other countries. It is crucial to avoid the mistakes of the past, when many countries failed to consolidate sufficiently in good times. The Governing Council considers that more determined progress is required towards sound public finances in a number of countries, that concrete and credible measures should be implemented swiftly as part of a medium-term-oriented strategy, and that it is vital to consolidate confidence in the revised Stability and Growth Pact by ensuring the sustainability of public finances in the euro area. In terms of structural reforms, the Governing Council reiterates its call for the implementation of firm measures to ensure open, competitive and well-functioning product and labour markets, so as to foster an attractive environment for investment and innovation and to promote flexibility in wages and prices. There is a broad and firm consensus that such reforms are beneficial in promoting growth and employment and in enhancing the resilience of the euro area economy to external shocks. At the same time, these reforms would further facilitate intra-euro area adjustments by reducing rigidities that contribute, in some economies, to wage developments that lead to high and persistent unit labour cost growth, higher inflationary pressure and losses in competitiveness. Examples of such rigidities are low productivity growth due to a lack of competition in some sectors and an explicit or de facto indexation of nominal wages to prices. All in all, a comprehensive set of reforms is essential to strengthen the foundations for sustained growth in output and employment across the euro area, to underpin the ongoing economic recovery and to further smoothen the functioning of adjustment mechanisms in the euro area, thereby facilitating the conduct of the single monetary policy."
South Korea,2006-06-08,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) by 25 basis points from 4.00% to 4.25% for the intermeeting period. In a related action, the Committee raised the interest rates on Liquidity Adjustment Loans and Aggregate Credit Ceiling Loans of the Bank of Korea by the same 25 basis points, respectively to 4.00 percent and 2.50 percent. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). In the real economy, the exports growth has accelerated, the recovery of private consumption has been maintained, and facilities investment is still recovering gradually. On the other hand, an improvement of construction investment has not yet been sufficient. Meanwhile, the current account has temporarily enlarged a deficit due to the narrowed goods account surplus, and the repatriation of dividends. Both consumer price inflation and core inflation maintain overall stability. Nevertheless, there are arising inflationary pressures due to the economic recovery and persistently high oil prices. The recent rebound in real estate prices has continued. In the financial markets, overall liquidity conditions are favorable and financial institutions' loans have shown a sharp increase. Taking the above economic and financial conditions into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) by 25 basis points from 4.00% to 4.25% for the intermeeting period."
Nigeria,2006-06-08,"PRESS RELEASE CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA COMMUNIQUE NO. 46 OF THE MONETARY POLICY COMMITTEE. JUNE 8, 2006 The Monetary Policy Committee of the CBN decided on 8th June 2006 to raise the Minimum Rediscount Rate (MRR) by 100 basis points to 140 per cent. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the CBN met on 8th June, 2006. The MPC reviewed the major macroeconomic developments and the implementation of fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies in the first five months of 2006, as well as the challenges for the rest of the year. The Meeting, the second in the year, lasted five hours and had in attendance two new External Board Members of the Bank. The MPC noted the mixed economic performance in the first five months and restated its commitment to ensuring monetary and price stability in the rest of the year. This Press Release summarises some of the major conclusions of the MPC. KEY MACROECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS Inflation The MPC noted that both the end-April headline and core inflation rates had increased to 126 and 166 per cent from 116 and 24 per cent in December 2005 respectively. The provisional estimates for end-May as well as the forecasts for June for the two measures of inflation, however, indicated some moderation. The MPC observed further that inflation was being pushed by structural factors particularly the vandalism of oil pipelines, which was affecting the efficient supply of power-energy and cost of transportation. In addition, inflation in non-food price (core) was being aided by the continued build-up of excess liquidity. On the other hand, food prices had declined to 96 per cent at end-April from 155 per cent at end-December 2005. The Committee expects continued decline in food prices in the next quarter as the harvest period sets in; this would have a general dampening influence on prices given the overriding weight of food in the inflation basket. However to complement the influence of food, the MPC noted the need to address the problems posed by excess liquidity. Economic activity The GDP growth was seasonally low in 2006, relative to the high growth in 2005. The overall end-March 2006 GDP grew by 27 per cent year-on-year, down from 69 per cent in the corresponding period of 2005. This was attributed largely to the unrest in the Niger Delta, which affected oil productions. In addition, the incessant pipeline vandalism disrupted the supply of fuel products as well as the supply of power energy that adversely affected non- oil private sector activity. Exchange rate The MPC noted with satisfaction the relative stability of the naira following the Bank's initiative to allow the BDCs access to the CBN's forex window in April 2006. The naira exchange in the BDCs has since appreciated from US $1/N15100 in March to US $1/N13600 by the first week in June 2006. Against the DAS exchange rate, which has stabilized at about US $1/N12700, the BDC market premium has dropped from N2400 in March to N900 in the first week of June 2006. External Reserves Gross external reserves increased from US $2800 billion at end- December 2005 to US $3600 billion at end-March 2006. Following the US $460 billion exit payment to the Paris Club in April, the stock of external reserves fell to US $3200 billion at end- April, but rose to US $3400 billion at end-May 2006, owing to continued positive developments in the international oil market and the commitment of the Authorities to accumulate external reserves to defend the value of the naira. Growth in Monetary Aggregates Broad money (M2) grew by 141% as at end-May 2006 over the December 2005, which represented an annualized growth rate of 338 per cent compared with the target of 150  170 per cent for 2006. The rise in money stock was due to the 225 per cent increase in aggregate bank credit (net) to the public sector; compared with the target negative 40 per cent for the entire 2006. The increase in M2 was also helped by the monetization of foreign assets (net). Credit to the private sector, however, increased by 435 per cent in the period under review owing to the slowdown in economic activity in the sector. When annualised credit to the private sector was 104 per cent compared to the target of 300 per cent for 2006. Reserve Money At end-May 2006, the reserve money was N81250 billion, which was higher than the target of N80000 billion for the second quarter 2006. In addition, the level of RM is projected to rise to N83500 billion if current trends continued. Interest Rates The MPC noted the general decline in banks' deposit and lending rates following the excess liquidity in the system. Consequently the spread between the average savings deposit and maximum lending rates fell from 162 percentage points in December 2005 to 151 percentage points at the end of May 2006. THE OUTLOOK FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR Some risks exist owing to persistent excess liquidity in the rest of 2006 if current trends remained unchanged. prolonged disruption in oil production would reduce government revenue from oil; and to meet the planned programme, government might resort to high powered money, which would be more inflationary. Against this background, the MPC decided to tighten monetary policy in line with its anti-inflationary policy goal. DECISIONS The Committee thus: (a) Raised the MRR from 130% to 140%, to take effect from 12th June, 2006, (b) Maintained the CRR at 50% (c) Resolved to sustain the on-going liberalization of the forex market as well as effectively monitor the market to maintain stability of the naira. (d) The Monetary Policy Implementation Committee (MPIC) would continue to keep daily surveillance on monetary operations. (e) With the deployment of the electronic Financial Analysis Surveillance System (eFASS), the Bank will leverage on that to ensure the proactive implementation of monetary policy. (f) The OMO shall continue to be the major instrument of monetary policy. (g) The Committee, further assured that it would respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to support the attainment of its objectives. Thank you for your kind attention.

Turkiye,2006-06-08,"The Monetary Policy Committee has decided to increase short-term interest rates (policy rates) at the CBRT Interbank Money Market and the Istanbul Stock Exchange Repo-Reverse Repo Market as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: The CBRT borrowing interest rate is increased to 15 percent from 13.25 percent, and the CBRT lending interest rate is increased to 18 percent from 16.25 percent. b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Within the framework of the Late Liquidity Window Facility, the CBRT overnight borrowing interest rate applicable between 4:00 p.m.  4:30 p.m. at Interbank Money Market is increased to 11 percent from 9.25 percent. Lending interest rate is increased to 21 percent from 19.25 percent. c) The interest rates applicable to overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealer banks via repo transactions within the framework of open market transactions are increased to 17 percent from 15.25 percent. According to the April and May inflation figures, the annual inflation rate significantly exceeded the target path. Moreover, annual inflation figures to be recorded in the next months might further go up temporarily, with the pass-through effect of the exchange rate movements arising from the recent volatility in financial markets. The Monetary Policy Committee has deemed it necessary to revise the policy rates in order not to let such temporary developments cause permanent effects on the medium-term expectations and pricing behaviors, and also to make sure that the medium-term inflation trend is kept in line with the targets. In light of currently available information, the policy rates are less likely to rise in the short-term, compared to the previous period. However, it should be reminded that the direction of monetary policy decisions might change conditional on developments pertaining to inflation outlook. Policy decisions will be based on a perspective in which inflation would converge to the target towards the end of 2007. Therefore, accompanied by the envisioned decline in inflation, the direction of policy rates would be downward as well in the medium-term. It should be emphasized that any new data or information associated with the inflation outlook will potentially lead the Monetary Policy Committee to revise its future stance. A broader summary of the assessments of the Monetary Policy Committee will be published within five working days.

South Africa,2006-06-08,"The risks to the previously benign inflation outlook in South Africa have increased over the past few weeks. Uncertainties relating to the future movements of US interest rates have had reverberations in international financial markets, with negative consequences for a number of emerging markets in particular. This has put some downward pressure on commodity prices and has contributed to a marked depreciation of the rand since the last meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee. These events have occurred at a time of continued geopolitical tensions which have driven international oil prices to new record highs. Domestically, consumer demand has remained robust, and there are few signs of moderation. Growth in credit extension has continued at a brisk pace and household debt has continued to rise, while the current account deficit of the balance of payments has widened further. Domestic output growth in the first quarter of 2006 returned to a level more in line with potential output following the improved performance of the manufacturing sector in the first quarter of 2006. Inflation as measured by the consumer price index for metropolitan and other urban areas excluding the interest cost on mortgage bonds (CPIX) increased by 3,7 per cent year-on-year rate in April, having measured 3,8 per cent and 4,5 per cent in the previous two months respectively. Petrol price movements continue to account for much of the volatility in CPIX inflation. If petrol prices were excluded. CPIX inflation would have fluctuated within a band of 3,0 per cent and 3,7 per cent since July 2004, and would have averaged 3,3 per cent in April 2006. Motor vehicle running costs declined to year-on-year rates of increase of 13,7 per cent and 9,5 per cent in March and April. This can be compared to respective increases of 21,5 per cent and 24,6 per cent in the previous two months. Goods price inflation declined to 4,1 per cent and 3,9 per cent in March and April respectively, compared to 4,8 per cent in February. The lower trend of goods price inflation was influenced by the lower rates of increase in vehicle running costs, and the continued decline in the prices of clothing and footwear, furniture and equipment and motor vehicles. Food price inflation increased further, measuring 5,5 per cent and 6,2 per cent in March and April respectively. The main categories contributing to the higher food price inflation were meat, fish and vegetables. Although grain price increases remained relatively low, there were signs of acceleration in this category, as the impact of the higher maize prices began to be felt at the consumer level. Grain product prices increased by 3,9 per cent in April, compared to a modest fall in prices in January. Services price inflation remained below that of goods inflation and measured 3,5 per cent in both March and April of this year. Administered prices increased at a year-on-year rate of 5,2 per cent in April, while administered prices excluding petrol increased by 3,3 per cent. Production price inflation has remained relatively stable at around 5,5 per cent for the first four months of 2006. Imported goods prices increased by 6,7 per cent and 6,1 per cent in March and April respectively, while prices of domestically produced goods increased by 5,0 per cent and 5,5 per cent in these months respectively. Compared to the previous forecast of the Bank, the latest forecast shows a marked deterioration in the inflation outlook, particularly in the short term. Whereas the previous forecast projected CPIX inflation to peak at a level just below 5 per cent in the first quarter of 2007, it is now expected to breach the upper end of the target range and to peak at a level of 6,2 per cent at that time. CPIX inflation is then expected to fall back below the upper end of the target by the next quarter, and by the third quarter it is projected to decline further to 5,2 per cent. Inflation is then expected to continue to moderate gradually to reach 4,8 per cent by the end of 2008. The main reason for the deteriorating outlook is a significant upward revision of the international oil price assumptions. The most recent inflation expectations survey of the Bank conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research at the University of Stellenbosch shows that expectations for 2006 have remained more or less unchanged, although there has been a slight deterioration in expectations for 2007 and 2008. The revisions were mainly a result of an upward adjustment of expectations of trade unionists, and this brought them in line with the expectations of analysts and business executives. Inflation is now expected to average 4,9 per cent in both 2007 and 2008, compared to expectations in the first quarter of 2006 of 4,6 per cent and 4,8 per cent for these two years respectively. These expectations are in line with the inflation expectations as indicated in the long-term break-even inflation rate, measured as the yield differential between conventional bonds and inflation-linked bonds, which measured 4,8 per cent at the end of May 2006. Favourable factors to the inflation outlook include the continued fiscal discipline, the moderate trend in unit labour costs and the benign world inflation. The International Monetary Fund expects world inflation to decline from a projected 3,8 per cent in 2006 to 3,5 per cent next year, despite higher international oil prices. South Africa's growth performance improved during the first quarter of 2006 to a rate of 4,2 per cent, compared to the revised 3,2 per cent growth in the fourth quarter of last year. The improved performance occurred despite contractions in both agriculture and mining. The manufacturing sector made a good recovery and grew by 4,3 per cent following a mild contraction in the final quarter of 2005. The latest Investec/BER Purchasing Manager's Index indicates that this improved performance may continue in the second quarter, despite the downturn recorded in April. Overall growth in 2006 is expected to remain more or less in line with potential output. Although inflation is expected to remain within the target range for most of the forecast period, the risks are still seen to be on the upside. Household real consumption expenditure increased in the first quarter of 2006, at a rate roughly the same as that in the previous quarter, and in line with the 6,9 per cent increase in 2005. Motor vehicle sales remain at a high level although on a month-on-month basis a 4,1 per cent decrease was recorded in May of this year. These developments continue to be reflected in the growth of credit extension. Twelve-month growth in bank loans and advances extended to the private sector measured 23,1 per cent in April compared to 24,3 per cent in March, while asset-backed credit extended to the private sector continued to grow strongly at a year-on-year rate of 27,2 per cent in April, reflecting strong growth in mortgage advances. This has resulted in a further increase in consumer indebtedness. In the first quarter of 2006, the ratio of household debt to GDP had risen to approximately 68 per cent, compared to 65½ per cent the previous quarter. The cost of servicing the debt has remained fairly stable at around 7 per cent. High levels of expenditure contributed to the continued widening in the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments in the first quarter of 2006. This has arisen in part as a result of weak export volume growth and higher volumes and values of crude oil imports, particularly in January and February, when signficantly large trade deficits were recorded. The widening deficit has nevertheless been more than financed by capital inflows. These inflows enabled the Bank to further increase its holdings of foreign exchange reserves. By the end of May, official gross gold and other foreign exchange reserves had increased to US$24,1 billion, while the international liquidity position had increased to US$20,4 billion. The international environment has posed increased risks to the inflation outlook. Since the last meeting of the MPC the exchange rate of the rand has come under pressure as a result of developments in international financial and commodity markets. Previously the relative exchange rate stability had contributed to the positive inflation outlook. In the past weeks, the rand has depreciated against all the major currencies at a time when the US dollar has been weakening against other major currencies. The decline in commodity prices and the re-rating of emerging market risk contributed to the depreciation of the rand from around R6,12 to the US dollar at the time of the last MPC meeting to current levels of around R6,80, and from R7,42 to the euro to current levels of around R8,65. On a trade weighted basis, the rand has depreciated by approximately 13 per cent since the last MPC meeting. The continued uncertainties on the international financial and commodities markets add to inflation risk, but may be a part of the adjustment to changing risk perceptions of emerging markets. Of significance is the fact that South Africa's spreads have not widened by as much as those of a number of other emerging markets and there does not appear to be a strong exodus by non-residents from the domestic bond and capital markets. In fact over the past few weeks, non-residents have remained net buyers of South African bonds and equities. However, in line with a number of other markets internationally, share prices on the JSE Securities Exchange have come under pressure, and the all-share index has retreated from a recent all-time high of just over 22000 in May to current levels just below 20000. According to the IMF, world growth is expected to average a robust 4,9 per cent this year compared to the previous forecast of 4,3 per cent, and 4,7 per cent next year. Uncertainties arise however in the interpretation of recent events in the international markets. It is unclear at this stage whether they are simply a reflection of a temporary correction in the markets, or a more sustained period of volatility which could undermine world growth in general and in emerging markets in particular. Adding to the uncertainty is the continued risk posed by international oil prices. Since the last meeting of the MPC, the price of Brent crude has averaged around US$70 per barrel and fluctuated between a new record high of just below US$75 per barrel in the third week of April and the current level around US$68. These developments have been a result of tight supply and demand conditions, as well as continued geopolitical tensions, which have kept the oil price at a high level. These higher oil prices have been felt domestically in the pump price of petrol. The R0,22 per litre increase in April was followed by increases R0,39 per litre and R0,36 per litre in May and June respectively. Approximately R0,14 of the most recent increase is a result of exchange rate movements. On the basis of the detailed analysis of the economy which is summarised above, the MPC has decided that a moderate adjustment in the repo rate is warranted at present. Accordingly the repo rate is increased by 50 basis points to 7,5 per cent per annum with immediate effect. The MPC will continue to monitor economic developments and all the relevant risks which might have a bearing on the continued attainment of the inflation target."
Chile,2006-06-15,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 15 June 2006 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 5% (annual). The external scenario relevant for the Chilean economy continues to be favorable, despite the fact that financial conditions facing emerging economies have become less advantageous in the past few weeks. In this context, both corporate shares and currencies have adjusted downward, while sovereign spreads have risen slightly. The price of copper has made relatively fast downward corrections, but it remains high. The information available continues to point at domestic demand moderating its growth rate, in line with projections in the last Monetary Policy Report. April's output growth was slower than expected, although evidence at hand suggests that no persistent factors are behind. Employment continues to grow at high rates, especially the salaried component. Internal financial conditions are still expansionary, although less so than in the past few months. CPI inflation has continued along the path foreseen in the last Monetary Policy Report. CPIX1 inflation (that excludes fuels, perishables and some regulated utilities) has declined recently, as have other trend inflation indicators, while the different measures of expected annual inflation continue to be well anchored around 3%. While fuel prices have continued on the rise, other cost pressures seem to be well contained. This decision to maintain the monetary policy interest rate unchanged is consistent with the strategy of gradual normalization of monetary policy. It does not modify the Board's evaluation that, in the most likely scenario, additional increases in the interest rate in coming months continue to be necessary to have annual inflation around 3% in the normal policy horizon. * The Spanish original prevails."
Peru,2006-06-15,"Press Release MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JUNE 2006 CENTRAL BANK MAINTAINS REFERENCE RATE AT 4.50% The Board of the BCRP acknowledge the following information: The Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) decreased 0.5 percent in May. This evolution is explained by the reduction in the prices of electricity, sugar, and potato; the price drop of the latter two products reverting part of the increases produced in the previous months. In this way, the CPI inflation rate for the last twelve months was 2.2 percent, within the target range (1.5 percent  3.5 percent). On the other hand, the core inflation rate for the last 12 months was 1.3 percent. In the January  April 2006 period, economic activity grew around 6 percent with respect to the same period last year. As in previous months, demand indicators show the constant dynamism of economic activity. The average exchange rate decreased 1.6 percent in May, falling from 3.33 in April to 3.28 per dollar. Thus, the real exchange rate increased 0.4 percent in May (the sol depreciated 2.9 percent in real terms over the last twelve months) due to the depreciation of the dollar against other currencies. The BCRP intervened in the exchange market on May 17, purchasing US$ 0.5 million. The interbank interest rate in May was 4.48 percent, similar to the reference level (4.5 percent), while the 90-day corporate prime rate in soles fell from 6.8 percent in April to 5.9 percent. In this way, the upward pressures on the short-term interest rates were reverted. To do so, the BCRP continued carrying out significant repo auctions, increasing the maturities on these operations to up to three months. The country risk indicator decreased from 181 basis points at the close of April to 168 basis points at the end of May. In this month, placements of 20-year nominal sovereign bonds were made for the first time, thus widening the yield curve of these securities. The Board of the BCRP approved to maintain the interbank reference rate at 4.50 percent, taking into account that: The Central Bank has been partially reducing monetary stimulation since the month of December, thereby generating an increase of 150 basis points in the reference interest rate. The BCRP will continue to evaluate relevant macroeconomic information in order to implement the measures required to guarantee that the level of inflation remain within the target range. Economic activity in 2006 and 2007 is expected to grow between 5.0 and 5.5 percent, the dynamism of economic activity being consistent with the inflation target (within 1.5 and 3.5 percent). If necessary, the Central Bank will intervene in the exchange market to reduce exchange volatility so that undesired effects on inflation and on economic activity in general are prevented. The Board of the BCRP also approved to maintain the Bank's interest rates on active and passive operations (outside auctions). Thus. For direct repo and for rediscount operations, the rate continues to be 5.25 percent. For overnight deposits, the rate continues to be 3.75 percent. The interest rates for the following operations in dollars between the BCRP and the financial entities are established as follows: Rediscount facilities: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point. Overnight deposits: overnight LIBOR minus 3/8 of a percentage point. SWAP: the commission is maintained at a level that implies a minimum annual effective cost of 5.25 percent. Reserve requirements in foreign currency subject to payment remain at 2.25 percent. The Board will approve the following Monetary Program (July 2006) on the session to be held on July 6, 2006."
Turkiye,2006-06-25,"İbrahim Turhan. Mehmet Yörükoğlu. (Being abroad. Durmuş Yılmaz has chaired the meeting via tele-conference system.) The Monetary Policy Committee has decided to raise short-term interest rates (policy rates) at the CBRT Interbank Money Market and the Istanbul Stock Exchange Repo-Reverse Repo Market as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: The CBRT borrowing interest rate is raised to 17.25 percent from 15 percent, and the CBRT lending interest rate is raised to 20.25 percent from 18 percent. b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Within the framework of the Late Liquidity Window Facility, the CBRT overnight borrowing interest rate applicable between 4:00 p.m.  4:30 p.m. at Interbank Money Market is raised to 13.25 percent from 11 percent. Lending interest rate is raised to 23.25 percent from 21 percent. c) The interest rates applicable to overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealer banks via repo transactions within the framework of open market transactions are raised to 19.25 percent from 17 percent. The Committee perceives that the volatility in international financial markets, which has started in May, basically results from the serious shrinkage in demand for financial assets of developing countries due to portfolio movements triggered by the process of monetary tightening and interest hikes in the developed countries. This demand shrinkage has exerted pressure on both foreign exchange rates and medium and short-term interest rates in developing countries, especially in the last three days, beyond the extent implied by economic fundamentals. Turkey has significantly been influenced by these developments because of the structure of the portfolio held by non-residents. Recent volatility has the potential to affect the expectations and the risk perceptions, and thus the inflation. The Central Bank will not allow this to happen. In this context, the Central Bank will start deposit-buying auctions in order to reduce the excess New Turkish Lira liquidity in overnight money market via open market transactions with the aim of increasing the effectiveness of monetary policy decisions. Governor Yılmaz has submitted the regulation, which has been drawn up for this purpose, to the Committee. Moreover, the liquidity conditions in the foreign exchange markets have been thoroughly assessed and shrinkage in foreign exchange liquidity was identified. Due to the fact that an effective operating foreign exchange market is a precondition for price stability, the Committee has expressed its full support for the effective intervention of the Central Bank Head-Office in order to provide foreign exchange liquidity via its tools and mechanisms. Furthermore. Monetary Policy Committee has reviewed policy rates and has decided to further strengthen monetary tightening in order to improve medium-term inflationary expectations.

Israel,2006-06-26,"26.6.2006 The Bank of Israel leaves the interest rate for July 2006 unchanged at 5.25 percent The interest rate for July 2006 will remain unchanged at 5.25 percent. The decision to leave the interest rate unchanged is consistent with the achievement of price stability within the limits of the inflation target of between 1 percent and 3 percent a year. Background conditions Inflation over the past 12 months reached 3.5 percent--above the upper limit of the price stability target--though inflation is expected to converge to within the target range in the coming months. Inflation expectations for the next 12 months, derived from the capital markets, have fallen slightly and now stand close to the midpoint of the target range, or even a little below it. Forecasters also predict inflation over the next 12 months to be a little below the midpoint of the price stability target range. The Bank of Israel's own econometric models point to inflation over the next 12 months being around the midpoint of the range. At the same time, the capital market and forecasters expect the interest rate to be raised by 50 basis points by the end of the year. According to various indicators, strong growth in the economy continues. The Bank of Israel's Composite State-of-the-Economy index shows a continued acceleration in activity, which tends to reduce the output gap and contribute to inflationary pressures. Wages in the business sector rose by some 7 percent in the 12 months to March 2006. However at this stage these increases have not resulted in rising prices, due to the rapid increase in labor productivity this year apparently as a result of the increased utilization of capital. The exchange rate has been stable since mid-May under the influence of opposing forces from different sectors in the market. Medium- and long-term capital inflows appear likely to continue. In addition, the current accountsurplus of the balance of payments constitutes a basic factor that affectsexchange rate developments over time. The fall in share prices in the lastmonth likely reflects the public's wish to move into low-risk local assetswhich should, in itself, support a fall in domestic market interest rates.Forecasters expect the interest rate in the US to be raised 25 basis points at the end of June. Fiscal discipline is expected to continue and the government deficit target for 2007 has been set at 2 percent of GDP. This policy, which aims for a balanced budget in 2009, strives to reduce the burden of government debt and to maintain fiscal discipline. The reduction of VAT by one percentage point will probably cause, directly, a 0.3- percentage point fall in the price index in the near term, but will add slightly to demand pressures and the price level over the next year and beyond. The main considerations behind the decision Inflation over the past 12 months is expected to return to within the inflation targetrange in the next quarter. Furthermore, inflation in the next 12 months isexpected to lie around the midpoint of the target range, with the markets and forecasters assuming that the interest rate will be raised by some 50 basis points by the end of the year. This development in inflation derives mainly from the continued stability in the foreign currency market. While inflationary pressures continue from several sources, they have on balance been offset by other factors, mainly the exchange rate. The chief inflationary factors stem from the strong growth and the reduction in the output gap, as well as the expected contraction in the interest rate differential between the NIS and the dollar. Rising business sector wages constitute an additional source of inflationary pressure, but these have been offset by the strong growth in labor productivity. The government's commitment to maintaining budgetary discipline which will continue toreduce the debt-to-GDP burden contributes, for its part, to local and foreign investors' positive outlook for the economy. Consideration of these factors led to the decision to leave the interest rate unchanged this month. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor economic developments closely with the intention of achieving the government's price-stability target. Subject to this, the Bank will continue to support the attainment of a range of objectives of macroeconomic policy, particularly with respect to increasing employment and growth. In addition, the Bank will continue to supportfinancial stability. 26.6.2006 The Bank of Israel leaves the interest rate for July 2006 unchanged at 5.25 percent.

Romania,2006-06-27,"In its meeting of June 27, 2006, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided the following:. The NBR Board is restating that it will continue to vigilantly monitor the monetary and macroeconomic trends, both domestically and internationally, standing ready to react to achieve medium-term disinflation objectives. The analysis of recent data shows strong domestic demand dynamics driven by an unsustainable expansion of consumption against the background of a rapid increase in non-government credit, especially leu-denominated loans, and of a widening external imbalance. Leu-denominated household credit rose by 110.5 percent year-on-year in real terms in May. The expected increase in government spending will additionally boost domestic demand pressure both on the external deficit and on inflation, which requires monetary policy tightening. Under these circumstances, the NBR Board has decided to raise the monetary policy rate to 8.75 percent per annum from 8.5 percent. Moreover, in order to slow the persistent and fast-paced non-government credit expansion, especially leu-denominated loans, the NBR Board has decided to increase to 20 percent from 16 percent the minimum reserve requirements on leu-denominated liabilities with maturities of up to two years starting with the July 24 - August 23, 2006 maintenance period. These decisions, together with the maintenance of a firm control of money market liquidity via significant sterilization of excess liquidity, will contribute to monetary policy tightening including through the impact on inflation expectations and help consolidate the disinflation process under which inflation is to converge towards the 4 percent target during 2007. The NBR is reiterating that it will continue to vigilantly monitor macroeconomic and monetary trends and adjust its instruments to counter inflationary pressures. According to the announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled on August 9, 2006, when a new quarterly Inflation Report is to be analyzed."
Philippines,2006-06-28,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the BSP's key policy interest rates at 7.5 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.75 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. The Monetary Board believed that the evidence on current and expected inflation continues to support the maintenance of policy settings in the meantime. Core inflation and other recent data continue to paint a scenario of limited demand-based pressures, while latest BSP forecasts remain suggestive of a deceleration in inflation in the second half, leading to within-target inflation in 2007. In addition, inflation expectations appear to be well-contained, judging from the results of the BSP's surveys among households and private sector analysts. Nevertheless, the balance of risks to the inflation outlook remains tilted toward the upside, linked mainly to movements in oil prices. In the near term, the current high oil price environment is likely to be sustained given a tight demand-supply balance in the international oil market. Along with likely adjustments in domestic power costs, this points to a continuing environment of supply-side pressures. Such a prospect increases the risks to inflation expectations and the likelihood of second-round effects, particularly on wage-setting. Rising global interest rates will be closely monitored, in view of their impact on capital movements and inflation. The Monetary Board remains strongly committed to achieving the inflation target for 2007 and stands ready to act upon evidence of escalating risks to the outlook for inflation and to inflation expectations."
Poland,2006-06-28,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 28 June 2006 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 27-28 June 2006 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e.: reference rate 4.00% on an annual basis; lombard rate 5.50 % on an annual basis; deposit rate 2.50% on an annual basis; rediscount rate 4.25% on an annual basis. Since the Council's meeting in May 2006, the forecasts of inflation in 2006 in the euro area and the United States have been slightly revised upwards, while forecasts for 2007 have remained unchanged. Forecasts of economic growth in both the euro area and the United States for 2006-2007 have not changed, either. In May, the annual growth of consumer prices increased both in the United States (from 3.5% in April to 4.2%) and in the euro area (from 2.4% to 2.5%). Since the May meeting of the Council no change has occurred in crude oil prices, either current or those forecast for 2006-2007. Still, uncertainty persists as to the effect of high oil prices on economic growth and inflation. The May data on output, retail sales and employment in the enterprise sector in Poland proved better than expected and indicated that the high rate of economic growth recorded in Q1 will be also continued in 2006 Q2. The rise in industrial output in May 2006 was markedly higher than expected both by the NBP and external forecasters, reaching 19.1% y/y (compared with 5.7% y/y in April). In seasonally adjusted terms, the growth in industrial output in May amounted to 15.6% y/y (compared to 10.2% y/y in April). Also significantly higher than previously expected proved the surge in construction and assembly output, reaching the level of 13.4% y/y against 4.1% y/y in April, which in seasonally adjusted terms corresponds to 7.0% y/y compared to 4.9% y/y. The rise in retail sales also outstripped the expectations at 13.7% y/y in nominal terms compared with 13.2% y/y in April. Similarly, as in the case of industrial output, this rise in retail sales has been the highest since April 2004, when economic activity rose significantly before Poland's entry to the EU. The growth of household lending has continued at a robust pace: consumer loans registered an increase of 19.2% y/y in May (compared with 17.6% y/y in April), while the growth rate of housing loans stepped up to 48.2% y/y (compared with 41.1% y/y in April). The growth in corporate lending accelerated (from 3.4% y/y in April to 4.1% y/y in May), though it still remains moderate. Since December 2004 the growth of corporate sector employment has been constantly accelerating. In May 2006, employment in enterprises increased by 3.1% y/y (compared to 2.8% y/y in April 2006). 2006 Q1 also brought acceleration in the number of people working in the economy as measured by the Polish Labour Force Survey (BAEL)  3.1% y/y against 2.4% y/y in 2005 Q4. The number of persons working outside private farming is soaring rapidly (a rise of 3.8% in 2006 Q1 compared with 3.5% y/y in 2005 Q4). There was also a significant drop in unemployment figure  in 2006 Q1 the unemployment rate according to the BAEL stood at 16.0% compared with 18.9% a year before. According to labour office data in May 2006 the rate of unemployment slid to 16.5% compared with 18.2% a year before. This rapid growth in the number of working persons and the significant slump in unemployment rate was accompanied by a drop in the economically active figure, which in 2006 Q1 fell in relation to 2005 Q1 by 0.4%. In May 2006, the growth in the corporate sector's wages rose to 5.2% y/y (compared to 4.0% y/y in April). The estimated rate of growth of unit labour costs in the economy (excluding private farming) fell from 4.3% in 2005 Q4 down to 3.3% y/y in 2006 Q1. In turn, the rise in labour productivity in industry in January-May (10.5% y/y) was still higher than wage growth, which has resulted in a decline of unit labour costs in this sector by 5.2% y/y. Since the May meeting of the Council: the Government has adopted a draft act on transferring funds to public health-care institutions to finance a 30-percent pay rise for their employees, an agreement has been reached on bonus payments for miners to be made from profits of coal-mines and further signals have arisen pointing to building wage pressure in some parts of the public sector. All this may lead to further increases in wage pressure. It should be emphasised that an indispensable condition for a sustained acceleration of economic growth which would not pose a threat to the achievement of the inflation target is that the growth in wages does not outpace the growth in labour productivity. This requires strong and productivity-oriented corporate governance in enterprises. The annual growth of consumer prices in May rose to 0.9% (against 0.7% y/y in April). The increase in the annual rate of inflation as compared to April 2006 was driven by the rise in prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages and also in fuel prices. The majority of core inflation indicators edged up as well, even though their levels remained low (in May core inflation indicators ranged between -0.4% y/y and 1.0% y/y). This low level of all core inflation indices suggests that inflationary pressure continues to be low. June did not bring any significant modifications to the inflation expectations of households, which continued at a low level. According to GUS business tendency surveys, the expected prices of enterprises' output have been gradually increasing since the beginning of 2006. In May 2006 the producer prices in industry (PPI) rose by 2.3% y/y as compared to 1.7% y/y in April, i.e. by 0.4% m/m against 1.5% m/m in April, which to a large extent resulted from higher prices of commodities and energy carriers. The rise in annual PPI growth rate occurred even though the effective exchange rate of the zloty proved 4.5% stronger than a year before. The Council maintains its belief that implementing an economic strategy focused on creating conditions which ensure the introduction of the euro at the earliest possible date would be most favourable for Poland and would contribute to higher long-term economic growth. In the Council's assessment, the balance of risks for future inflation may point to an increased probability of inflation running, in monetary policy transmission horizon, at a higher level than it was accounted for in the April projection and at the May meeting of the Monetary Policy Council. A broader assessment of the inflation outlook will be possible in July 2006 after the publication of the inflation projection. The next meeting of the Council will be held on 18 July 2006 and will be devoted to discussing the draft Inflation Report. The Report will be finally approved at the Council's meeting scheduled for 25-26 July 2006."
Egypt,2006-06-29,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release June 29, 2006 The Central Bank of Egypt decided to keep its overnight deposit rate unchanged at 8 percent per annum and the lending rate at 10 percent per annu. In its meeting held on June 29, 2006, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain the overnight deposit and the overnight lending rates at 8 percent and 10 percent, respectivel. This decision was based on an assessment of recent domestic and external economic developments since the last MPC meetin. Domestically inflation rates continued to hold at moderate levels, despite the most recent inch-u. On the other hand, externally, risks to global inflation are still skewed to the upside and uncertainty surrounds the international interest rate outloo. This uncertainty adversely affected emerging markets as risk perceptions started to shif. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments, especially the factors underlying inflation, and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates in either direction, if necessary, to ensure price stability over the medium-ter.

United States,2006-06-29,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5-1/4 percent. Recent indicators suggest that economic growth is moderating from its quite strong pace earlier this year, partly reflecting a gradual cooling of the housing market and the lagged effects of increases in interest rates and energy prices. Readings on core inflation have been elevated in recent months. Ongoing productivity gains have held down the rise in unit labor costs, and inflation expectations remain contained. However, the high levels of resource utilization and of the prices of energy and other commodities have the potential to sustain inflation pressures. Although the moderation in the growth of aggregate demand should help to limit inflation pressures over time, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain. The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information. In any event, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to support the attainment of its objectives. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; Timothy F Geithner. Vice Chairman; Susan S Bies; Jack Guynn; Donald L Kohn; Randall S Kroszner; Jeffrey M Lacker; Sandra Pianalto; Kevin M Warsh; and Janet L Yellen. In a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 25-basis-point increase in the discount rate to 6-1/4 percent. In taking this action, the Board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston. New York. Philadelphia. Cleveland. Richmond. Atlanta. Chicago.

Hungary,2006-07-03,"At its meeting on 3 July 2006, the Monetary Council considered the latest financial market developments. As questions have recently been raised about the inflation target of monetary policy, the Council attaches particular importance to stating explicitly that its medium-term policy objective, set in agreement with the Government, remains to achieve and maintain an inflation rate of 3%, believed to be consistent with price stability. In the Council's view, the set of fiscal measures, announced by the Government in the past few weeks, will make a strong contribution to restoring Hungary's domestic and external balance which has been upset recently. The contractionary effects of these measures on demand are expected to mitigate the medium-term risks to inflation; however, they will put considerable upward pressure on prices in 2007. The Monetary Council clearly aims to prevent a temporary rise in inflation from feeding through to economic agents' inflation expectations and to ensure that inflation reverts to the 3% target in 2008. By raising the base rate gradually, the Monetary Council's intention is to create monetary conditions which will help inflation to return to 3%, a level compatible with price stability."
Euroarea,2006-07-06,"Ladies and gentlemen, let me welcome you to our press conference and report on the outcome of today's meeting of the ECB's Governing Council. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, at today's meeting we decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The information that has become available since our last meeting has confirmed that a further withdrawal of monetary accommodation was warranted to contain upside risks to price stability. Indeed, acting in a timely manner to contain such risks remains essential to ensure that inflation expectations in the euro area are kept solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. Such anchoring of inflation expectations is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area. With key ECB interest rates at still low levels in both nominal and real terms, money and credit growth dynamic, and liquidity ample by all plausible measures, our monetary policy continues to be accommodative. Therefore, if our assumptions and baseline scenario are confirmed, a progressive withdrawal of monetary accommodation remains warranted. Against this background, we will exercise strong vigilance so as to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. Turning first to the economic analysis, the latest data and survey releases remain positive and, in general, have improved further. On balance, this confirms our assessment that economic growth has both regained momentum and become more broadly based and sustained in the first half of 2006. Looking further ahead, the conditions remain in place for continued economic growth at rates around potential, despite possible volatility in the quarterly figures. Global economic activity remains strong, providing support for euro area exports. Investment is expected to pick up, benefiting from an extended period of very favourable financing conditions, balance sheet restructuring and accumulated and ongoing gains in earnings and business efficiency. Consumption growth in the euro area should also strengthen gradually over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, as employment conditions improve further. This broadly favourable outlook for economic activity is also reflected in the June Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections and forecasts by international organisations and private sector institutions. The risks to the outlook for economic growth appear to be balanced over the shorter term, while in the longer term downside risks prevail, relating mainly to potential further oil price rises, a disorderly unwinding of global imbalances and potential pressures for increased protectionism. With respect to price developments, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 2.5% in June 2006, the same rate as in May and compared with 2.4% in April. During the second half of 2006, and on average in 2007, inflation rates are likely to remain above 2%, the precise levels depending on future energy price developments. This assessment is supported by the Eurosystem staff projections and available public and private sector forecasts. While the moderate evolution of labour costs in the euro area is expected to continue in 2007  also reflecting ongoing global competitive pressures, particularly in the manufacturing sector  indirect effects of past oil price increases and already announced changes in indirect taxes are expected to exert a significant upward effect on inflation in the course of next year. Against this background, and also in the context of a more favourable environment for economic activity and employment, it is crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities. Risks to the outlook for price developments remain on the upside and include further increases in oil prices, a stronger pass-through of oil price rises into consumer prices than currently expected, additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes and, more fundamentally, stronger than expected wage and price developments due to second-round effects of past oil price increases. Regarding prospects for inflation over medium to longer horizons, our assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail is confirmed by the monetary analysis. Money and credit growth have strengthened further over recent quarters, with the latest annual growth rate of M3 increasing to 8.9% in May  the highest annual growth of M3 since the start of Stage Three of EMU. The stimulative impact of the low level of interest rates in the euro area remains an important driving factor behind the high trend rate of monetary expansion. On an annual basis, loans to the private sector as a whole have continued to increase at double-digit rates over recent months, with borrowing both by households and by non-financial corporations rising rapidly. Ongoing strong lending activity to households continues to be explained, in particular, by borrowing for house purchases, which has stood at an annual rate of above 12% in recent months. The dynamic growth of money and credit, in an environment of already ample liquidity, points to increased upside risks to price stability at medium to longer horizons. Monetary developments, therefore, require enhanced monitoring, particularly in the light of strong dynamics in housing markets. To sum up, annual inflation rates are projected to remain elevated in 2006 and 2007, with risks to this outlook continuing to be on the upside. Given the dynamism of monetary growth in an environment of already ample liquidity, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium term. It is essential that inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. Accordingly, the Governing Council will exercise strong vigilance so as to ensure that risks to price stability do not materialise, thereby making an ongoing contribution to sustainable economic growth and job creation. In terms of fiscal policy, the overall pace of consolidation is disappointing against the background of the favourable outlook for growth. Consolidation targets continue to be at risk, notably in a number of countries with an excessive deficit. The Governing Council therefore reiterates its position that it is crucial to avoid the mistakes of the past. It also wishes to express its broad agreement with the main fiscal challenges as generally identified by the European Commission. These concern, in particular, the need for a rigorous implementation of the revised Stability and Growth Pact with a view to speeding up fiscal consolidation and improving the outlook for fiscal sustainability. This needs to be underpinned by medium term-oriented structural reform strategies and appropriate national fiscal institutions and procedures. Finally, reliable compilation and timely reporting of government finance statistics remain essential for the European fiscal framework. Meeting these challenges will support confidence in the soundness of public finances and in economic prospects in Europe. As regards structural reforms, enhancing the growth potential of the euro area, increasing job opportunities and strengthening the euro area's ability to cope with the challenges of globalisation are among the most demanding economic policy issues of our time. In order to translate the opportunities brought about by globalisation  in terms of higher living standards  into achievements, the euro area would greatly benefit from more flexible labour and product markets. It would also gain from a more favourable business environment and a fully fledged internal market  including in the services sector  that foster innovation, investment and the creation of new firms. Indeed, implementing the necessary reforms in a decisive manner would both help to reap the benefits that globalisation and the single market offer our citizens and raise the production capacity of our economy."
South Korea,2006-07-07,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (4.25%) for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). In the real economy, exports continue to exhibit steady growth, the recovery of private consumption has been maintained, and facilities investment is still recovering gradually. On the other hand, construction investment shows lackluster movements. Meanwhile, the current account has shifted into surplus due to the widened goods account surplus, and the reduced repatriation of dividends. Both consumer price inflation and core inflation maintain overall stability. Nevertheless, there exist persistently inflationary pressures due to the economic recovery and high oil prices. The upward pace of real estate prices has slowed down. In the financial markets, overall liquidity conditions are favorable and financial institutions' loans continue to increase steadily. Taking the above economic and financial conditions into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (4.25%) for the intermeeting period."
Chile,2006-07-13,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago 13 July 2006 Press Release1 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to raise the monetary policy interest rate by 25 basis points to 5.25% (annual). The external scenario relevant for the Chilean economy remains favorable. The volatility of international financial markets observed in recent weeks has decreased. The copper price has increased again while oil has reached record-high price levels. Domestic demand suggests a moderation in its growth rate for the second quarter, in line with projections in the last Monetary Policy Report. The latest output indicators support the evaluation that April's low growth figures were due mainly to transitory factors. However, available information points a somewhat lower increase in the second semester growth rate than previously considered. Meanwhile, salaried employment continues to increase relatively vigorously, and domestic financial conditions are still expansionary. CPI inflation is in the higher part of the target range, probably postponing its convergence to the center for a few quarters, due to the incidence of higher fuel prices. Measures of core inflation CPIX and CPIX1 (that exclude fuels, perishables and some regulated utilities) are around 3%. Other trend inflation indicators remain stable while the different measures of expected inflation continue to be anchored around 3%. While fuel prices have continued on the rise, other cost pressures are contained. The Board considers that, in the most likely scenario, additional gradual adjustments to the interest rate continue to be necessary to maintain projected annual inflation around 3% in the normal policy horizon. The timing of said adjustments will depend on incoming information, and may be less frequent than they have been in recent quarters. 1 The Spanish original prevails."
Peru,2006-07-15,"Press Release MONETARY PROGRAM FOR JULY 2006 CENTRAL BANK MAINTAINS REFERENCE RATE AT 4.50% The Board of the BCRP acknowledge the following information: The Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) decreased 0.1 percent in June, as a result of which the CPI inflation rate over the last twelve months was 1.8 percent, within the target range (1.5 percent  3.5 percent). On the other hand, core inflation over the last 12 months was 1.3 percent. In the January-May period, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew 6 percent with respect to the same period last year. This evolution reflects the continuous dynamic performance of economic activity, with domestic demand growing at a rate of nearly 8 percent. The average exchange rate decreased 0.5 percent to 3.26 per dollar in June. The real exchange rate fell 1.3 percent (2.9 percent of real depreciation in the last twelve months), an evolution that was associated with the appreciation of other currencies against the US dollar. On June 5, the Central Bank intervened in the exchange market purchasing US$ 2.5 million. The interbank interest rate was 4.53 percent in June, close to the reference level (4.5 percent), while the 90-day corporate prime rate for loans in soles fell from 6.0 percent to 5.8 percent between May and June. The country risk indicator by the end of June was 169 bps, a level similar to that recorded by the close of May (168 bps). On the other hand, the 15-year maturity sovereign bond yield decreased from 8.26 to 8.14 percent. A greater volatility was recorded in the international markets of capitals and commodities during this month, although it was offset following a statement issued by the United States Federal Reserve. The Board of the Central Bank approved to maintain the interbank reference interest rate at 4.50 percent. This decision has been taken taking into account that: Between December 2005 and May 2006, as a result of a partial withdrawal of monetary stimulation, the reference interest rate rose by 150 basis points. The Central Bank will continue to assess all relevant macroeconomic information to guarantee that the necessary measures are in place to maintain inflation within the target range. Forecasts on the dynamism of economic activity in the period 2006- 2007 (around 5.5 percent) are consistent with the inflation target (from 1.5 to 3.5 percent). The Board approved the following interest rates for the BCRP operations: For direct repo and rediscount operations, the rate continues to be 5.25 percent. For overnight deposits, the rate continues to be 4.00 percent. The interest rates for the following operations in dollars between the Central Bank and the Financial system are established as follows: Rediscount operations: 1-month LIBOR plus one percent. Overnight deposits: overnight LIBOR minus 3/8 of a percentage point. Swap: the commission continues to be at a level that implies a minimum annual effective cost of 5.25 percent. Reserve requirements in foreign deposits subject to payment: the rate is increased to 2.5 percent. The Board will approve the following Monetary Program (for the month of August 2006) on the session to be held on August 3, 2006."
Thailand,2006-07-19,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 19 July 2006 Ms. Atchana Waiquamdee. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand, announces that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance. The main issues discussed are as follows. From the latest data, the MPC assessed that economic growth was slowing down in the second quarter of 2006. Looking ahead, in light of many uncertainties including the oil prices, there is a risk that the economy, especially in private investment demand, may continue to slow down for some time. Pressure on economic stability remains with the oil prices edging up further. The MPC thus viewed that this year's headline inflation will moderate at a pace slower than previously projected. However softening economic growth will help to relieve pressure on core inflation, which is still expected to stay within the target range. Judging that the current level of the policy interest rate is appropriate in that it facilitates the business and household sectors to adjust at a gradual pace, the MPC decided to maintain the 14-day repurchase rate at 500 per cent per annum. Under the present circumstance, with volatile movements of domestic and external factors including the oil prices, the MPC will continue to monitor inflation and growth indicators closely for future policy deliberation."
Turkiye,2006-07-20,"The Monetary Policy Committee (Committee) has decided to increase short- term interest rates (policy rates) in the Inter-bank Money Market and the Istanbul Stock Exchange Repo-Reverse Repo Market as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: The overnight borrowing interest rate is increased to 17.50 percent from 17.25 percent, and the overnight lending interest rate is increased to 22.50 percent from 22.25 percent. b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Within the framework of the Late Liquidity Window Facility, the overnight borrowing interest rate valid between 4:00 p.m.  4:30 p.m. in the Inter-bank Money Market is increased to 13.50 percent from 13.25 percent while the lending interest rate is increased to 25.50 percent from 25.25 percent. c) The interest rates on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealer banks via repo transactions within the framework of open market transactions are increased to 21.50 percent from 21.25 percent. The Committee perceives that the recent rise in inflation will continue in July due to the lagged exchange rate pass-through. The measures taken in June by the Central Bank is expected to ease the pressures on inflation in the forthcoming period. However, there is still need to remain cautious for inflation because oil and other commodity prices are still increasing and the expectations are not yet in line with the medium-term targets. Taken all these factors into account, the Committee decided to move toward a measured tightening of monetary policy in order to achieve the 2007 year-end inflation target. In light of the existing risks, the Committee considers that the cautious stance is more likely to continue for some time. Under a cautious stance, the downward trend in inflation is expected to be significant in the second quarter of 2007. In the forthcoming period, the developments in the international liquidity conditions, the course of domestic demand, pricing behavior and the public sector income policy will be monitored closely. It should be emphasized that any new data or information associated with the inflation outlook will potentially lead the Monetary Policy Committee to revise its future stance. A brief summary of the assessments of the Monetary Policy Committee will be released within five working days. Following that, the Inflation Report assessing the reflections of recent economic developments on the medium-term inflation outlook will be released on 28 July 2006. The Monetary Policy Committee (Committee) has decided to increase short- term interest rates (policy rates) in the Inter-bank Money Market and the Istanbul Stock Exchange Repo-Reverse Repo Market as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: The overnight borrowing interest rate is increased to 17.50 percent from 17.25 percent, and the overnight lending interest rate is increased to 22.50 percent from 22.25 percent. b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Within the framework of the Late Liquidity Window Facility, the overnight borrowing interest rate valid between 4:00 p.m.  4:30 p.m. in the Inter-bank Money Market is increased to 13.50 percent from 13.25 percent while the lending interest rate is increased to 25.50 percent from 25.25 percent. c) The interest rates on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealer banks via repo transactions within the framework of open market transactions are increased to 21.50 percent from 21.25 percent.

Hungary,2006-07-24,"1. At its meeting on 24 July 2006, the Monetary Council considered the latest economic and financial developments and voted to increase the central bank base rate by 50 basis points, from 6.25% to 6.75%, with effect from 25 July 2006. In the Council's judgement, meeting the 3% medium-term inflation target, set jointly with the Government, requires a tighter policy stance than currently. The Council's objective is therefore to create firmer monetary conditions, by raising the Bank's key policy rate in a series of steps. Trend inflation, better capturing the less volatile components of inflation developments, and virtually all the important components of core inflation have risen in recent months. This points to a sustained rise in inflation. The Council expects inflation to rise significantly throughout 2007. Inflation may turn out to be above the 3% target in 2008, the year relevant for monetary policy, if monetary conditions are to remain unchanged. In addition to trend inflation developments, several measures contained in the Government's budgetary adjustment programme are likely to provide a one-off boost to prices; and the forint exchange rate, which has now been weaker for a longer period, also poses upside risks to inflation over the period ahead. By tightening its monetary policy stance, the Council intends to prevent the upward effects on domestic prices of the Government's crucially important measures to restore external and domestic equilibrium from feeding through to economic agents' expectations, and thus from causing sustained inflationary pressures. The Monetary Council's decision to raise the central bank base rate also took into account the fact that, in recent months, the environment for investments had turned less favourable worldwide and in the region, and also that investors believed that the risks associated with investments into Central and Eastern Europe had increased, irrespective of Hungarian economic fundamentals."
Israel,2006-07-24,"24.7.2006 The Bank of Israel raises the interest rate for August 2006 by 25 basis pointsto 5.5 percent The interest rate for August 2006 will rise by 25 basis points to 5.5 percent. This decision is designed to ensure that inflation will be within the limits of the inflation target of between 1 percent and 3 percent a year.Background conditions In the first half of 2006 the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 1.6 percent, above the upper limit of the inflation target range. The rate of inflation over the last twelve months was 3.5 percent, above the upper limit ofthe target range, but it is expected to return to within the range next month. Inflation expectations for the next twelve months derived from the capital markets remained stable, close to the midpoint of the target range, and in July averaged 1.7 percent. Economic forecasters' assessments of inflation over the next twelve months, averaging 2.3 percent, are close to the midpoint of the range, after rising by 0.6 of a percentage point due tothe change in the security situation. The rise in the expected rate of inflation stems from heightened uncertainty, which raises the economy's risk premium and acts against the forces tending to strengthen the sheqel. As a result of the tension created by the security situation, the economic forecasters also raised their assessments regarding the change in the interest rate, and estimate that the August interest rate will be raised. The capital market (the makam curve) also shows the expectation of a rise in the interest rate. The data reflecting the state of the economy prior to the hostilities onIsrael's northern border indicated continued rapid economic growth. According to the most recent National Accounts data. GDP rose at an annual rate of 6 percent in the first quarter of 2006, with domestic demand rising at a more rapid rate. According to the Bank of Israel's Companies Survey, which was carried out prior to the outbreak of the fighting in the North, economic activity continued expanding in the second quarter, and companies expected, with a high degree of probability, that it would carry on increasing in the third quarter. The Composite State-of-the-Economy indexcontinued to rise at a fast pace, rising by 0.7 percent in June. The conflict in the North makes it necessary to reassess the expected level of activity in the economy. The degree of real damage to economic activity depends on how long the current hostilities will continue and on their outcome, and the results are felt both on the supply side, the reduction ofproduction capacity, and on the demand side, the lowering of private sector demand. A calculation performed in the Bank of Israel yields the result that, assuming a quick end to the fighting, the damage caused to economic activity will remain relatively low, up to one percent of GDP. A major element in this calculation is the harm caused to tourism. Despite the escalation of the fighting, exchange-rate fluctuations were relatively moderate: in the first days of the hostilities in the North the exchange rate rose from 4.40 to 4.52 sheqel to the dollar, but then the NISstrengthened again. In the light of the security situation a rise in the degree of uncertainty was evident in the foreign currency market, and this was reflected by a rise in implied volatility--the probability of depreciation increased somewhat, while the probability of appreciation remained high. The Bank of Israel projects that the economy will continueto enjoy a surplus in the current account of the balance of payment. Financial market data indicate that central banks are expected to continue monetary tightening, particularly in Europe. However, in the last few days the probability of further tightening in the US at the beginning of August declined. Prior to the fighting in the North, it was expected that the government budget deficit in 2006 would not exceed one percent of GDP. The hostilitiesincrease certain categories of government expenditure (defense expenditureand expenditure not covered by the damages fund) and reduce tax revenues. Nevertheless, the advantageous starting point from the aspect of the government budget will enable the budget targets set for 2006 to be met. Fiscal discipline is expected to continue, with adherence to the ceiling governmentdeficit for 2007 of 2 percent of GDP. The government decided to maintain the maximum increase in expenditure (1.7 percent, from 2007), and to meet new expenditures from within the budget framework by changes in spending priorities. This policy will enable the government debt burden to be reduced further. The main considerations behind the decision Inflation in the first half of 2006 was close to the upper limit of the target price-stability range, while viewed over the previous twelve months inflation was above the upper limit of the range. The main forces affecting inflation in the first half of the year--in particular the rise in energy prices and in prices of other imports, and the contraction of the output gap--continue to exert inflationary pressures. These forceswere partly offset in the second quarter of 2006 by the strengthening of the sheqel. In the light of the changed security situation. Israel's economic risk assessment increased. The rise in risk serves to reduce capital inflows and acts against the forces tending to strengthen the sheqel. This rise in risk, including inflation risk, demands a measure of monetary tightening, in order to maintain price stability and to bolster financial stability. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor economic developments closely with the intention of achieving the price-stability target. Subject to this, the Bank will continue to support the attainment of a range of objectives of macroeconomic policy, particularly with respect to increasing employment and growth. In addition, the Bank will continue to support financial stability. 24.7.2006 The Bank of Israel raises the interest rate for August 2006 by 25 basis pointsto 5.5 percent. The Bank of Israel raises the interest rate for August 2006 by 25 basis pointsto 5.5 percent. The interest rate for August 2006 will rise by 25 basis points to 5.5 percent.

India,2006-07-25,"RBI Governor presented the First Quarter Review of Annual Statement on Monetary Policy for the Year 2006-07 today. Highlights Reverse Repo Rate increased to 6.0 per cent and Repo Rate to 7.0 per cent. Bank Rate and Cash Reserve Ratio kept unchanged. GDP growth projection for 2006-07 retained at 7.5-8.0 per cent. Containing inflation within 5.0-5.5 per cent for 2006-07 warrants appropriate priority in policy responses. Money supply, deposit and credit growth above the indicative projections, warranting caution. Appropriate liquidity to be maintained to meet legitimate credit requirements, consistent with price and financial stability. Barring the emergence of any adverse and unexpected developments in various sectors of the economy and keeping in view the current assessment of the economy including the outlook for inflation, the overall stance of monetary policy in the period ahead will be: To ensure a monetary and interest rate environment that enables continuation of the growth momentum while emphasising price stability with a view to anchoring inflation expectations. To reinforce the focus on credit quality and financial market conditions to support export and investment demand in the economy for maintaining macroeconomic and, in particular, financial stability. To consider measures as appropriate to the evolving global and domestic circumstances impinging on inflation expectations and the growth momentum.2006-07. The Review consists of three sections: I. Assessment of Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments; II. Stance of Monetary Policy; and III. Monetary Measures. Domestic Developments Real GDP growth during January-March 2006 is placed at 9.3 per cent as against 8.6 per cent in the corresponding quarter a year ago and real GDP growth for the year 2005-06 is revised to 8.4 per cent from 8.1 per cent. Inflation, measured by variations in the wholesale price index (WPI) on a year- on-year basis, rose from 4.1 per cent at end-March 2006 to 4.7 per cent as on July 8, 2006. The average international price of the Indian crude basket increased from US $ 60.1 per barrel in January-March, 2006 to US $ 67.3 per barrel in April-June, 2006 and further to US $ 71.4 per barrel in July 2006 (up to July 21). During 2006-07 so far, there has been a reversal of the phenomenon of consumer prices lagging wholesale prices, indicative of the increase in food prices which constitute a relatively larger share in the consumer price basket. On a year-on-year basis, money supply (M ) growth at 18.8 per cent by July 3 7, 2006 was higher than 13.8 per cent, net of conversion, a year ago and above the projected trajectory of 15.0 per cent indicated in the Annual Policy Statement for 2006-07. The year-on-year increase in aggregate deposits at 20.7 per cent (Rs.3,72,977 crore) was significantly higher than 14.9 per cent (Rs.2,34,020 crore), net of conversion, a year ago. On a year-on-year basis, the increase in non-food bank credit was 32.9 per cent (Rs.3,71,993 crore) on top of an increase of 31.0 per cent (Rs.2,60,164 crore), net of conversion of a non-bank into a bank, a year ago. The overhang of liquidity in the system, as reflected in the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF), the market stabilisation scheme (MSS) and the Central Government's cash balances with the Reserve Bank which, put together, averaged Rs.65,174 crore during January-March, 2006 stood at Rs.91,231 crore as on July 20, 2006. Reflecting the easy conditions at the short end of the market spectrum, interest rates in the call, market repo and collateralised borrowing and lending obligations (CBLO) segments of the money market eased while gilt prices declined in the secondary market for government securities. Banks increased their deposit rates by about 25-100 basis points across various maturities between March 2006 and July 2006. A majority of public sector banks adjusted their deposit rates up to three year maturity upwards by 25 to 50 basis points, while keeping the range of 6.00-7.25 per cent unchanged for deposits of over three years over the same period. The adjustments in deposit rates made by some private sector and foreign banks were somewhat higher, up to 100 basis points, particularly for deposit rates of over one year maturity. Exclusive of LAF operations, banks' investments in Government and other approved securities declined by Rs.1,328 crore during 2006-07 up to July 7, as compared with an increase of Rs.12,397 crore a year ago. 233 crore (Rs.60,282 crore a year ago) during 2006-07 so far (up to July 17, 2006) constituted 38.2 per cent of the budget estimates while net market borrowings at Rs.34,572 crore (Rs.39,234 crore a year ago) constituted 30.4 per cent of the budget estimates. External Developments Export growth in US dollar terms moderated to 16.9 per cent during April- June, 2006 from 35.4 per cent a year ago. Merchandise import also decelerated to 17.7 per cent from 45.4 per cent. While petroleum, oil and lubricants (POL) import growth rose sharply to 39.0 per cent from 31.0 per cent reflecting the steep rise in international crude oil prices, non-oil imports posted a relatively modest growth of 9.6 per cent as compared with 51.7 per cent a year ago. India's foreign exchange reserves increased by US $ 11.0 billion over their end-March, 2006 level to US $ 162.7 billion as on July 14, 2006. The exchange rate of the rupee depreciated by 4.7 per cent against the US dollar, by 8.4 per cent against euro, by 10.2 per cent against pound sterling and by 5.1 per cent against Japanese yen during 2006-07 so far (up to July 21, 2006). Orderly conditions have prevailed in the domestic foreign exchange market during the period. Global Developments According to the World Economic Outlook of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) released in April 2006, global growth is expected to pick up from 4.8 per cent in 2005 to 4.9 per cent in 2006 before easing to 4.7 per cent in 2007. In major industrial countries, inflation appears to be on the upswing mainly on account of oil price increases. In addition, risks loom large in the form of lagged second order effects of oil price increases, geopolitical tensions, the probability of disruptive adjustment of current account imbalances and the cooling global housing market. A large number of central banks have raised their official interest rates, inter alia: the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of Canada, the Reserve Bank of Australia, the People's Bank of China, the Bank of Korea and the Banco Central de Chile. Some central banks have kept their policy rates steady as for instance, the Bank of England, the Bank Negara Malaysia, the Bank of Thailand and the Monetary Authority of Singapore. A few central banks have also eased monetary policy such as the Banco de Mexico, the Bank Indonesia and the Banco Central do Brasil. Global imbalances, emanating mainly from the twin deficits of the US and reflected in misalignment of major currencies, have continued to widen during 2006 in an environment of rising interest rates worldwide and prospects of contraction of liquidity in the global financial markets. Overall Assessment There are several positive factors in domestic developments during 2006-07 so far, inter alia: reasonably robust corporate performance, pick-up in investment activity, strong demand for bank credit, growth in new order books, increase in capacity utilization, ample liquidity, stabilisation of inflation since mid-June and strong export growth. 345 basis points to 6.00 per cent and 7.00 per cent, respectively. CRR kept unchanged at 5.0 per cent. The Mid-term Review of the Annual Policy Statement will be undertaken on October 31, 2006 instead of October 17, 2006 and the Third Quarter Review on January 30, 2007 instead of January 23, 2007 as indicated in the Annual Policy Statement of April 2006.

Poland,2006-07-26,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 26 July 2006 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 25-26 July 2006 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e.: (cid:131) reference rate 4.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate 5.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate 2.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate 4.25% on an annual basis. Since the Council's meeting in June 2006, the forecasts of inflation and economic growth for 2006-2007 in the euro area have been slightly revised upwards. In the United States the inflation forecasts for 2006 have been slightly revised upwards, while the economic growth forecasts for 2007 have been revised downwards. In June, the annual growth of consumer prices remained at an increased level both in the euro area (2.5% in June and May) and in the United States (4.3% against 4.2% in May). Since the June meeting of the Council current crude oil price has increased by USD 4.9 (i.e. by 7%), while the price of this commodity forecast for 2006-2007 has remained largely unchanged. The June data on industrial output, construction and assembly output and retail sales in Poland indicate a continuing fast economic growth in 2006 Q2, close to that recorded in 2006 Q1. The rise in industrial output in June 2006 was higher than expected both by the NBP and external forecasters, reaching 12.4% y/y (compared with 19.1% y/y in May). In seasonally adjusted terms, the growth in industrial output in June amounted to 13.8% y/y (compared to 15.6% y/y in May). Also significantly higher than expected proved the increase in construction and assembly output, reaching 15.7% y/y against 13.4% y/y in May, which in seasonally adjusted terms corresponds to 10.8% y/y, compared to 7.0% y/y. Retail sales saw a continued high increase (10.7% y/y in nominal terms as compared to 13.7% y/y in May). The growth of household lending has continued at a robust pace: the growth in consumer loans in June accelerated to 22.6% y/y (as compared with 19.2% y/y in May), while the growth rate of housing loans stepped up to 53.0% y/y (as compared with 48.2% y/y in May), which might have been related to the announced introduction of more stringent criteria of granting foreign currency loans. Corporate lending growth saw an increase (from 4.1% y/y in May to 5.1% y/y in June), though it remains moderate. The fast economic growth increases the demand for labour. Since December 2004 the growth of corporate sector employment has been constantly accelerating. According to labour office data, in June 2006 the registered unemployment rate slid to 16.0% compared with 18.0% a year before. In June 2006, the growth in the corporate sector's nominal wages amounted to 4.5% y/y (compared to 5.2% y/y in May). According to NBP estimates after adjustment for the impact of shifts in one-off components of wages in certain sections, the wage growth in enterprises equalled 4.9% y/y. The signals of wage pressure in the public sector persist. It should be emphasised that a necessary condition for a sustained acceleration of economic growth which would not pose a threat to the achievement of the inflation target is that the growth in wages does not outpace the growth in labour productivity. This requires strong and productivity-oriented corporate governance in enterprises. The annual growth of consumer prices in June was slightly below the expectations of external forecasters and the NBP, and reached 0.8% (against 0.9% y/y in May). This slight decrease in the annual inflation rate in relation to May 2006 was mainly driven by the fall in prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages, mainly fruit and vegetable prices. Core inflation indicators remained low (in June core inflation indicators ranged between -0.5% y/y and 1.0% y/y). The low level of all core inflation indices indicates that inflationary pressure remains contained. July brought a slight increase of the inflation expectations of households (to 0.8% y/y from 0.6% y/y in June). According to GUS business tendency surveys, the expected prices of industrial and construction & assembly output have been gradually increasing since the beginning of 2006. In June 2006 the growth in producer prices in industry (PPI) saw a marked acceleration to 2.8% y/y from 2.3% y/y in May, i.e. 0.8% m/m against 0.4% m/m in May, which resulted to a large extent from increased growth of producer prices in manufacturing. The rise in annual growth of PPI occurred despite the 1.1% (y/y) stronger effective exchange rate of the zloty. The inflation and GDP projections, which are presented in Inflation Reports, are one of the inputs to the monetary policy decisions. According to the NBP staff projection of inflation and GDP, which will be presented in the July Inflation Report, with 50% probability the annual GDP growth will be in the range of 4.7-5.3% in 2006 (against 3.9-5.0% in the April projection); 3.6-5.9% in 2007 (against 3.4-5.8%) and 4.0- 6.6% in 2008 (against 3.5-6.2%). The July inflation projection indicates that inflation will be higher throughout the whole projection horizon than was expected in the April Report. With the assumption of unchanged interest rates, with 50% probability inflation will be within the range of 1.0-1.9% in 2006 Q4 (against 0.5-2.0% in the April projection), 1.5-3.5% in 2007 Q4 (against 1.3-3.4%) and 1.7%-4.3% in 2008 Q4 (against 1.2-3.9%). It should be emphasised that, in the opinion of the authors of the projection, the inflation projection presented in the Report does not account for all sources of uncertainty. This primarily applies to the scale of the future impact of globalisation on inflation, the impact of global imbalances on the world economic growth, the growth of workforce, the effect of drought in Poland on food prices, the shape of economic policy in the coming years, in particular, the effect of increased wage pressure on public finance in Poland and the exchange rate developments. Besides, the projection was prepared on the basis of data available until 23 June 2006 and thus does not account for crude oil prices, which are higher than those assumed in the projection, higher estimates of GDP in 2006 Q2 and slightly lower than forecast CPI in 2006 Q2. However, net inflation in 2006 Q2 was consistent with the July projection. Having considered the latest data and the July inflation projection, the Council confirms the view expressed at its meeting in June that the probability of inflation running, in the monetary policy transmission horizon, above the level assessed in the April projection has increased. In the Council's opinion, the current fast economic growth creates favourable conditions for reducing the public finance imbalance, which would reinforce the long-term economic growth at a -2 - high level. The Council maintains its view that implementing an economic strategy focused on creating conditions which ensure the introduction of the euro at the earliest possible date would be most favourable for Poland and would contribute to higher long-term economic growth. The next meeting of the Council will be held on 29-30 August 2006."
Malaysia,2006-07-28,"At its meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to leave the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) unchanged at 3.50 percent. The Malaysian economy has performed well during the first half of 2006, sustained by robust domestic demand and strong global economic growth. While domestic conditions remain favourable, uncertainties have emerged in the external environment arising from sustained high energy prices, geopolitical risks and possible moderation of global growth. Recent statistics indicate that domestic inflation has peaked, and is expected to be lower for the remaining part of the year. At this stage, there are also no signs of second round effects and undue wage pressures. However, cost-driven pressures on prices remain, arising from high commodity and oil prices. Monetary policy will continue to balance the risks to inflation and growth. The future stance of monetary policy would therefore depend on Bank Negara Malaysia's assessment of new information regarding the domestic and international environment and their implications on the Malaysian economy. Bank Negara Malaysia 28 July 2006."
Euroarea,2006-08-03,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to this press conference to report on the outcome of today's meeting of the Governing Council. At today's meeting, we decided to increase the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. This decision reflects the upside risks to price stability over the medium term that we have identified through both our economic and monetary analyses. It will contribute to ensuring that medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. As stressed on previous occasions, such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. Also after today's increase, the key ECB interest rates remain low in both real and nominal terms, money and credit growth remain strong, and liquidity in the euro area is ample by all plausible measures. If our assumptions and baseline scenario are confirmed, a progressive withdrawal of monetary accommodation will be warranted. Against this background, we will continue to monitor very closely all developments so as to ensure price stability over the medium and longer term. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. The main indicators of economic activity that have become available since the July press conference have tended to confirm our baseline scenario for economic growth in the euro area. Eurostat's second release verified that, in the first quarter of 2006, real GDP grew by 0.6% on a quarter-on-quarter basis. Economic activity is also becoming more broadly based on domestic demand. Moreover, the currently available information on economic activity in the second quarter  such as various confidence surveys and monthly indicators  supports the view that economic growth has continued at a sustained pace. The survey information so far available for the third quarter is also in line with our baseline scenario. Looking further ahead, the conditions are in place for real GDP in the euro area to grow at around its potential rate, as projected by Eurosystem staff in June. Growth in the economies of the euro area's main trading partners is providing ongoing support for euro area exports. Investment growth is expected to continue benefiting from favourable financing conditions, corporate balance sheet restructuring, and improvements in earnings and business efficiency. Consumption growth should continue to strengthen gradually over time, in line with developments in employment growth and hence real disposable income. This generally favourable outlook for economic activity in the euro area is also reflected in forecasts by international organisations and private sector institutions. Risks to the outlook for economic growth are broadly balanced over the shorter term, although recent geopolitical tensions and their impact on markets are a timely reminder of the uncertainties that we face. Medium to longer-term risks lie on the downside and relate in particular to the potential for further oil price rises, a disorderly unwinding of global imbalances and protectionist pressures, especially after the suspension of the Doha Round of trade talks. Turning to price developments, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 2.5% in July 2006, unchanged from June and May. In the second half of 2006 and on average in 2007, inflation rates are likely to remain above 2%, the precise levels depending very much on future energy price developments. While the moderate evolution of labour costs in the euro area is expected to continue in 2007  also reflecting ongoing global competitive pressures, particularly in the manufacturing sector  indirect effects of past oil price increases and already announced changes in indirect taxes are expected to exert a significant upward effect on inflation in the course of next year. Against this background, it is crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities. Risks to the outlook for price developments have augmented and include further increases in oil prices, a stronger pass-through of past oil price rises into consumer prices than currently anticipated, additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, and  more fundamentally  stronger than expected wage and price developments owing to second-round effects of past oil price increases at a time of gradually improving labour markets. Regarding prospects for inflation over medium to longer horizons, our assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail is confirmed by the monetary analysis. While the data for June 2006 show some moderation in the annual growth rate of M3, these latest developments remain consistent with a persistent upward trend in the underlying rate of monetary expansion since mid-2004. The stimulative impact of the low level of interest rates in the euro area has been an important factor behind the tendency for money and credit growth to strengthen over recent quarters. Looking at the counterparts of M3, the expansion of credit to the private sector remains the main driver of monetary dynamics. On an annual basis, loans to the private sector as a whole have continued to increase at double-digit rates over recent months, with borrowing both by households and by non-financial corporations rising rapidly. Ongoing strong lending to households continues to be explained, in particular, by borrowing for house purchases. The dynamic growth of money and credit, in an environment of already ample liquidity, points to increased upside risks to price stability at medium to longer horizons. Monetary developments therefore require careful monitoring, particularly in the light of strong dynamics in housing markets. To sum up, annual inflation rates are expected to remain elevated, at above 2% on average, in 2006 and 2007, with risks to this outlook on the upside. Given strong monetary and credit growth in a context of ample liquidity, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium term. A further adjustment of interest rates was therefore warranted. By acting today in a timely fashion, the Governing Council is helping to anchor medium and long-term inflation expectations at levels consistent with price stability, thereby making an ongoing contribution to sustainable economic growth and job creation. Looking ahead, given that our monetary policy continues to be accommodative, a progressive withdrawal of monetary accommodation will be warranted if our assumptions and baseline scenario are confirmed. The Governing Council will continue to monitor very closely all developments so as to ensure that risks to price stability do not materialise. Concerning fiscal policies, given the outlook for economic growth, it is of crucial importance that euro area governments avoid pro-cyclical policies and step up the pace of fiscal consolidation. As budgetary targets for the current year are not particularly ambitious, a rigorous implementation of plans on the expenditure side is especially warranted, and any additional windfall revenues are best used for deficit reduction. Beyond the implementation of such prudent policies in the remainder of this year, the medium-term focus of fiscal policies should be on correcting the underlying sources of imbalances in public finances. Euro area governments, many of which are now finalising their budget plans for 2007, should take full advantage of the economic environment to bring forward the structural adjustment necessary for the durable correction of excessive deficits, so as to reach their medium-term budgetary objectives at an early stage and thereby prepare public finances for the acute demographic challenges they must cope with. As regards structural reforms, it is essential, for Europe's future, to ensure that it has a fully operational Internal Market, allowing a free flow of labour and capital and free trade in goods and services. Removing the remaining barriers within the EU will be a powerful means to promote the efficient allocation of factors of production as well as deeper economic and financial integration. This in turn would allow the EU to realise its substantial potential for stronger output and employment growth and to increase its resilience to shocks. Exploiting the opportunities of the Single Market will help to safeguard the prosperity of the citizens of Europe. For those Member States which have fulfilled the convergence criteria laid down by the Treaty and participate in the euro area, the considerable benefits of the Internal Market are further enhanced by the single currency, which offers them a credible framework for monetary policy and price stability in an environment characterised by the absence of exchange rate uncertainty within the euro area, low long-term interest rates, price and cost transparency, reduced transaction and information costs and stronger insurance against economic and financial instability. In this respect, the further enlargement of the euro area on 1 January 2007 with the entry of Slovenia will be a new historical landmark. In order to fully reap the advantages of the euro and to allow adjustment mechanisms to operate efficiently within the enlarged currency area, it will be necessary to fully integrate Slovenia into Economic and Monetary Union, which calls for all remaining barriers to be removed, including those related to labour mobility. Indeed, open, competitive and flexible markets are of particular importance for the functioning of the euro area economy and the smooth conduct of the single monetary policy. For its part, the Governing Council has undertaken all the necessary preparations to make Banka Slovenije an integral part of the Eurosystem."
South Africa,2006-08-03,"Domestic inflation is on an upward trend, with food price inflation adding to the pressures emanating from persistent petrol price increases. Household consumption spending has continued to grow at a strong pace and consumer confidence remains high. This has been reflected in strong credit extension and preliminary indications are that the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments might have remained high in the second quarter. These factors, combined with a general depreciation of the rand, have resulted in a further deterioration in the inflation outlook. In the recent past there has been considerable volatility in international financial markets in general, and in emerging markets in particular. These developments have centered around the uncertainty about the future path of interest rates globally. However, the latest developments appear to suggest that some calm may be returning to the financial markets, as evidenced by the narrowing spreads on emerging market debt. Inflation as measured by the consumer price index for metropolitan and other urban areas excluding the interest cost on mortgage bonds (CPIX) increased at a year-on-year rate of 4,8 per cent in June, compared to 3,7 per cent in April and 4,2 per cent in May. This upward trend is not only attributable to petrol price increases. If petrol prices were excluded. CPIX would have measured 3,5 per cent and 3,8 per cent in May and June respectively. This latter figure is the highest rate of increase of this measure since June 2004. Food price inflation has also made a significant contribution to this upward trend. Prices of petrol and diesel increased at year-on-year rates of 13,2 per cent and 22,7 per cent in May and June respectively. Food price inflation has been increasing steadily since late 2005. In November last year, year-on-year food price increases measured 2,0 per cent. In each subsequent month food price inflation increased, and measured 7,2 per cent in June. Significant increases in the prices of meat, fish and vegetables have been the major contributors to this trend. Grain product prices have not fully responded to the sizable increase in maize prices since the latter part of last year although some upward pressure is evident. In June, the grain products inflation component of CPIX measured 3,8 per cent compared to 0,2 per cent in January 2006. Most of the other CPIX categories continue to exhibit low rates of price increases, while the categories of clothing and footwear and furniture and equipment have shown persistent price declines. Services price inflation has declined continuously in the past few months and measured 3,3 per cent year-on-year in June 2006. Administered prices excluding petrol are predominantly services and therefore have exhibited a similar trend but at marginally lower rates of increase. Indications of possible consumer price pressures come from production price inflation which increased at a year-on-year rate of 7,6 per cent in June, compared to 5,5 per cent and 6,3 per cent in April and May respectively. Although food and energy were important drivers of these increases, the pressure was more broad-based. If food and energy were excluded, production price inflation would have measured 4,5 per cent in June, compared to 2,9 per cent in April, and 3,6 per cent in May of this year. Some of the upward pressure in June can be attributed to the change to winter electricity tariffs. Since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the inflation forecast of the Bank has deteriorated moderately. The most recent central forecast of the Bank projects inflation to peak above the 6 per cent level and to remain outside the target range for the first two quarters of 2007. Thereafter, based on the current assumptions. CPIX inflation is projected to decline slowly to reach a level marginally above 5 per cent by the end of 2008. It seems to us that the use of the forecast in monetary policy decisions needs to be further explained. The MPC does not use the forecast in a mechanical way as the basis for policy making. The forecast provides a broad guide to possible inflation outcomes, but the Committee relies on its judgement about possible future developments. No model can adequately capture all the relevant dynamic processes in any economy. It is worth emphasising that the model outcomes are also dependent on the assumptions that are fed into it. Furthermore, the MPC takes a view of the risks to the forecast. The exchange rate has exhibited considerable volatility, and fluctuated between levels of around R6,70 and R7,50 to the US dollar since the June MPC meeting. The behaviour of the rand was initially related to increased global risk aversion, combined with concerns relating to domestic balance of payments imbalances. More recently, expectations that the monetary policy tightening cycle globally may be at or near its peak have prompted an appreciation of the rand to current levels of around R6,90. On a trade-weighted basis, the rand has depreciated by about 14 per cent since the beginning of the year, and by 2,5 per cent since the previous MPC meeting. Some pass-through from the exchange rate to prices can be expected, particularly to domestic petrol prices, which have increased by a cumulative R0,56 in July and August. Exchange rate movements accounted for about R0,44 of this adjustment. The prospects for the rand going forward, and the associated risks to inflation, depend to some extent on the global interest rate trend. In previous statements the MPC expressed concerns about the expanding deficit on the current account of the balance of payments. Current account deficits are a reflection of higher domestic expenditure and are not in themselves inflationary. There is however a possible risk to the exchange rate if the deficits are perceived to be unsustainable, particularly if the deficits are reflecting higher consumption expenditure. The recent exchange rate reaction to the higher deficit is indicative of this, but it is also part of the macroeconomic adjustment process. In order for the exchange rate to play its part in this process, it is important that the exchange rate changes are not simply offset by higher inflation. The current account deficit is expected to be adequately financed through capital inflows, although the focus of non-residents has shifted from the equity market towards the domestic bond market. In July, non-residents became net sellers of shares to the value of R2 billion, whilst non-resident net bond purchases totalled R11,8 billion in the same month, compared to net sales of R1,3 billion in June. Household consumption expenditure, which grew at an annualised rate of 7 per cent in the first quarter of this year, shows few signs of abating. The FNB/BER Consumer Confidence Index declined marginally in the second quarter of 2006, but nevertheless remains close to historically high levels. Motor vehicle sales continue to exhibit strong growth. New vehicle sales grew by 20,8 per cent in the year to July. This higher consumer demand has been underpinned by low nominal interest rates, rising real incomes, and wealth effects arising from strong asset price growth. The residential property market remains buoyant, although the rate of increase in house prices has declined somewhat during 2006. According to the ABSA house price index, house prices recorded year-on-year increases of 13,6 per cent in June. Prices on the JSE Securities Exchange have been somewhat volatile with the ALSI fluctuating between 18380 and a high of 21592. Growth in credit extension to the private sector reflects the growth in consumer expenditure and higher property prices. Growth over twelve months in total loans and advances accelerated from 22,5 per cent in May 2006 to 23,2 per cent in June. Asset backed credit growth, which accounts for a significant part of the increase in total loans and advances, has remained around 27 per cent since February 2006. Until recently wage developments presented a benign picture. During 2005, unit labour cost in the formal non-agricultural sector increased by 3,4 per cent, providing further evidence that wage pressures were well contained. However in the first quarter of 2006, nominal unit labour cost increased by 7,6 per cent compared to the same quarter of the previous year, and up from an increase of 2,6 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2005. This development is attributed in part to a decline in labour productivity in the first quarter of 2006 compared to the first quarter last year, as employment outpaced output growth. It is too early to tell if this represents a reversal of the previous trend, but as a significant number of wage negotiations are concluded in the third quarter, these developments will be closely monitored. Wage settlements surveys conducted by Andrew Levy Employment Publications show that settlements have averaged 6,2 per cent in the first half of 2006, compared to 6,3 per cent in 2005 as a whole. Preliminary indications are that economic growth, although still robust, continues to show some moderation compared to the 4,9 per cent achieved in 2005, and consequently poses little threat to the inflation outlook. The RMB/BER Business Confidence Index declined in the second quarter, although it remains at a high level. Manufacturing output growth has shown some signs of sustaining the first quarter recovery after the subdued levels in the second half of 2005. The physical volume of manufacturing production increased by 4,4 per cent on a year-on-year basis in May, while the Investec/BER Purchasing Managers Index has increased for 6 consecutive months, with the measure for July indicating a strongly positive outlook for the sector. Mining production, however, remains under pressure. Total mining production decreased by 6,8 per cent year-on-year in May although in the past three months mining production increased by 5,4 per cent compared to the previous three months, mainly as a result of increased platinum group metals production. International factors also pose a risk to the inflation and interest rate outlook. International oil price developments remain a significant source of concern. In mid-June the price of Brent crude oil had declined to levels of around US$66 per barrel as a result of higher reported inventories. However by the end of June, oil prices had risen to levels of around US$75 per barrel as a result of strong demand pressures, supply constraints and rising geopolitical tensions. In July the price of Brent crude oil averaged almost US$74 per barrel, compared to US$68 per barrel in June. Despite the relatively subdued global inflation environment, inflationary pressures have begun to emerge in a number of countries. This has prompted further tightening of monetary policy by several central banks in the past few months. The MPC remains concerned about the longer term threats to the inflation outlook and has therefore decided that a further adjustment to the repo rate would be prudent. Accordingly, the repo rate is increased by 50 basis points to 8,0 per cent per annum with immediate effect. The Monetary Policy Committee will, as is always the case, remain vigilant in order to ensure that CPIX inflation stays within the inflation target range."
United States,2006-08-08,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent. Economic growth has moderated from its quite strong pace earlier this year, partly reflecting a gradual cooling of the housing market and the lagged effects of increases in interest rates and energy prices. Readings on core inflation have been elevated in recent months, and the high levels of resource utilization and of the prices of energy and other commodities have the potential to sustain inflation pressures. However, inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time, reflecting contained inflation expectations and the cumulative effects of monetary policy actions and other factors restraining aggregate demand. Nonetheless, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain. The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; Timothy F Geithner. Vice Chairman; Susan S Bies; Jack Guynn; Donald L Kohn; Randall S Kroszner; Sandra Pianalto; Kevin M Warsh; and Janet L Yellen. Voting against was Jeffrey M Lacker, who preferred an increase of 25 basis points in the federal funds rate target at this meeting."
Philippines,2006-08-09,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the BSP's key policy interest rates at 7.5 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.75 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. The Monetary Board indicated that the evidence on output and inflation supports a steady policy setting. Latest BSP forecasts continue to show a decelerating path for inflation over the policy horizon, with the likelihood that the target headline inflation rate in 2007 of 4-5 percent will be achieved, in the absence of additional cost-push shocks. The sustained decline in core inflation also implies reduced generalized pressures on consumer prices. Moderate improvements in demand indicators and weak credit activity also suggest a scenario of limited demand-based price pressures. Nevertheless, the Monetary Board considered that the balance of risks to the future path of inflation remains tilted toward the upside, mainly on account of the outlook of higher oil prices. The prospect of sustained high international oil prices, along with associated adjustments in power and possibly transport costs, implies a continuing environment of supply-side pressures. Meanwhile, more than ample liquidity in the banking system can also be a source of concern. Given these considerations, the Monetary Board recognized the need to remain focused on managing the risks to inflation expectations, assessing the likelihood of second-round effects, and closely monitoring developments in liquidity conditions. The Monetary Board remains strongly committed to achieving the inflation target for 2007 and stands ready to act against emerging risks to the outlook for inflation and to inflation expectations."
Romania,2006-08-09,"In its meeting of August 9, 2006, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided the following: to maintain the monetary policy rate at 8.75 percent per annum; to continue to pursue a firm control of money market liquidity via open-market operations and maintain prudential measures to slow down non-government credit expansion; to set the 2008 inflation target at 3.8 percent, with a target band of +/- one percentage point. The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled on August 16, 2006. The most recent macroeconomic indicators show a continuation of disinflation at a faster pace than previously forecast, against the background of a slower rise in administered prices and volatile food prices and under the impact of ongoing monetary policy tightening. The continuous slowdown of core inflation is worth mentioning; when computed by excluding the effects of ""vice tax"", this reached 3.7 percent year on year in June. The latest data reveal the maintenance of strong dynamics of consumption and non-government credit expansion. Economic growth exceeded expectations and the current account deficit widened further. In light of available data and given the timeframe needed for the effects of the recent monetary policy tightening to become completely manifest, the NBR Board has decided to maintain the monetary policy rate at 8.75 percent per annum and to keep in place its measures designed to slow down credit growth. The NBR Board has also examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which assesses the recent macroeconomic context and the inflation outlook, as well as the main challenges and risks to monetary policy in the coming period. The baseline scenario of the current projection reveals a change of the disinflation pattern compared to the previous forecast, with a faster disinflation process in 2006 and a relative slowdown during 2007. The prospect of higher inflationary pressures due to the increase in government spending and the inertia of inflation expectations require a firm monetary policy stance for a longer period of time. Following an assessment of the new forecasts as well as of the medium-term risks and uncertainties related to the inflation outlook, especially the factors outside the central bank's authority, the NBR Board has set, after consultation with government, the 2008 inflation target at 3.8 percent, with a target band of +/- one percentage point. The target represents an achievable goal and is in line with the need to continue the disinflation process in order to reach a sustainable level in the medium term and later on to fulfill the convergence criteria stated by the Maastricht Treaty. The NBR reaffirms that it will continue to vigilantly monitor domestic macroeconomic and monetary trends as well as the impact of external developments, standing ready to adjust its instruments to ensure the achievement of medium-term disinflation goals and consolidate the convergence process with the European Union. According to the announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy issues is scheduled for September 27, 2006."
Chile,2006-08-10,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 10 August 2006 1 Press Release In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 5.25% (annual). The external scenario relevant to the Chilean economy remains favorable, with a recent change in the contribution to economic growth by the various economic zones. International financial conditions continue to be positive, the copper price remains high and oil is again at a record peak. Domestic demand seems to have slowed during the second quarter—in line with projections in the last Monetary Policy Report—with a sustained drive from consumption and some investment deceleration. Nonetheless, second- quarter output growth was somewhat lower than expected, while available indicators continue to suggest that the increase in the pace of growth considered for the second half of the year may fall short of projections. On the other hand, salaried employment continues to grow relatively vigorously, and domestic financial conditions are still expansionary. CPI inflation remains in the higher part of the target range, due mainly to the incidence of higher fuel prices. Measures of core inflation CPIX and CPIX1 (that exclude fuels, perishables and some regulated utilities) are still near 3%. Other trend inflation indicators remain stable, while the different measures of medium- and long-term expected inflation continue to be anchored around 3%. While fuel prices are still high, other cost pressures are contained. The Board considers that, in the most likely scenario, gradual adjustments to the interest rate continue to be necessary to maintain projected annual inflation around 3% in the normal policy horizon. The timing of said adjustments will depend on incoming information, but the data available reaffirms that they may be less frequent than they have been in recent quarters. 1 The Spanish original prevails."
Egypt,2006-08-10,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release August 10, 2006 The Central Bank of Egypt decided not to raise its policy rate. In its meeting held on August 10, 2006, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided not to raise its policy rat. It maintained the overnight deposit and the overnight lending rates at 8 percent and 10 percent, respectivel. This decision was based on the assessment of recent domestic and external economic developments since the last MPC meetin. Domestically the gradual increase in headline consumer price index since April has been attributed to supply factors chiefly driven by the outbreak of the Avian Fl. This has adversely affected food inflation, which is not expected to persist in light of the measures undertaken by the Government in this respec. In addition, price adjustments in administered items have also contributed to the increase in headline inflatio. However the MPC judges that these factors should not have, in their first round, a permanent effect on inflatio. Externally risks to global inflation are still skewed to the upside and could be exacerbated by increasing international oil prices if geopolitical tensions heighten and by any further increases in commodity price. The MPC will continue to closely monitor all economic developments, especially the factors underlying inflation, and will not hesitate to adjust the key CBE rates to ensure price stability over the medium-ter.

South Korea,2006-08-10,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) by 25 basis point from 4.25% to 4.50%. In a related action, the Committee raised the interest rates on Liquidity Adjustment Loans and Aggregate Credit Ceiling Loans of the Bank of Korea by the same 25 basis points, respectively to 4.25 % and 2.75%. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). In the real economy, exports continue to exhibit steady growth, the recovery of private consumption has been maintained, and facilities investment is still recovering gradually. On the other hand, construction investment shows lackluster movements. Meanwhile, the current account is running a surplus, thanks to that on the goods account. Both consumer price inflation and core inflation maintain overall stability. Nevertheless, inflation pressures persist due to economic recovery and high oil prices. The upward pace of real estate prices has slowed down. In the financial markets, financial institutions' lending has slowed the pace of its expansion. Nevertheless, overall liquidity conditions are favorable. Taking the above economic and financial conditions into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to raise the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) by 25 basis points from 4.25% to 4.50%."
Peru,2006-08-15,"Press Release MONETARY PROGRAM FOR AUGUST 2006 CENTRAL BANK MAINTAINS REFERENCE RATE AT 4.50% The Board of the BCRP acknowledge the following information: The Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) decreased 0.17 percent in July due to a 1.0 percent fall in terms of foodstuffs. Thus, the CPI inflation rate over the last twelve months was 1.55 percent, within the target range (1.5 percent  3.5 percent). On the other hand, core inflation over the last 12 months remained at 1.3 percent. In the January-June period, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew 6 percent with respect to the same period last year. This evolution reflects the continuous dynamic performance of economic activity, with domestic demand growing at a rate of nearly 8.1 percent in the first semester. Consumption in the private sector is estimated to have grown 5.3 percent, while private investment would have grown 20.9 percent in the same period. The average exchange rate decreased 0.6 percent in July to 3.24 per dollar. The real multilateral exchange rate rose slightly in July because of a reduction in the general level of domestic prices and the depreciation of the dollar against other currencies. In July, the Central Bank intervened in the exchange market purchasing US$ 600 million in order to inject liquidity to the market in a more permanent fashion, given that there is a seasonal higher demand for local currency in this month. In July, there were foreign exchange net sales in the spot market by US$ 493 million, while the stock of forward net sales of foreign currency dropped by US$ 249 million. In July, the interbank interest rate was 4.50 percent, while the 90-day corporate prime rate for loans in soles fell from 5.8 percent to 5.6 percent between June and July. The country risk indicator by the end of July was 153 bps, a level lower than the one recorded by the close of June (169 bps). On the other hand, the yield of the Peruvian sovereign bond with a 20-year-maturity and denominated in domestic currency, decreased from 8.3 to 7.8 percent. The Board of the Central Bank approved to maintain the reference interest rate for the interbank market at 4.50 percent. This decision has been taken taking into account that: Between December 2005 and May 2006, as a result of a partial withdrawal of monetary stimulation, the reference interest rate rose by 150 basis points. The Central Bank will continue to assess all relevant macroeconomic information to guarantee that the necessary measures are in place to maintain inflation within the target range. Forecasts on the dynamism of economic activity in the period 2006- 2007 (around 5.5 percent) are consistent with the inflation target (from 1.5 to 3.5 percent). The Board approved the following interest rates for the BCRP active and passive operations: For direct repo and rediscount operations, the rate continues to be 5.25 percent. For overnight deposits, the rate continues to be 3.75 percent. The interest rates for the following operations in dollars between the Central Bank and the Financial system are established as follows: Rediscount operations: 1-month LIBOR plus one percent. Overnight deposits: overnight LIBOR minus 3/8 of a percentage point. Swap: the commission continues to be at a level that implies a minimum annual effective cost of 5.25 percent. Reserve requirements in foreign deposits subject to payment: the rate continues to be at 2.5 percent. The Board will approve the following Monetary Program (for the month of September 2006) in its meeting of September 7, 2006."

Malaysia,2006-08-25,"At its meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to leave the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) unchanged at 3.50 percent. The Malaysian economy has performed well during the first half of 2006, sustained by strong domestic private demand and global economic growth. While the external environment may become less favourable in the second half of the year due to an anticipated softening of global growth, its impact on the domestic economy is expected to be modest. Inflation is expected to moderate during the remaining part of the year. At this stage, there are also no signs of second round effects and wage pressures. However, this relatively benign outlook has to be tempered by the fact that commodity and oil prices remain high and there continues to be cost driven pressures on prices. Given the uncertainty about the transmission of increases in producer prices to consumer prices, continued vigilance is warranted. The future stance of monetary policy would therefore depend on Bank Negara Malaysia's assessment of new developments and their impact on the inflation outlook and economic growth prospects. Bank Negara Malaysia 25 August 2006."
Israel,2006-08-28,"28.8.2006 The Bank of Israel leaves the interest rate for September 2006 unchanged at 5.5 percent The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for September 2006 will remain unchanged at 5.5 percent. The decision to leave the rate at its current level is consistent with the maintenance of price stability within the limits of the inflation target of between one percent and three percent inflation a year. Background conditions The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 0.1 percent in July, slightly above forecast, and has risen by 1.7 percent since the start of the year (an annual rate of 2.2 percent, seasonally adjusted). The rate of inflation overthe last twelve months fell to within the range and reached 2.5 percent. Inflation expectations for the next twelve months and beyond, remain close to the midpoint of the target range. Expectations derived from the capital market and economic forecasters' assessments of inflation over the next twelve months stood at the midpoint of the target range in August: at an average of between 1.9 percent and 2 percent. At the same time, some forecasters expect no further rise in the interest rate for the rest of theyear, while others do foresee such a rise by the end of 2006. The makam curve reflects no change in the interest rate over the next year. Prior to the outbreak of hostilities on Israel's northern border, the Israeli economy was on a path of growth and GDP grew in the first half of the year at an annual rate of 5.9 percent. Data for the second half show growth in most of the major industries according to the National Accounts. According to the Employers' Survey from the Ministry of Industry. Trade and Employment, demand for labor in the business sector continued to grow and real wages have increased by 0.2 percent in the current quarter. The damage from the fighting was concentrated in the manufacturing, commerce and services, tourism and agriculture industries. Part of the losses caused to manufacturing and the commerce and services industry could yet be set off later this year which could minimize the damage to economic growth,rendering it only temporary with most of it impacting in the third quarter. However, the rate of recovery for incoming tourism is expected to be slow. Growth forecast for 2006 is estimated at about 4.5 percent, compared to 5.5 percent before the hostilities. According to the most recent data, one notes a drop in exports of 12 percent in July as a result, inter alia, of the temporary interruption to normal activities of factories and the difficulties of haulage following the closure of Haifa Port. Numbers of incoming tourists fell after the start of hostilities, from an average daily of 5,000 at the start of July to around 3,300 after July 12. Despite the fighting, the capital market demonstrated firmness. Changes in nominal and real yields were moderate. Moreover, the NIS continued to strengthen and appreciated nominally against the dollar by 1.1 percent in July and showed no change in August. However in July, following the fighting, there was a rise in exchange-rate risk, as derived from trade in options, although exchange-rate fluctuations moderated in August: the implied volatility of NIS/$ options traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange declined in August to 8.2 percent, on average, after rising in July to 8.6 percent, compared to 7.4 percent in June. In the international financial markets, there was a fall in Israel's risk premium in August, as measured by the CDS spread. Surveys released by foreign investment houses during the fighting stressed the Israeli economy's positive macroeconomic data and financial stability. The US Federal Reserve decided to keep its federal funds rate unchanged,and the probability of a further rise at its next meeting is less than 50 percent, according to the financial markets. At the same time, the markets expect interest rates in the European Monetary Union to be raised 25 basis points in continuation of its monetary tightening. Government budget performance in July was significantly different to previous months. Government domestic deficit was higher than seasonal, againsta background of income levels consistent with that derived from the budgetforecast and spending levels significantly higher than forecast, as a result of the fighting. The budget is therefore expected to be fully utilized this year and total income is expected to be around NIS 7 billion higher than forecast in the budget. Assuming that the hostilities will cause damage of around 1 percent of GDP, the total government deficit (net of credit) forthe whole of 2006 is expected to total around 2 percent of GDP. The main considerations behind the decision The rate ofinflation since the start of 2006 has moderated and is now close to the midpoint of the inflation target range. Estimates from the capital market andprivate forecasters for the year ahead point to future developments of inflation within the inflation target range, at the current rate of interest.</td> The expected damage to GDP as a result of the fighting could reduce demand in the private sector. However aggregate demand is not expected to drop significantly in light of the effect of future changes in the government budget. At the same time, the expected damage on the supply side will likely be temporary and short term. Therefore there is unlikely to be a significant impact from all these changes on prices. In light ofthe implications of the fighting it is reasonable to assume that government expenditure for 2006 and 2007 will increase, though there is uncertainty regarding the size of this increase. This expected development constitutes a further consideration in leaving the interest rate at its current level to maintain price stability. Despite therise in the level of risk and uncertainty in the period of fighting, the financial markets remained stable and demonstrated impressive financial resilience, including long-term yields. The Bank of Israel's interest-rate riselast month, and the US Federal Reserve's most recent decision to leave itsfederal funds rate unchanged allow a differential between these rates of 25 basis points, which is a further boost to the stability of the sheqel. Global oil prices stabilized and even began to fall after rising about 10 percent since the start of the summer. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor economic developments closely with the intention of achieving the price-stability target. Subject to this, the Bank will continue to support the attainment of a range of objectives of macroeconomic policy, particularly with respect to increasing employment and growth. In addition, the Bank will continue to support financial stability. 28.8.2006 The Bank of Israel leaves the interest rate for September 2006 unchanged at 5.5 percent. The Bank of Israel leaves the interest rate for September 2006 unchanged at 5.5 percent. The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for September 2006 will remain unchanged at 5.5 percent.

Poland,2006-08-30,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 30 August 2006 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL Held on 29-30 August 2006 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: (cid:131) reference rate 4.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate 5.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate 2.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate 4.25% on an annual basis. Since the Council's meeting in July 2006 there has been no changes in the forecasts of economic growth in the euro area and the United States. They still point to a slight slowdown of economic growth in the euro area in 2007 in relation to 2006. Similarly, according to unchanged forecasts some deceleration of economic growth in 2007 is also expected in the United States. Inflation forecasts for 2006-2007 have not changed in the euro area, while the outlook for inflation in the United States in 2007 has been revised upwards. The annual growth of consumer prices in the euro area has remained at a heightened level for a longer period (2.4% in July compared with 2.5% in June). In July inflation in the United States was 4.1% (compared with 4.3% in June). Since the July meeting of the Council increases have occurred both in the current price of crude oil (rise of USD 1.4, i.e. 1.9%) and in the price forecast for 2006-2007 (according to analysts surveyed by the Reuters the average rise of over USD 2.0, i.e. 3.0%). The GUS data on GDP in 2006 Q2 confirm the acceleration of economic growth that has been observed since 2005 Q2. The growth of real GDP in 2006 Q2 reached 5.5% y/y (compared with 5.2% in Q1) and was higher than assumed in the July inflation projection. Private consumption rose by 4.9% y/y (as compared with 5.2% in 2006 Q1) and the contribution of net exports to GDP growth was 0.4 percentage point (against 0.7 percentage point in 2006 Q1). Gross fixed capital formation increased by 14.4% y/y (against 7.4% y/y in 2006 Q1) and according to the GUS, contrary to the expectations of the July projection, public consumption declined by 1.0% y/y (against growth of 3.4% y/y in 2006 Q1). The contribution of net exports to GDP growth and the growth of gross fixed capital formation were higher than forecast in the July projection. The July 2006 data on industrial output and retail sales indicate that high economic growth has continued. The rise in industrial output in July 2006 was consistent with the expectations of the NBP and external forecasters reaching 14.3% y/y (compared with 12.2% y/y in June). In seasonally adjusted terms, the growth in industrial output in July amounted to 14.1% y/y (compared with 13.8% y/y in June). Lower than expected was the rise in construction and assembly output, which was only 4.8% y/y compared with 15.7% y/y in June, which in seasonally adjusted terms represents 5.7% y/y against 10.8% y/y. What has to be borne in mind, however, is that the monthly data on growth in construction and assembly production are subject to considerable volatility. The rise in retail sales remained high (at 11.0% y/y in nominal terms, compared with 10.7% y/y in June). ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (22) 826 99 55, fax (22) 826 37 51. Lending to households has continued to rise rapidly: in July the rise in consumer loans amounted to 19.7% y/y (against 22.6% y/y in June) and housing loans rose by 50.4% y/y (compared with 53.0% y/y). Corporate lending growth accelerated (to 7.2% y/y from 5.1% y/y in June). The acceleration in corporate lending, which came despite the fact that enterprises are holding substantial own funds resulting from their very good financial results in the first half of 2006, may point to a further rise in investment growth. Net profits of non-financial enterprises in the first half of 2006 were 24.2% higher than in the first half of 2005. The fast economic growth has been accompanied by growing demand for labour. Since December 2004 the growth of corporate sector employment has been constantly accelerating. In July 2006 the employment in enterprises rose by 3.3% y/y (compared to 3.1% in June), which was the highest increase since the beginning of the 1990s. According to labour office data, in July 2006 the registered unemployment rate slid to 15.7% compared with 17.9% a year before. Economic growth is also accompanied by a high growth of wages. In 2006 Q2 the rise of nominal wages in the economy was consistent with expectations and, similarly to the previous quarter, amounted to 4.7% y/y. In the enterprise sector, in July 2006 the rise in nominal wages accelerated to 5.6% y/y compared with 4.5% y/y in June (wages in enterprises after adjustment for the impact of shifts in one-off components of wages in certain sections, grew in June, according to NBP estimates, by 4.9% y/y). In industry, in January-July 2006, with employment rising by 1.9% y/y, the growth of labour productivity amounted to 10.4% y/y and was higher than the growth of wages in this sector (5.1% y/y). It will only be possible to assess the growth of unit labour costs in the whole economy in 2006 Q2 once the BAEL data for this period are released. The rise of unit labour costs in the economy (excluding private farming) in 2006 Q1 amounted to 3.3% y/y. It should be emphasised that the high economic growth which would not pose a threat to the achievement of the inflation target can only be sustained on the condition that the growth in wages does not outpace the growth in labour productivity. This requires strong and productivity-oriented corporate governance in enterprises, which is usually more easily attained under private ownership. This also requires wage discipline in the public sector. The annual growth of consumer prices in July was faster than expected by external forecasters and the NBP, and reached 1.1% (against 0.8% y/y in June). The rise in the annual growth of prices in relation to June 2006 was mainly the result of the acceleration in the annual growth in the prices of food and internet services. The growth of food prices accelerated in connection to the unfavourable weather conditions in July. In turn, the rise in the prices of internet services mainly followed from the expiry of special price reductions offered by one of the providers. All measures of core inflation have increased (in July core inflation indicators ranged between 0.1% y/y and 1.3% y/y). August did not bring any changes to inflation expectations of households (0.8% y/y). According to the GUS business tendency surveys, the expected prices in retail sales, prices of industrial production and construction and assembly output have been gradually increasing since the beginning of 2006. July 2006 has been another month of a considerable acceleration in the growth of producer prices in industry (rise of 3.5% y/y compared with upwards revised 3.0% y/y in June, i.e. 0.7% m/m against 0.9% m/m in June). The rise in annual PPI growth occurred even though the nominal effective exchange rate of the zloty was 2.3% stronger than a year before. In the opinion of the Council the analysis of the latest data indicates that the path of future inflation will be similar to that presented in the July projection. In the opinion of the Council, the currently observed fast economic growth creates favourable conditions for the implementation of reforms which would permanently reduce the public finance imbalance. The Council maintains its belief that it would be the most favourable for Poland to adopt an economic strategy focused on creating conditions that would guarantee the introduction of the euro at the earliest possible date. The reduction of the public finance imbalance -2 - and, consequently, the creation of the conditions for the introduction of the euro would contribute to higher long-term economic growth. The next meeting of the Council will be held on 5 September 2006 and will be devoted to discussing the draft Monetary Policy Guidelines for 2007. The Guidelines will be finally approved at the Council's meeting on 26-27 September 2006."
Euroarea,2006-08-31,"Ladies and gentlemen, let me welcome you to our press conference and report on the outcome of today's meeting of the ECB's Governing Council. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, at today's meeting we decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The information that has become available since our last meeting has further underpinned the reasoning behind our decision to increase interest rates earlier this month. It has also confirmed that strong vigilance remains of the essence so as to ensure that upside risks to price stability are contained. With key ECB interest rates at still low levels in both nominal and real terms, money and credit growth dynamic, and liquidity ample by all plausible measures, our monetary policy continues to be accommodative. If our assumptions and baseline scenario continue to be confirmed, a progressive withdrawal of monetary accommodation will remain warranted. Indeed, acting in a timely manner to contain risks to price stability remains essential to ensure that inflation expectations in the euro area are kept solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. Such anchoring of inflation expectations is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area. Turning first to the economic analysis, all the main indicators in the euro area that have recently become available for the first half of the year show a significant improvement in underlying economic activity and indicate that economic growth was stronger than previously projected by official and private forecasters. According to Eurostat's flash estimate, on a quarter-on-quarter basis, real GDP grew by 0.9% in the euro area in the second quarter of 2006, significantly above the 0.6% growth rate recorded in the previous quarter. In interpreting recent GDP data, due account needs to be taken of the degree of volatility of quarterly growth rates, but they generally confirm our view that economic growth is broadening and becoming more sustained. The information on activity in the third quarter  coming from various confidence surveys and indicator-based estimates  continues to be favourable and supports the assessment of real GDP growing at rates around potential. Looking forward, the conditions remain in place for the euro area economy to continue growing at around the potential rate. Global economic activity remains robust, providing support for euro area exports. Investment is expected to remain strong, benefiting from an extended period of very favourable financing conditions, balance sheet restructuring, accumulated and ongoing strong earnings, and gains in business efficiency. Consumption growth in the euro area should also strengthen further over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, as employment conditions improve further. This outlook is also reflected in the new ECB staff macroeconomic projections, which for the first time include Slovenia as part of the euro area projections for 2007. The projections foresee average annual real GDP growth in a range between 2.2% and 2.8% in 2006, and between 1.6% and 2.6% in 2007. In comparison with the June Eurosystem staff projections, the ranges projected for real GDP growth in 2006 and 2007 have been revised upwards, mainly reflecting the stronger growth recorded in the first half of this year, along with continued positive signals from a number of other indicators. It is the Governing Council's view that risks to these projections for economic growth are broadly balanced over the shorter term. Over the longer term, uncertainty has augmented and downside risks relate mainly to potential further oil price rises, global imbalances and protectionist pressures, especially after the suspension of the Doha round of trade talks. With respect to price developments, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 2.3% in August 2006, compared with 2.4% in the previous month. During the second half of 2006, and on average also in 2007, inflation rates are likely to remain elevated at above 2%, with the precise levels depending mainly on future energy price developments. While in our main scenario the moderate evolution of labour costs in the euro area is expected to continue in the remainder of 2006 and in 2007  partly reflecting ongoing global competitive pressures, particularly in the manufacturing sector  lagged indirect effects of past oil price increases and already announced increases in indirect taxes are expected to exert a significant upward effect on inflation in the course of next year. In the new ECB staff projections, annual HICP inflation is projected to lie between 2.3% and 2.5% in 2006, and between 1.9% and 2.9% in 2007. Compared with the June 2006 Eurosystem staff projections, the range for 2006 is within the upper part of the previous range, while that for 2007 has been shifted slightly upwards, largely reflecting the assumption of higher oil prices. In the view of the Governing Council, risks to this outlook for price developments remain on the upside. They include further increases in oil prices, a stronger pass-through of past oil price rises into consumer prices than currently anticipated, additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, and  more fundamentally  stronger than expected wage developments. Against this background, it is crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities, also in the context of a more favourable environment for economic activity and employment. Regarding prospects for inflation over medium to longer horizons, our assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail continues to be confirmed by the monetary analysis. The rates of monetary and credit expansion remain rapid, reflecting the still low level of interest rates in the euro area. In particular, loans to the private sector continue to grow at double-digit rates on an annual basis, with this rapid growth remaining broadly based across the household and corporate sectors. The moderation of annual M3 growth observed in the past two months  to 8.5% in June and 7.8% in July  may possibly reflect the impact of previous increases in interest rates. However, it also needs to be viewed against the high growth rate witnessed in May, which represented one of the highest annual rates of M3 growth seen since the introduction of the euro. More generally, recent monetary developments should be assessed with the appropriate medium-term perspective, and thus against the background of the persistent upward trend in the underlying rate of monetary expansion observed since mid-2004. On this basis, liquidity in the euro area remains ample by all reasonable measures. Continued strong monetary and credit growth in the context of already ample liquidity points to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. Monetary developments therefore require careful monitoring, especially against the background of improved economic conditions and strong property market developments in many parts of the euro area. To sum up, annual inflation rates are projected to remain elevated in 2006 and 2007, with risks to this outlook continuing to be clearly on the upside. Given the ongoing dynamism of monetary and credit growth in an environment of already ample liquidity, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium term. It is essential that inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. Accordingly, strong vigilance is warranted in order to ensure that risks to price stability are contained. If our assumptions and baseline scenario continue to be confirmed, a progressive withdrawal of monetary accommodation remains warranted. Acting in a timely manner will make an ongoing contribution to sustainable economic growth and job creation. As regards fiscal policy, in several Member States public finances appear to be on track to meet or even exceed this year's targets as the favourable economic situation, revenue windfalls and effective consolidation measures exert a positive influence on fiscal balances. However, in other countries, the current fiscal outlook suggests a shortfall in terms of the required structural improvement in public finances. This is worrying in view of the objectives and commitments agreed under the revised Stability and Growth Pact. It is therefore essential that 2006 budgets are executed strictly during the remainder of this year, and that budget plans for 2007 and beyond are sufficiently ambitious. All countries should take advantage of the current economic recovery to consolidate fiscal balances. Especially countries in excessive deficit procedure and with a high debt-to-GDP ratio should use the current economic recovery to bring the public deficit ratio to below 3% within the agreed deadline, and more ambitious fiscal consolidation is essential to achieve the medium-term objectives. It is also crucial that comprehensive reform programmes strengthen economic incentives and enhance the sustainability of social security systems. This is the best contribution that fiscal policies can make towards building confidence in the outlook for growth and stability in the euro area and in the revised Stability and Growth Pact. As regards structural reforms, the Governing Council stresses the need to raise the potential growth rate of the euro area, to foster incentives to work and to strengthen the euro area's capacity to absorb shocks. Comprehensive reform measures to ensure a fully operational internal market, a higher degree of wage and price flexibility, and a more favourable business environment would offer new opportunities for firms and workers and promote investment, innovation and job creation. Such structural reforms would not only help to underpin the momentum of the ongoing economic recovery, but would also safeguard the standard of living of euro area citizens in the longer run."
Thailand,2006-09-06,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 6 September 2006 Ms. Atchana Waiquamdee. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand, announces that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance. The main issues discussed are as follows. The economy continued to expand in the second quarter of the year and July 2006, although at a more moderated pace due to the slowdown in domestic spending. The MPC assessed that such slowdown may continue for some time but should not significantly affect overall growth given the favourable export performance. Economic stability has improved, as evidenced by the decline in inflation and the current account turning positive. Although recently oil prices fell somewhat, future oil prices remain uncertain and continue to be a risk factor to be closely monitored. The MPC viewed that the economy is adjusting well both in terms of stability and growth, but risks to inflation remain. In this light, the current level of the policy interest rate was considered appropriate. The MPC thus decided to maintain the 14-day repurchase rate at 500 per cent per annum."
Chile,2006-09-07,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago, 7 September 2006 Press Release1 In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 5.25% (annual). The external scenario relevant for the Chilean economy remains favorable. International financial conditions continue to be positive; the copper price remains high while the oil price has dropped significantly in the last several days. Although consumption continues to grow with relative strength, output is still less dynamic than previously forecast. However, salaried employment continues to rise while unemployment is gradually declining. Market interest rates in general have fallen, and domestic financial conditions are still favorable. CPI inflation remains in the upper part of the target range, due mainly to the incidence of higher fuel prices. Measures of core inflation CPIX and CPIX1 (that exclude fuels, perishables and some regulated utilities) have fallen short of projections, at around 3% and 2.5%, respectively. Also, other indicators of trend inflation show a slight decline. Cost pressures are well contained. The various measures of expected inflation continue to be well anchored around 3% over the normal policy horizon. The Board considers that, in the most likely scenario, additional increases in the interest rate will be necessary to maintain projected annual inflation around 3%. However, these adjustments might take a rather long period of time, depending on incoming information and its implications on projected inflation. 1 The Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2006-09-07,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (4.50%) for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). In the real economy, exports continue to exhibit steady growth, facilities investment maintains its pace of growth. On the other hand, private consumption has temporarily exhibited some degree of adjustment and construction investment shows lackluster movements. Meanwhile, the current account has suffered a deficit, owing to the narrowed goods account surplus and widened services account deficit. Both consumer price inflation and core inflation maintain overall stability. Nevertheless, inflation pressures persist due to economic recovery and high oil prices. The upward pace of real estate prices has slowed down. In the financial markets, overall liquidity conditions are favorable and financial institutions' lending has slowed the pace of its expansion. Taking the above economic and financial conditions into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (4.50%) for the intermeeting period."
Peru,2006-09-15,"Press Release MONETARY PROGRAM FOR SEPTEMBER 2006 CENTRAL BANK MAINTAINS REFERENCE RATE AT 4.50% The Board of the BCRP acknowledge the following information: The Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) increased 0.14 percent in August as a result of an 8.5 increase in water rates and a rise in the prices of onion and citrus fruits. In this way, the CPI inflation rate over the last twelve months was 1.9 percent, within the target range (1.5 percent  3.5 percent). On the other hand, core inflation showed a similar evolution in August with a rate of 0.13 percent, accumulating a last-12-month change of 1.4 percent. In the January-July period, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew approximately 6.7 percent with respect to the same period last year. This evolution reflects the continuous dynamic performance of economic activity, with domestic demand growing at an estimated rate of 8.6 percent in the January-July period. Consumption in the private sector is estimated to have grown 5 percent, while private investment is estimated to have grown 18 percent in the same period. The average exchange rate decreased 0.3 percent in August to 3.24 per dollar. The real exchange rate rose 0.5 percent (2.0 percent depreciation of the nuevo sol in real terms over the last 12 months), an evolution associated with the depreciation of the dollar against other currencies. In August, the Central Bank intervened in the exchange market purchasing US$ 1,410 million. A total of US$ 765 million were offered on the spot market and the total of exchange-related hedging operations declined by US$ 643 million. The average interbank interest rate was 4.44 percent in August. Downward pressures on the interbank interest rate were observed during the month; in this context, the Central Bank conducted operations aimed at injecting liquidity into the market by purchasing dollars. Therefore, and in order to sterilize this greater supply of liquid funds, the Central Bank resumed placements of BCRP Certificate of Deposits (BCRPCDs). On the other hand, the 90-day corporate prime rate for loans in soles fell from 5.7 percent to 5.4 percent between July and August. The country risk indicator by the end of August was 135 bps, a level lower than that recorded by the close of July (152 bps). On the other hand, the yield of the Peruvian sovereign bond with a 20-year-maturity in domestic currency decreased for the third consecutive month, falling from 7.8 to 7.5 percent in August. The Board of the Central Bank approved to maintain the reference interest rate for the interbank market at 4.50 percent. This decision has been taken taking into account that: Between December 2005 and May 2006, as a result of a partial withdrawal of monetary stimulation, the reference interest rate rose by 150 basis points. The Central Bank will continue to assess all relevant macroeconomic information to guarantee that the necessary measures are in place to maintain inflation within the target range. Forecasts on the dynamism of economic activity in the period 2006- 2007 (between 5.5 and 6.0 percent) are consistent with the inflation target (from 1.5 to 3.5 percent). The Board approved the following interest rates for the BCRP active and passive operations: For direct repo and rediscount operations, the rate continues to be 5.25 percent. For overnight deposits, the rate continues to be 3.75 percent. The interest rates for the following operations in dollars between the Central Bank and the Financial system are established as follows: Rediscount operations: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point. Overnight deposits: overnight LIBOR minus 3/8 of a percentage point. Swap: the commission continues to be at a level that implies a minimum annual effective cost of 5.25 percent. Reserve requirements in foreign deposits subject to payment: the rate continues to be 2.5 percent. The Board will approve the following Monetary Program (for the month of October 2006) in its meeting of October 5, 2006."
United States,2006-09-20,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent. The moderation in economic growth appears to be continuing, partly reflecting a cooling of the housing market. Readings on core inflation have been elevated, and the high levels of resource utilization and of the prices of energy and other commodities have the potential to sustain inflation pressures. However, inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time, reflecting reduced impetus from energy prices, contained inflation expectations, and the cumulative effects of monetary policy actions and other factors restraining aggregate demand. Nonetheless, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain. The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; Timothy F Geithner. Vice Chairman; Susan S Bies; Jack Guynn; Donald L Kohn; Randall S Kroszner; Frederic S Mishkin; Sandra Pianalto; Kevin M Warsh; and Janet L Yellen. Voting against was Jeffrey M Lacker, who preferred an increase of 25 basis points in the federal funds rate target at this meeting."
Israel,2006-09-25,"25.9.2006 The Bank of Israel leaves the interest rate for October 2006 unchanged at 5.5 percent The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for October 2006 will remain unchanged at 5.5 percent. The decision to leave the rate at its current level is consistent with the maintenance of price stability within the limits of the target determined by the government of between one percent and three percent inflation a year. Background conditions The Consumer Price Index (CPI) remained unchanged in August, similar to forecasters' expectations, and has risen by 1.7 percent since the start of the year. The rate of inflation over the past twelve months is 2.2 percent,consistent with the necessary path for meeting the inflation target. Inflation expectations for the next twelve months and beyond remain close to the midpoint of the target range. Average forecasts for inflation for 2006 stand at 1.8 percent. Some private economic forecasters expect no further rise in the interest rate for the rest of the year, while others do foresee a modest rise by the end of 2006. The makam curve reflects no significant change in the interest rate over the next year. Data on real activity point to a rapid economic recovery after a drop inactivity in the third quarter following the fighting in the north. Prior to the outbreak of hostilities on Israel's northern border, the Israeli economy was on a path of growth and GDP grew in the first half of the year at an annual rate of 5.7 percent, while the business sector grew by 7.5 percent. According to the latest Bank of Israel forecasts. GDP is expectedto grow by 4 percent in 2006 (compared to 5.4 percent without the effect of the fighting). Growth forecast for 2007 is estimated at 4 percent (similar to the forecast prior to the fighting, of 3.9 percent). The unemployment rate rose slightly in the second quarter of 2006 from 8.8 percent to 8.9 percent following an increase in the participation rate of the population in the workforce. There are no inflationary pressures from the labor market asduring the first half of 2006 unit labor costs continued to fall against abackground of rapidly rising productivity. The stability of the financial markets and the firmness of the shekel in the foreign exchange market throughout the period of fighting--except for the initial few days--and afterward point to the strength of the economy. This stability also reflects the assessmentthat the effect of the fighting will be relatively modest. The changes in nominal and real yields were moderate. Moreover, the shekel continued to strengthen. Prior to the fighting, in July the shekel traded at around NIS 4.40 to the dollar while in recent days, the exchange rate has fluctuated around NIS 4.32 to the dollar. The shekel appreciated similarly against the basket of currencies. Furthermore, the current account of the balance of payments continues to report a surplus. In the international financial markets. Israel's risk premium, as measured by the CDS spread, remained steady. However the yield gap between fixed-rate, shekel 10-year Shahar bonds and similarly termed US government bonds expanded to around 170 basis points, compared to a gap of 125 basis points prior to the fighting. The financial markets do not expect the US Federal Reserve to change itsinterest rate before the end of the year--i.e. that the federal funds rate will remain at its current level of 5.25 percent--but do expect the Fed to lower its rate at the beginning of 2007. At the same time, the markets expect that the European Central Bank's interest rate, currently at 3 percent, will be raised to 3.5 percent by the end of the year. Due to the cost of the hostilities in the north, a one-time increase wasrequired in security expenditure and spending on damage compensation, of around NIS 13.5 billion. This increase in expenditure is expected to raise the government deficit to 2 percent of GDP this year, and the deficit ceiling for 2007--approved two weeks ago by the government--stands at 2.9 percent of GDP. The proposed government budget isexpected to be submitted for approval by the Knesset. The main considerations behind the decision The rate ofinflation is now close to the midpoint of the inflation target range. Estimates from the capital market and private forecasters for the year ahead point to future developments of inflation within the inflation target range, at the current rate of interest. Assuming the proposed government budget for 2007 is approved by the Knesset and there are no geopolitical changes, the effects of the fighting are not expected to be long lasting on the future expansion of economic activity nor on prices. Up to now, the financial markets have demonstrated relative stability. The shekel has recently strengthened further in the foreign exchange market. In the pasttwo months, global oil prices fell in a volatile market, while rising oil prices at the beginning of the year contributed to a rise in the inflation rate. However there remains some uncertainty regarding the debate on the state budget for 2007 during the Knesset's discussion on its approval, and this could last formonths. It is important that the government budget be adopted soon by the Knesset in order to shorten the period of uncertainty, particularly in light of the high ratio of public debt to GDP. This is important in order to keep on a path of growth, based on price stability, that was the situation prior to the fighting, and to improve the chances of making such a situation sustainable. The decision to leave the interest rate unchanged in October took into account all these considerations with the intention of maintaining price stability. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor economic developments closely with the intention of achieving the price-stability target. Subject to this, the Bank will continue to support the attainment of a range of objectives of macroeconomic policy, particularly with respect to increasing employment and growth. In addition, the Bank will continue to support financial stability. 25.9.2006 The Bank of Israel leaves the interest rate for October 2006 unchanged at 5.5 percent.

Malaysia,2006-09-26,"At its meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to leave the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) unchanged at 3.50 percent. The Malaysian economy has performed well during the first half of 2006, sustained by strong domestic private demand and global economic growth. While the external environment may become less favourable in the second half of the year due to an anticipated softening of global growth, its impact on the domestic economy is expected to be modest. Inflation is expected to moderate during the remaining part of the year. At this stage, there are also no signs of second round effects and wage pressures. However, this relatively benign outlook has to be tempered by the fact that commodity and oil prices remain high and there continues to be cost driven pressures on prices. Given the uncertainty about the transmission of increases in producer prices to consumer prices, continued vigilance is warranted. The future stance of monetary policy would therefore depend on Bank Negara Malaysia's assessment of new developments and their impact on the inflation outlook and economic growth prospects. Bank Negara Malaysia 26 September 2006."
Turkiye,2006-09-26,"The Monetary Policy Committee (Committee) has decided to keep short-term interest rates (policy rates) unchanged in the Inter-bank Money Market and the Istanbul Stock Exchange Repo-Reverse Repo Market as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: The overnight borrowing interest rate is 17.50 percent, and the overnight lending interest rate is 22.50 percent. b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Within the framework of the Late Liquidity Window Facility, the overnight borrowing interest rate valid between 4:00 p.m.  4:30 p.m. in the Inter-bank Money Market is 13.50 percent, while the lending interest rate is 25.50 percent. c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealer banks via repo transactions within the framework of open market transactions is 21.50 percent. The recently available data suggest that inflation outlook has continued to improve. Leading indicators confirm our earlier conjecture that total demand would slow down, albeit not as significantly. Although domestic demand indicators point to a significant slowdown, foreign demand remains relatively strong. Following the policy measures taken by the CBRT in June, inflation expectations continued to improve in September. Furthermore, the recent deceleration in the price increases in items such as energy, unprocessed food, alcoholic beverages-tobacco and gold has had a positive impact on annual inflation figures. However, factors such as the mismatch between the medium-term inflation expectations and the targets, and the continuation of uncertainties in both commodity prices and international liquidity conditions necessitate the monetary policy to remain cautious. In light of these developments, the Committee assesses that maintaining the cautious stance for a while is necessary for the inflation rate to converge to the 2007 year-end targets. The policy rate is expected to remain close to the CBRT borrowing rate in the upcoming months. The CBRT will not hesitate to implement further tightening, in case there are developments that would suggest an unfavorable medium-term inflation outlook. It should be emphasized that any new data or information on inflation outlook will potentially lead the Committee to revise its future stance.

Poland,2006-09-27,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 27 September 2006 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL Held on 26-27 September 2006 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: (cid:131) reference rate 4.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate 5.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate 2.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate 4.25% on an annual basis. Since the meeting of the Council in August 2006 the forecasts of economic growth for 2006 have been slightly raised in the euro area, while the forecasts for 2007 have remained changed. In the United States the economic growth forecasts for 2006 have not changed, while the forecasts for 2007 have been slightly lowered. The forecasts of inflation in the euro area and the United States for 2006-2007 have not changed significantly. The annual growth of consumer prices in the euro area has remained at a heightened level for a longer period (2.3% in August compared with 2.4% in July). In the United States inflation was 3.8% in August (compared with 4.1% recorded in July). Since the August meeting of the Council the current price of crude oil has decreased (by USD 10.1, i.e. 13.7%), while the oil price forecast for 2006-2007 has not changed significantly (according to the analysts polled by the Reuters). The data for July-August 2006 on industrial output, construction and assembly production and retail sales indicate that high economic growth has continued in 2006 Q3. The rise in industrial output in August 2006 was consistent with the expectations of the NBP and reached 12.5% y/y (compared with 14.3% y/y in July). In seasonally adjusted terms, the growth in industrial output in August amounted to 12.9% y/y (compared to 14.1% y/y in July). In line with expectations, the growth in construction and assembly production returned  after one month of decline  to a high level reaching 15.3% y/y compared with 4.8% y/y in July, and 14.8% y/y compared with 5.7% in seasonally adjusted terms. The rise in retail sales remained high (at 11.5% y/y in nominal terms, compared with 11.0% y/y in July). Lending to households has continued to rise rapidly: in August the rise in consumer loans amounted to 19.6% y/y (against 19.7% y/y in July) and housing loans rose by 51.2% y/y (compared with 50.4% y/y). Corporate lending growth accelerated (to 8.7% y/y from 7.2% y/y in July). This acceleration of loans to enterprises, which came despite the fact that enterprises held substantial own funds resulting from their very good financial results in the first half of 2006, may point to a further rise in the growth of investment. ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51. Strong economic growth is accompanied by a fast growth of labour demand. Since December 2004 the employment growth in the corporate sector has been accelerating  in August 2006 the growth of employment in enterprises amounted to 3.5% y/y compared with 3.3% y/y in July. According to BAEL (LFS), the rise in the number of people working in the economy in 2006 Q2 exceeded expectations and accelerated to 3.7% y/y (against 2.4% y/y in 2006 Q1). The number of people working outside private farming has been growing fast (by 5.3% compared with 3.2% in 2006 Q1). In 2006 Q2 the unemployment rate according to BAEL fell to 14.1% compared with 18.1% one year before. According to labour office data, in August 2006 the registered unemployment rate slid to 15.5% compared with 17.7% one year before. This rapid growth in the number of working persons and the significant decline in unemployment was accompanied by a drop in the economically active population, which in 2006 Q2 fell in relation to 2005 Q2 by 1.1%. Economic growth is also accompanied by a high growth of wages. In the enterprise sector, in August 2006 nominal wages rose by 5.3% y/y compared to a rise of 5.6% in July. The growth of unit labour costs in the economy (excluding private farming) stepped up to 4.5% y/y in 2006 Q2 (in comparison to 2.7% in 2006 Q1). In turn, the rise in labour productivity in industry in January- August (10.4%) was still higher than wage growth, which has the result of decreasing unit labour costs in this sector by 5.2% y/y. Strong economic growth which would not pose a threat to the achievement of the inflation target can only be sustained on the condition that the growth in wages does not outpace the growth in labour productivity. This requires strong and productivity-oriented corporate governance in enterprises, which is usually more easily attained under private ownership. This also requires wage discipline in the public sector. In August the annual growth of consumer prices rose to 1.6% (compared with 1.1% in July) and was higher than expected by external forecasters and the NBP. Thus, inflation was slightly above the lower limit for deviations from the inflation target. The rise in the annual growth of prices in relation to July 2006 was mainly brought about by higher than expected acceleration in the annual growth of prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages, which were affected by the unfavourable weather conditions in July. All measures of core inflation have increased (in August core inflation indicators ranged between 0.7% y/y and 1.4% y/y). September brought a significant rise in inflation expectations of households (1.3% y/y against 0.8% y/y in August). According to GUS business tendency survey, the expected prices in retail sales, prices of industrial production as well as construction and assembly output have been gradually increasing since the beginning of 2006. In August 2006 the rise in producer prices in industry amounted to 3.4% y/y compared with 3.5% y/y in July (i.e. 0.0% m/m compared with 0.7% m/m in July), while producer prices in manufacturing rose by 1.6% y/y in August. The nominal effective exchange rate of the zloty appreciated by 3.8% in relation to August 2005. The latest data warrant the assessment that in 2006 Q3 both headline and “net” inflation will be higher than expected in the July inflation projection. In this way, headline inflation will be close to the lower limit for deviations from the inflation target. The released information concerning medium-term factors suggests that inflation in 2007 may prove higher than expected in the July inflation projection. A broader assessment of the inflation outlook will be formed in October 2006 after considering the new inflation projection. In the opinion of the Council, the currently observed strong economic growth creates favourable conditions for the implementation of reforms which would permanently contain the public finance imbalance. The Council maintains its belief that it would be the most favourable for Poland to adopt an economic strategy focused on creating conditions that would guarantee the introduction of the euro at the earliest possible date. The restraining of public finance imbalance and, consequently, the creation of the conditions for the introduction of the euro would contribute to higher long-term economic growth. -2 - The Council has adopted the Monetary Policy Guidelines for the year 2007. This document sets forth the monetary policy strategy, conditions of its implementation and objectives of monetary policy in 2007. The Council has maintained the present understanding of the inflation target and its implementation, including the focus of monetary policy on maintaining inflation as close as possible to the target of 2.5% in the medium term. The Council will strive to make the return of inflation to the target, which is forecast for the beginning of 2007, permanent. The Council has also adopted the document on the International Investment Position of Poland in 2005. The International Investment Position of Poland is a specification of foreign assets and liabilities of domestic entities. At the end of 2005. Poland's net international investment position was negative and reached EUR 104.7 billion, which accounted for 43.0% of GDP. Negative international investment position is typical of capital-importing economies. Compared with 2004. Poland's negative international investment position has increased by EUR 11.2 billion, i.e. 12.0% y/y, as a result of foreign liabilities increasing faster than foreign assets. This rise in foreign liabilities was to a large extent the result of the influx of foreign portfolio investment (of EUR 11.8 billion, mainly investment in Treasury bonds issued both in the foreign and domestic markets) and foreign direct investment (of EUR 7.7 billion). The Council has adopted the Forecast of the Balance of Payments of the Republic of Poland for the Year 2007. According to this forecast, in 2007 deterioration may be expected in the trade and service balance of Poland in relation to 2006. Nevertheless, current and capital account deficit will remain at a safe level. Moreover, it will be largely financed by the inflow of foreign capital in the form of direct investment. The next meeting of the Council will be held on 19 October 2006 and will be devoted to discussing the draft Inflation Report. The Report will be finally approved at the Council's meeting on 24-25 October 2006."
Romania,2006-09-27,"In its meeting of September 27, 2006, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided the following:. The NBR Board is reiterating that it will continue to vigilantly monitor the monetary and macroeconomic trends, both domestically and internationally, standing ready to react in order to achieve medium-term disinflation objectives and consolidate the convergence process with the European Union. The analysis of the most recent developments in macroeconomic indicators shows continuation of disinflation process ? with year-on-year inflation falling to 6.0 percent in August 2006 ? and faster economic growth against the background of increased investment and high consumption dynamics, which were also supported by credit expansion. The widening trend of the current account deficit persisted, but its financing via foreign direct investment has improved to stand at about 82.2 percent over January-July 2006 versus 77.3 percent in the same period of 2005. The slower dynamics of administered prices and of volatile food prices along with restrictive monetary and fiscal policies have triggered a faster pace of disinflation over the past few months, suggesting the end-2006 year-on-year inflation figure will fall within the band around the 5 percent target. Although the short-term inflation outlook has improved, persistent excess demand against the background of high growth rates of household consumption and an anticipated increase in budget spending in the following months requires the maintenance of a firm monetary policy stance in a bid to ensure the sustainability of the medium-term disinflation process. In light of the available data, the NBR Board has decided to maintain the monetary policy rate at 8.75 percent per annum and to continue to pursue firm control over money market liquidity via open-market operations. Moreover, the NBR Board is restating that it will continue to vigilantly monitor macroeconomic and monetary trends, standing ready to adjust its instrument settings in order to ensure the achievement of this year's target as well as of the medium-term disinflation path in line with the announced inflation targets (4.0 percent +/- one percentage points for 2007 and 3.8 percent +/- one percentage points for 2008). The NBR Board believes that Romania's successful integration in the European Union starting January 2007 requires a continued firm implementation of a balanced mix of economic policies (monetary, fiscal, income as well as structural reforms) in order to consolidate the disinflation process and fulfill the convergence criteria stated by the Maastricht Treaty. According to the announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy is scheduled for November 10, 2006 when a new quarterly Inflation Report is to be examined."
Egypt,2006-10-04,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release October 4, 2006 The Central Bank of Egypt decided not to raise its policy rate. In their deliberations during the MPC meeting on October 4, the members decided not to raise interest rates, however, with the sentiment to review this decision in its next meetin. The MPC has witnessed trends exerting pressures on the various price indices which have been instigated by the continued acceleration in economic growth, particularly in manufacturing and real estate sectors and second round effects from the July fuel price hik. The MPC is watching these developments and is weighing the possible effects of the above on inflation in the near futur. The MPC judges that interest rate increases are highly likely at this junctur.

Euroarea,2006-10-05,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to the press conference here in Paris. I would particularly like to thank Governor Noyer for his kind hospitality and express our special gratitude to the staff of the Banque de France for the excellent organisation of the meeting of the Governing Council. Let me now report on the outcome of our meeting, which was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup. Prime Minister Juncker, and Commissioner Almunia. At today's meeting, we decided to increase the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. This decision reflects the upside risks to price stability over the medium term that we have identified through both our economic and monetary analyses. Today's decision will contribute to ensuring that medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area. Also after today's increase, the key ECB interest rates remain at low levels, money and credit growth are strong, and liquidity in the euro area is ample by all plausible measures. If our assumptions and baseline scenario are confirmed, it will remain warranted to further withdraw monetary accommodation. The Governing Council will therefore continue to monitor very closely all developments so as to ensure price stability over the medium and longer term. Turning first to the economic analysis, the quarter-on-quarter growth rate of real GDP in the euro area for the second quarter of 2006 was confirmed at 0.9%. Moreover, since our previous meeting on 31 August. Eurostat has revised upwards the growth data for the two preceding quarters, thereby confirming that a significant acceleration in economic expansion has taken place over the past few quarters. On the basis of the revised data, economic activity has been growing at a quarterly rate of 0.7% on average over the last four quarters, the unemployment rate has been on a falling trend, employment growth has recovered and employment expectations overall have remained favourable. All in all, the economic recovery now appears somewhat stronger than on the basis of earlier data. It has become more broadly based and is mainly supported by domestic demand. The available information on activity in the third quarter  coming from various confidence surveys and indicator-based estimates  continues to support the assessment that economic activity will grow robustly while possibly moderating somewhat. Looking ahead to the remainder of 2006 and 2007, the conditions remain in place for the euro area economy to grow at solid rates around potential, with some volatility in the quarterly growth rates likely to emerge around the turn of the year. Global economic activity has become more balanced across regions and is still robust, thereby providing ongoing support for euro area exports. Investment is expected to remain strong, benefiting from an extended period of very favourable financing conditions, balance sheet restructuring, accumulated and ongoing strong earnings, and gains in business efficiency. Consumption growth in the euro area should also strengthen further over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, as employment conditions continue to improve. Risks to the outlook for economic growth are broadly balanced over the shorter term, although the recent fall in oil prices  if it were to prove lasting  has the potential to lead to somewhat stronger demand and output growth than embodied in our baseline scenario for activity in the coming quarters. Over the longer term, risks to growth lie on balance on the downside, and relate mainly to the possibility of a renewed increase in oil prices, fears of a rise in protectionist pressures, especially after the suspension of the Doha round of trade talks, and possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances. As regards price developments, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, annual HICP inflation fell to 1.8% in September 2006, from 2.3% in August. Although no detailed breakdown is available as yet, this relatively sharp decline seems to be the combined result of favourable base effects, given in particular the strong rise in oil prices a year ago, and the recent significant fall in oil prices. While the outlook for energy prices is uncertain, on the basis of current energy prices and the higher quotations on futures markets, overall inflation rates are likely to increase again towards the end of the year and in early 2007. As a consequence, we expect a considerable degree of short-term volatility in the annual HICP inflation rate, while the overall inflation rate will remain elevated at levels above 2% on average in 2006 and is likely to remain so in 2007. In addition, risks to the outlook for price developments remain clearly on the upside. They continue to include a stronger pass-through of past oil price rises into consumer prices than currently anticipated and additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those announced thus far. Furthermore, renewed increases in oil prices cannot be excluded. More fundamentally, given the favourable momentum of real GDP growth observed over the past few quarters and the positive signs from labour markets, stronger than currently expected wage developments pose substantial upward risks to price stability. Against this background, it is crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities, in particular in the context of a more favourable environment for economic activity and employment. The monetary analysis continues to point to upside risks to price stability at medium to longer horizons. Annual M3 growth rose again to 8.2% in August and, more generally, the rate of monetary and credit expansion remains rapid, reflecting the still low level of interest rates in the euro area. In particular, loans to the private sector continue to grow at double-digit rates on an annual basis, remaining broadly based across the household and corporate sectors. Taking the appropriate medium-term perspective, these developments remain consistent with the persistent upward trend in the underlying rate of monetary expansion, identified by the ECB's monetary analysis since mid-2004. Moreover, following several years of robust monetary growth, the liquidity situation in the euro area is ample by all plausible measures. Continued strong monetary and credit growth in an environment of still ample liquidity, as a result of the persistently high rate of monetary expansion over the past few years, point to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. Monetary developments therefore require careful monitoring, particularly against the background of improved economic conditions and strong property market developments in many parts of the euro area. To sum up, annual inflation rates are projected to remain elevated in 2006 and 2007, with risks to this outlook remaining clearly on the upside. Given the ongoing dynamism of monetary and credit growth in an environment of already ample liquidity, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium term. It is essential that inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. If our assumptions and baseline scenario are confirmed, it will remain warranted to further withdraw monetary accommodation. The Governing Council will therefore continue to monitor very closely all developments so as to ensure price stability over the medium and longer term. As regards fiscal policy, euro area countries are now in the process of finalising their 2007 budgets and preparing their next stability programme updates. In the current favourable economic environment, it is essential that adequate headway be made towards sound public finances, implying that budget targets for 2007 should generally be more ambitious than in previous programmes. Countries in excessive deficit need to remain fully committed to bringing their deficits to below 3% within the agreed deadline via adequate and credible structural consolidation. Other countries need to make clear progress towards their medium-term objectives in line with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact. In all cases, any revenue windfalls from faster than expected growth should be used to speed up deficit reduction or to increase surpluses. Pro-cyclical policies should be avoided and expenditure restraint is of particular importance, also given the high spending ratios and taxes as compared with many other industrialised countries. Experience has shown that expenditure reform is key to successful consolidation, and consolidation is essential for reducing overall public debt and for making public finances less vulnerable to the impact of ageing populations. Fiscal consolidation is likely to be most successful when coupled with comprehensive structural reforms. These are urgently needed to help to cushion the unfavourable economic effects of the projected demographic change in the euro area. The decline in the working age population will place further pressure on pension and health care systems, and may have wide-ranging economic consequences. In order to support the potential economic growth of the euro area, to foster macroeconomic flexibility and dynamism, and to safeguard the future standard of living of our citizens, labour and product market reforms are urgently needed. This will increase labour market participation and employment and strengthen innovation and the other forces driving productivity and economic growth. The ECB will play its part by continuing to maintain price stability over the medium term."
Chile,2006-10-12,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago 12 October 2006 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 5.25% (annual). The oil price level is lower than projected in the last Monetary Policy Report, strengthening the favorable external scenario for the Chilean economy. International financial conditions continue to be positive, and the copper price remains high. Output continues to grow at a low pace, partly affected by specific developments in mining and manufacturing. Nonetheless, salaried employment continues to rise, while unemployment is gradually declining. Domestic financial conditions remain favorable. All these facts, combined with the evolution of the external scenario, are consistent with the economic recovery projected for next year. CPI inflation and core CPIX inflation (which excludes fuels and perishables) are close to 3%. Core CPIX1 inflation (which also excludes some regulated services) has been below forecast and is now less than 2.5%. Other indicators of trend inflation also show a decline and cost pressures are contained. This, together with reduced fuel prices, permits to forecast that inflation in the next few months will be less than projected in the last Monetary Policy Report. Medium- and long-term inflation expectations continue to be anchored around 3%. With the information at hand, the Board considers that, for a rather extended period of time, new increases in the policy rate may not be necessary to maintain projected annual inflation around 3%. However, this will depend on incoming information and its implications on projected inflation. * The Spanish original prevails."
South Korea,2006-10-12,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (4.50%) for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). In the real economy, exports continue to show steady growth, facilities investment maintains a growing pace. On the other hand, private consumption exhibits a slowdown in the pace of its expansion and construction investment shows lackluster movements. Meanwhile, the current account has suffered a deficit owing to the widened services account deficit, although the goods account has remain in surplus. Consumer price inflation and core inflation both remain stable. Nevertheless, inflation pressures are present due to persistently high oil prices. The real estate prices shows signs of accelerating. In the financial markets, overall liquidity conditions are favorable and financial institutions' lending has shown a sharp increase led by those to small and medium enterprise. Taking the above economic and financial conditions into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (4.50%) for the intermeeting period."
South Africa,2006-10-12,"Recent domestic economic developments indicate that the risks to the inflation outlook to which the MPC drew attention in previous statements remain. The domestic economy continues to grow at a brisk pace while domestic demand growth has sustained its vibrancy, buoyed by strong credit extension. The deficit on the current account of the balance of payments continues to be at levels which may strongly influence the exchange rate outlook. The exchange rate has depreciated further since the last MPC meeting and broad-based pressure from producer prices has become more pronounced. Internationally, oil prices have moderated somewhat, which has allowed for a reduction in petrol prices in two consecutive months. However, in line with declining oil prices, commodity prices in general have also declined recently. The outlook for the international economy remains positive although there are still uncertainties relating to the growth outlook in the United States of America. The latest World Economic Outlook of the IMF says that global growth is expected to moderate slightly from 5,1 per cent in 2006 to 4,9 per cent in 2007. Against the background of generally tighter monetary policies globally, world inflation is expected to remain under control and average 3,7 per cent next year, slightly higher than the April projection of the IMF. Inflation has continued to display an upward trend. Year-on-year inflation as measured by the consumer price index for metropolitan and other urban areas excluding the interest cost on mortgage bonds (CPIX) has increased in each month since April of this year when it measured 3,7 per cent. By August this year. CPIX inflation had increased to 5,0 per cent. Goods prices increased at a year-on-year rate of 6,0 per cent compared to 3,5 per cent for services in August. The main inflation drivers in the goods category were again food and petrol prices. The prices of a number of food products have been increasing at high rates, in particular meat prices which increased at year-on-year rates of 15,2 per cent in August. Meat has a weight of about 7 per cent in the CPIX basket, and in August its contribution to CPIX inflation was similar to that of petrol and diesel. Petrol and diesel prices, which have a weight of 5,04 per cent in the CPIX basket, increased at year-on-year rates of 22,1 per cent. By contrast, clothing, footwear and furniture and equipment prices continued to decline, while administered prices excluding energy increased at a year-on-year rate of 4,2 per cent. Production price inflation increased markedly and across a broad spectrum of categories. Measured year-on-year, production price inflation had increased to 9,2 per cent in August 2006. Of particular concern was the 9,6 per cent increase in domestically produced goods inflation, up from 8,1 per cent the previous month. Imported goods inflation measured 7,8 per cent in August compared with 8,2 per cent in July. The categories displaying the highest month-on-month increases were agricultural products, manufactured food and electricity, gas and water. In the short term, the increase in CPIX inflation is expected to be moderated somewhat by the reductions in the domestic petrol price, amounting to R0,36 and R0,50, which took effect in September and October respectively. Pressures emanating from production prices, however, indicate that some countervailing movements can be expected. The outcome of the Bank's forecasting models shows that over the forecast period, inflation is expected to continue its upward trend towards the upper end of the target range and remain at levels of around 6 per cent between the second and fourth quarters of 2007. Thereafter CPIX inflation is expected to decline gradually to reach around 5,4 per cent by the end of the forecast period in the fourth quarter of 2008. Market expectations of inflation, as indicated by the break-even inflation rates (i.e. the yield differential between inflation-linked bonds and conventional government bonds), also show an upward trend over the shorter maturity range. Inflation expectations as reflected in the survey conducted on behalf of the Bank by the Bureau for Economic Research (BER) have also moved higher. Compared to the previous quarter, inflation expectations during the third quarter of this year increased in respect of every forecast year. Average inflation expectations increased by 0,5 per cent for 2006 to 4,9 per cent, while for 2007 they increased by 0,4 per cent to 5,3 per cent. Inflation is then expected to decline to 5,0 per cent in 2008. Despite this upward movement, expectations are still within the inflation target range during all the forecast years. Given the importance of inflation expectations in the price and wage formation process, it is vital that the Monetary Policy Committee remains vigilant to ensure that expectations stay entrenched within the 3-to-6 per cent range. A number of factors have contributed to the adverse inflation outcomes and outlook, and continue to pose a risk to future outcomes. Domestic expenditure remained buoyant in the second quarter of this year. Real domestic final demand increased at an annualised rate of 10 per cent in the second quarter, with strong growth in final consumption expenditure by both households and general government, as well as fixed capital formation. Strong household consumption expenditure remains one of the primary risk factors. In the second quarter of this year, household consumption expenditure increased at an annualised rate of 8 per cent, the highest quarter-on-quarter growth rate since 1995. There are few indications that this trend has been reversed despite the most recent interest rate changes. However it is recognised that it is possibly too early to assess fully the impact of monetary policy actions. One tentative indication of a possible slowdown in demand growth is seen in motor vehicles sales. In the third quarter of this year, sales of new motor vehicles declined by 0,3 per cent. On a month-on-month basis, sales in September declined by 3,6 per cent. This strong demand is supported by higher asset prices and increased credit extension to the private sector. Share prices on the JSE securities exchange reached new record highs recently while house prices have continued to increase, albeit at a slower rate. Growth over twelve months in total loans and advances extended to the private sector grew at a level of 26,1 per cent in August. Mortgage advances continued to be the largest component of credit extension. This component is likely to react to interest rate changes with a lag, given the time taken to finalise property transfers. The higher rates of credit extension have contributed to the further increase in household indebtedness which in the second quarter of this year rose to 70 per cent of household disposable income. Growth in money supply (M3) remains brisk. Twelve-month growth in money supply decelerated from 23,0 per cent in June to 21,2 per cent in July before accelerating marginally to 21,4 per cent in August. The income velocity of circulation of M3 declined from 1,43 in the first quarter of 2006 to a low of 1,37 in the second quarter. This is yet another indication of ample liquidity in the South African economy. Recent exchange rate developments might pose a risk to the inflation outlook. Since early May, the rand has depreciated on a trade-weighted basis by almost 22 per cent. At these levels, it is possible that some pass-through to higher prices might occur. The challenge for monetary policy is to ensure that this effect is minimised. Part of the explanation for the recent adjustment in the rand exchange rate lies in the reaction of the market to the current account deficit which has averaged over 6 per cent of GDP during the first half of this year. Other factors influencing the exchange rate include the lower commodity prices, the repricing of risk in a number of emerging markets and a general tightening of monetary policy globally. Whilst noting potential risks that may emanate from the relatively high deficit on the current account of the balance of payments, the MPC noted that this deficit continues to be reasonably well financed. The overall balance of payments situation is in surplus and has allowed further improvements in the external position of the country, with official reserves continuing to improve. Official gross gold and other foreign exchange reserves stood at US$24,6 billion at the end of September 2006 and net reserves amounted to US$21,2 billion. Food prices also pose a significant risk to inflation. Food prices in general have increased by 7,2 per cent and agricultural prices at the producer price level have increased at a year-on-year rate of 20,4 per cent. In 2005 food price inflation averaged 2,1 per cent and exerted significant downward pressure on the overall inflation trend. Higher maize prices are also likely to be sensitive to exchange rate developments. Maize product inflation in CPIX is on an upward trend but is still relatively low, having measured 4,7 per cent in August, and further pressure is expected from this source. There have, however, been some positive developments. In particular, the threat to inflation posed by the international oil prices has subsided to some extent. Having reached levels of almost US$80 per barrel in August of 2006, the price of Brent crude has now fallen to below US$60 per barrel. The timing of this adjustment has happened by chance or luck, as a high and rising oil price coupled with a depreciating rand would have had a marked and rapid impact on inflation. In August and September, the decline in international oil prices more than offset the upward pressure exerted by the exchange rate on petrol prices. Despite this positive development, the MPC considers the risk to inflation from this source still to be on the upside. The tight supply and demand conditions in the oil markets coupled with the sensitivity of oil prices to geopolitical tensions mean that oil prices could respond quickly to any new adverse developments. Furthermore, the decision by OPEC to cut quotas by 1 million barrels per day could slow the decline in oil prices. Labour market developments do not appear to pose a threat to the inflation outlook at present. Having increased by 7,3 per cent in the first quarter of this year, unit labour costs increased by 3,2 per cent in the second quarter. Trends in inflation expectations will be critical in the months ahead. Should expectations increase significantly above those indicated earlier, this is likely to be reflected in higher wage demands which may impact on the price formation process. Although at this stage wage costs do not pose a threat to inflation, these developments will be closely monitored by the MPC. The developments outlined above have taken place against the background of a buoyant economy. In the second quarter of this year, the economy grew by 4,9 per cent on an annualised basis, compared to 4 per cent in the previous quarter. Nevertheless economic growth this year is still expected to be lower than the 4,9 per cent average recorded last year. At these levels, growth is still in line with, or slightly above, what our studies indicate to be the potential output of the economy. The Rand Merchant Bank/BER Business Confidence Indicator is still at a high level, while the Investec/BER Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI), although lower in October, still reflects a positive outlook for the manufacturing sector. The recent BER manufacturing survey indicates that although there has been a marginal decline in confidence in the consumer goods sector, the capital and intermediate goods sectors have maintained a positive outlook. Having considered in detail all the recent economic data and other developments impacting on inflation, the MPC remains concerned about the outlook for inflation and is of the view that the risks to the outlook are still on the upside. Accordingly the MPC has decided that a further upward adjustment in the repo rate is appropriate at this juncture. The repo rate is therefore increased by 50 basis points to 8,5 per cent per annum with effect from Friday, 13 October 2006. The Monetary Policy Committee will continue to monitor all economic, financial and other relevant developments and stands ready to act in order to ensure that the monetary policy stance remains consistent with achieving the inflation target."
Peru,2006-10-15,"Press Release MONETARY PROGRAM FOR OCTOBER 2006 CENTRAL BANK MAINTAINS REFERENCE RATE AT 4.50% The Board of the BCRP acknowledge the following information: The Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) increased 0.03 percent in September. In this way, the CPI inflation rate over the last twelve months was 1.99 percent, within the target range (1.5 percent  3.5 percent). On the other hand, core inflation exhibited a rate of 0.08 percent, accumulating a last-12-month change of 1.49 percent. Factors explaining the lack of inflationary pressures despite the expansion of domestic demand include continuous low expectations of inflation, improvements in the productivity of factors, and the trend towards the appreciation of the nuevo sol that has been observed recently. Economic activity continues to show a dynamic performance with an estimated growth rate of 7.1 percent in the January-August period, led by the expansion of domestic demand, which recorded a growth rate of 9.1 percent in this same period. Consumption in the private sector is estimated to have grown 5.5 percent, while private investment is estimated to have grown 19.1 percent in the same period, in a context marked by high consumer and business confidence. Moreover, public consumption and investment are estimated to have grown 9.1 and 10.4 percent respectively. The nominal and real exchange rate increased 0.4 and 0.3 percent respectively in September. The nominal exchange rate rose to 3.25 per dollar. In the last 12 months, the nuevo sol has appreciated 1.8 percent against the dollar in nominal terms and has remained stable in real terms. In September, the Central Bank intervened in the exchange market purchasing US$ 166 million and sold US$ 200 million to the Public Treasury. The average interbank interest rate was 4.51 percent in September, while the average 90-day corporate prime rate in soles decreased to 5.34 percent in September, falling 11 bps. with respect to August. The country risk indicator by the end of September was 171 bps, a higher level than the one recorded by the close of August (135 bps). This higher level is explained by the new methodology that is being used to calculate this indicator since September 29, and now includes bonds involving a longer maturity in the basket. With the methodology previously used, the country risk on September 28 was 130 bps., 5 bps. below the level posted in the previous month. On the other hand, the yield of the Peruvian sovereign bond with a 20-year-maturity in domestic currency decreased for the fourth consecutive month, falling from 7.5 to 7.4 percent in September. The Board of the Central Bank approved to maintain the reference interest rate for the interbank market at 4.50 percent. This decision has been taken taking into account that: The recent evolution of inflation, which is settling at the lower level of the target range, has led to revise inflation downward for the 2006-2007 timeframe. In this context, the dynamic performance of economic activity forecast for the period 2006 (between 6.5 and 7.0 percent) and 2007 (between 5.5 and 6.0 percent) would allow gradually achieving inflation levels that are close to the inflation target. The Central Bank will continue to assess the accumulated impact of recent adjustments of the reference rate, as well as all relevant macroeconomic information to guarantee that the necessary measures are in place to maintain inflation within the target range. The Board approved the following interest rates for the BCRP active and passive operations: For direct repo and rediscount operations, the rate continues to be 5.25 percent. For overnight deposits, the rate continues to be 3.75 percent. The interest rates for the following operations in dollars between the Central Bank and the Financial system are established as follows: Rediscount operations: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point. Overnight deposits: overnight LIBOR minus 3/8 of a percentage point. Swap: the commission continues to be at a level that implies a minimum annual effective cost of 5.25 percent. Reserve requirements in foreign currency subject to payment: the rate continues to be 2.5 percent. The Board will approve the following Monetary Program (for the month of November 2006) in its meeting of November 2, 2006."
Thailand,2006-10-18,"Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 18 October 2006 Ms. Atchana Waiquamdee. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand, announces that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance. The main issues discussed are as follows. The MPC judged that the Thai economy continued to expand well. Although domestic demand in the second half of this year softened from the first half, export growth remained robust and economic stability improved. In addition, the decline in inflation was likely to help boost consumers' purchasing power. The economy was expected to maintain growth and stability in 2007 as the oil price softens and the budget disbursement accelerates from the MPC's previous assumptions. However the MPC continued to be cautious regarding uncertainties from the global economy and world oil price, which could pick up again. With economic stability and growth improving from the assessment in the last meeting, the MPC deemed the current level of the policy rate to be appropriate and thus decided to maintain the 14-day repurchase rate at 500 per cent per annum."

Leading indicators confirm our earlier conjecture of a moderate slow down in aggregate demand. While the private sector demand indicators are pointing to a significant slowdown, the foreign demand remains relatively strong, though not as much as envisaged before. The improvement in inflation expectations continues. However, the factors such as the continued presence of a gap between the medium-term inflation expectations and the targets, the emergence of new risks related to services prices and the continuation of uncertainties in the global economy necessitate the monetary policy to remain cautious in the medium term. In light of these developments, the Committee perceives that maintaining the cautious stance is necessary for the inflation rate to converge to the 2007 year- end targets. The Committee closely monitors the lagged effects of the monetary tightening that has been carried out since June. In addition, the impact of the incomes policy and the non-interest public sector expenditures on the 2007 inflation are closely monitored as well. The CBRT will not hesitate to tighten monetary policy, in case developments with unfavorable effects on medium-term inflation outlook are observed. It should be emphasized that any new data or information on inflation outlook will lead the Committee to revise its future stance.

Israel,2006-10-23,"23.10.2006 The Bank of Israel lowers the interest rate for November 2006 by 25 basis points to 5.25 percent The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for November 2006 will be lowered by 25 basis points to 5.25 percent. The decision to reduce the rate to 5.25 percent is consistent with the maintenance of price stability within the limits of the target range determined by the government of between one percent and three percent inflation a year over the course of time. Background conditions The Consumer Price Index (CPI) fell sharply in September by 0.9 percent,beyond forecasters' expectations which had ranged from a fall of 0.3 percent to a fall of 0.6 percent. This sharp drop in the CPI stems mainly from the strengthening of the shekel and a fall in the price of oil, as well as seasonal reductions in prices. The CPI has risen by 0.8 percent since the start of the year. The rate of inflation over the past twelve months is 1.3 percent, lower than the midpoint of the inflation target range. Inflation expectations for the next twelve months and beyond, which havefluctuated close to the midpoint of the target range since January 2005 and which stood at 1.9 percent in September, fell to 1.5 percent in October, below the midpoint of the target range. Average forecasts for inflation forthe next twelve months fell to 1.3 percent, while average forecasts for 2006 were adjusted downward during the month to only 0.4 percent, i.e. below the target. Private economic forecasters expect, on average, a 25 basis-point cut in the Bank of Israel interest rate for November, and a further reduction for December, which would bring the interest rate down to 5.0 percentby the end of the year. The makam curve reflects the expectations of a lower interest rate. Data on real activity point to a rapid economic recovery after a declinein the third quarter following the fighting in the north. According to a Central Bureau of Statistics estimate published this month. GDP is expected to grow in 2006 by 4.5 percent. The Bank of Israel forecast for growth for 2007 is 4 percent. Nevertheless, there are no inflationary pressures from the labor market, as unit labor costs are on a gentle downward trend againsta background of rapidly rising productivity. The stability of the financial markets and the firmness of the shekel in the foreign exchange market throughout the period of fighting--except for the initial few days--and afterward point to investors' faith in the strength in the economy. Prior to the fighting, in July the shekel traded at about NIS 4.40 to the dollar and around the time of last month's decision on the interest rate, the exchange rate fluctuated about NIS 4.32 to the dollar, while today the shekel is trading at around NIS 4.28 to the dollar. The shekel has appreciated similarly against thebasket of currencies. This strengthening of the shekel takes place againsta background of a current account surplus in the balance of payments--which is expected to reach more than $ 6 billion this year--and significant inflows of foreign investment. It should be noted that the shekel's strengthening in recent months follows a period since 2002 of a real depreciation (that is depreciation adjusted for inflationgaps between Israel and abroad) of the shekel against the basket of currencies, of more than 25 percent. In the international financial markets. Israel's risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, fell slightly. The yield gap between fixed-rate, shekel 10-year Shahar bonds and 10-year US government bonds contracted to 127 basis points from around 173 basis points in mid-September and 125 basis points prior to the war. The US Federal Reserve left its interest rate unchanged this month at 5.25 percent. The financial markets expect no change in this rate in the coming months, followed by a reduction in the federal funds rate in the first half of 2007, though the probability the markets attach to the Fed lowering its interest rate has fallen. The European Central Bank raised its interest rate by 25 basis points this month to 3.25 percent, and the markets expectthis rate to be raised to 3.5 percent by the end of the year. Due to the cost of the hostilities in the north, a temporary increase was required in security expenditure and spending on damage compensation, to be spread over three years. This increase in expenditure is expected to raise the government deficit to around 1.5 percent of GDP this year, and the deficit ceiling approved by the government for 2007 stands at 2.9 percent ofGDP. The proposed government budget is expected to be submitted for approval by the Knesset. The main considerations behind the decision Recently, in light of the strengthening of the shekel and falling energy prices, therehas been a sharp drop in the consumer price index. The rate of inflation is now close to the lower part of the inflation target range, with a high likelihood that it will fall temporarily in the coming months to below the target range. The Bank of Israel's monetary policy goal is to gradually return the inflation rate to around the midpoint of the inflation target range.</td> At the present time, according to current data and the Bank of Israel's models, it is reasonable to assume that the inflationary environment will allow for a further reduction in the interest rate. This gradual reduction in the interest rate is designed to return the inflation rate to around the midpoint of the target range while avoiding shocks to the financial markets. Growth forecasts for 2006 reflect the assessment that the recent fighting will have nolong-lasting effects on expanding economic activity nor on prices. The rate of growth in activity continues to be rapid, with GDP expected to grow by 4.5 percent in 2006 (according to the latest CBS estimate) and by around 4 percent in 2007 (according to the Bank of Israel forecast). There are pressures for additional budget expenditures, which contribute to some uncertainty about the fiscal situation, until the Knesset's approval of the budget for 2007. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor economic developments closely with the intention of achieving the price-stability target. Subject to this, the Bank will continue to support the attainment of a range of objectives of macroeconomic policy, particularly with respect to increasing employment and growth. In addition, the Bank will continue to support financial stability. 23.10.2006 The Bank of Israel lowers the interest rate for November 2006 by 25 basis points to 5.25 percent. The Bank of Israel lowers the interest rate for November 2006 by 25 basis points to 5.25 percent.

Poland,2006-10-25,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 25 October 2006 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL Held on 24-25 October 2006 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: (cid:131) reference rate 4.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate 5.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate 2.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate 4.25% on an annual basis. Since the meeting of the Council in September 2006 the forecasts of economic growth in the euro area for 2006 have been raised, while the forecasts for 2007 have remained unchanged. In the United States the economic growth forecasts for 2006 have not changed, while the forecasts for 2007 have been slightly lowered. The forecasts of inflation in the euro area for 2006-2007 have not changed significantly. The forecasts of inflation in the United States for 2006 have remained unchanged while the forecasts of inflation for 2007 have been slightly revised downwards. September marked a decrease in the annual growth of consumer prices: to 1.7% (from 2.3% in August) in the euro area and to 2.1% y/y (from 3.8% y/y) in the United States. The decline of inflation in the euro area and the United States has been largely driven by a decrease in crude oil prices. Since the September meeting of the Council the price of crude oil has decreased by USD 4.0 (i.e. 6.6%), while the oil price forecast for 2006-2007 has not changed significantly (according to the analysts polled by the Reuters). GUS data for July-September 2006 on industrial output, construction and assembly production and retail sales indicate that high economic growth continued in 2006 Q3. The rise in industrial output in September 2006 was consistent with the expectations of the NBP and reached 11.7% y/y (as compared with 12.6% y/y in August). In seasonally adjusted terms, the growth in industrial output in September amounted to 13.8 % y/y (as compared to 12.9% y/y in August). The growth in construction and assembly production accelerated to 21.1% y/y as compared to 15.3% y/y in August, and to 20.9% y/y as compared to 14.8% y/y in seasonally adjusted terms, thus exceeding the NBP's expectations. The growth of retail sales increased (to 14.5% y/y in nominal terms, as compared with 11.5% y/y in August). According to the preliminary assessments of GUS GDP growth in 2006 Q3 should not be lower than in 2006 Q2 (i.e. reached at least 5.5% y/y). Growth of lending to households has accelerated: in September growth of consumer loans accelerated to 20.4% y/y (against 19.6% y/y in August), while growth of housing loans rose to 55.9%% y/y (as compared with 51.2% y/y). Growth of corporate lending has been accelerating since April (to 9.5% y/y in September from 3.4% y/y in April). The acceleration of corporate lending growth, which came despite the fact that enterprises held substantial own funds resulting from their very good financial results, may point to a further rise in investment growth. ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51. Strong economic growth is accompanied by a rapid increase in labour demand. Since December 2004 the employment growth in the corporate sector has been accelerating  in September the growth of employment in enterprises amounted  similarly to August - to 3.5% y/y. According to the labour office data, in September 2006 the registered unemployment rate slid to 15.2% from 17.6% a year before. Economic growth is accompanied by a high growth of wages. In the enterprise sector, in September 2006 nominal wages rose by 5.1% y/y as compared with 5.3% y/y in August. Strong economic growth which would not pose a threat to the achievement of the inflation target can only be sustained on the condition that the growth in wages does not outpace the growth in labour productivity. This requires strong and productivity-oriented corporate governance in enterprises, which is usually more easily attained under private ownership. This also requires wage discipline in the public sector. In September the annual growth of consumer prices stood  similarly to August  at 1.6% and was slightly lower than expected by external forecasters and the NBP. Thus, inflation stayed slightly above the lower limit for deviations from the inflation target. Acceleration in the annual growth of prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages coupled with a decline in fuel prices were the main drivers behind the unchanged against the previous month annual growth of consumer prices. Core inflation indicators remained similar as in the previous month. In September core inflation indicators ranged between 1.0% y/y and 1.4% y/y, and net inflation stood at 1.4%. October was another consecutive month which marked a rise in inflation expectations of households (1.6% y/y against 1.3 % y/y in September and 0.8% y/y in August). In October, inflation in 11 months as forecasted by commercial bank economists was 2.2% against 2.3% a month before. According to GUS business tendency survey, the expected prices in retail sales, prices of industrial production as well as construction and assembly output have been gradually increasing since the beginning of 2006. In September 2006 the annual growth of producer prices in industry amounted to 3.6% y/y compared with 3.3% y/y in August (i.e. -0.1% m/m, similarly to August), while the growth of producer prices in manufacturing reached 1.7% y/y against 1.5% in August. The nominal effective exchange rate of the zloty in September was close to the level a year ago. The Monetary Policy Council got acquainted with the projection of inflation and GDP prepared by the NBP staff, which will be presented in the October Inflation Report. According to the projection, there is a 50% probability that the annual growth of GDP will be within the range of 5.2-5.5% in 2006 (against 4.7-5.3% in the July projection); 4.1-6.2% in 2007 (against 3.6-5.9%) and 4.5-7.0% in 2008 (against 4.0-6.6%). The October inflation projection indicates that over the whole projection horizon inflation will be higher than forecasted in the July Report. Assuming unchanged interest rates, there is a 50% probability that inflation will be within the range of 1.8-2.2% in 2006 Q4 (against 1.0-1.9% in the July projection), 1.9-3.8% in 2007 Q4 (against 1.5-3.5%) and 2.2%-4.6% in 2008 Q4 (against 1.7- 4.3%). In the opinion of the authors of the projection, the inflation projection presented in the Report does not account for all sources of uncertainty. This primarily applies to the possibility of markedly higher than expected in the projection wage increase and the shape of economic policy in the coming years. Besides, the October projection was prepared on the basis of the data available until 28 September 2006 and thus does not account for crude oil prices, which are lower than those assumed in the projection. The estimates of both GDP and CPI inflation in 2006 Q3 were close to those assumed in the projection, while net inflation in 2006 Q3 was consistent with the projection. The latest data have confirmed that in 2006 Q3 both headline and “net” inflation were higher than expected in the July inflation projection. In this way, headline inflation was close to the lower limit for deviations from the inflation target. New data and the October inflation -2 - projection suggest that in the medium-term inflation may prove higher than assessed in the previous meeting. In the opinion of the Council, the currently observed strong economic growth creates favourable conditions for the implementation of reforms which would permanently contain the public finance imbalance. The Council maintains its belief that it would be the most favourable for Poland to adopt an economic strategy focused on creating conditions that would guarantee the introduction of the euro at the earliest possible date. The restraining of public finance imbalance would per se and by creating conditions for the introduction of the euro contribute to higher long- term economic growth. At its meeting on 19 October 2006 the Council decided that starting from the next Inflation Report (January 2007) the format of the chapter ""Monetary Policy"" (chapter III of the Inflation Report) will be modified. The new format of the chapter will make it possible to present in greater detail the views expressed at the Council's meetings against changing economic developments, thus bringing it closer to the practice of many central banks (minutes). The Council approved The Balance of Payments of the Republic of Poland in 2006 Q2. The next meeting of the Council will be held on 28-29 November 2006."
United States,2006-10-25,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent. Economic growth has slowed over the course of the year, partly reflecting a cooling of the housing market. Going forward, the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace. Readings on core inflation have been elevated, and the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain inflation pressures. However, inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time, reflecting reduced impetus from energy prices, contained inflation expectations, and the cumulative effects of monetary policy actions and other factors restraining aggregate demand. Nonetheless, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain. The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; Timothy F Geithner. Vice Chairman; Susan S Bies; Donald L Kohn; Randall S Kroszner; Frederic S Mishkin; Sandra Pianalto; William Poole; Kevin M Warsh; and Janet L Yellen. Voting against was Jeffrey M Lacker, who preferred an increase of 25 basis points in the federal funds rate target at this meeting."

MSS and Centre's surplus cash balances increased from Rs.89,786 crore in April-June to Rs.92,354 crore in July-September before declining to Rs.85,196 crore in October (up to October 23). Financial markets continued to remain stable and orderly in the second quarter of 2006- 07 although interest rates have firmed up in almost all segments. During April-October, 2006 public sector banks (PSBs) raised their deposit rates by 50- 75 basis points (bps). The maximum deposit rates of private sector and foreign banks increased by 50-175 bps but the minimum deposit rates declined by 50-150 bps. The weighted average BPLR of PSBs and private sector banks increased from 11.18 per cent and 12.80 per cent in June to 11.33 per cent and 12.89 per cent, respectively, in September.

Global Developments According to the IMF's World Economic Outlook, global real GDP growth in purchasing power parity terms is expected to pick up from 4.9 per cent in 2005 to 5.1 per cent in 2006 before easing back to 4.9 per cent in 2007. In the US, real GDP growth was 1.6 per cent in the third quarter (July-September) as compared with 5.6 per cent and 2.6 per cent in the first and second quarters, respectively. The strength of the global economy has been accompanied by upward pressure on commodity prices till the first half of 2006. Following the re-pricing of risks in May-June, investor optimism seems to have returned to most equity markets and, more significantly, to the emerging markets. A number of central banks have raised their policy rates, inter-alia, in the UK. Euro area. Australia. China and Korea. Some central banks have put a pause on policy rates, notably in the US. Canada. Japan. Malaysia. Thailand. Singapore. Chile. Mexico and Turkey. A few central banks have eased monetary policy, such as in Indonesia and Brazil. Overall Assessment While global growth has been strong and broad-based, there are some indications of moderation like the cooling of the US housing market and the potential drainage of liquidity from financial markets. While global inflation conditions have not worsened, potential price pressures persist in the wake of the firming up of food and metal prices, the uncertainty surrounding international crude prices and the monetary overhang. While geopolitical risks continue to cast a shadow, it is necessary to recognise that global risks have not changed significantly from the time of the First Quarter Review of July, 2006. On the domestic front, there is a pick-up in the momentum of growth which also appears to be spreading across all constituent sectors. Financial markets have exhibited stable and orderly conditions. The current account deficit has been well-managed so far. There are indications of growing demand pressures and potential risks from rapid credit growth, strains on credit quality and elevated asset prices. High levels of monetary expansion and the evolution of the liquidity situation need to be continuously monitored for any signs of risks to inflation.5- At the current juncture, for policy purposes, the two major issues that exert conflicting pulls are exploration of signs of overheating firming up to warrant a policy response, and, the impact of lagged effects of earlier policy action on the evolution of macroeconomic developments. Stance of Monetary Policy The GDP growth is forecast to be at around 8.0 per cent during 2006-07 as against 7.5- 8.0 per cent projected in the Annual Policy Statement and the First Quarter Review. Containing the Y-o-Y inflation rate for 2006-07 in the range of 5.0-5.5 per cent assumes policy priority in terms of watchful monitoring and appropriate policy responses. The growth in monetary and credit aggregates is expected to be higher than the initial indicative projections. It is, however, important to reiterate the concerns expressed in the First Quarter Review and take careful note of the higher expansion in money supply, deposits and credit while assessing liquidity conditions. The increasing importance of global factors, by itself, would not warrant any change in the policy stance at this stage, though the evolving monetary policy actions of major economies need to be watched. In the domestic economy, there are signs of demand pressures in addition to possible transient supply constraints in respect of primary commodities. The Reserve Bank will ensure that appropriate liquidity is maintained in the system so that all legitimate requirements of credit are met, particularly for productive purposes, consistent with the objective of price and financial stability. Towards this end, the Reserve Bank will continue with its policy of active demand management of liquidity through open market operations (OMO) including the MSS. LAF and CRR, and using all the policy instruments at its disposal flexibly, as and when the situation warrants. Barring the emergence of any adverse and unexpected developments in various sectors of the economy and keeping in view the current assessment of the economy including the outlook for inflation, the overall stance of monetary policy in the period ahead will be: To ensure a monetary and interest rate environment that supports export and investment demand in the economy so as to enable continuation of the growth momentum while reinforcing price stability with a view to anchoring inflation expectations. To maintain the emphasis on macroeconomic and, in particular, financial stability. To consider promptly all possible measures as appropriate to the evolving global and domestic situation. Monetary Measures Repo Rate under the LAF is increased by 25 basis points from 7.0 per cent to 7.25 per cent with immediate effect. The Reserve Bank retains the option to conduct overnight repo or longer term repo under the LAF depending on market conditions and other relevant factors. The Reserve Bank will continue to use this flexibility including the right to accept or reject tender(s) under6- the LAF, wholly or partially, if deemed fit, so as to make efficient use of the LAF in daily liquidity management. Reverse Repo Rate and Bank Rate have been kept unchanged at 6.0 per cent. CRR has been kept unchanged at 5.0 per cent. Developmental and Regulatory Policies Financial Markets It is proposed to extend the ‘When issued' trading in the case of fresh issues of Central Government securities on a selective basis. It is proposed to allow scheduled commercial banks and primary dealers to cover their short positions in Central Government Securities within an extended period of five trading days and to deliver a shorted security by borrowing it through the repo market. Resident individuals would be free to remit up to US $ 50,000 per financial year for any current or capital account transaction or a combination of both, as against the earlier limit of US $ 25,000. The existing facilities for gifts, donations and investment by resident individuals in overseas companies would be subsumed under this revised limit. All categories of foreign exchange earners may retain up to 100 per cent of their foreign exchange earnings in their Exchange Earners' Foreign Currency accounts. Large turnkey/project exporters/service exporters with satisfactory track record may operate one foreign currency account with inter-project transferability of funds/machinery in any country, subject to specified reporting requirements. Large turnkey/project exporters/service exporters with good track record may deploy their temporary cash surpluses in either short-term bank deposits or AAA-rated short-term paper abroad, subject to monitoring by the authorised dealer bank(s). The stipulation regarding recovery of market value of machinery from the transferee project is withdrawn; however, such transfer of machinery should be reported to and monitored by the authorized dealer bank(s)/approving authority. Authorised dealer banks may borrow funds from their overseas branches and correspondent banks (including borrowing for export credit, external commercial borrowings (ECBs) and overdrafts from their Head Office/Nostro account) up to a limit of 50 per cent of their unimpaired Tier I capital or US $ 10 million, whichever is higher, as against the earlier overall limit of 25 per cent (excluding borrowing for export credit). Short-term borrowings up to one year or less should not exceed 20 per cent of unimpaired Tier I capital within the overall limit of 50 per cent. Borrowers eligible for accessing ECBs can avail of an additional US $ 250 million with average maturity of more than 10 years under the approval route, over and above the existing limit of US $ 500 million under the automatic route, during a financial year. Prepayment of ECB up to US $ 300 million, as against the earlier limit of US $ 200 million, will be allowed by authorised dealer banks without prior approval of the Reserve Bank subject to the stipulated minimum average maturity period as applicable to the loan. Authorised dealer banks may allow remittances on behalf of their customers up to 15 per cent of the average annual sales/income or turnover during the last two financial years or up7- to 25 per cent of their net worth, whichever is higher, for initial expenses, and allow remittances up to 10 per cent of the average annual sales/income or turnover during the last two financial years for recurring expenses. The existing limit of US $ 2 billion on investments in Government securities by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) will be enhanced in phases to US $ 2.6 billion by December 31, 2006 and further to US $ 3.2 billion by March 31, 2007. Importers will be permitted to book forward contracts for their customs duty component of imports. It is proposed to allow FIIs to rebook a part, say, 25 per cent of the cancelled forward contracts, provided such contracts are supported by underlying exposure. Forward contracts booked by exporters and importers in excess of 50 per cent of the eligible limit (as against the earlier 25 per cent limit) have to be on deliverable basis and cannot be cancelled. It is proposed to permit authorised dealer banks to issue guarantees/letters of credit for import of services up to US $ 100,000 where the guarantee is intended to secure a direct contractual liability arising out of a contract between a resident and a non-resident. It is proposed to eliminate the lock-in period for sale proceeds of the immovable property credited to the NRO account, provided the amount being remitted in any financial year does not exceed US $ one million. It is proposed to dispense with the existing restrictions on the number of tie-ups by banks with exchange houses and the number of drawee branches for rupee drawing arrangements in respect of those banks having sound risk management systems. Credit Delivery Consistent with the notification of the Micro. Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006, it is proposed to modify the definition of small-scale industry and micro and small enterprises engaged in providing or rendering of services for the purpose of priority sector lending. Prudential Measures Foreign banks operating in India and Indian banks having presence outside India are to migrate to the standardised approach for credit risk and the basic indicator approach for operational risk under Basel II with effect from March 31, 2008. All other scheduled commercial banks are encouraged to migrate to these approaches under Basel II in alignment with them but in any case not later than March 31, 2009.8- It is proposed to enhance the prudential limit on credit and non-credit facilities to Indian Joint Ventures/Wholly Owned Subsidiaries abroad extended by banks from the existing 10 per cent to 20 per cent of unimpaired capital funds (Tier I and Tier II capital). Institutional Developments Banks are urged to harmonise their IT-based initiatives to ensure that the objective of greater financial inclusion is achieved. It is proposed to allow financially sound UCBs registered in States that have signed MoU with the Reserve Bank and those registered under the Multi-State Co-operative Societies Act, 2002 to convert existing extension counters into full-fledged branches. The Reserve Bank would place a model draft Fair Practices Code for consideration of Task Forces for UCBs (TAFCUBs) set up in the States that have signed MoUs for deliberation and adoption. It is proposed to allow NBFCs to issue co-branded credit cards with banks without risk sharing; and to market and distribute mutual fund products as agents of mutual funds. It is proposed to re-group as asset financing companies the NBFCs engaged in financing real/physical assets supporting economic activity such as automobiles and general purpose industrial machinery.

Philippines,2006-11-01,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the BSP's key policy interest rates at 7.5 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.75 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. At the same time, the Monetary Board adopted a tiering scheme on banks' aggregate placements with the BSP under the RP/RRP and special deposit accounts (SDA) windows, effective today, 2 November 2006. Banks' placements with the BSP under the said windows, will now be subject to the following interest rates: the applicable BSP published rate (RRP or SDA) for the first P5 billion; the applicable BSP published rate less 200 basis points for the next P5 billion; and, the applicable BSP published rate less 400 basis points for amounts in excess of P10 billion. The restoration of the tiering scheme is expected to encourage banks to seek alternatives to placing their excess funds with the BSP, such as lending to the public. The Monetary Board is of the view that the improving outlook for inflation, given prevailing demand and supply-side conditions, provides some policy flexibility. Latest forecasts continue to show a generally declining path for inflation, with average inflation for 2007 expected to fall within the 4-5 percent target in the absence of further adverse shocks. The stronger peso should also help keep down the domestic prices of imported commodities, particularly crude oil, while a moderate outlook for agriculture should help ensure stable food prices. Meanwhile, the continued easing of core inflation suggests minimal demand-based inflation pressures. Aggregate demand, to date, has been largely driven by consumer spending. However, the Monetary Board also believes that the balance of risks to the inflation outlook remains on the upside, due to a number of factors. Foremost among these are the potential cost-side pressures arising from the uncertainty in world oil prices. Food prices may also be at risk if the El Niño turns out more severe than expected, which can significantly affect agricultural production. With these potential supply-side pressures, the Monetary Board remains watchful of a rise in the public's inflation expectations. Monetary authorities will continue to pay close attention to a possible excessive buildup in liquidity conditions that could lead to higher inflation. The Monetary Board remains committed to achieving the inflation targets for the medium term and stands ready to act against emerging risks to the outlook for inflation and to inflation expectations."
Euroarea,2006-11-02,"Ladies and gentlemen, let me welcome you to our press conference and report on the outcome of today's meeting of the ECB's Governing Council. The meeting was also attended by Mr Heinäluoma. President of the Ecofin Council, and Commissioner Almunia. On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today's meeting to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The information that has become available since our last meeting has further underpinned the reasoning behind our decision to increase interest rates in October. It has also confirmed that strong vigilance remains of the essence so as to ensure that medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. With the key ECB interest rates at still low levels, money and credit growth dynamic, and liquidity ample by all plausible measures, our monetary policy continues to be accommodative. If our assumptions and baseline scenario continue to be confirmed, it will remain warranted to further withdraw monetary accommodation. Indeed, acting in a firm and timely manner remains essential to ensuring price stability over the medium term. As emphasised on previous occasions, this is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, turning first to the economic analysis. Eurostat's second estimate confirmed that real GDP growth in the euro area was 0.9% quarter on quarter in the second quarter of 2006, after 0.8% in the first quarter. Looking through the usual volatility of quarterly growth rates, economic activity has been growing at an average quarter-on-quarter rate of 0.7% over the four quarters to mid-2006, and thus faster than generally expected a year ago. On the basis of various monthly indicators of economic activity and confidence surveys, available up to October, the momentum of the economic expansion is expected to have continued in the second half of this year. In addition, the unemployment rate has been declining, employment growth has recovered and employment expectations remain favourable. All in all, the assessment of a more broadly based and more self-sustaining recovery continues to be confirmed by the incoming data, notwithstanding some possibility of a somewhat slower pace of quarter-on-quarter real GDP growth in the second half of this year than in the first. Looking further ahead, the conditions remain in place for the euro area economy to grow at solid rates around potential, although some volatility in the quarterly growth rates is likely to emerge around the turn of the year, mainly reflecting the impact of an increase in indirect taxes in a large euro area country in January 2007. Global economic activity has become more balanced across regions and remains robust, thereby providing ongoing support for euro area exports. Investment is expected to remain dynamic, benefiting from an extended period of very favourable financing conditions, balance sheet restructuring, accumulated and ongoing strong earnings, and gains in business efficiency. Consumption growth in the euro area should also strengthen further over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, as employment conditions continue to improve. Risks to the outlook for economic growth are broadly balanced over the shorter term, taking into account, in particular, the recent slowing down in the US economy on the one hand and the recent fall in oil prices on the other. The oil price decline  if it were to prove lasting  has the potential to lead to somewhat stronger demand and output growth than embodied in our current baseline scenario for activity in the coming quarters. Over the longer term, risks to growth continue to lie on the downside, relating mainly to the possibility of a renewed increase in oil prices, fears of a rise in protectionist pressures, especially after the suspension of the Doha round of trade talks, and possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances. As regards price developments, according to Eurostat's flash estimate annual HICP inflation was 1.6% in October, after having declined to 1.7% in September from 2.3% in August. The recent decline in inflation is the combined result of favourable base effects, given in particular the strong rise in oil prices a year ago, and the recent significant fall in oil prices. While the outlook for energy prices remains uncertain, on the basis of current energy prices and the higher quotations on futures markets, inflation rates are likely to increase again in the next few months and early 2007. As a consequence, we expect a high degree of short-term volatility in the annual HICP inflation rate. Looking through this volatility, however. HICP inflation will remain elevated at a level above 2% on average in 2006 and is likely to remain so in 2007. Risks to the outlook for price stability remain clearly on the upside. They continue to include a stronger pass-through of past oil price rises into consumer prices than currently anticipated and additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those announced thus far. Furthermore, renewed increases in oil prices cannot be excluded. More fundamentally, given the favourable momentum of real GDP growth observed over the past few quarters and the ongoing improvement in labour markets, stronger than currently expected wage developments pose substantial upward risks to price stability. Against this background, it is crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities, particularly in the context of a more favourable environment for economic activity and employment. The monetary analysis continues to point to upside risks to price stability at medium to longer horizons. Annual M3 growth rose again to 8.5% in September, after having increased to 8.2% in August. Although the annual growth rate of M1 has moderated somewhat in recent months, reflecting shifts into instruments with more market-related returns in a context of rising interest rates, this has been more than compensated by the stronger expansion of the other components of M3. More generally, the rate of monetary and credit expansion remains rapid, reflecting the still low level of interest rates in the euro area and the strengthening of economic activity. In particular, loans to the private sector continue to grow at double-digit rates on an annual basis, their dynamism remaining broadly based across the household and corporate sectors. While the growth of household borrowing shows some signs of stabilisation, albeit at very high rates, the growth of borrowing by non-financial corporations continues to trend upwards and has now reached rates of over 12% on an annual basis, the highest seen since the early 1990s. Thus, when the counterparts of M3 are considered, the main driver of strong monetary growth remains the expansion of credit to the private sector. Taking the appropriate medium-term perspective, the latest developments are consistent with a continuation of the persistent upward trend in the underlying rate of monetary expansion, identified by the ECB's monetary analysis since mid-2004. Furthermore, following several years of robust monetary growth, the liquidity situation in the euro area is ample by all plausible measures. Continued strong monetary and credit growth in an environment of ample liquidity point to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. Monetary developments therefore continue to require very careful monitoring, particularly against the background of improved economic conditions and strong property market developments in many parts of the euro area. To sum up, annual inflation rates are projected to remain elevated in 2006 and 2007, with risks to this outlook remaining clearly on the upside. Given the ongoing marked dynamism of monetary growth in an environment of ample liquidity, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium to longer term. It is essential that inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. If our assumptions and baseline scenario continue to be confirmed, it will remain warranted to further withdraw monetary accommodation. Indeed, acting in a firm and timely manner remains essential to ensuring price stability over the medium term. The Governing Council will therefore exercise strong vigilance. As regards fiscal policy, euro area countries have recently notified their deficit and debt figures for 2005 to the European Commission, and most have reported on developments in 2006 and budget plans for 2007. While, on average, this information points to further, albeit slow improvements in budget balances, this should not give rise to complacency. It is important that commitments under the revised Stability and Growth Pact are met in all euro area countries. It is essential that budgetary consolidation is strengthened in the current economic upswing and that pro-cyclical policies are avoided. This would boost confidence among market participants and the public. To that effect any revenue windfalls from faster than expected growth should be pre-committed and used in full to speed up deficit reduction or to increase surpluses in good times. The prospects for attaining sound budgetary positions improve when consolidation plans are based on credible commitments to reduce expenditure ratios and better expenditure control mechanisms. Finally, let me reiterate previous calls for high quality statistical data and sound statistical reporting, which are key for the prevention and correction of budgetary imbalances. As regards structural reforms, the Governing Council stressed the importance of creating a fully operational Single Market and flexible product and labour markets in order to enhance the adjustment capacity of the euro area economy and its resilience to external shocks. Liberalising product markets to allow more competition would raise incentives for firms to invest and innovate, thereby raising productivity growth. Removing labour market rigidities and distortions in wage and price formation are key conditions for promoting more homogeneous cost and price competitiveness trends among euro area countries and for generating sustained output growth and job creation. In particular, wage increases should be guided, in general, by the trend in labour productivity growth, while taking full account of the present level of unit labour costs, in order to preserve or restore price competitiveness. Moreover, it is desirable that wage settlements move away from automatic, backward-looking indexation mechanisms. The successful implementation of reforms aimed at removing rigidities and inefficiencies in euro area countries would raise potential growth and employment prospects."
Egypt,2006-11-02,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release November 2, 2006 The Central Bank of Egypt decided to raise its overnight deposit rate to 85 percent per annu. In its meeting held on November 2, 2006, the Monetary Policy Committee decided to raise its overnight deposit and overnight lending rates to 85 percent and 105 percent from 8 percent and 10 percent, respectivel. This decision was based on the observed trends exerting pressures on the various price indices which have been instigated by the continued acceleration in economic growth, particularly in construction and manufacturing sectors and second round effects from the July fuel price hik. However in the near-term, the annual inflation rates are expected to remain high as they continue to carry the effects of the previous price increases related to the supply shocks and administered price adjustment. Future decisions will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming data release.

South Korea,2006-11-09,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (4.50%) for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). In the real economy, exports continue to show steady growth, facilities investment maintains a growing pace and construction investment shows signs of some alleviation of its sluggishness. On the other hand, private consumption exhibits a slowdown in the pace of its expansion. Meanwhile, the current account has shifted into surplus, thanks to the widened goods account surplus and the narrowed services account deficit. Consumer price inflation and core inflation both remain stable. On the other hand, the upward pace of real estate prices has accelerated. In the financial markets, overall liquidity conditions are favorable and financial institutions' lending has shown a sharp increase. Taking the above economic and financial conditions into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (4.50%) for the intermeeting period."
Romania,2006-11-10,"In its meeting of November 10, 2006, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided the following:. The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which will be released to the public in a press conference scheduled for November 14, 2006. The inflation rate dropped to 4.8 percent year on year in October, falling inside the 2006 target band. Statistical data show further robust economic growth, high dynamics of consumption, investment and credit as well as a continued widening of the current account deficit. The acceleration of disinflation came as a result of the implementation of tight monetary and fiscal policies and of favorable trends in food prices due to a good agricultural year, whereas the increase in average wages in this period has been relatively close to that of labor productivity. The improvement of the 2006 inflation forecast is however accompanied by persistent inflationary pressures in the medium term, given the projected rise in government spending, possible wage hikes and the upcoming adjustments in administered prices and excise duties. The NBR Board reiterates that the achievement of the objective to ensure steady disinflation in a stable economic and financial environment calls for maintaining a restrictive monetary policy stance alongside a consistent and continued support from income and fiscal policies as well as from structural reforms. In this regard, the real monetary policy rate has already registered a significant increase due to a slowdown in price rises. In light of the available data, the NBR Board has decided to maintain the monetary policy rate at 8.75 percent per annum and to continue to pursue firm control over money market liquidity via open-market operations. The NBR Board has decided to remove the limit on the exposure of credit institutions to unhedged borrowers in terms of foreign-currency denominated credits (Norm no. 11/2005) starting from January 1, 2007. The administrative and prudential measures adopted starting 2005 have led to an improvement of the assets/liabilities structure as well as of foreign exchange risk elements in the Romanian financial sector. Thus, the share of foreign currency-denominated loans in total non-government credit narrowed to about 47 percent from 60 percent in July 2005, nearing the share of foreign currency-denominated deposits in overall saving. The NBR Board has examined and approved the quarterly Inflation Report, which assesses the recent macroeconomic context and inflation outlook, as well as the main challenges and risks to monetary policy in the coming period. The report will be presented to the public in a press conference on November 14, 2006. The NBR Board is reiterating that it will continue to vigilantly monitor monetary and macroeconomic trends, both domestically and internationally, standing ready to react in order to achieve medium-term disinflation objectives and consolidate the convergence process with the European Union. According to the announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy is scheduled for December 28, 2006."
Peru,2006-11-15,"Press Release MONETARY PROGRAM FOR NOVEMBER 2006 CENTRAL BANK MAINTAINS REFERENCE RATE AT 4.50% The Board of the Central Bank approved to maintain the reference interest rate for the interbank market at 4.50 percent, considering that:: Inflation continues to be at the lower band of the announced target range (1.5  2.5 percent), as a result of which the estimated evolution of inflation described in the Inflation Report of September stands. Thus, in the 2006- 2007 forecast horizon, inflation would temporarily settle at the lower band of the target range due to the reversal of the increase in the price of some food products, converging gradually to 2.5 percent. The risks described in our previous Inflation Report persist. A higher growth of domestic demand should it not be coupled by the growth of investment or productivity would generate upward pressures on inflation. In this context, the Central Bank will continue to evaluate all relevant macroeconomic information to guarantee that the necessary measures are in place to maintain inflation within the target range (1.5 percent  3.5 percent) in the medium term. This decision has been made taking into account the following information: The Consumer Price Index of Metropolitan Lima (CPI) increased 0.04 percent in October. In this way, the CPI inflation rate over the last twelve months was 1.89 percent, within the target range announced for inflation. On the other hand, core inflation was 0.06 percent, accumulating a last-12-month change of 1.45 percent. Maintaining the dynamic performance it has exhibited so far this year, economic activity is estimated to have grown 8.7 percent in the third quarter, driven by domestic demand, which is estimated to have grown 10.5 percent in the same period. Private consumption, on the other hand, would have grown 6.3 percent in the third quarter, while private investment would have grown 16.5 percent. These evolutions have taken place in a favorable context supported by consumer and business confidence. The average interest rate in the interbank market was 4.50 percent in October (similar to the reference rate), while the 90-day corporate prime rate in soles decreased to 5.31 percent, posting 3 bps. less than in September. The country risk indicator recorded 150 bps. at the close of October, a lower level than the one posted at the close of September (171 bps). On the other hand, the yield on the 20-year sovereign decreased for the fifth consecutive month, falling from 7.4 to 6.9 percent in October. Moreover, in October, the nominal average exchange rate decreased 0.3 percent with respect to September, and the real exchange rate declined 0.2 percent. The nominal exchange closed at 3.24 per dollar. During the month of October, banks' net forward sales of foreign currency decreased by US$ 526 million; net sales of foreign currency to banks on the spot market amounted to US$ 152 million; and banks exchange position decreased by US$ 25 million. In this scenario, the BCRP intervened in the exchange market purchasing US$ 696 million, of which US$ 120 million were sold to the Public Treasury. The Board of the BCRP approved the following interest rates for active and passive operations of both the BCRP and the financial system: For direct repo and rediscount operations, the rate continues to be 5.25 percent. For overnight deposits, the rate continues to be 3.75 percent. Likewise, the interest rates for the following operations in dollars between the Central Bank and the financial system are established as follows: Rediscount operations: 1-month LIBOR plus one percentage point. Overnight deposits: overnight LIBOR minus 3/8 of a percentage point. Swap: the commission continues to be at a level that implies a minimum annual effective cost of 5.25 percent. Reserve requirements in foreign deposits subject to payment: the rate continues to be 2.5 percent. In addition to this, the Board decided to initiate the required procedures to increase the maximum limit of investments abroad from 10.5 percent to 12.0 percent for Private Administrators of Pension Funds (Administradoras Privadas de Fondos de Pensiones). The Board will approve the following Monetary Program (for the month of December 2006) in its meeting of December 7, 2006."
Chile,2006-11-16,"Central Bank of Chile Santiago 16 November 2006 Press Release* In its monthly monetary policy meeting, the Board of the Central Bank of Chile decided to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 5.25% (annual). The external scenario relevant to the Chilean economy remains favorable. Oil prices remain below projections in the last Monetary Policy Report, world financial conditions are still positive and the copper price, despite recent reductions, is still high. Domestic output continues to grow at a low pace, below earlier projections, and beyond specific developments in manufacturing industry and mining. Nonetheless, salaried employment continues to rise, while unemployment falls and consumption grows steadily with relative strength. Domestic financial conditions remain favorable. This information, combined with the evolution of the external scenario and increases in investment intentions, is consistent with economic growth picking up during next year. Annual CPI inflation dropped significantly, largely influenced by the decline in fuel prices, and is now in the lower part of the target range, below earlier projections. This also reflects the decline in core CPIX1 inflation (which excludes fuels and perishables, plus some regulated services). Other indicators of trend inflation also show a decline, and cost pressures are well contained. These events permit to forecast that inflation will be, for some months, below the center of the target range. Long-term inflation expectations continue to be anchored around 3%. The Board reaffirms its commitment of conducting monetary policy to assure that projected inflation will be at 3% over the policy horizon. Future changes in the monetary policy rate intended to achieve this objective will depend on incoming information and its implications for projected inflation. * The Spanish original prevails."
Turkiye,2006-11-23,"The Monetary Policy Committee (Committee) has decided to keep short- term interest rates (policy rates) unchanged in the Inter-bank Money Market and the Istanbul Stock Exchange Repo-Reverse Repo Market as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: The overnight borrowing interest rate is 17.50 percent, and the overnight lending interest rate is 22.50 percent. b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Within the framework of the Late Liquidity Window Facility, the overnight borrowing interest rate valid between 4:00 p.m.  4:30 p.m. in the Inter-bank Money Market is 13.50 percent, while the lending interest rate is 25.50 percent. c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealer banks via repo transactions within the framework of open market transactions is 21.50 percent. The Committee considers that the recent data is consistent with the outlook presented in the Inflation Report. The slowdown in the aggregate demand continues as expected. While the private sector demand indicators point to a significant slowdown, the foreign demand remains relatively strong. Inflation expectations continue to improve. However, the factors such as the gap between the medium-term inflation expectations and the targets, the risks related to the services price inflation and the uncertainties in the global economy require the monetary policy to maintain its tight stance. Apart from these issues, the Committee notes, as stated in the “October Price Developments” report, that weather conditions may have a negative impact on November inflation through food prices. In light of these developments, the Committee assesses that meeting the medium-term inflation targets would necessitate the maintenance of the cautious policy stance. The committee closely monitors the lagged effects of the monetary tightening since June. Moreover, the potential impact of the recent developments in the incomes policy and the non-interest public sector expenditures on inflation and inflation expectations are carefully evaluated. The CBRT will not hesitate to tighten monetary policy in case of any new developments that would have unfavorable effects on the medium-term inflation outlook. It should be emphasized that any new data or information related to inflation outlook will lead the Committee to reconsider its stance.

Malaysia,2006-11-24,"At its meeting today. Bank Negara Malaysia 's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to leave the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) unchanged at 3.50 percent. The Malaysian economy continued on a steady growth path, with real gross domestic product increasing by 5.8% in the third quarter. The growth has been supported by continued expansion in domestic private demand as well as robust external demand for Malaysia 's exports. The growth momentum is expected to be sustained into the fourth quarter. Weaker international oil and commodity prices and global competition, combined with a moderate environment of wage and price increases in the domestic economy sustained the downward trend in inflation. In October, the inflation rate eased further to 3.1%. While some uncertainty still remains, the broad underlying trend towards lower inflationary pressures is expected to continue into 2007. The MPC also approved the schedule of MPC meetings for 2007. The current practice of releasing the Monetary Policy Statement at 6:00 p.m. on the same day as the MPC meeting would be maintained in 2007. Schedule of Monetary Policy Committee Meetings for 2007.

Israel,2006-11-27,"27.11.2006 The Bank of Israel lowers the interest rate for December 2006 by 25 basis points to 5 percent The Bank of Israel announces that the interest rate for December 2006 will be lowered by 25 basis points to 5 percent. This step is consistent withthe policy of maintaining price stability in the long run, in accordance with the inflation target of 1-3 percent a year. Background conditions The Consumer Price Index (CPI) fell in October by 0.7 percent, in excessof the fall expected by private forecasters of between 0.2 percent and 0.5 percent. This drop in the CPI stems mainly from the continued strengthening of the shekel and the fall in housing prices and in the world price of oil. The CPI has risen by 0.1 percent since the start of the year, and in thelast twelve months it has declined by 0.2 percent, below the lower limit of the target inflation range. Inflation expectations for the next twelve months derived from the capital market remained in the vicinity of the midpoint of the target inflation range from January 2005 to September 2006. In October and November, however, they were about 1.5 percent, below the midpoint of the range. This is in line with assessments derived from the yield curve of a reduction in the interest rate of 0.5 of a percentage point in the course of the next twelve months. On the other hand, the forecasters predict inflation for the next twelve months at close to the midpoint of the range, at 2.1 percent, and expect, on average, that the Bank of Israel interest rate will be cut and that it will settle at 5.0 percent in 2007. National Accounts data for the third quarter indicate a fall of 1.4 percent in GDP, in annual terms (seasonally adjusted). Most of the decline reflects a 20 percent drop in exports, whereas at the same time investment in the principal industries rose by some 22 percent. The extent of the impact on GDP in the third quarter was less than that expected by the Bank of Israel, and it now appears that the rate of growth in 2006 will be 4.8 percent,slightly higher than that forecast by the Bank immediately after the hostilities in the north. Foreign trade data for October show continued export and import growth, with a contraction in the trade deficit. At the same timethe composite state-of-the-economy index rose by 0.6 percent, and the figures of tourist entries indicate that tourism has stopped declining. All theabove paint a picture of rapid recovery from the impact on activity in thethird quarter caused by the war. Nonresidents' flow of investments in Israel continued unabated in October, following the trend set earlier in the year. The flow of foreigninvestment, together with the current account surplus in the balance of payments--which is expected to reach more than $ 6 billion this year--provide the background to the strengthening of theshekel to date. In the international financial markets. Israel's risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, fell slightly. The yield gap between fixed-rate, 10-year Shahar local-currency bonds and 10-year US government bonds contracted to about 1.3 percentage points. Data of the performance of the government budget in October show a marked recovery in tax revenues, and that since May expenditure is settling at ahigh level. The Bank of Israel assessments are that expenditure in 2006 will exceed the original budget by some NIS 3 billion, and the revenues will be about NIS 10 billion higher than the budget forecast. The deficit is therefore expected to reach 1.8 percent of GDP. The main considerations behind the decision Due to the strengthening of the shekel and falling energy prices, the annual rate of inflation is below the target range. The Bank of Israel has therefore decided to cut the interest rate by 25 basis points, to 5 percent, with the intention of gradually bringing the inflation rate to around the midpoint of the inflation target range, while preserving financial stability. This, bearing in mind the negative differential between the Fed interest rate and thatof the Bank of Israel. The Bank ofIsrael assesses that this cut in the interest rate is important, against the background of capital inflows into the market and the current account surplus in the balance of payments. These provide the backdrop to the strengthening of the shekel and the easing of pressure on prices so far, on the one hand, and the rapid reduction in the output gap, with its inherent upwardpressure on prices, on the other. This decision to reduce the interest rate is consistent with the Bank's monetary policy that is aimed at bringing inflation back to the midpoint of the target over the coming year, without causing financial shocks. The Bank of Israel will continue to monitor economic developments closely with the intention of achieving the price-stability target. Subject to this, the Bank will continue to support the attainment of a range of objectives of macroeconomic policy, in particular to encourage employment and growth. In addition, the Bank will continue to support financial stability. 27.11.2006 The Bank of Israel lowers the interest rate for December 2006 by 25 basis points to 5 percent.

Poland,2006-11-29,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 29 November 2006 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 28-29 November 2006 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged: (cid:131) reference rate 4.00% on an annual basis; (cid:131) lombard rate 5.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) deposit rate 2.50% on an annual basis; (cid:131) rediscount rate 4.25% on an annual basis. Since the Council's meeting held in October 2006 the forecasts of economic growth for the years 2006-2007 have been slightly raised in the euro area and somewhat lowered in the United States. The forecasts of inflation in the euro area for the years 2006-2007 have remained unchanged, while inflation forecasts in the United States for the same period have been slightly revised downwards. October marked a slight decline in the annual growth of consumer prices in the euro area to 1.6% as compared with 1.7% in September. The annual rate of growth in the United States also decreased (to 1.3% from 2.1% y/y in September). The decline of inflation in the euro area and the United States has been largely driven by a decrease in crude oil prices. Since the October meeting of the Council the current price of crude oil and the oil price forecast for the years 2007 and 2008 have not changed significantly (according to the analysts polled by the Reuters). The latest GUS data and information on GDP and investment growth signal that in 2006 Q3 the economic growth may be higher than 5.5%. In particular, according to GUS data the growth of corporate investment outlays in large and medium-size enterprises significantly accelerated (growth of 26.0% y/y in 2006 Q3 as compared with 15.6% y/y in the first half of 2006). GUS data for October 2006 on industrial output, construction and assembly production and retail sales indicate that high economic growth continues. The rise in industrial output in October 2006 exceeded the expectations of the NBP and external forecasters and reached 14.6% y/y (as compared with 11.7% y/y in September). In seasonally adjusted terms, the growth in industrial output in October amounted to 12.5 % y/y (as compared to 13.8% y/y in September). The growth in construction and assembly production accelerated for another consecutive month to 28.6% y/y, as compared to 21.1% y/y in September, and to 28.2% y/y as compared to 20.9% y/y in seasonally adjusted terms, thus exceeding the NBP's expectations. The still high growth rate of retail sales somewhat decreased (reaching 13.3% y/y in nominal terms as compared with 14.5% y/y in September). The growth rate of lending to non-financial sector has been rising steadily and in October 2006 it reached 19.8% y/y. Since the second half of 2005, a high growth rate of consumer loans to households has been sustained and in October 2006 it amounted to 20.0% y/y. Also housing loans has been growing fast; in October 2006 their rate of growth reached 52.3%. Since April 2006 an acceleration in the growth of corporate lending has been observed. In October 2006 the rate of growth of credit to enterprises amounted to 10.1% y/y. Such a growth rate of corporate lending, combined with substantial enterprises' own funds resulting from their very good financial results in ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51, the three first quarters of 2006, may point to a further rise in investment growth. Net earnings generated by non-financial enterprises in 2006 Q3 were by 31.4% higher than a year before. Strong economic growth is accompanied by a rapid increase in labour demand. Since December 2004 the employment growth in the corporate sector has been accelerating in October 2006 the growth of employment in enterprises amounted to 3.6% y/y hitting the highest level since the beginning of the 90s. According to BAEL (Labour Force Survey) preliminary data, in 2006 Q3 the rise in the number of people working in the economy amounted to 3.9% y/y (against 3.7% y/y in 2006 Q2). The number of people working outside private farming has been growing fast (growth by 6.9% as compared with 5.3% in 2006 Q2). In 2006 Q3 the unemployment rate according to BAEL fell to 13.0% as compared with 17.4% one year before. According to the labour office data, in October 2006 the registered unemployment rate slid to 14.9 % from 17.3% one year before. This rapid growth in the number of working persons and the significant decrease in unemployment was accompanied by a decline, in annual terms, in the economically active population, which has continued since 2006 Q1: in 2006 Q3 this figure fell by 1.2% in relation to 2005 Q3. Economic growth is also accompanied by a high growth of wages. In the enterprise sector,in October 2006 nominal wages rose by 4.7% y/y as compared with 5.1% y/y in September (according to the NBP's estimates, after adjustment for the impact of shifts in one-off components of wages in certain sections, in October wages in enterprises grew by 5.6% y/y). In 2006 Q3 the rise in nominal wages in the economy accelerated to 5.0% y/y from 4.7% y/y recorded in 2006 Q2. According to preliminary estimates, the rise of unit labour costs in the economy (excluding private farming) in 2006 Q3 accelerated to 6.2% y/y (as compared with 4.5% y/y in 2006 Q2 and 2.7% y/y in 2006 Q1). In industry, in January-October 2006, the growth of labour productivity amounted to 10.2% y/y and was still higher than the growth of wages, which resulted in a drop of unit labour costs in this sector by 4.7% y/y. Strong economic growth which would not pose a threat to the achievement of the inflation target can only be sustained on the condition that the growth in wages does not outpace the growth in labour productivity. This requires strong and productivity-oriented corporate governance in enterprises, which is usually more easily attained under private ownership. This also requires wage discipline in the public sector. In October 2006 the annual growth rate of consumer prices amounted to 1.2% as compared with 1.6% in September thus falling below the expectations of external forecasters and the NBP. The fall in the annual growth of consumer prices was primarily driven by a decline in fuel prices and lower than in the previous month growth of prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages. The majority of core inflation indicators fell slightly (in October they ranged between 0.8% y/y and 1.3% y/y, and net inflation reached 1.3%. November was another consecutive month which marked a rise in inflation expectations of households (1.7% y/y against 1.6 % y/y in October). According to GUS business tendency survey, the expected prices in retail sales, prices of industrial production as well as construction and assembly output have been gradually increasing since the beginning of 2006. In October 2006 the annual growth rate of producer prices in industry amounted to 3.4% y/y as compared with 3.6% y/y in September (i.e. -0.3% m/m as compared with 0.0% in September), while the growth rate of producer prices in manufacturing  similarly to September  stood at 1.7% y/y. In October the nominal effective exchange rate of the zloty appreciated by 1.6% as compared with the previous year. The latest data signal that in 2006 Q4 the annual CPI inflation may prove lower than expected in the October projection, while the “net” inflation will be in line with the projection. Despite the fact that in 2006 Q4 the CPI inflation will most probably be lower than expected, in the Council's -2 - assessment, the medium term inflation outlook has not significantly changed as compared to that from October. In the opinion of the Council, the currently observed strong economic growth creates favourable conditions for the implementation of reforms which would permanently contain the public finance imbalance. The Council maintains its belief that it would be the most favourable for Poland to adopt an economic strategy focused on creating conditions that would guarantee the introduction of the euro at the earliest possible date. The restraining of public finance imbalance would per se and by creating conditions for the introduction of the euro contribute to higher long-term economic growth. The next meeting of the Council will be held on 19-20 December 2006."
Euroarea,2006-12-07,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are very pleased to welcome you to today's press conference. Let me report on the outcome of our meeting, which was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup. Prime Minister Juncker, and Commissioner Almunia. At today's meeting, we decided to increase the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. This decision reflects the upside risks to price stability over the medium term that we have identified through both our economic and monetary analyses. Today's decision will contribute to ensuring that medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area. After today's increase, our monetary policy continues to be accommodative, with the key ECB interest rates remaining at low levels, money and credit growth strong, and liquidity in the euro area ample by all plausible measures. Therefore, looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term is warranted. The Governing Council will monitor very closely all developments so that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. Turning first to the economic analysis, according to Eurostat's first estimate, the quarter-on-quarter growth rate of real GDP in the euro area for the third quarter of 2006 was 0.5%. The data thus confirm our assessment that economic activity continued to expand robustly, while moderating from the very strong rates seen in the first half of the year. Domestic demand remained the main driver of economic growth in the third quarter, confirming the anticipated broadening of the recovery and pointing to the increasingly self-sustaining nature of economic expansion in the euro area. The information on economic activity from various confidence surveys and indicator-based estimates supports the assessment that robust economic growth has continued in the fourth quarter of this year. Looking ahead, the conditions remain in place for the euro area economy to grow at solid rates around potential. While some volatility in the quarterly growth rates is likely to emerge around the turn of the year, associated with the impact of changes in indirect taxes in a large euro area country, the medium-term outlook for economic activity remains favourable. As regards the external environment, economic growth has become more balanced across regions. Helped in part by lower oil prices, global growth is robust, thereby providing support for euro area exports. Domestic demand in the euro area is expected to maintain its relatively strong momentum. Investment should remain dynamic, benefiting from an extended period of very favourable financing conditions, balance sheet restructuring, accumulated and ongoing strong earnings, and gains in business efficiency. Consumption should also strengthen further over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, as employment conditions continue to improve. This outlook is also reflected in the new Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections. The projections foresee average annual real GDP growth in a range between 2.5% and 2.9% in 2006, between 1.7% and 2.7% in 2007 and between 1.8% and 2.8% in 2008. Most recent forecasts by international organisations give a broadly similar picture. In comparison with the September ECB staff projections, the ranges projected for real GDP growth in 2006 and 2007 have been revised upwards, largely reflecting the assumption of lower energy prices and their impact on real disposable income. In the Governing Council's view, the risks surrounding this broadly favourable outlook for economic growth over the projection horizon lie on the downside. The main risks relate to the possibility of a renewed increase in oil prices, fears of a rise in protectionist pressures, especially after the suspension of the Doha round of trade talks, and concerns about possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances. As regards price developments, according to Eurostat's flash estimate, annual HICP inflation rose to 1.8% in November 2006, from 1.6% in October and 1.7% in September. While no detailed breakdown of the November HICP data is available as of yet, the lower annual HICP inflation rates recorded in the two previous months reflected mainly the significant declines in crude oil prices from August onwards, as well as base effects. While the outlook for energy prices remains uncertain, on the basis of the oil prices currently implied by the futures market overall inflation rates are likely to increase again in early 2007 and then hover around 2% in the course of that year, also reflecting the impact of higher indirect taxes. The December Eurosystem staff projections see annual HICP inflation at between 2.1% and 2.3% in 2006, between 1.5% and 2.5% in 2007 and between 1.3% and 2.5% in 2008. Most recent forecasts by international organisations give a broadly similar picture. Compared with the September 2006 ECB staff projections, the ranges for 2006 and 2007 are somewhat lower, largely reflecting the assumption of lower energy prices. In this context, let me remind you of the conditional nature of these projections, which are based on a series of technical assumptions, including market expectations for short and long-term interest rates as well as for oil and non-energy commodity prices. In the Governing Council's view, the outlook for price developments remains subject to upside risks, stemming in particular from a pass-through of previous oil price increases which is stronger than assumed in the baseline scenario, the possibility of renewed oil price increases and additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those announced and decided thus far. More fundamentally, given the favourable momentum of real GDP growth observed over the past few quarters and the positive signs from labour markets, wage developments could be stronger than currently expected. Therefore, it is crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities. Wage agreements should take into account productivity developments in connection with the still high level of unemployment and positions in price competitiveness. It is also important that wage settlements move away from automatic, backward-looking indexation mechanisms. Turning to the monetary analysis, annual M3 growth was unchanged at 8.5% in October, remaining close to the highest rates observed since the introduction of the euro, which points to inflationary risks at medium to longer horizons. Increasing interest rates have exerted some influence over monetary developments in recent months, although as yet mainly by triggering shifts among the components of M3 rather than constraining the expansion of M3 itself. In particular, the annual growth rate of M1 has moderated somewhat, reflecting shifts from overnight deposits into other components of M3 which offer more market-related returns. More generally, the rate of monetary and credit expansion remains rapid, reflecting the low level of interest rates and the strengthening of economic activity in the euro area. In particular, loans to the private sector continue to grow at double-digit rates on an annual basis, their dynamism remaining broadly based across the household and corporate sectors. In the context of rising interest rates, the growth of household borrowing has shown signs of stabilisation in recent months, albeit at very high growth rates. By contrast, the growth of borrowing by non-financial corporations continues to trend upwards and has now reached rates of over 12% on an annual basis, the highest seen since the early 1990s. Thus, when the counterparts of M3 are considered, the main driver of strong monetary growth remains the expansion of credit to the private sector. Taking a medium to longer-term perspective, the latest developments are consistent with a continuation of the persistent upward trend in the underlying rate of monetary expansion, identified by the ECB's monetary analysis since mid-2004. Furthermore, following several years of robust monetary growth, the liquidity situation in the euro area is ample by all plausible measures. Continued strong monetary and credit growth in an environment of ample liquidity point to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. Monetary developments therefore continue to require very careful monitoring, particularly against the background of improved economic conditions and continued strong property market developments in many parts of the euro area. To sum up, annual inflation rates are projected to hover around 2% in the coming two years, with risks to this outlook remaining on the upside. In addition, given the ongoing marked dynamism of monetary and credit growth in an environment of ample liquidity, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium to long term. It is essential that inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. Indeed, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term is warranted. The Governing Council will therefore monitor very closely all developments so that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. As regards fiscal policy, the European Commission's autumn forecasts suggest that deficits will fall below 3% of GDP in most euro area countries by 2007. However, the projected improvements in fiscal balances can only partly be attributed to substantial progress in structural consolidation, as higher economic growth and revenue windfalls are playing an important role. Moreover, in a number of countries with fiscal imbalances, adjustment efforts still fall short of what is needed to meet their respective medium-term objectives in a timely manner and thus fulfil the requirements of the revised Stability and Growth Pact. It is therefore crucial that forthcoming updates of the stability programmes not only envisage significant progress towards the correction of excessive deficits in a sustainable manner but also make sufficient headway towards safe budgetary positions in the countries concerned. For all countries it is paramount that pro-cyclical policies be avoided in the current economic upswing. More progress is also needed with fiscal structural reform as part of a comprehensive medium-term strategy to improve economic incentives and the soundness of social security systems. This would be a crucial contribution of fiscal policies to economic growth and fiscal sustainability as well as to confidence in the revised Stability and Growth Pact. As regards structural reforms, the Governing Council welcomed the 2006 progress reports submitted by EU Member States on their 2005-08 national reform programmes, in line with the renewed Lisbon Strategy. Although it is encouraging that many concrete reform steps are being taken or are planned, there is still a considerable way to go to make the euro area a more dynamic economy, which is crucial to meeting the challenges of globalisation, population ageing and rapid technological change. Reform measures should foster more integrated, flexible and competitive economies in the euro area, thus allowing more efficient adjustment processes and a stronger resilience to shocks. These are essential conditions for the substantial benefits of the single currency to be better exploited and for the economic performance to improve in both the euro area as a whole and in each member state."
South Korea,2006-12-07,"The Bank of Korea Monetary Policy Decision The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (4.50%) for the intermeeting period. (The following is an unofficial English translation of the Monetary Policy Committee statement). In the real economy, exports continue to show steady growth, facilities investment maintains a growing pace and construction investment shows signs of some alleviation of its sluggishness. On the other hand, private consumption exhibits a slowdown in the pace of its expansion. Meanwhile, the current account surplus has widened, thanks to the goods account surplus and the narrowed services account deficit. Consumer price inflation and core inflation both remain stable. On the other hand, the upward pace of real estate prices has slowed down affected by the government's announcement of stabilization measures. In the financial markets, overall liquidity conditions are favorable and financial institutions' lending has shown a sharp increase. Taking the above economic and financial conditions into consideration, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of Korea decided today to maintain the benchmark call rate (uncollateralized overnight rate) at its current level (4.50%) for the intermeeting period."
South Africa,2006-12-07,"Introduction Inflation has continued its upward trend but is still within the inflation target range. Credit extension and domestic demand remain strong, and there only tentative signs that household consumer demand may be responding to the tighter monetary policy stance. The recent revisions of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data show that the economy has been growing at a faster rate than previously estimated. Reflecting the strong economy, the equity market has reached new highs. The outlook for the international economy remains somewhat mixed with good growth performances in Europe and Asia, and some weakness in the United States economy. The resulting weakening of the US dollar against some of the major currencies and the rebounding of investor confidence in emerging markets has influenced the rand and other currencies. Recent developments in inflation Year-on-year inflation as measured by the consumer price index for metropolitan and other urban areas excluding the interest cost on mortgage bonds (CPIX) declined to 5,0 per cent in October 2006 from 5,1 per cent in September. The outcome, however, was higher than expected following the R0,50 per litre reduction in the petrol price in October. Petrol and diesel prices increased at a year-on-year rate of 0,2 per cent in October, compared to 22,1 per cent in August. The lower petrol price inflation, combined with continued sizeable declines in the prices of clothing and footwear, contributed to the moderation in goods price inflation from 6,0 per cent in August to 5,1 per cent in October. However this favourable development was offset by the increase in services inflation from 3,5 per cent in August to 4,6 per cent in October. The food category remained the main inflation driver. Food price inflation increased from a year-on-year rate of 7,2 per cent in August 2006 to 7,9 per cent and 9,4 per cent in September and October respectively. Meat prices increased at a year-on-year rate of almost 20 per cent in October, whilst the prices of fish and other seafood increased by 11,0 per cent. The significance of the meat price developments is illustrated by the fact that if this sub-category were excluded. CPIX inflation would have measured approximately 3,8 per cent in October. Housing services were primarily responsible for the increase in services inflation in September and October. Administered prices excluding energy increased at a year-on-year rate of 5,5 per cent in October, up from 4,2 per cent in August. Production price inflation continued to increase markedly and across a broad spectrum of categories. Measured year-on-year, production price inflation had declined to 9,0 per cent in September 2006 from 9,2 per cent the previous month. However in October the year-on-year increase was 10,0 per cent. Imported goods inflation measured 10,4 per cent in October compared to 8,2 per cent in September. Domestically produced goods inflation increased to 9,9 per cent compared to 9,2 per cent in the previous month. The categories displaying the highest year-on-year increases included agricultural products, manufactured food and electricity, gas and water. The outlook for inflation The most recent central forecast of the Bank's forecasting model indicates a moderate improvement in the inflation outlook compared to the forecast considered at the October meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee. CPIX inflation is expected to breach the upper level of the inflation target range in the second quarter of 2007. Thereafter. CPIX inflation is expected to follow a downward path to just above 5 per cent at the end of the forecast period in 2008. The more favourable outlook is a result of the previous monetary adjustments, and a consolidation of oil prices at around US$60 per barrel. Inflation expectations have shown a slight deterioration in the fourth quarter of 2006. According to the latest survey conducted on behalf of the Bank by the University of Stellenbosch-based Bureau for Economic Research (BER), expectations increased marginally by 0,1 percentage points in respect of both 2006 and 2007. However, the forecast for 2008 shows a significant upward adjustment of 0,4 percentage points. The survey results indicate that CPIX inflation is now expected to average 5,4 per cent in both 2007 and 2008. In the previous survey the forecasts were 5,3 per cent and 5,0 per cent respectively. Although expectations for all forecast years are within the inflation target range, the upward trend in expectations observed over the past two quarters is a source of some concern to the MPC. The yield curve became more inverted in October and November 2006. Rather than necessarily reflecting expectations of a drastic slowing in the economy, technical factors are partly responsible for the inversion of the curve. The shorter end of the curve reflects expectations of higher interest rates, while the longer end of the curve is influenced by amongst others, demand and supply conditions in the bond market and positive expectations regarding future inflation outcomes. Notwithstanding the slight improvement in the forecast, the MPC still views the risks to the outlook to be on the upside, with continued pressures on inflation emanating from a number of sources. There is a mixed picture with respect to the responsiveness of household consumer demand to the cumulative 150 basis point increase in the repo rate since June. The growth in household consumption expenditure declined moderately from 7,8 per cent in the second quarter of 2006, to 7,2 per cent in the third quarter, with a marked decline in the growth of spending on durable and non-durable goods. Motor vehicle sales trends may indicate a possible impact of the increased interest rates on sales. In November, new motor vehicle sales increased at a modest year-on-year rate of 2,3 per cent, and declined by 3 per cent on a month-on-month basis. The FNB/BER Consumer Confidence Index however, rose marginally in the fourth quarter following a decline in the third quarter, indicating continued resilience in consumer demand. Despite tentative signs of moderation in consumer demand, private sector credit extension remains at high levels. Growth in total loans and advances extended to the private sector have maintained a growth rate of around 26 per cent since August 2006 despite some securitisation transactions. Mortgage advances remained the main source of credit growth. The higher rates of credit extension have contributed to the further increase in household indebtedness which in the third quarter of this year rose to 73 per cent of household disposable income, while the cost of servicing this debt has also increased marginally. Insolvencies have remained at low levels. Food price inflation continues to pose a threat to the inflation outlook and is likely to maintain its strong trend in the coming months. Wheat and maize price increases have fed through to food prices at the production price level and further pass-through to CPIX can be expected. Prices of grain products in CPIX have increased further, and in October, grain product inflation had risen to 5,5 per cent. The futures prices of maize suggest that some respite could be on the way during the first half of next year. The risk to the inflation outlook arising from oil price developments appears to have abated somewhat. For most of October and November. North Sea Brent crude oil traded at prices between US$55-US$60 per barrel in the international market. Towards the end of November, prices began to edge up amid fears of further OPEC quota cuts. The oil prices displayed a far lower degree of volatility than was the case during the earlier parts of this year. The current international oil price levels, and the more recently appreciated rand exchange rate, have led to a R1,14 per litre decline in domestic petrol prices during the past four months. Nevertheless the oil price is still considered to pose an upside risk to the inflation outlook, given the sensitivity of oil prices to geopolitical events and the continued tight supply and demand conditions in the oil market. During the period since the previous meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee, the exchange rate of the rand has displayed a degree of volatility. The related uncertainty therefore also poses a risk to the inflation outlook. The rand is currently trading at around R7,10 to the US dollar compared to R7,70 at the time of the October meeting of the MPC. Part of the recent appreciation of the rand against the US dollar can be attributed to the recent 6-per-cent decline in the value of the US dollar against the euro and pound sterling. Against the euro, the rand is currently trading at levels similar to those at the previous MPC meeting. On a trade-weighted basis, the rand has therefore appreciated by about 2,8 per cent since 12 October. Balance of payments developments indicate that the deficit on the trade account narrowed in the third quarter of this year, and has contributed to the decline in the ratio of the current account deficit to GDP from a revised 5,7 per cent in the second quarter of 2006 to 5,2 per cent in the third quarter. The current account deficit continues to be adequately financed by capital inflows which are largely attracted by the positive growth prospects of the South African economy. This year to date, non-resident purchases of South African bonds and equities have exceeded R100 billion, compared to R41 billion for 2005 as a whole. Official gross gold and other foreign exchange reserves stood at US$25 billion at the end of November 2006 and the international liquidity position amounted to US$22,2 billion. The South African economy has sustained its strong growth momentum and grew at revised annualised rates of 5,0 and 5,5 per cent in the first two quarters of this year respectively. Growth in the third quarter, however, moderated to 4,7 per cent. This decline is not viewed as being indicative of a widening of the output gap, and there are few signs of significant underutilisation of capacity in the economy. The forward-looking indicators also remain favourable. The Investec/BER Purchasing Managers Index declined in November, but nevertheless still indicates a strong performance in the manufacturing sector. Similarly, in the fourth quarter of this year, the RMB/BER Business Confidence Index remained at the high levels seen over the past two years, while the BER manufacturing survey showed a marked improvement in manufacturing business confidence in the fourth quarter of this year. On the positive side from an inflation outlook perspective, wage settlement levels appear to be moderate, although there is evidence of a slight upward trend. According to Andrew Levy Employment Publications, the average level of wage settlements in collective bargaining agreements increased marginally from 6,2 per cent in the nine months ending September 2005 to 6,4 per cent over the same period in 2006. Settlements ranged from 4,6 per cent in the retail sector to 8,9 per cent in the mining sector. These settlements remain in line with the inflation target if allowance is made for a moderate increase in labour productivity over time. Fiscal policy continues to be supportive of monetary policy. In the October Medium Term Budget Policy Statement, the government has continued to demonstrate its commitment to prudent fiscal management. International inflation developments are generally seen to be relatively favourable. Global inflation fears appear to have subsided somewhat in the wake of tighter monetary policies by a number of central banks. However in recent weeks there have been indications of a possible slowdown in the United States economy which have contributed to the uncertainties and volatility in the international financial markets. It is still too early to tell how these developments will play themselves out in the coming months. Monetary policy stance The Monetary Policy Committee has decided to adjust the existing monetary policy stance by increasing the repo rate by 50 basis points to 9,0 per cent per annum with effect from Friday, 8 December 2006. As always, the Monetary Policy Committee will continue to monitor all relevant developments in the economy and will not hesitate to act to ensure that the monetary policy stance remains consistent with achieving the inflation target.

United States,2006-12-12,"The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent. Economic growth has slowed over the course of the year, partly reflecting a substantial cooling of the housing market. Although recent indicators have been mixed, the economy seems likely to expand at a moderate pace on balance over coming quarters. Readings on core inflation have been elevated, and the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain inflation pressures. However, inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time, reflecting reduced impetus from energy prices, contained inflation expectations, and the cumulative effects of monetary policy actions and other factors restraining aggregate demand. Nonetheless, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain. The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information. Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S Bernanke. Chairman; Timothy F Geithner. Vice Chairman; Susan S Bies; Donald L Kohn; Randall S Kroszner; Frederic S Mishkin; Sandra Pianalto; William Poole; Kevin M Warsh; and Janet L Yellen. Voting against was Jeffrey M Lacker, who preferred an increase of 25 basis points in the federal funds rate target at this meeting."
Philippines,2006-12-13,"At its meeting today, the Monetary Board decided to keep the BSP's key policy interest rates steady at 7.5 percent for the overnight borrowing or reverse repurchase (RRP) rate and 9.75 percent for the overnight lending or repurchase (RP) rate. The tiering scheme on bank placements with the BSP was also maintained. In its assessment of the monetary policy stance, the Monetary Board agreed that the sum of new information since the previous policy meeting argues for keeping policy settings unchanged. Latest inflation readings remain in line with the forecast path, given easing oil prices and a firm peso. Equally important, inflation expectations also remain well-anchored. The Monetary Board also believes that the policy action in Novembershould be given time to work its way through the various channels of monetary policy, including the credit channel. Despite recent benign readings in inflation, the Monetary Board noted that there continue to be upside risks to future inflation. Domestic power costs could be adjusted upward in 2007, while food prices may come under pressure if the mild El Niño dry spell becomes prolonged. The outlook for international crude oil prices also remains vulnerable to geopolitical disruptions. At the same time,continued strong foreign inflows could imply added potential inflation pressures from surges in liquidity growth that, if sustained, could have adverse implications for inflation over the medium term. The Monetary Board remains vigilant against potential shifts in the public's inflation expectations, well aware that safeguarding price stability is critical to sustaining strong economic growth."
Thailand,2006-12-13,"No 49 /2006 Monetary Policy Committee's Decision on 13 December 2006 Ms. Suchada Kirakul. Assistant Governor of the Monetary Policy Group. Bank of Thailand, announces that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met today to assess the latest economic developments and trends in order to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance. The main issues discussed are as follows. During the first ten months of 2006, the Thai economy expanded at a satisfactory pace. In the third quarter. GDP grew by 47 per cent, led by a robust expansion in exports. Overall economic stability improved, as reflected in the continued deceleration of core inflation from 18 per cent in October to 17 per cent in November. Although headline inflation accelerated from 28 per cent in October to 35 per cent in November, this resulted mainly from the increase in vegetable prices due to flooding. The MPC judged that the Thai economy continued to expand, although going forward, the momentum of private investment would need to be monitored closely. Price pressures remained in the economy, even though they had moderated somewhat. Therefore the MPC deemed that the current level of the policy rate is appropriate for the current economic situation and decided to maintain the 14-day repurchase rate at 500 per cent per annum. In addition, to further enhance the efficiency and transparency of the Bank of Thailand's monetary policy implementation as well as to facilitate continued development of the Thai financial markets, the MPC decided to change the policy rate to the 1-day repurchase rate, instead of the 14-day repurchase rate, effective from the next MPC meeting onwards.

Egypt,2006-12-14,"Central Bank of Egypt Press Release December 14, 2006 The Central Bank of Egypt decided to raise its overnight deposit rate by 25 bps to 875 percent per annu. In its meeting held on December 14, 2006, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to raise its overnight deposit and overnight lending rates to 875 percent and 1075 percent from 85 percent and 105 percent, respectivel. The decision was based on the observations of emerging inflationary trends, driven by the demand pressures arising from accelerating economic growth mostly in the construction and manufacturing sector. In addition, supply factors, chiefly the outbreak of Avian flu as well as administered price adjustments, most importantly the July fuel price hike, have had varying degrees of initial cost-push effects on inflation and the second round effects are becoming eviden. The annual inflation rates are expected to remain high until the base effect from the previous price increases related to the supply shocks and administered price adjustments level of. The MPC will continue to monitor all economic development. Future decisions will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming data release.

Peru,2006-12-15,"BANCO CENTRAL DE RESERVA DEL PERU PRESS RELEASE MONETARY PROGRAM FOR DECEMBER 2006 BCRP MAINTAINS THE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE AT 4.50% The Board of Directors of the BCRP decided to maintain the reference interest rate for the interbank market at4.50 percent, taking into account that: The inflation rate continues to be within the lower range of the announced target range (1.5  2.5 percent), in line with the inflation forecasts outlined in our Inflation Report of September. As described in this Report, due to the reversal of the price increases observed in some food products, inflation is expected to be temporarily below the lower range of the inflation target during the next months, returning thereafter to a level within the inflation target range (1.5 percent 3.5 percent). The risks forecast in our previous Inflation Report persist. Particularly, an increased growth of domestic demand not coupled by an increase in productivity- would generate upward pressures on inflation and would, consequently, require that preventive adjustments be made in terms of the monetary stance. In this context, the Central Bank will continue to evaluate any relevant macroeconomic information and take any necessary action in order to ensure that inflation remains within the target range in the medium term. This decision has been made taking into account the following information: The Consumer Price lndex for Metropolitan Lima (CPI) decreased 0.28 percent in November. As a result of this, the CPI inflation rate accumulated in the last twelve months was 1.54 percent, close to the lower range of the inflation target (1.5 percent). One of the factors explaining this evolution was the prices of food products, especially the lower prices of onion, poultry, potato and sugar. On the other hand, core inflation was 0.13 percent, and accumulated a last-12-month rate of 1.45 percent. Economic activity is estimated to have grown by 6.9 percent in October, accumulating a rate of 7.4 percent in the January-October 2006 period, boosted by the dynamic performace of domestic demand which is estimated to have grown 9.6 percent in the same period. All domestic demand components show high rates of growth, particularly private consumption and investment which are estimated to have grown 5.8 percent and 19.7 percent respectively as a result of a favorable context marked by high consumers' and business confidence. BANCO CENTRAL DE RESERVA DEL PERU The average monthly interest rate in the interbank market was 4.48 percent in November, while the average 90-day corporate prime rate for credit in soles was 5.25 percent, a level 6 bps. lower than in October.

Furthermore, the yield of the 20-year sovereign bonds in domestic currency decreased for the sixth consecutive month, falling from 6.90 percentin October to 6.88 percentin November. The nuevo sol appreciated 0.5 percentin nominal terms against the dollar in November when the exchange rate was 3.22 per dollar.

Poland,2006-12-20,"Monetary Policy Council Warsaw, 20 December 2006 INFORMATION FROM THE MEETING OF THE MONETARY POLICY COUNCIL held on 19-20 December 2006 The Council decided to keep the NBP interest rates unchanged, i.e.: reference rate 4.00% on an annual basis; lombard rate 5.50% on an annual basis; deposit rate 2.50% on an annual basis; rediscount rate 4.25% on an annual basis. Since the Council's meeting in November 2006 there have been no changes in the forecasts of economic growth and inflation in the euro area for 2006-2007. In the United States both the forecasts of economic growth in 2007 and inflation in 2006-2007 have been slightly lowered. In November, the annual inflation increased both in the euro area (from 1.6% in October to 1.9% ) and in the United States (from 1.3% y/y to 2.0% y/y). Since the November meeting of the Council the current price of crude oil has increased by USD 4.6 (i.e. 7.9%), while the oil price forecast for 2007-2008 has not changed (according to the analysts polled by Reuters). GUS data on the GDP in Q3 have confirmed that the Polish economy is in a strong and consolidating recovery, which encompasses all sectors of the economy. The real GDP growth in 2006 Q3 reached 5.8% y/y and was higher than the projection and external expectations. Higher than the projection proved the growth of private consumption at 5.5% y/y (compared to 4.9% y/y in 2006 Q2), which was the highest growth since 1999 Q4. Similarly, higher than the projection was the growth in gross fixed capital formation, which accelerated to 19.8% y/y (down from 14.8% y/y in 2006 Q2) and was the highest since 1997 Q4. The rise in public consumption (of 1.1% y/y) was consistent with the projection, while the contribution of net exports to GDP growth (at -0.3 percentage points) proved less negative than in the projection. GUS data on industrial and construction and assembly output in October and November 2006 indicate the continuation of strong business activity. The November growth in industrial output was consistent with expectations of the NBP staff and lower than expected by external forecasters. It amounted to 11.7% y/y (compared to 14.8% y/y in October). In seasonally adjusted terms, the growth in industrial output was 10.2% y/y (compared to 12.5% y/y recorded in October). In line with expectations of the NBP staff, the surge in construction and assembly output was sustained (at 23.4% y/y against 28.6% y/y in October, which in seasonally adjusted terms corresponds to 25.0% y/y compared to 28.2% y/y). According to the preliminary data on money creation factors available as of 20 December, the lending to the private sector in November 2006 grew by 22.7% y/y. Since the middle of 2005 lending to households has been growing strongly and in November it accelerated to 31.4% y/y (compared to 30.1% in October and 13.3% in December 2004, when it was the lowest in the last two years). Starting from 2006 Q2 acceleration in loans to enterprises has been observed; in ul. Świętokrzyska 11/21, 00-919 Warszawa. Poland, phone (48 22) 826 99 55, fax (48 22) 826 37 51. November their growth reached 13.1% y/y and in April 2006, when it was the lowest in the current year, it stood at 3.3% y/y. The current growth in corporate lending, combined with substantial own funds of enterprises resulting from their very good financial results in the first three quarters of 2006, may indicate that the high investment growth will be sustained. The strong economic growth is accompanied by a dynamically growing demand for labour. Since December 2004 the employment growth in the corporate sector has been constantly accelerating  in November 2006 the growth of corporate employment amounted to 3.8% y/y, compared to 3.6% y/y in October, which was the highest since the beginning of the 1990s. Economic growth is also accompanied by a high growth of wages. In November 2006, the growth in nominal wages in enterprises amounted to 3.1% y/y compared to 4.7% y/y in October. However, according to NBP estimates the wage growth in enterprises adjusted for the impact of one-off shifts in wage components in several sections was 5.7% y/y in November against 5.6% y/y in October. The latest data on GDP in Q3, combined with data on the nominal wage growth in the economy (5.0% y/y in Q3) and the growth of the number of working persons outside private farming (6.9% y/y in Q3), confirm preliminary assessments formulated in November that the growth of unit labour costs (outside private farming) stepped up significantly in Q3 (to 6.1% y/y against 4.5% y/y in Q2 and 2.7% in 2006 Q1). This growth was slightly higher than estimated in the October projection. Strong economic growth which would not pose a threat to the achievement of the inflation target can only be sustained on the condition that the growth in wages does not outpace the growth in labour productivity. This requires strong and productivity-oriented corporate governance in enterprises, which is usually more easily achieved under private ownership. This also requires wage discipline in the public sector. In November the annual growth of consumer prices rose to 1.4% from 1.2% in October. The rise in the annual inflation primarily reflected an increase in the annual growth of prices in telecommunications and recreation and culture. In November the annual growth of producer prices in industry was 2.6% against 3.2% in October (i.e. 0.5% m/m both in October and November), with 1.3% in manufacturing. In November the nominal effective exchange rate of the zloty appreciated 5.6% in year-on-year terms. The latest data suggest that annual CPI inflation in 2006 Q4 will be lower than indicated in the October projection. ‘Net' core inflation will run close to the path expected in the projection. Some factors may arise in 2007 which can be temporarily pulling (CPI) inflation down in some periods. The analysis of inflation outlook indicates that maintaining inflation close to the target of 2.5% in the medium term may require monetary policy tightening. In the opinion of the Council, the currently observed strong economic growth creates convenient conditions for the implementation of reforms which would permanently reduce the public finance imbalance. The Council maintains its belief that it would be the most favourable for Poland to adopt an economic strategy focused on creating conditions that would guarantee the introduction of the euro at the earliest possible date. The constraining of public finance imbalance would be conducive, both per se and by creating conditions for the introduction of the euro, to accelerating the long-term economic growth. The Council has adopted a resolution approving The Financial Plan of the National Bank of Poland for 2007 and The Resolution on the principles of setting and releasing provisions for the exchange rate risk of the zloty against foreign currencies at the National Bank of Poland. In line with the time schedule, the next meeting of the Council will be held on 23 January 2007 and will be devoted to discussing the draft Inflation Report. The Report will finally be adopted at the Council's meeting on 30-31 January 2007."
Turkiye,2006-12-21,"The Monetary Policy Committee (Committee) has decided to keep short-term interest rates (policy rates) unchanged in the Inter-bank Money Market and the Istanbul Stock Exchange Repo-Reverse Repo Market as follows: a) Overnight Interest Rates: The overnight borrowing interest rate is 17.50 percent, and the overnight lending interest rate is 22.50 percent, b) Late Liquidity Window Interest Rates: Within the framework of the Late Liquidity Window Facility, the overnight borrowing interest rate valid between 4:00 p.m.  4:30 p.m. in the Inter-bank Money Market is 13.50 percent, while the lending interest rate is 25.50 percent, c) The interest rate on overnight and one-week maturity borrowing facilities provided for primary dealer banks via repo transactions within the framework of open market transactions is 21.50 percent. The Committee considers that the recent data is broadly consistent with the outlook presented in the October Inflation Report. The slowdown in total demand continues as expected. While the private sector demand indicators point to a significant slowdown, the foreign demand remains relatively strong. Nevertheless, the tight monetary policy should continue due to factors such as the gap between the medium-term inflation expectations and the targets, the risks related to the services price inflation and the uncertainties in the global economy. Moreover, the Committee judges that inflation risks regarding the unprocessed food prices remain. In light of these developments, the Committee assesses that meeting the medium term inflation targets would necessitate the maintenance of the cautious policy stance. The Committee closely monitors the lagged effects of the monetary tightening since June. Moreover, the potential impact of the progress in the structural reform agenda and the developments in the incomes policy as well as the non-interest public sector expenditures on the inflation and the inflation expectations are carefully evaluated. The CBRT will not hesitate to tighten monetary policy in case of any new developments that would have unfavorable effects on the medium-term inflation outlook.

Israel,2006-12-25,"25.12.2006 The Bank of Israel lowers the interest rate for January 2007 by 50 basis points to 4.5 percent The Bank ofIsrael announces that the interest rate for January 2007 will be lowered by 50 basis points to 4.5 percent. This step is consistent with the policy of maintaining price stability in the long run, in accordance with the inflation target of 1-3 percent a year. Background conditions The Consumer Price Index (CPI) fell in November by 0.2 percent, in line with general expectations. This fall in the CPI stems mainly from the continued strengthening of the shekel against the dollar and the fall in prices of housing, transportation and communications. Since the beginning of the year the CPI has declined by 0.1 percent and has fallen in the past 12 months by 0.3 percent, below the lower limit of the target inflation range. Against the background that changes in the exchange rate have a rapid and strong effect on inflation, the strengthening of the shekel against the dollar has been a major factor in the reduction of inflation, both in recent months, and over thepast 12 months. The strengthening of the shekel reflects the weakening of the dollar worldwide as well as several positive developments in the economy, principally the increase in the current account surplus in the balance of payments and the inflow of foreign investment into the economy. Followingthe cumulative fall in the CPI in the past three months--by about 2 percentage points--inflation (over the past measured 12 months) is expected to be lower than the target throughout the firsthalf of 2007. Inflation expectations for the next twelve months derived from the capital market werein the vicinity of the midpoint of the target inflation range from the beginning of the year until September 2006. Since October, however, they were below the midpoint of the range and in December they reached about 1.3 percent. Expectations derived from the yield curve indicate a reduction in the interest rate of 0.3 of a percentage point in the course of the next twelvemonths. In addition, the forecasters predict inflation for the next 12 months below the midpoint of the range, at 1.5 percent, and expect, on average, that the Bank of Israel interest rate will reach 4.75 percent at the end of 2007. The econometric models of the Bank of Israel suggest that conditioned on a reduction in the interest rate, the inflation rate for 2007 is likely to be within the inflation target range by the fourth quarter of 2007.</td> Annual economic growth rate for 2006 is expected to reach 4.8 percent, despite the hostilities in the north during the summer. The current rapid rate of growth is similar to that in the first half of the year. Though the composite state-of-the-economy index in November rose by 0.1 percent, it is still too early to deduce from this any change in the rate of development of economic activity. Unemployment fell in the third quarter of 2006, while unit labor costs rose only slightly in the same period as labor productivity continued torise rapidly. The current account surplus in the balance of payments increased in the third quarter by $ 2.4 billion, totaling $ 6 billion since the beginning of the year, which is some 4.7 percent of GDP. Foreign trade datafor November show continued export growth, and a slowing of the rate of growth in goods imports. Nonresidents' flow of investments in Israel continued unabated in November, following the trend set earlier in the year. In the international financial markets. Israel's risk premium, as measured by the five-year CDS spread, fell further, as it did for other countries. The yield gap between fixed-rate, 10-year Shahar local-currency bonds and 10-year US government bonds also continued to contract. At the same time, the Fitch rating agency raised Israel's outlook from Stable to Positive. Data on theperformance of the government budget show a continued recovery in tax revenues, while expenditure increades have slowed, such that the annual budget deficit is expected to reach about 1 percent of GDP. Assuming the Knesset will approve the 2007 budget in line with the framework approved by the government, the budget deficit for the coming year is expected to be consistentwith the ceiling set in the budget, of 2.9 percent. The mainconsiderations behind the decision The decision to cut the interest rate by 50 basis points is, intended to raise the probabilities that inflation will return to within the target range during 2007. As the CPI has fallen cumulatively in recent months, the Bank of Israel does not expect inflation as measured by the increase in the CPI over the past 12 months--to return to within the target range until the second half of 2007. This decision is consistent with the Bank of Israel's policy to gradually bringing theinflation rate back to the target range, while preserving financial stability. The Bankof Israel will continue to monitor economic developments closely with the intention of achieving the price-stability target. Subject to this, the Bank will continue to support the attainment of a range of objectives of macroeconomic policy, in particular to encourage employment and growth. In addition, the Bank will continue to support financial stability. 25.12.2006 The Bank of Israel lowers the interest rate for January 2007 by 50 basis points to 4.5 percent.

Romania,2006-12-28,"In its meeting of 28 December 2006, the Board of the National Bank of Romania has decided to:. According to the latest statistical data, developments in macroeconomic indicators show the continuation of the disinflation process, with the inflation rate running at 4.67 percent in November 2006 versus the same year-ago period, and a significant acceleration of economic growth against the background of larger investment and persistently fast consumption dynamics, both supported by the rapid expansion of credit. The substantial reduction in the rate of inflation to less than 5 percent at end-2006 from 8.6 percent at end-2005 is attributable to the restrictive stance of monetary and fiscal policies, as well as to the slowdown in the growth of administered prices and volatile food prices. The consolidation of an average rate of inflation below 5 percent per annum - a key component for the continuation of the integration process - requires, however, sustained economic and financial efforts, backed by a mix of adequate macroeconomic policies, over a longer period of time. The short-term outlook indicates a continuation of the disinflation process given the estimates of moderate pressures from administered price adjustments and the expectations of a low impact on some food prices, as a result of Romania's joining the Common Agricultural Policy and the enforcement of the EU Common Customs Tariff starting with 1 January 2007, but the persistence of excess demand against the background of high growth rates of investment and consumption, also supported by budgetary and income policies, calls for the maintenance of restrictive monetary conditions in order to ensure sustainable disinflation over the medium term. In light of available data, the NBR Board has decided to maintain the monetary policy rate at 8.75 percent per annum and to pursue control over liquidity in order to ensure monetary conditions consistent with the achievement of the medium-term disinflation objectives. The NBR Board is reiterating that it will continue to monitor economic, monetary and fiscal trends, standing ready to adjust its instrument settings in order to ensure the achievement of medium-term disinflation objectives in line with the announced inflation targets, i.e. 4.0 percent +/-1 percentage point for 2007 and 3.8 percent +/-1 percentage point for 2008. According to the announced calendar, the next NBR Board meeting dedicated to monetary policy is scheduled for 9 February 2007, when a new quarterly Inflation Report is to be examined."
